[1] "N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."

          [5] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi- cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain- ing materials [13,2123]."
          [2] "A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24]."
          [3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows.

          [6] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
          [7] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration re- mained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites were present."
          [8] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida- tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."
          [9] "In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation."
          [10] "However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
          [11] "Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to ob- tain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O."
          [12] "The same VOx/ MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane [13,14]."

          [14] "In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher,amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."
          [15] "Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."

[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"
          [3] "A major draw- back of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, al- though the original catalytic activity was completely recov- ered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003)."
          [4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
          [5] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."
          [6] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

          [4] "The level of detail and accuracy for in situ investigation of coke formation as obtained by TEOM cannot be accomplished using typical approaches to study deactivation, in which coke is characterized after exposing the catalyst to reaction condi- tions and taking samples at defined times for ex situ analyses [1416]."
          [5] "However, TEOM does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level, be- cause the nature of coke as well as its interaction with chemical groups in the zeolite cannot be probed."
          [6] "To gain a better under- standing of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air,complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed."
          [7] "In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion [1720], by monitoring in real time the formation of carbona- ceous deposits and eventual changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous ma- terial."

          [4] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
          [5] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."
          [6] "Besides, iron zeolites strongly deactivate during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation and it is unclear from these publications whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time."

          [9] "The time and degree of deactivation in Fig. 2 depend on the catalyst in question."
          [10] "The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample."
          [11] "The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored."
          [12] "The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2)."
          [13] "The propylene yield is significantly higher in st-H-Z than in c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples is rather similar (especially after 40 min on stream)."
          [14] "This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed performance."
          [15] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5."
          [16] "This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
          [17] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
          [18] "This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by Bula nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of 3001200 ppm."
          [19] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."
          [20] "Our results show that deactivation is slower over the steam- activated zeolites (Fig. 2), with a significantly reduced number of Brnsted sites as a consequence of the steam treatment [21]."
          [21] "A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie- Fe-Z."
          [22] "It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction."
          [23] "Further research is required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP."

[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas."
          [2] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."
          [3] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."
          [4] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."
          [5] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
          [2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
          [3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
          [4] "We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."
          [6] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
          [7] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."
          [8] "One alternative explanation could be the fact that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, so leading to a lower conversion, while selectivity increases."
          [9] "The results obtained when the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4 were similar, but less significant (when 1 vol.% N2O is added,conversion decreases from 7.5 to 4.3% and selectivity increases from 34.8 to 41.9%)."
          [10] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 cat- alyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2)."
          [11] "In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%,respectively."
          [12] "However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%)."
          [13] "This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O."
          [14] "Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst."
          [15] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon."
          [16] "This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable."
          [17] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."
          [18] "N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explain- ing the high carbon formation."
          [19] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
          [2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
          [3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
          [4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
          [5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
          [6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."
          [7] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
          [8] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation.
          The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane.
          A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature.
          The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4).
          Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O.
          The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx.
          Such intermediates appear to be essential for propene production. Accordingly, the performance of FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated ODH of propane is severely deteriorated in the presence of small amounts of O2.
          Because the initial ODHP performance was recovered upon air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles has been evaluated.
          The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may also explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K.
          The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2.
          The efficient utilization of N2O in tail-gases should involve a previous purification step. As shown here, the presence of O2 (a typical component of tail-gases) has a negative impact on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5.



[1] "Recently, it has been pro- posed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted con- siderable attention [213]."
          [2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."
          [3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
          [4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination."
          [5] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."
          [6] "In the case of the ODHP with N2O, the presence of the propane reductant in the reaction system makes the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites much more complicated."
          [7] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mecha- nism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O."
          [8] "Accordingly, there is no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
          [3] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
          [4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective ox- idation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

For all V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion.
          The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as com- pared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction.
          There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant.
          In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2.
          The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx.
          The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2.
          From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
          [4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."
          [5] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."
          [6] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [7] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
          [8] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
          [9] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
          [10] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
          [11] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
          [12] "Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
          [13] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O. Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5. The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2. The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [6] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."
          [7] "The XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to ca. 5 wt % do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase."
          [8] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
          [9] "The primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [10] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [11] "The higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [12] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [13] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."
          [14] "The BET values of unloaded MCM-41, MCM-48, and SiO2 support materials amounted to 1040, 1049, and 300 m2/g, respectively."
          [15] "Vanadium-loaded MCM-41 and SiO2 materials showed a decrease in the specific surface area by a factor of ca. 20% for vanadium loadings up to 5.3 wt %."
          [16] "The VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 catalyst lost ca. 50% of the original surface area of MCM-48."
          [17] "The SBET value (52 m2/g) of VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 is significantly lower than those of the other catalysts."
          [18] "As reported in ref 20, the pore structure of MCM-41 is completely destroyed in this sample."
          [19] "Small V2O5 crystallites were observed in this sample by means of ex-situ XRD analysis."
          [20] "The XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to ca. 5 wt % do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase."
          [21] "Additional UV/vis and Raman spectroscopic characterization studies (the data are not shown for brevity) did not indicate a possible presence of XRD-amorphous crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles for samples possessing up to 5.3 wt % vanadium."
          [22] "The calculated vanadium surface densities are 0.37, 0.6, 1.38, and 25.4 for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, VOx(2.9)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, respectively."
          [23] "On the basis of the obtained densities and the literature9 values for a vanadium monolayer (57 V/nm2), it can be safely concluded that all catalytic materials, except for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, possess VOx species below one vanadium monolayer."
          [24] "A single maximum of H2 consumption at ca. 801 and 806 K was observed upon reduction of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 and VOx (2.8)/SiO2, respectively."
          [25] "Additionally to the maximal H2 consumption at 810 K, a small shoulder at ca. 860 K was identified in the TPR profile of the VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 sample."
          [26] "This shoulder becomes more pronounced for the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where crystalline V2O5 phase was identified by XRD analysis."
          [27] "According to the literature data,37,42,43 the peak at 864 K could be due to the presence of highly polymerized VOx species or crystalline V2O5."
          [28] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material at apparent surface vanadium densities below one monolayer."
          [29] "The relative degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the order"
          [30] "The VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possesses microcrystalline V2O5 phase."
          [31] "The next section establishes correlations between the nature of VOx species and their performance in the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O."
          [32] "Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."
          [33] "Since the amount of N2O was double that of O2, both of the above reaction feeds contained the same amount of oxygen atoms."
          [34] "This allows the comparison of the influence of oxidizing agents on the ODP reaction."
          [35] "The TOF (turnover frequency) values of propane conversion in the presence of O2 and N2O over VOx species below (VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48) and above (VOx(11.2)/MCM-41) one monolayer are compared in Table 1."
          [36] "The TOF values were calculated taking the total amount of vanadium atoms into account."
          [37] "This table illustrates that the catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples."
          [38] "This may be due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species over the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst as shown in section 3.1."
          [39] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
          [40] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."
          [41] "For establishing overall mechanistic scheme of the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O over VOx species of different degrees of polymerization, catalytic performance (product selectivity) was determined at different contact times, that is, different degrees of propane conversion."
          [42] "This knowledge is of high importance for catalyst designing, because it provides essential information on the sequence of product formation, that is, the catalyst ability for C3H8 conversion to C3H6 and COx as well as for consecutive C3H6 combustion."
          [43] "The obtained selectivityconversion relationships with O2 are summarized in Figure 1."
          [44] "Propene selectivity decreases, while CO and CO2 selectivities (the data are not shown) increase with an increase in the degree of propane conversion."
          [45] "Such behavior is explained by consecutive oxidation of the primarily formed propene to carbon oxides."
          [46] "For the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, the low propene selectivity at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion is an indication for catalytic activity toward direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to carbon oxides."
          [47] "This reaction pathway does not play any significant role over other catalytic materials with vanadium loading below one monolayer."
          [48] "Over the latter catalysts, CO and CO2 originate mainly via consecutive C3H6 oxidation."
          [49] "Figure 1b illustrates selectivityconversion relationships in the ODP reaction over differently structured VOx species using N2O."
          [50] "As in the presence of O2 (Figure 1a), propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion with N2O, too."
          [51] "However, from the comparison of the results in Figure 1a and b, it is obvious that propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion."
          [52] "This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [53] "From a more detailed analysis of the data in Figure 1, the primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion) and the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx can be derived."
          [54] "These two parameters represent the catalyst activity for direct propane conversion to COx and for consecutive combustion of primarily formed propene, respectively."
          [55] "In the present paper, the dependence of S(C3H6) on X(C3H8) at low propane conversion (<10%) is described by a linear function in eq 1."
          [56] "where S(C3H6)initial and A are the primary propene selectivity and the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, respectively."
          [57] "According to this function, the primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx."
          [58] "This parameter is related to the catalyst activity for propene conversion to carbon oxides."
          [59] "The higher the slope of the function in eq 1, the faster the COx production from C3H6."
          [60] "Establishing the relationships between the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation and the structure of VOx species or the applied oxidizing agent is highly relevant for designing selective catalysts, since propene selectivity in the ODP reaction suffers mainly from the higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."
          [61] "Figure 2 compares the primary S(C3H6) and the catalyst ability (A) for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx over differently structured VOx species in the presence of O2 and N2O."
          [62] "For an O2-containing reaction feed (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40), it is clear that the primary propene selectivity is close for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, and VOx(2.8)/SiO2 materials but is significantly low over VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 (Figure 2 a)."
          [63] "From the characterization results in section 3.1, the latter material possesses microcrystalline V2O5 while other materials are free of microcrystalline V2O5 and possess highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx species."
          [64] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too."
          [65] "The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found:"
          [66] "The degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the same order (section 3.1)."
          [67] "Thus, the higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [68] "This conclusion is in agreement with literature data9 and with our recent results of the ODP reaction on VOx/γ-Al2O3.36"
          [69] "Further insights into the influence of oxidizing agent on product selectivity in the ODP reaction are derived from the analysis of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 ratios at different degrees of propane conversion."
          [70] "Table 1 represents these ratios at propane conversions of ca. 2 and 10%."
          [71] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."
          [72] "However, the ratio of CO2/C3H6 over polymerized VOx species increases from 0.04 to 0.13, while the ratio of CO/C3H6 decreases from 1.7 to 0.27, when N2O is used instead of O2."
          [73] "For both oxidizing agents, the ratios of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 increase with propane conversion, with the former increasing stronger."
          [74] "This increase is less pronounced for a feed with N2O."
          [75] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [76] "This effect is more pronounced for polymerized VOx species."
          [77] "Summarizing, two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [78] "To elucidate possible reasons of the influence of oxidizing agent on the ODP performance of highly dispersed VOx species and microcrystalline V2O5, in-situ UV/vis measurements were performed at 773 K."
          [79] "The degrees of propane and oxidant (O2 and N2O) conversion were controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS)."
          [80] "To ensure a near-to-uniform composition of the studied catalysts along the catalyst bed, propane and oxidant (O2 or N2O) conversions were kept below 5 and 10%, respectively."
          [81] "Figure 3 exemplifies in-situ UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 in oxidizing (O2/Ne = 20/80) and reducing (H2/N2 = 5/95 or C3H8/Ne = 40/60) atmospheres as well as in ODP feeds (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20)."
          [82] "The UV/vis spectrum in a flow of O2 with the absorption at 295 nm is characteristic for tetrahedrally coordinated V5+Ox species."
          [83] "The adsorption in the 400700 nm region (dd transitions of reduced vanadium species) increases upon switching from an O2 flow to a H2 flow (Figure 3a); the UV/vis bands of V4+ and V3+ species appear as broad features in the 400800 nm region (note the nonzero value of the absorption for the reduced samples in this region)."
          [84] "46,47 Similar changes were also observed when the oxidized catalyst was admitted to a C3H8 flow."
          [85] "Since no significant differences in the UV/vis spectra in H2 and C3H8 flows were observed (Figure 3a), the effect of possible carbon-containing deposits in the case of C3H8 flow on the interpretation of UV/vis data can therefore be neglected."
          [86] "Thus, the observed changes in the UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 upon switching from oxidizing to reducing flows reflect the changes in reduction degree of VOx species under different reaction conditions."
          [87] "Taking the above discussion into account, the UV/vis spectra in O2 (20% O2 in Ne) and C3H8 (40% C3H8 in Ne) flows represent oxidized and reduced states of VOx species, respectively."
          [88] "In the following, we compare UV/vis spectra under different ODP conditions (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) with the spectra of oxidized and reduced VOx species to derive insights into the reduction degree of VOx species under reaction conditions."
          [89] "One can see from Figure 3 that the UV/vis spectra during the ODP reaction with O2 (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40) and in an O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) flow are very similar."
          [90] "This means that the oxidation state of VOx species in both cases is close to 5+."
          [91] "However, there is a strong difference between the UV/vis spectra in O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows, while the UV/vis spectra in H2 (H2/N2 = 5/95) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows are very similar."
          [92] "This evidence that the oxidation state of VOx species under conditions of the ODP reaction with N2O (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%) is similar to the reduced one."
          [93] "This means that the oxidation state of vanadium in VOx species decreases from 5+ to 3+ and/or 4+ when the ODP reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2."
          [94] "Another interesting observation from Figure 3 is the appearance of a new band at 400450 nm in the UV/vis spectrum of VOx(2.8)/SiO2 in a C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [95] "A similar band was also identified over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 after 1030 min on stream in C3H8."
          [96] "To prove whether this band may belong to carbon deposits, we performed time-on-stream in-situ UV/vis tests over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 in a H2 flow (H2/N2 = 5/95)."
          [97] "The results are shown in Figure 4."
          [98] "One can see that the band at 400450 nm starts to appear after 10 min and becomes apparent after 30 min on stream in a H2 flow."
          [99] "Since this band appears in the absence of carbon-containing species, its appearance due to coke deposition can be safely excluded."
          [100] "Possible origins of this band are discussed as follows."
          [101] "It is well-known that nondehydrated VOx/silica materials possess octahedral coordinated VOx species, in which adsorbed water is a ligand."
          [102] "On the basis of this experimental fact, it can be suggested that water is formed upon reaction of VOx species over SiO2 and MCM-41 with H2 and adsorbs over reduced VOx species increasing their coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral."
          [103] "However, to draw a more definitive conclusion about the origins of the band at 400450 nm in H2 at 773 K, new additional experiments are required."
          [104] "It is also important to stress that there is no difference in the UV/vis spectra of VOx species under oxidizing conditions before and after treatments in H2 (Figure 4)."
          [105] "Similar results were obtained for all the oxidizing/reduction/reaction cycles described in Figure 3."
          [106] "This means that VOx species remain highly dispersed during the applied treatments and time-on-stream operation."
          [107] "To check if O2 and N2O show different ability (activity) for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species, in-situ UV/vis tests were performed in a transient mode."
          [108] "In these experiments, the oxidized sample was reduced in a flow of C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) at 773 K for 10 min followed by flushing in a Ne flow for 1 min and feeding an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) over the reduced catalyst."
          [109] "The sample was kept in this flow for 30 min to reoxidate reduced VOx species."
          [110] "Hereafter, the reoxidized catalyst was again reduced in C3H8 followed by its reoxidation in a N2O (N2O/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [111] "In all the above experiments, UV/vis spectra from 200 to 800 nm and KubelkaMunk at 700 nm were recorded every 20 and 5 s, respectively."
          [112] "The respective results are summarized in Figure 5 and Figure 6."
          [113] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."
          [114] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."
          [115] "More detailed insights into the kinetics of reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 and reoxidation of reduced ones by O2 and N2O were derived from the analysis of temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function in Figure 6."
          [116] "At time zero, we switched from an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) to a C3H8 flow (C3H8/Ne = 40/60)."
          [117] "As result, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm increases from 0 (fully oxidized VOx species) and reaches a constant value of ca. 0.2 after 5 min on C3H8 stream."
          [118] "Similar changes were observed when H2 was used as a reducing agent instead of C3H8."
          [119] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed changes are due to the reduction of oxidized VOx species by propane and are not due to deposition of carbon-containing species in the case of C3H8."
          [120] "To prove whether the reduction/reoxidation of VOx species is a reversible process, an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) was fed over the reduced sample (at ca. 10 min in Figure 6) followed by C3H8 feeding (at ca. 22 min in Figure 6)."
          [121] "As shown in Figure 6, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm falls from ca. 0.2 to 0 after a few seconds in the O2 flow and reversibly increases to 0.2 in the C3H8 flow."
          [122] "Two important conclusions were derived: (1) reduction/oxidation of VOx species is a reversible process and (2) reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 is slower than reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2."
          [123] "When N2O was used for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species (ca. 3240 min in Figure 6), these species were also reoxidized."
          [124] "However, the temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm are slower than those with O2."
          [125] "From this difference in the temporal profiles, it is concluded that the reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O is slower than by O2."
          [126] "Similar results were obtained for other catalytic materials studied."
          [127] "Taking the difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [128] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [129] "The effect of oxygen species (lattice oxygen or adsorbed) on the ODP reaction was studied by pulsing a mixture of propane and labeled oxygen (18O2) over the catalyst, which was preoxidized by 16O2."
          [130] "COx products containing different oxygen isotopes (16O and 18O) were detected at the reactor outlet."
          [131] "Their transient responses are presented in Figure 7 in a height-normalized form for better comparison of their pulse shapes."
          [132] "The presence of 16O (not pulsed gas-phase oxygen) in CO and CO2 evidences the participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species in combustion of C3H8/C3H6."
          [133] "This result is very similar to previous reported ones over various vanadium-based catalytic materials.27,48,49"
          [134] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
          [135] "However, the concentration of CO2 and CO formed with participation of labeled oxygen (C18O2, C18O16O, and C18O) was significantly lower than C16O2 and C16O."
          [136] "This indicates that C16O and C16O2 are the main COx products."
          [137] "In other words, lattice oxygen of VOx species is mainly responsible for COx formation."
          [138] "Adsorbed oxygen species formed from gas-phase labeled (18O2) oxygen play only a minor role in COx formation under transient vacuum conditions."
          [139] "This may be because the concentration of lattice nonlabeled oxygen in VOx species is considerably higher than that of labeled oxygen in the C3H818O2 pulse."
          [140] "The ratio of vanadium to the amount of 18O2 in one pulse was estimated as ca. 5·104."
          [141] "However, the contribution of adsorbed oxygen species to the formation of COx can be significantly higher under ambient-pressure conditions."
          [142] "We would like to emphasize that no labeled oxygen species in COx was observed in our previous experiments over VOx/γ-Al2O3 under similar conditions in the TAP reactor.27"
          [143] "This can be explained by the fact that incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into VOx species occurs considerably faster over VOx/γ-Al2O3 as compared to SiO2-based catalysts."
          [144] "This assumption is indirectly supported by the recently reported results of the ODP reaction over VOx/Al2O3 50 and VOx/SiO2 51 in cofeed (O2 and C3H8 are fed together) and cyclic (O2 and C3H8 are fed separately and periodically) modes."
          [145] "No substantial differences in propene selectivity between the cofeed and cyclic conditions were found over the alumina-based catalysts, while propene selectivity over the silica-based one was significantly improved when the ODP reaction was performed under the cyclic conditions."
          [146] "In the latter case, the negative effect of adsorbed oxygen species on propene selectivity could be avoided."
          [147] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O."
          [148] "According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [149] "The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2."
          [150] "The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [151] "Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [152] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."
          [153] "The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
          [154] "This is essential for achieving high primary propene selectivity and for suppressing consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2 as shown in Figure 2."
          [155] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
          [156] "Since 710 oxygen atoms are required for COx formation from propane/propene but only one for propene formation, nonselective propane/propene oxidation to COx will be inhibited upon increasing degree of reduction of VOx species."
          [157] "However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for superior performance of N2O as compared to O2."
          [158] "On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."
          [159] "It is well-known 52 that O2 adsorption over reducible metal oxides occurs via a complex sequence of redox processes until O2- (lattice oxygen) is formed."
          [160] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that gas-phase oxygen adsorbs molecularly over anion vacancy of reduced VOx species. 53,54"
          [161] "This biatomic adsorbed oxygen dissociates further yielding lattice oxygen species."
          [162] "Adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species were suggested to be nonselective ones for the ODP reaction over VMgO 55,56 and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 57 catalytic materials."
          [163] "In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O- or O2-, which are considered as selective ones.52"
          [164] "Further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations are in progress with the aim to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species."

[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
          [4] "Taking into account the precision in the measurements, in- troduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes."
          [5] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged."
          [6] "For pure NiMoO4, addition of 300 ppm N2O leads to (Table 2): (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an increase in the selectivity to propylene (+32%), (iii) a decrease in both the conversion of oxygen (19%) and the yield of CO2 (21%)."
          [7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
          [8] "These results could indicate that -Sb2O4 and N2O could probably play the same role, namely, control- ling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction, inhibit- ing non-selective sites."
          [9] "The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products."
          [10] "N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
          [11] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
          [12] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeo- lites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM- 5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
          [2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [5] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxidation, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)."
          [7] "The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products with a prolongation of contact time supports this explanation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indicating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream."
          [8] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."

[1] "N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."
          [2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state."
          [3] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [4] "The Oproduced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene."
          [5] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi- cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain- ing materials [13,2123]."
          [2] "A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24]."
          [3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxida- tion of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.

          [6] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
          [7] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration re- mained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites were present."
          [8] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida- tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."
          [9] "In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation."
          [10] "However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
          [11] "Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to ob- tain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O."
          [12] "The same VOx/ MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane [13,14]."
          [13] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol 1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxi- dizing agent."
          [14] "In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher,amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."
          [15] "Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."

[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"
          [3] "A major draw- back of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, al- though the original catalytic activity was completely recov- ered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003)."
          [4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
          [5] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."
          [6] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

          [12] "The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2)."
          [13] "The propylene yield is significantly higher in st-H-Z than in c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples is rather similar (especially after 40 min on stream)."
          [14] "This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed performance."
          [15] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5."
          [16] "This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
          [17] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
          [18] "This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by Bula nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of 3001200 ppm."
          [19] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."
          [20] "Our results show that deactivation is slower over the steam- activated zeolites (Fig. 2), with a significantly reduced number of Brnsted sites as a consequence of the steam treatment [21]."
          [21] "A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie- Fe-Z."
          [22] "It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction."
          [23] "Further research is required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP."

[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas."
          [2] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."
          [3] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."
          [4] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."
          [5] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
          [2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
          [3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
          [4] "We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."
          [6] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
          [7] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."
          [8] "One alternative explanation could be the fact that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, so leading to a lower conversion, while selectivity increases."
          [9] "The results obtained when the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4 were similar, but less significant (when 1 vol.% N2O is added,conversion decreases from 7.5 to 4.3% and selectivity increases from 34.8 to 41.9%)."
          [10] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 cat- alyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2)."
          [11] "In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%,respectively."
          [12] "However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%)."
          [13] "This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O."
          [14] "Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst."
          [15] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon."
          [16] "This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable."
          [17] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."
          [18] "N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explain- ing the high carbon formation."
          [19] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
          [2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
          [3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
          [4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
          [5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
          [6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."
          [7] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
          [8] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation.
          The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane.
          A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature.
          The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4).
          Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O.
          The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx.
          Such intermediates appear to be essential for propene production. Accordingly, the performance of FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated ODH of propane is severely deteriorated in the presence of small amounts of O2.
          Because the initial ODHP performance was recovered upon air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles has been evaluated.
          The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may also explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K.
          The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2.
          The efficient utilization of N2O in tail-gases should involve a previous purification step. As shown here, the presence of O2 (a typical component of tail-gases) has a negative impact on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5.



[1] "Recently, it has been pro- posed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted con- siderable attention [213]."
          [2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."
          [3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
          [4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination."
          [5] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."
          [6] "In the case of the ODHP with N2O, the presence of the propane reductant in the reaction system makes the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites much more complicated."
          [7] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mecha- nism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O."
          [8] "Accordingly, there is no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
          [3] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
          [4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective ox- idation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

For all V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion.
          The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as com- pared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction.
          There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant.
          In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2.
          The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx.
          The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2.
          From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
          [4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."
          [5] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."
          [6] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [7] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
          [8] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
          [9] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
          [10] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
          [11] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
          [12] "Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
          [13] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O. Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5. The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2. The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [6] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."

          [8] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
          [9] "The primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [10] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [11] "The higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [12] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [13] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."

          [21] "Additional UV/vis and Raman spectroscopic characterization studies (the data are not shown for brevity) did not indicate a possible presence of XRD-amorphous crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles for samples possessing up to 5.3 wt % vanadium."
          [22] "The calculated vanadium surface densities are 0.37, 0.6, 1.38, and 25.4 for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, VOx(2.9)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, respectively."
          [23] "On the basis of the obtained densities and the literature9 values for a vanadium monolayer (57 V/nm2), it can be safely concluded that all catalytic materials, except for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, possess VOx species below one vanadium monolayer."
          [24] "A single maximum of H2 consumption at ca. 801 and 806 K was observed upon reduction of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 and VOx (2.8)/SiO2, respectively."

          [26] "This shoulder becomes more pronounced for the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where crystalline V2O5 phase was identified by XRD analysis."
          [27] "According to the literature data,37,42,43 the peak at 864 K could be due to the presence of highly polymerized VOx species or crystalline V2O5."
          [28] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material at apparent surface vanadium densities below one monolayer."
          [29] "The relative degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the order"
          [30] "The VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possesses microcrystalline V2O5 phase."
          [31] "The next section establishes correlations between the nature of VOx species and their performance in the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O."
          [32] "Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."
          [33] "Since the amount of N2O was double that of O2, both of the above reaction feeds contained the same amount of oxygen atoms."
          [34] "This allows the comparison of the influence of oxidizing agents on the ODP reaction."
          [35] "The TOF (turnover frequency) values of propane conversion in the presence of O2 and N2O over VOx species below (VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48) and above (VOx(11.2)/MCM-41) one monolayer are compared in Table 1."
          [36] "The TOF values were calculated taking the total amount of vanadium atoms into account."
          [37] "This table illustrates that the catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples."
          [38] "This may be due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species over the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst as shown in section 3.1."
          [39] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
          [40] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."
          [41] "For establishing overall mechanistic scheme of the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O over VOx species of different degrees of polymerization, catalytic performance (product selectivity) was determined at different contact times, that is, different degrees of propane conversion."
          [42] "This knowledge is of high importance for catalyst designing, because it provides essential information on the sequence of product formation, that is, the catalyst ability for C3H8 conversion to C3H6 and COx as well as for consecutive C3H6 combustion."
          [43] "The obtained selectivityconversion relationships with O2 are summarized in Figure 1."
          [44] "Propene selectivity decreases, while CO and CO2 selectivities (the data are not shown) increase with an increase in the degree of propane conversion."
          [45] "Such behavior is explained by consecutive oxidation of the primarily formed propene to carbon oxides."
          [46] "For the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, the low propene selectivity at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion is an indication for catalytic activity toward direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to carbon oxides."
          [47] "This reaction pathway does not play any significant role over other catalytic materials with vanadium loading below one monolayer."
          [48] "Over the latter catalysts, CO and CO2 originate mainly via consecutive C3H6 oxidation."
          [49] "Figure 1b illustrates selectivityconversion relationships in the ODP reaction over differently structured VOx species using N2O."
          [50] "As in the presence of O2 (Figure 1a), propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion with N2O, too."
          [51] "However, from the comparison of the results in Figure 1a and b, it is obvious that propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion."
          [52] "This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [53] "From a more detailed analysis of the data in Figure 1, the primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion) and the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx can be derived."
          [54] "These two parameters represent the catalyst activity for direct propane conversion to COx and for consecutive combustion of primarily formed propene, respectively."
          [55] "In the present paper, the dependence of S(C3H6) on X(C3H8) at low propane conversion (<10%) is described by a linear function in eq 1."
          [56] "where S(C3H6)initial and A are the primary propene selectivity and the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, respectively."
          [57] "According to this function, the primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx."
          [58] "This parameter is related to the catalyst activity for propene conversion to carbon oxides."
          [59] "The higher the slope of the function in eq 1, the faster the COx production from C3H6."
          [60] "Establishing the relationships between the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation and the structure of VOx species or the applied oxidizing agent is highly relevant for designing selective catalysts, since propene selectivity in the ODP reaction suffers mainly from the higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."
          [61] "Figure 2 compares the primary S(C3H6) and the catalyst ability (A) for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx over differently structured VOx species in the presence of O2 and N2O."
          [62] "For an O2-containing reaction feed (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40), it is clear that the primary propene selectivity is close for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, and VOx(2.8)/SiO2 materials but is significantly low over VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 (Figure 2 a)."
          [63] "From the characterization results in section 3.1, the latter material possesses microcrystalline V2O5 while other materials are free of microcrystalline V2O5 and possess highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx species."
          [64] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too."
          [65] "The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found:"
          [66] "The degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the same order (section 3.1)."
          [67] "Thus, the higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [68] "This conclusion is in agreement with literature data9 and with our recent results of the ODP reaction on VOx/γ-Al2O3.36"
          [69] "Further insights into the influence of oxidizing agent on product selectivity in the ODP reaction are derived from the analysis of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 ratios at different degrees of propane conversion."
          [70] "Table 1 represents these ratios at propane conversions of ca. 2 and 10%."
          [71] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."
          [72] "However, the ratio of CO2/C3H6 over polymerized VOx species increases from 0.04 to 0.13, while the ratio of CO/C3H6 decreases from 1.7 to 0.27, when N2O is used instead of O2."
          [73] "For both oxidizing agents, the ratios of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 increase with propane conversion, with the former increasing stronger."
          [74] "This increase is less pronounced for a feed with N2O."
          [75] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [76] "This effect is more pronounced for polymerized VOx species."
          [77] "Summarizing, two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [78] "To elucidate possible reasons of the influence of oxidizing agent on the ODP performance of highly dispersed VOx species and microcrystalline V2O5, in-situ UV/vis measurements were performed at 773 K."
          [79] "The degrees of propane and oxidant (O2 and N2O) conversion were controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS)."
          [80] "To ensure a near-to-uniform composition of the studied catalysts along the catalyst bed, propane and oxidant (O2 or N2O) conversions were kept below 5 and 10%, respectively."
          [81] "Figure 3 exemplifies in-situ UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 in oxidizing (O2/Ne = 20/80) and reducing (H2/N2 = 5/95 or C3H8/Ne = 40/60) atmospheres as well as in ODP feeds (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20)."
          [82] "The UV/vis spectrum in a flow of O2 with the absorption at 295 nm is characteristic for tetrahedrally coordinated V5+Ox species."
          [83] "The adsorption in the 400700 nm region (dd transitions of reduced vanadium species) increases upon switching from an O2 flow to a H2 flow (Figure 3a); the UV/vis bands of V4+ and V3+ species appear as broad features in the 400800 nm region (note the nonzero value of the absorption for the reduced samples in this region)."
          [84] "46,47 Similar changes were also observed when the oxidized catalyst was admitted to a C3H8 flow."
          [85] "Since no significant differences in the UV/vis spectra in H2 and C3H8 flows were observed (Figure 3a), the effect of possible carbon-containing deposits in the case of C3H8 flow on the interpretation of UV/vis data can therefore be neglected."
          [86] "Thus, the observed changes in the UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 upon switching from oxidizing to reducing flows reflect the changes in reduction degree of VOx species under different reaction conditions."
          [87] "Taking the above discussion into account, the UV/vis spectra in O2 (20% O2 in Ne) and C3H8 (40% C3H8 in Ne) flows represent oxidized and reduced states of VOx species, respectively."
          [88] "In the following, we compare UV/vis spectra under different ODP conditions (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) with the spectra of oxidized and reduced VOx species to derive insights into the reduction degree of VOx species under reaction conditions."
          [89] "One can see from Figure 3 that the UV/vis spectra during the ODP reaction with O2 (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40) and in an O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) flow are very similar."
          [90] "This means that the oxidation state of VOx species in both cases is close to 5+."
          [91] "However, there is a strong difference between the UV/vis spectra in O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows, while the UV/vis spectra in H2 (H2/N2 = 5/95) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows are very similar."
          [92] "This evidence that the oxidation state of VOx species under conditions of the ODP reaction with N2O (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%) is similar to the reduced one."
          [93] "This means that the oxidation state of vanadium in VOx species decreases from 5+ to 3+ and/or 4+ when the ODP reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2."
          [94] "Another interesting observation from Figure 3 is the appearance of a new band at 400450 nm in the UV/vis spectrum of VOx(2.8)/SiO2 in a C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [95] "A similar band was also identified over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 after 1030 min on stream in C3H8."
          [96] "To prove whether this band may belong to carbon deposits, we performed time-on-stream in-situ UV/vis tests over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 in a H2 flow (H2/N2 = 5/95)."
          [97] "The results are shown in Figure 4."
          [98] "One can see that the band at 400450 nm starts to appear after 10 min and becomes apparent after 30 min on stream in a H2 flow."
          [99] "Since this band appears in the absence of carbon-containing species, its appearance due to coke deposition can be safely excluded."
          [100] "Possible origins of this band are discussed as follows."
          [101] "It is well-known that nondehydrated VOx/silica materials possess octahedral coordinated VOx species, in which adsorbed water is a ligand."
          [102] "On the basis of this experimental fact, it can be suggested that water is formed upon reaction of VOx species over SiO2 and MCM-41 with H2 and adsorbs over reduced VOx species increasing their coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral."
          [103] "However, to draw a more definitive conclusion about the origins of the band at 400450 nm in H2 at 773 K, new additional experiments are required."
          [104] "It is also important to stress that there is no difference in the UV/vis spectra of VOx species under oxidizing conditions before and after treatments in H2 (Figure 4)."
          [105] "Similar results were obtained for all the oxidizing/reduction/reaction cycles described in Figure 3."
          [106] "This means that VOx species remain highly dispersed during the applied treatments and time-on-stream operation."
          [107] "To check if O2 and N2O show different ability (activity) for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species, in-situ UV/vis tests were performed in a transient mode."
          [108] "In these experiments, the oxidized sample was reduced in a flow of C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) at 773 K for 10 min followed by flushing in a Ne flow for 1 min and feeding an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) over the reduced catalyst."
          [109] "The sample was kept in this flow for 30 min to reoxidate reduced VOx species."
          [110] "Hereafter, the reoxidized catalyst was again reduced in C3H8 followed by its reoxidation in a N2O (N2O/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [111] "In all the above experiments, UV/vis spectra from 200 to 800 nm and KubelkaMunk at 700 nm were recorded every 20 and 5 s, respectively."
          [112] "The respective results are summarized in Figure 5 and Figure 6."
          [113] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."
          [114] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."
          [115] "More detailed insights into the kinetics of reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 and reoxidation of reduced ones by O2 and N2O were derived from the analysis of temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function in Figure 6."
          [116] "At time zero, we switched from an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) to a C3H8 flow (C3H8/Ne = 40/60)."
          [117] "As result, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm increases from 0 (fully oxidized VOx species) and reaches a constant value of ca. 0.2 after 5 min on C3H8 stream."
          [118] "Similar changes were observed when H2 was used as a reducing agent instead of C3H8."
          [119] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed changes are due to the reduction of oxidized VOx species by propane and are not due to deposition of carbon-containing species in the case of C3H8."
          [120] "To prove whether the reduction/reoxidation of VOx species is a reversible process, an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) was fed over the reduced sample (at ca. 10 min in Figure 6) followed by C3H8 feeding (at ca. 22 min in Figure 6)."
          [121] "As shown in Figure 6, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm falls from ca. 0.2 to 0 after a few seconds in the O2 flow and reversibly increases to 0.2 in the C3H8 flow."
          [122] "Two important conclusions were derived: (1) reduction/oxidation of VOx species is a reversible process and (2) reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 is slower than reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2."
          [123] "When N2O was used for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species (ca. 3240 min in Figure 6), these species were also reoxidized."
          [124] "However, the temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm are slower than those with O2."
          [125] "From this difference in the temporal profiles, it is concluded that the reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O is slower than by O2."
          [126] "Similar results were obtained for other catalytic materials studied."
          [127] "Taking the difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [128] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [129] "The effect of oxygen species (lattice oxygen or adsorbed) on the ODP reaction was studied by pulsing a mixture of propane and labeled oxygen (18O2) over the catalyst, which was preoxidized by 16O2."
          [130] "COx products containing different oxygen isotopes (16O and 18O) were detected at the reactor outlet."
          [131] "Their transient responses are presented in Figure 7 in a height-normalized form for better comparison of their pulse shapes."
          [132] "The presence of 16O (not pulsed gas-phase oxygen) in CO and CO2 evidences the participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species in combustion of C3H8/C3H6."
          [133] "This result is very similar to previous reported ones over various vanadium-based catalytic materials.27,48,49"
          [134] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
          [135] "However, the concentration of CO2 and CO formed with participation of labeled oxygen (C18O2, C18O16O, and C18O) was significantly lower than C16O2 and C16O."
          [136] "This indicates that C16O and C16O2 are the main COx products."
          [137] "In other words, lattice oxygen of VOx species is mainly responsible for COx formation."
          [138] "Adsorbed oxygen species formed from gas-phase labeled (18O2) oxygen play only a minor role in COx formation under transient vacuum conditions."
          [139] "This may be because the concentration of lattice nonlabeled oxygen in VOx species is considerably higher than that of labeled oxygen in the C3H818O2 pulse."
          [140] "The ratio of vanadium to the amount of 18O2 in one pulse was estimated as ca. 5·104."
          [141] "However, the contribution of adsorbed oxygen species to the formation of COx can be significantly higher under ambient-pressure conditions."
          [142] "We would like to emphasize that no labeled oxygen species in COx was observed in our previous experiments over VOx/γ-Al2O3 under similar conditions in the TAP reactor.27"
          [143] "This can be explained by the fact that incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into VOx species occurs considerably faster over VOx/γ-Al2O3 as compared to SiO2-based catalysts."
          [144] "This assumption is indirectly supported by the recently reported results of the ODP reaction over VOx/Al2O3 50 and VOx/SiO2 51 in cofeed (O2 and C3H8 are fed together) and cyclic (O2 and C3H8 are fed separately and periodically) modes."
          [145] "No substantial differences in propene selectivity between the cofeed and cyclic conditions were found over the alumina-based catalysts, while propene selectivity over the silica-based one was significantly improved when the ODP reaction was performed under the cyclic conditions."
          [146] "In the latter case, the negative effect of adsorbed oxygen species on propene selectivity could be avoided."
          [147] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O."
          [148] "According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [149] "The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2."
          [150] "The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [151] "Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [152] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."
          [153] "The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
          [154] "This is essential for achieving high primary propene selectivity and for suppressing consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2 as shown in Figure 2."
          [155] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
          [156] "Since 710 oxygen atoms are required for COx formation from propane/propene but only one for propene formation, nonselective propane/propene oxidation to COx will be inhibited upon increasing degree of reduction of VOx species."
          [157] "However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for superior performance of N2O as compared to O2."
          [158] "On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."
          [159] "It is well-known 52 that O2 adsorption over reducible metal oxides occurs via a complex sequence of redox processes until O2- (lattice oxygen) is formed."
          [160] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that gas-phase oxygen adsorbs molecularly over anion vacancy of reduced VOx species. 53,54"
          [161] "This biatomic adsorbed oxygen dissociates further yielding lattice oxygen species."
          [162] "Adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species were suggested to be nonselective ones for the ODP reaction over VMgO 55,56 and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 57 catalytic materials."
          [163] "In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O- or O2-, which are considered as selective ones.52"
          [164] "Further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations are in progress with the aim to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species."

[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
          [4] "Taking into account the precision in the measurements, in- troduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes."
          [5] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged."
          [6] "For pure NiMoO4, addition of 300 ppm N2O leads to (Table 2): (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an increase in the selectivity to propylene (+32%), (iii) a decrease in both the conversion of oxygen (19%) and the yield of CO2 (21%)."
          [7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
          [8] "These results could indicate that -Sb2O4 and N2O could probably play the same role, namely, control- ling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction, inhibit- ing non-selective sites."
          [9] "The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products."
          [10] "N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
          [11] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
          [12] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeo- lites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM- 5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
          [2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [5] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxidation, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)."
          [7] "The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products with a prolongation of contact time supports this explanation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indicating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream."
          [8] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."

[1] "N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."
          [2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state."
          [3] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [4] "The Oproduced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene."
          [5] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi- cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain- ing materials [13,2123]."
          [2] "A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24]."
          [3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxida- tion of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.

          [6] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
          [7] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration re- mained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites were present."
          [8] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida- tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."
          [9] "In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation."
          [10] "However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
          [11] "Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to ob- tain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O."
          [12] "The same VOx/ MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane [13,14]."
          [13] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol 1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxi- dizing agent."
          [14] "In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher,amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."
          [15] "Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."

[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"
          [3] "A major draw- back of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, al- though the original catalytic activity was completely recov- ered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003)."
          [4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
          [5] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."
          [6] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

          [5] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."

          [11] "The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored."
          [12] "The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2)."

          [15] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5."
          [16] "This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
          [17] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
          [18] "This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by Bula nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of 3001200 ppm."
          [19] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."
          [20] "Our results show that deactivation is slower over the steam- activated zeolites (Fig. 2), with a significantly reduced number of Brnsted sites as a consequence of the steam treatment [21]."
          [21] "A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie- Fe-Z."
          [22] "It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction."
          [23] "Further research is required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP."

[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas."
          [2] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."
          [3] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."
          [4] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."
          [5] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
          [2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
          [3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
          [4] "We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."
          [6] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
          [7] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."
          [8] "One alternative explanation could be the fact that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, so leading to a lower conversion, while selectivity increases."
          [9] "The results obtained when the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4 were similar, but less significant (when 1 vol.% N2O is added,conversion decreases from 7.5 to 4.3% and selectivity increases from 34.8 to 41.9%)."
          [10] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 cat- alyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2)."
          [11] "In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%,respectively."
          [12] "However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%)."
          [13] "This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O."
          [14] "Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst."
          [15] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon."
          [16] "This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable."
          [17] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."
          [18] "N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explain- ing the high carbon formation."
          [19] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
          [2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
          [3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
          [4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
          [5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
          [6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."
          [7] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
          [8] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation.
          The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane.
          A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature.
          The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4).
          Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O.
          The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx.
          Such intermediates appear to be essential for propene production. Accordingly, the performance of FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated ODH of propane is severely deteriorated in the presence of small amounts of O2.
          Because the initial ODHP performance was recovered upon air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles has been evaluated.
          The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may also explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K.
          The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2.
          The efficient utilization of N2O in tail-gases should involve a previous purification step. As shown here, the presence of O2 (a typical component of tail-gases) has a negative impact on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5.



[1] "Recently, it has been pro- posed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted con- siderable attention [213]."
          [2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."
          [3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
          [4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination."
          [5] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."
          [6] "In the case of the ODHP with N2O, the presence of the propane reductant in the reaction system makes the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites much more complicated."
          [7] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mecha- nism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O."
          [8] "Accordingly, there is no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
          [3] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
          [4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective ox- idation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

For all V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion.
          The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as com- pared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction.
          There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant.
          In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2.
          The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx.
          The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2.
          From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
          [4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."
          [5] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."
          [6] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [7] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
          [8] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
          [9] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
          [10] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
          [11] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
          [12] "Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
          [13] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O. Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5. The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2. The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [6] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."
          [7] "The XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to ca. 5 wt % do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase."

          [9] "The primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [10] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [11] "The higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [12] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."

          [14] "The BET values of unloaded MCM-41, MCM-48, and SiO2 support materials amounted to 1040, 1049, and 300 m2/g, respectively."
          [15] "Vanadium-loaded MCM-41 and SiO2 materials showed a decrease in the specific surface area by a factor of ca. 20% for vanadium loadings up to 5.3 wt %."
          [16] "The VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 catalyst lost ca. 50% of the original surface area of MCM-48."
          [17] "The SBET value (52 m2/g) of VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 is significantly lower than those of the other catalysts."
          [18] "As reported in ref 20, the pore structure of MCM-41 is completely destroyed in this sample."
          [19] "Small V2O5 crystallites were observed in this sample by means of ex-situ XRD analysis."
          [20] "The XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to ca. 5 wt % do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase."
          [21] "Additional UV/vis and Raman spectroscopic characterization studies (the data are not shown for brevity) did not indicate a possible presence of XRD-amorphous crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles for samples possessing up to 5.3 wt % vanadium."
          [22] "The calculated vanadium surface densities are 0.37, 0.6, 1.38, and 25.4 for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, VOx(2.9)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, respectively."
          [23] "On the basis of the obtained densities and the literature9 values for a vanadium monolayer (57 V/nm2), it can be safely concluded that all catalytic materials, except for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, possess VOx species below one vanadium monolayer."
          [24] "A single maximum of H2 consumption at ca. 801 and 806 K was observed upon reduction of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 and VOx (2.8)/SiO2, respectively."
          [25] "Additionally to the maximal H2 consumption at 810 K, a small shoulder at ca. 860 K was identified in the TPR profile of the VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 sample."
          [26] "This shoulder becomes more pronounced for the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where crystalline V2O5 phase was identified by XRD analysis."
          [27] "According to the literature data,37,42,43 the peak at 864 K could be due to the presence of highly polymerized VOx species or crystalline V2O5."
          [28] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material at apparent surface vanadium densities below one monolayer."
          [29] "The relative degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the order"

          [33] "Since the amount of N2O was double that of O2, both of the above reaction feeds contained the same amount of oxygen atoms."
          [34] "This allows the comparison of the influence of oxidizing agents on the ODP reaction."

          [36] "The TOF values were calculated taking the total amount of vanadium atoms into account."
          [37] "This table illustrates that the catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples."
          [38] "This may be due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species over the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst as shown in section 3.1."

          [40] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."
          [41] "For establishing overall mechanistic scheme of the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O over VOx species of different degrees of polymerization, catalytic performance (product selectivity) was determined at different contact times, that is, different degrees of propane conversion."
          [42] "This knowledge is of high importance for catalyst designing, because it provides essential information on the sequence of product formation, that is, the catalyst ability for C3H8 conversion to C3H6 and COx as well as for consecutive C3H6 combustion."
          [43] "The obtained selectivityconversion relationships with O2 are summarized in Figure 1."
          [44] "Propene selectivity decreases, while CO and CO2 selectivities (the data are not shown) increase with an increase in the degree of propane conversion."
          [45] "Such behavior is explained by consecutive oxidation of the primarily formed propene to carbon oxides."
          [46] "For the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, the low propene selectivity at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion is an indication for catalytic activity toward direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to carbon oxides."
          [47] "This reaction pathway does not play any significant role over other catalytic materials with vanadium loading below one monolayer."
          [48] "Over the latter catalysts, CO and CO2 originate mainly via consecutive C3H6 oxidation."
          [49] "Figure 1b illustrates selectivityconversion relationships in the ODP reaction over differently structured VOx species using N2O."
          [50] "As in the presence of O2 (Figure 1a), propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion with N2O, too."
          [51] "However, from the comparison of the results in Figure 1a and b, it is obvious that propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion."
          [52] "This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [53] "From a more detailed analysis of the data in Figure 1, the primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion) and the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx can be derived."
          [54] "These two parameters represent the catalyst activity for direct propane conversion to COx and for consecutive combustion of primarily formed propene, respectively."
          [55] "In the present paper, the dependence of S(C3H6) on X(C3H8) at low propane conversion (<10%) is described by a linear function in eq 1."
          [56] "where S(C3H6)initial and A are the primary propene selectivity and the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, respectively."
          [57] "According to this function, the primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx."
          [58] "This parameter is related to the catalyst activity for propene conversion to carbon oxides."
          [59] "The higher the slope of the function in eq 1, the faster the COx production from C3H6."
          [60] "Establishing the relationships between the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation and the structure of VOx species or the applied oxidizing agent is highly relevant for designing selective catalysts, since propene selectivity in the ODP reaction suffers mainly from the higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."
          [61] "Figure 2 compares the primary S(C3H6) and the catalyst ability (A) for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx over differently structured VOx species in the presence of O2 and N2O."
          [62] "For an O2-containing reaction feed (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40), it is clear that the primary propene selectivity is close for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, and VOx(2.8)/SiO2 materials but is significantly low over VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 (Figure 2 a)."
          [63] "From the characterization results in section 3.1, the latter material possesses microcrystalline V2O5 while other materials are free of microcrystalline V2O5 and possess highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx species."
          [64] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too."
          [65] "The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found:"
          [66] "The degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the same order (section 3.1)."
          [67] "Thus, the higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [68] "This conclusion is in agreement with literature data9 and with our recent results of the ODP reaction on VOx/γ-Al2O3.36"
          [69] "Further insights into the influence of oxidizing agent on product selectivity in the ODP reaction are derived from the analysis of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 ratios at different degrees of propane conversion."
          [70] "Table 1 represents these ratios at propane conversions of ca. 2 and 10%."
          [71] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."
          [72] "However, the ratio of CO2/C3H6 over polymerized VOx species increases from 0.04 to 0.13, while the ratio of CO/C3H6 decreases from 1.7 to 0.27, when N2O is used instead of O2."
          [73] "For both oxidizing agents, the ratios of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 increase with propane conversion, with the former increasing stronger."
          [74] "This increase is less pronounced for a feed with N2O."
          [75] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [76] "This effect is more pronounced for polymerized VOx species."
          [77] "Summarizing, two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [78] "To elucidate possible reasons of the influence of oxidizing agent on the ODP performance of highly dispersed VOx species and microcrystalline V2O5, in-situ UV/vis measurements were performed at 773 K."
          [79] "The degrees of propane and oxidant (O2 and N2O) conversion were controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS)."
          [80] "To ensure a near-to-uniform composition of the studied catalysts along the catalyst bed, propane and oxidant (O2 or N2O) conversions were kept below 5 and 10%, respectively."
          [81] "Figure 3 exemplifies in-situ UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 in oxidizing (O2/Ne = 20/80) and reducing (H2/N2 = 5/95 or C3H8/Ne = 40/60) atmospheres as well as in ODP feeds (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20)."
          [82] "The UV/vis spectrum in a flow of O2 with the absorption at 295 nm is characteristic for tetrahedrally coordinated V5+Ox species."
          [83] "The adsorption in the 400700 nm region (dd transitions of reduced vanadium species) increases upon switching from an O2 flow to a H2 flow (Figure 3a); the UV/vis bands of V4+ and V3+ species appear as broad features in the 400800 nm region (note the nonzero value of the absorption for the reduced samples in this region)."
          [84] "46,47 Similar changes were also observed when the oxidized catalyst was admitted to a C3H8 flow."
          [85] "Since no significant differences in the UV/vis spectra in H2 and C3H8 flows were observed (Figure 3a), the effect of possible carbon-containing deposits in the case of C3H8 flow on the interpretation of UV/vis data can therefore be neglected."
          [86] "Thus, the observed changes in the UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 upon switching from oxidizing to reducing flows reflect the changes in reduction degree of VOx species under different reaction conditions."
          [87] "Taking the above discussion into account, the UV/vis spectra in O2 (20% O2 in Ne) and C3H8 (40% C3H8 in Ne) flows represent oxidized and reduced states of VOx species, respectively."
          [88] "In the following, we compare UV/vis spectra under different ODP conditions (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) with the spectra of oxidized and reduced VOx species to derive insights into the reduction degree of VOx species under reaction conditions."
          [89] "One can see from Figure 3 that the UV/vis spectra during the ODP reaction with O2 (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40) and in an O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) flow are very similar."
          [90] "This means that the oxidation state of VOx species in both cases is close to 5+."
          [91] "However, there is a strong difference between the UV/vis spectra in O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows, while the UV/vis spectra in H2 (H2/N2 = 5/95) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows are very similar."
          [92] "This evidence that the oxidation state of VOx species under conditions of the ODP reaction with N2O (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%) is similar to the reduced one."
          [93] "This means that the oxidation state of vanadium in VOx species decreases from 5+ to 3+ and/or 4+ when the ODP reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2."
          [94] "Another interesting observation from Figure 3 is the appearance of a new band at 400450 nm in the UV/vis spectrum of VOx(2.8)/SiO2 in a C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [95] "A similar band was also identified over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 after 1030 min on stream in C3H8."
          [96] "To prove whether this band may belong to carbon deposits, we performed time-on-stream in-situ UV/vis tests over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 in a H2 flow (H2/N2 = 5/95)."
          [97] "The results are shown in Figure 4."
          [98] "One can see that the band at 400450 nm starts to appear after 10 min and becomes apparent after 30 min on stream in a H2 flow."
          [99] "Since this band appears in the absence of carbon-containing species, its appearance due to coke deposition can be safely excluded."
          [100] "Possible origins of this band are discussed as follows."
          [101] "It is well-known that nondehydrated VOx/silica materials possess octahedral coordinated VOx species, in which adsorbed water is a ligand."
          [102] "On the basis of this experimental fact, it can be suggested that water is formed upon reaction of VOx species over SiO2 and MCM-41 with H2 and adsorbs over reduced VOx species increasing their coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral."
          [103] "However, to draw a more definitive conclusion about the origins of the band at 400450 nm in H2 at 773 K, new additional experiments are required."
          [104] "It is also important to stress that there is no difference in the UV/vis spectra of VOx species under oxidizing conditions before and after treatments in H2 (Figure 4)."
          [105] "Similar results were obtained for all the oxidizing/reduction/reaction cycles described in Figure 3."
          [106] "This means that VOx species remain highly dispersed during the applied treatments and time-on-stream operation."
          [107] "To check if O2 and N2O show different ability (activity) for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species, in-situ UV/vis tests were performed in a transient mode."
          [108] "In these experiments, the oxidized sample was reduced in a flow of C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) at 773 K for 10 min followed by flushing in a Ne flow for 1 min and feeding an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) over the reduced catalyst."
          [109] "The sample was kept in this flow for 30 min to reoxidate reduced VOx species."
          [110] "Hereafter, the reoxidized catalyst was again reduced in C3H8 followed by its reoxidation in a N2O (N2O/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [111] "In all the above experiments, UV/vis spectra from 200 to 800 nm and KubelkaMunk at 700 nm were recorded every 20 and 5 s, respectively."
          [112] "The respective results are summarized in Figure 5 and Figure 6."
          [113] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."
          [114] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."
          [115] "More detailed insights into the kinetics of reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 and reoxidation of reduced ones by O2 and N2O were derived from the analysis of temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function in Figure 6."
          [116] "At time zero, we switched from an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) to a C3H8 flow (C3H8/Ne = 40/60)."
          [117] "As result, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm increases from 0 (fully oxidized VOx species) and reaches a constant value of ca. 0.2 after 5 min on C3H8 stream."
          [118] "Similar changes were observed when H2 was used as a reducing agent instead of C3H8."
          [119] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed changes are due to the reduction of oxidized VOx species by propane and are not due to deposition of carbon-containing species in the case of C3H8."
          [120] "To prove whether the reduction/reoxidation of VOx species is a reversible process, an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) was fed over the reduced sample (at ca. 10 min in Figure 6) followed by C3H8 feeding (at ca. 22 min in Figure 6)."
          [121] "As shown in Figure 6, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm falls from ca. 0.2 to 0 after a few seconds in the O2 flow and reversibly increases to 0.2 in the C3H8 flow."
          [122] "Two important conclusions were derived: (1) reduction/oxidation of VOx species is a reversible process and (2) reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 is slower than reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2."
          [123] "When N2O was used for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species (ca. 3240 min in Figure 6), these species were also reoxidized."
          [124] "However, the temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm are slower than those with O2."
          [125] "From this difference in the temporal profiles, it is concluded that the reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O is slower than by O2."
          [126] "Similar results were obtained for other catalytic materials studied."
          [127] "Taking the difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [128] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [129] "The effect of oxygen species (lattice oxygen or adsorbed) on the ODP reaction was studied by pulsing a mixture of propane and labeled oxygen (18O2) over the catalyst, which was preoxidized by 16O2."
          [130] "COx products containing different oxygen isotopes (16O and 18O) were detected at the reactor outlet."
          [131] "Their transient responses are presented in Figure 7 in a height-normalized form for better comparison of their pulse shapes."
          [132] "The presence of 16O (not pulsed gas-phase oxygen) in CO and CO2 evidences the participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species in combustion of C3H8/C3H6."
          [133] "This result is very similar to previous reported ones over various vanadium-based catalytic materials.27,48,49"
          [134] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
          [135] "However, the concentration of CO2 and CO formed with participation of labeled oxygen (C18O2, C18O16O, and C18O) was significantly lower than C16O2 and C16O."
          [136] "This indicates that C16O and C16O2 are the main COx products."
          [137] "In other words, lattice oxygen of VOx species is mainly responsible for COx formation."
          [138] "Adsorbed oxygen species formed from gas-phase labeled (18O2) oxygen play only a minor role in COx formation under transient vacuum conditions."
          [139] "This may be because the concentration of lattice nonlabeled oxygen in VOx species is considerably higher than that of labeled oxygen in the C3H818O2 pulse."
          [140] "The ratio of vanadium to the amount of 18O2 in one pulse was estimated as ca. 5·104."
          [141] "However, the contribution of adsorbed oxygen species to the formation of COx can be significantly higher under ambient-pressure conditions."
          [142] "We would like to emphasize that no labeled oxygen species in COx was observed in our previous experiments over VOx/γ-Al2O3 under similar conditions in the TAP reactor.27"
          [143] "This can be explained by the fact that incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into VOx species occurs considerably faster over VOx/γ-Al2O3 as compared to SiO2-based catalysts."
          [144] "This assumption is indirectly supported by the recently reported results of the ODP reaction over VOx/Al2O3 50 and VOx/SiO2 51 in cofeed (O2 and C3H8 are fed together) and cyclic (O2 and C3H8 are fed separately and periodically) modes."
          [145] "No substantial differences in propene selectivity between the cofeed and cyclic conditions were found over the alumina-based catalysts, while propene selectivity over the silica-based one was significantly improved when the ODP reaction was performed under the cyclic conditions."
          [146] "In the latter case, the negative effect of adsorbed oxygen species on propene selectivity could be avoided."
          [147] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O."
          [148] "According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [149] "The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2."
          [150] "The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [151] "Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [152] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."
          [153] "The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
          [154] "This is essential for achieving high primary propene selectivity and for suppressing consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2 as shown in Figure 2."
          [155] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
          [156] "Since 710 oxygen atoms are required for COx formation from propane/propene but only one for propene formation, nonselective propane/propene oxidation to COx will be inhibited upon increasing degree of reduction of VOx species."
          [157] "However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for superior performance of N2O as compared to O2."
          [158] "On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."
          [159] "It is well-known 52 that O2 adsorption over reducible metal oxides occurs via a complex sequence of redox processes until O2- (lattice oxygen) is formed."
          [160] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that gas-phase oxygen adsorbs molecularly over anion vacancy of reduced VOx species. 53,54"
          [161] "This biatomic adsorbed oxygen dissociates further yielding lattice oxygen species."
          [162] "Adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species were suggested to be nonselective ones for the ODP reaction over VMgO 55,56 and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 57 catalytic materials."
          [163] "In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O- or O2-, which are considered as selective ones.52"
          [164] "Further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations are in progress with the aim to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species."

[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
          [4] "Taking into account the precision in the measurements, in- troduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes."
          [5] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged."
          [6] "For pure NiMoO4, addition of 300 ppm N2O leads to (Table 2): (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an increase in the selectivity to propylene (+32%), (iii) a decrease in both the conversion of oxygen (19%) and the yield of CO2 (21%)."
          [7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
          [8] "These results could indicate that -Sb2O4 and N2O could probably play the same role, namely, control- ling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction, inhibit- ing non-selective sites."
          [9] "The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products."
          [10] "N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
          [11] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
          [12] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeo- lites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM- 5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
          [2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [5] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxidation, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)."
          [7] "The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products with a prolongation of contact time supports this explanation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indicating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream."
          [8] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."

[1] "N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."
          [2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state."
          [3] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [4] "The Oproduced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene."
          [5] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi- cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain- ing materials [13,2123]."
          [2] "A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24]."
          [3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxida- tion of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.

          [6] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
          [7] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration re- mained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites were present."
          [8] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida- tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."
          [9] "In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation."
          [10] "However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
          [11] "Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to ob- tain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O."
          [12] "The same VOx/ MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane [13,14]."
          [13] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol 1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxi- dizing agent."
          [14] "In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher,amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."
          [15] "Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."

[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"
          [3] "A major draw- back of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, al- though the original catalytic activity was completely recov- ered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003)."
          [4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
          [5] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."
          [6] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

[1] "The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor and to the ability of determined iron species for coordinating re- active atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane [4]."

          [4] "The level of detail and accuracy for in situ investigation of coke formation as obtained by TEOM cannot be accomplished using typical approaches to study deactivation, in which coke is characterized after exposing the catalyst to reaction condi- tions and taking samples at defined times for ex situ analyses [1416]."
          [5] "However, TEOM does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level, be- cause the nature of coke as well as its interaction with chemical groups in the zeolite cannot be probed."
          [6] "To gain a better under- standing of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air,complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed."
          [7] "In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion [1720], by monitoring in real time the formation of carbona- ceous deposits and eventual changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous ma- terial."
          [8] "Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction."
          [9] "To the best of our knowledge, in situ in- vestigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported."
          [10] "Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts (i.e., to what extent the catalytic performance is recovered on successive re- action and regeneration cycles) has not yet been addressed in detail."
          [11] "Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC exper- iments over the catalysts at the same conditions."
          [12] "The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characteri- zation of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),and nitrogen adsorption."

[1] "Much research effort is currently devoted to the selective activation and functionalization of light alkanes (methane,ethane, propane, and butane) for obtaining petrochemicals directly or their respective olefinic feedstocks."
          [2] "Many studies have explored the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, a key building block in the petrochemical industry."
          [3] "Relatively complex multimetallic mixed oxides based on Vand Mo are considered as the most efficient catalysts in this reaction, with propene yields in the range of 1030% using O2 as the oxidant [1]."
          [4] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
          [5] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."
          [6] "Besides, iron zeolites strongly deactivate during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation and it is unclear from these publications whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time."
          [7] "The highest propylene yield was obtained over steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 (22%), followed by the iron zeolites prepared by liquid-ion exchange (16%) and chemical vapor deposition (9%)."
          [8] "The positive effect of steaming on the catalytic performance of iron zeolites for different conver- sions involving N2O, including direct decomposition [15],benzene hydroxylation [14,16,17], and propane oxidation [4,5] has been previously reported."
          [9] "The time and degree of deactivation in Fig. 2 depend on the catalyst in question."
          [10] "The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample."
          [11] "The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored."
          [12] "The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2)."
          [13] "The propylene yield is significantly higher in st-H-Z than in c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples is rather similar (especially after 40 min on stream)."
          [14] "This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed performance."
          [15] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5."
          [16] "This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
          [17] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
          [18] "This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by Bula nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of 3001200 ppm."
          [19] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."
          [20] "Our results show that deactivation is slower over the steam- activated zeolites (Fig. 2), with a significantly reduced number of Brnsted sites as a consequence of the steam treatment [21]."
          [21] "A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie- Fe-Z."
          [22] "It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction."
          [23] "Further research is required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP."

[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas."
          [2] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."
          [3] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."
          [4] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."
          [5] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
          [2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
          [3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
          [4] "We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."
          [6] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
          [7] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."
          [8] "One alternative explanation could be the fact that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, so leading to a lower conversion, while selectivity increases."
          [9] "The results obtained when the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4 were similar, but less significant (when 1 vol.% N2O is added,conversion decreases from 7.5 to 4.3% and selectivity increases from 34.8 to 41.9%)."
          [10] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 cat- alyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2)."
          [11] "In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%,respectively."
          [12] "However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%)."
          [13] "This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O."
          [14] "Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst."
          [15] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon."
          [16] "This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable."
          [17] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."
          [18] "N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explain- ing the high carbon formation."
          [19] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
          [2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
          [3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
          [4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
          [5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
          [6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."
          [7] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
          [8] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation.
          The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane.
          A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature.
          The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4).
          Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O.
          The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx.
          Such intermediates appear to be essential for propene production. Accordingly, the performance of FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated ODH of propane is severely deteriorated in the presence of small amounts of O2.
          Because the initial ODHP performance was recovered upon air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles has been evaluated.
          The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may also explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K.
          The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2.
          The efficient utilization of N2O in tail-gases should involve a previous purification step. As shown here, the presence of O2 (a typical component of tail-gases) has a negative impact on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5.



[1] "Recently, it has been pro- posed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted con- siderable attention [213]."
          [2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."
          [3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
          [4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination."
          [5] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."
          [6] "In the case of the ODHP with N2O, the presence of the propane reductant in the reaction system makes the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites much more complicated."
          [7] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mecha- nism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O."
          [8] "Accordingly, there is no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
          [3] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
          [4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective ox- idation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

For all V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion.
          The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as com- pared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction.
          There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant.
          In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2.
          The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx.
          The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2.
          From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
          [4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."
          [5] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."
          [6] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [7] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
          [8] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
          [9] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
          [10] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
          [11] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
          [12] "Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
          [13] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O. Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5. The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2. The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [6] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."
          [7] "The XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to ca. 5 wt % do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase."
          [8] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
          [9] "The primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [10] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [11] "The higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [12] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [13] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."
          [14] "The BET values of unloaded MCM-41, MCM-48, and SiO2 support materials amounted to 1040, 1049, and 300 m2/g, respectively."
          [15] "Vanadium-loaded MCM-41 and SiO2 materials showed a decrease in the specific surface area by a factor of ca. 20% for vanadium loadings up to 5.3 wt %."
          [16] "The VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 catalyst lost ca. 50% of the original surface area of MCM-48."
          [17] "The SBET value (52 m2/g) of VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 is significantly lower than those of the other catalysts."
          [18] "As reported in ref 20, the pore structure of MCM-41 is completely destroyed in this sample."
          [19] "Small V2O5 crystallites were observed in this sample by means of ex-situ XRD analysis."
          [20] "The XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to ca. 5 wt % do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase."
          [21] "Additional UV/vis and Raman spectroscopic characterization studies (the data are not shown for brevity) did not indicate a possible presence of XRD-amorphous crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles for samples possessing up to 5.3 wt % vanadium."
          [22] "The calculated vanadium surface densities are 0.37, 0.6, 1.38, and 25.4 for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, VOx(2.9)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, respectively."
          [23] "On the basis of the obtained densities and the literature9 values for a vanadium monolayer (57 V/nm2), it can be safely concluded that all catalytic materials, except for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, possess VOx species below one vanadium monolayer."
          [24] "A single maximum of H2 consumption at ca. 801 and 806 K was observed upon reduction of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 and VOx (2.8)/SiO2, respectively."
          [25] "Additionally to the maximal H2 consumption at 810 K, a small shoulder at ca. 860 K was identified in the TPR profile of the VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 sample."
          [26] "This shoulder becomes more pronounced for the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where crystalline V2O5 phase was identified by XRD analysis."
          [27] "According to the literature data,37,42,43 the peak at 864 K could be due to the presence of highly polymerized VOx species or crystalline V2O5."
          [28] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material at apparent surface vanadium densities below one monolayer."
          [29] "The relative degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the order"
          [30] "The VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possesses microcrystalline V2O5 phase."
          [31] "The next section establishes correlations between the nature of VOx species and their performance in the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O."
          [32] "Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."
          [33] "Since the amount of N2O was double that of O2, both of the above reaction feeds contained the same amount of oxygen atoms."
          [34] "This allows the comparison of the influence of oxidizing agents on the ODP reaction."
          [35] "The TOF (turnover frequency) values of propane conversion in the presence of O2 and N2O over VOx species below (VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48) and above (VOx(11.2)/MCM-41) one monolayer are compared in Table 1."
          [36] "The TOF values were calculated taking the total amount of vanadium atoms into account."
          [37] "This table illustrates that the catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples."
          [38] "This may be due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species over the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst as shown in section 3.1."
          [39] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
          [40] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."
          [41] "For establishing overall mechanistic scheme of the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O over VOx species of different degrees of polymerization, catalytic performance (product selectivity) was determined at different contact times, that is, different degrees of propane conversion."
          [42] "This knowledge is of high importance for catalyst designing, because it provides essential information on the sequence of product formation, that is, the catalyst ability for C3H8 conversion to C3H6 and COx as well as for consecutive C3H6 combustion."
          [43] "The obtained selectivityconversion relationships with O2 are summarized in Figure 1."
          [44] "Propene selectivity decreases, while CO and CO2 selectivities (the data are not shown) increase with an increase in the degree of propane conversion."
          [45] "Such behavior is explained by consecutive oxidation of the primarily formed propene to carbon oxides."
          [46] "For the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, the low propene selectivity at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion is an indication for catalytic activity toward direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to carbon oxides."
          [47] "This reaction pathway does not play any significant role over other catalytic materials with vanadium loading below one monolayer."
          [48] "Over the latter catalysts, CO and CO2 originate mainly via consecutive C3H6 oxidation."
          [49] "Figure 1b illustrates selectivityconversion relationships in the ODP reaction over differently structured VOx species using N2O."
          [50] "As in the presence of O2 (Figure 1a), propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion with N2O, too."
          [51] "However, from the comparison of the results in Figure 1a and b, it is obvious that propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion."
          [52] "This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [53] "From a more detailed analysis of the data in Figure 1, the primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion) and the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx can be derived."
          [54] "These two parameters represent the catalyst activity for direct propane conversion to COx and for consecutive combustion of primarily formed propene, respectively."
          [55] "In the present paper, the dependence of S(C3H6) on X(C3H8) at low propane conversion (<10%) is described by a linear function in eq 1."
          [56] "where S(C3H6)initial and A are the primary propene selectivity and the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, respectively."
          [57] "According to this function, the primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx."
          [58] "This parameter is related to the catalyst activity for propene conversion to carbon oxides."
          [59] "The higher the slope of the function in eq 1, the faster the COx production from C3H6."
          [60] "Establishing the relationships between the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation and the structure of VOx species or the applied oxidizing agent is highly relevant for designing selective catalysts, since propene selectivity in the ODP reaction suffers mainly from the higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."
          [61] "Figure 2 compares the primary S(C3H6) and the catalyst ability (A) for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx over differently structured VOx species in the presence of O2 and N2O."
          [62] "For an O2-containing reaction feed (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40), it is clear that the primary propene selectivity is close for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, and VOx(2.8)/SiO2 materials but is significantly low over VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 (Figure 2 a)."
          [63] "From the characterization results in section 3.1, the latter material possesses microcrystalline V2O5 while other materials are free of microcrystalline V2O5 and possess highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx species."
          [64] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too."
          [65] "The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found:"
          [66] "The degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the same order (section 3.1)."
          [67] "Thus, the higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [68] "This conclusion is in agreement with literature data9 and with our recent results of the ODP reaction on VOx/γ-Al2O3.36"
          [69] "Further insights into the influence of oxidizing agent on product selectivity in the ODP reaction are derived from the analysis of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 ratios at different degrees of propane conversion."
          [70] "Table 1 represents these ratios at propane conversions of ca. 2 and 10%."
          [71] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."
          [72] "However, the ratio of CO2/C3H6 over polymerized VOx species increases from 0.04 to 0.13, while the ratio of CO/C3H6 decreases from 1.7 to 0.27, when N2O is used instead of O2."
          [73] "For both oxidizing agents, the ratios of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 increase with propane conversion, with the former increasing stronger."
          [74] "This increase is less pronounced for a feed with N2O."
          [75] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [76] "This effect is more pronounced for polymerized VOx species."
          [77] "Summarizing, two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [78] "To elucidate possible reasons of the influence of oxidizing agent on the ODP performance of highly dispersed VOx species and microcrystalline V2O5, in-situ UV/vis measurements were performed at 773 K."
          [79] "The degrees of propane and oxidant (O2 and N2O) conversion were controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS)."
          [80] "To ensure a near-to-uniform composition of the studied catalysts along the catalyst bed, propane and oxidant (O2 or N2O) conversions were kept below 5 and 10%, respectively."
          [81] "Figure 3 exemplifies in-situ UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 in oxidizing (O2/Ne = 20/80) and reducing (H2/N2 = 5/95 or C3H8/Ne = 40/60) atmospheres as well as in ODP feeds (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20)."
          [82] "The UV/vis spectrum in a flow of O2 with the absorption at 295 nm is characteristic for tetrahedrally coordinated V5+Ox species."
          [83] "The adsorption in the 400700 nm region (dd transitions of reduced vanadium species) increases upon switching from an O2 flow to a H2 flow (Figure 3a); the UV/vis bands of V4+ and V3+ species appear as broad features in the 400800 nm region (note the nonzero value of the absorption for the reduced samples in this region)."
          [84] "46,47 Similar changes were also observed when the oxidized catalyst was admitted to a C3H8 flow."
          [85] "Since no significant differences in the UV/vis spectra in H2 and C3H8 flows were observed (Figure 3a), the effect of possible carbon-containing deposits in the case of C3H8 flow on the interpretation of UV/vis data can therefore be neglected."
          [86] "Thus, the observed changes in the UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 upon switching from oxidizing to reducing flows reflect the changes in reduction degree of VOx species under different reaction conditions."
          [87] "Taking the above discussion into account, the UV/vis spectra in O2 (20% O2 in Ne) and C3H8 (40% C3H8 in Ne) flows represent oxidized and reduced states of VOx species, respectively."
          [88] "In the following, we compare UV/vis spectra under different ODP conditions (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) with the spectra of oxidized and reduced VOx species to derive insights into the reduction degree of VOx species under reaction conditions."
          [89] "One can see from Figure 3 that the UV/vis spectra during the ODP reaction with O2 (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40) and in an O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) flow are very similar."
          [90] "This means that the oxidation state of VOx species in both cases is close to 5+."
          [91] "However, there is a strong difference between the UV/vis spectra in O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows, while the UV/vis spectra in H2 (H2/N2 = 5/95) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows are very similar."
          [92] "This evidence that the oxidation state of VOx species under conditions of the ODP reaction with N2O (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%) is similar to the reduced one."
          [93] "This means that the oxidation state of vanadium in VOx species decreases from 5+ to 3+ and/or 4+ when the ODP reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2."
          [94] "Another interesting observation from Figure 3 is the appearance of a new band at 400450 nm in the UV/vis spectrum of VOx(2.8)/SiO2 in a C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [95] "A similar band was also identified over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 after 1030 min on stream in C3H8."
          [96] "To prove whether this band may belong to carbon deposits, we performed time-on-stream in-situ UV/vis tests over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 in a H2 flow (H2/N2 = 5/95)."
          [97] "The results are shown in Figure 4."
          [98] "One can see that the band at 400450 nm starts to appear after 10 min and becomes apparent after 30 min on stream in a H2 flow."
          [99] "Since this band appears in the absence of carbon-containing species, its appearance due to coke deposition can be safely excluded."
          [100] "Possible origins of this band are discussed as follows."
          [101] "It is well-known that nondehydrated VOx/silica materials possess octahedral coordinated VOx species, in which adsorbed water is a ligand."
          [102] "On the basis of this experimental fact, it can be suggested that water is formed upon reaction of VOx species over SiO2 and MCM-41 with H2 and adsorbs over reduced VOx species increasing their coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral."
          [103] "However, to draw a more definitive conclusion about the origins of the band at 400450 nm in H2 at 773 K, new additional experiments are required."
          [104] "It is also important to stress that there is no difference in the UV/vis spectra of VOx species under oxidizing conditions before and after treatments in H2 (Figure 4)."
          [105] "Similar results were obtained for all the oxidizing/reduction/reaction cycles described in Figure 3."
          [106] "This means that VOx species remain highly dispersed during the applied treatments and time-on-stream operation."
          [107] "To check if O2 and N2O show different ability (activity) for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species, in-situ UV/vis tests were performed in a transient mode."
          [108] "In these experiments, the oxidized sample was reduced in a flow of C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) at 773 K for 10 min followed by flushing in a Ne flow for 1 min and feeding an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) over the reduced catalyst."
          [109] "The sample was kept in this flow for 30 min to reoxidate reduced VOx species."
          [110] "Hereafter, the reoxidized catalyst was again reduced in C3H8 followed by its reoxidation in a N2O (N2O/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [111] "In all the above experiments, UV/vis spectra from 200 to 800 nm and KubelkaMunk at 700 nm were recorded every 20 and 5 s, respectively."
          [112] "The respective results are summarized in Figure 5 and Figure 6."
          [113] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."
          [114] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."
          [115] "More detailed insights into the kinetics of reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 and reoxidation of reduced ones by O2 and N2O were derived from the analysis of temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function in Figure 6."
          [116] "At time zero, we switched from an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) to a C3H8 flow (C3H8/Ne = 40/60)."
          [117] "As result, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm increases from 0 (fully oxidized VOx species) and reaches a constant value of ca. 0.2 after 5 min on C3H8 stream."
          [118] "Similar changes were observed when H2 was used as a reducing agent instead of C3H8."
          [119] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed changes are due to the reduction of oxidized VOx species by propane and are not due to deposition of carbon-containing species in the case of C3H8."
          [120] "To prove whether the reduction/reoxidation of VOx species is a reversible process, an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) was fed over the reduced sample (at ca. 10 min in Figure 6) followed by C3H8 feeding (at ca. 22 min in Figure 6)."
          [121] "As shown in Figure 6, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm falls from ca. 0.2 to 0 after a few seconds in the O2 flow and reversibly increases to 0.2 in the C3H8 flow."
          [122] "Two important conclusions were derived: (1) reduction/oxidation of VOx species is a reversible process and (2) reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 is slower than reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2."
          [123] "When N2O was used for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species (ca. 3240 min in Figure 6), these species were also reoxidized."
          [124] "However, the temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm are slower than those with O2."
          [125] "From this difference in the temporal profiles, it is concluded that the reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O is slower than by O2."
          [126] "Similar results were obtained for other catalytic materials studied."
          [127] "Taking the difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [128] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [129] "The effect of oxygen species (lattice oxygen or adsorbed) on the ODP reaction was studied by pulsing a mixture of propane and labeled oxygen (18O2) over the catalyst, which was preoxidized by 16O2."
          [130] "COx products containing different oxygen isotopes (16O and 18O) were detected at the reactor outlet."
          [131] "Their transient responses are presented in Figure 7 in a height-normalized form for better comparison of their pulse shapes."
          [132] "The presence of 16O (not pulsed gas-phase oxygen) in CO and CO2 evidences the participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species in combustion of C3H8/C3H6."
          [133] "This result is very similar to previous reported ones over various vanadium-based catalytic materials.27,48,49"
          [134] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
          [135] "However, the concentration of CO2 and CO formed with participation of labeled oxygen (C18O2, C18O16O, and C18O) was significantly lower than C16O2 and C16O."
          [136] "This indicates that C16O and C16O2 are the main COx products."
          [137] "In other words, lattice oxygen of VOx species is mainly responsible for COx formation."
          [138] "Adsorbed oxygen species formed from gas-phase labeled (18O2) oxygen play only a minor role in COx formation under transient vacuum conditions."
          [139] "This may be because the concentration of lattice nonlabeled oxygen in VOx species is considerably higher than that of labeled oxygen in the C3H818O2 pulse."
          [140] "The ratio of vanadium to the amount of 18O2 in one pulse was estimated as ca. 5·104."
          [141] "However, the contribution of adsorbed oxygen species to the formation of COx can be significantly higher under ambient-pressure conditions."
          [142] "We would like to emphasize that no labeled oxygen species in COx was observed in our previous experiments over VOx/γ-Al2O3 under similar conditions in the TAP reactor.27"
          [143] "This can be explained by the fact that incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into VOx species occurs considerably faster over VOx/γ-Al2O3 as compared to SiO2-based catalysts."
          [144] "This assumption is indirectly supported by the recently reported results of the ODP reaction over VOx/Al2O3 50 and VOx/SiO2 51 in cofeed (O2 and C3H8 are fed together) and cyclic (O2 and C3H8 are fed separately and periodically) modes."
          [145] "No substantial differences in propene selectivity between the cofeed and cyclic conditions were found over the alumina-based catalysts, while propene selectivity over the silica-based one was significantly improved when the ODP reaction was performed under the cyclic conditions."
          [146] "In the latter case, the negative effect of adsorbed oxygen species on propene selectivity could be avoided."
          [147] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O."
          [148] "According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [149] "The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2."
          [150] "The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [151] "Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [152] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."
          [153] "The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
          [154] "This is essential for achieving high primary propene selectivity and for suppressing consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2 as shown in Figure 2."
          [155] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
          [156] "Since 710 oxygen atoms are required for COx formation from propane/propene but only one for propene formation, nonselective propane/propene oxidation to COx will be inhibited upon increasing degree of reduction of VOx species."
          [157] "However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for superior performance of N2O as compared to O2."
          [158] "On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."
          [159] "It is well-known 52 that O2 adsorption over reducible metal oxides occurs via a complex sequence of redox processes until O2- (lattice oxygen) is formed."
          [160] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that gas-phase oxygen adsorbs molecularly over anion vacancy of reduced VOx species. 53,54"
          [161] "This biatomic adsorbed oxygen dissociates further yielding lattice oxygen species."
          [162] "Adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species were suggested to be nonselective ones for the ODP reaction over VMgO 55,56 and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 57 catalytic materials."
          [163] "In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O- or O2-, which are considered as selective ones.52"
          [164] "Further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations are in progress with the aim to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species."

[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
          [4] "Taking into account the precision in the measurements, in- troduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes."
          [5] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged."
          [6] "For pure NiMoO4, addition of 300 ppm N2O leads to (Table 2): (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an increase in the selectivity to propylene (+32%), (iii) a decrease in both the conversion of oxygen (19%) and the yield of CO2 (21%)."
          [7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
          [8] "These results could indicate that -Sb2O4 and N2O could probably play the same role, namely, control- ling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction, inhibit- ing non-selective sites."
          [9] "The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products."
          [10] "N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
          [11] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
          [12] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeo- lites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM- 5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
          [2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [5] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxidation, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)."
          [7] "The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products with a prolongation of contact time supports this explanation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indicating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream."
          [8] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."

[1] "N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."
          [2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state."
          [3] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [4] "The Oproduced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene."
          [5] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi- cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain- ing materials [13,2123]."
          [2] "A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24]."
          [3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxida- tion of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.

          [6] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
          [7] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration re- mained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites were present."
          [8] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida- tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."
          [9] "In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation."
          [10] "However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
          [11] "Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to ob- tain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O."
          [12] "The same VOx/ MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane [13,14]."
          [13] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol 1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxi- dizing agent."
          [14] "In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher,amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."
          [15] "Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."

[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"
          [3] "A major draw- back of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, al- though the original catalytic activity was completely recov- ered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003)."
          [4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
          [5] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."
          [6] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

          [4] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
          [5] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."

          [16] "This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
          [17] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
          [18] "This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by Bula nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of 3001200 ppm."
          [19] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."

          [21] "A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie- Fe-Z."
          [22] "It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction."

[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas."

          [3] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."
          [4] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."
          [5] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
          [2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
          [3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
          [4] "We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."
          [6] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
          [7] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."
          [8] "One alternative explanation could be the fact that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, so leading to a lower conversion, while selectivity increases."
          [9] "The results obtained when the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4 were similar, but less significant (when 1 vol.% N2O is added,conversion decreases from 7.5 to 4.3% and selectivity increases from 34.8 to 41.9%)."
          [10] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 cat- alyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2)."
          [11] "In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%,respectively."
          [12] "However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%)."
          [13] "This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O."
          [14] "Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst."
          [15] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon."
          [16] "This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable."
          [17] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."
          [18] "N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explain- ing the high carbon formation."
          [19] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
          [2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
          [3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
          [4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
          [5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
          [6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."
          [7] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
          [8] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation.
          The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane.
          A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature.
          The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4).
          Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O.
          The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx.
          Such intermediates appear to be essential for propene production. Accordingly, the performance of FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated ODH of propane is severely deteriorated in the presence of small amounts of O2.
          Because the initial ODHP performance was recovered upon air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles has been evaluated.
          The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may also explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K.
          The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2.
          The efficient utilization of N2O in tail-gases should involve a previous purification step. As shown here, the presence of O2 (a typical component of tail-gases) has a negative impact on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5.



[1] "Recently, it has been pro- posed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted con- siderable attention [213]."
          [2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."
          [3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
          [4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination."
          [5] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."
          [6] "In the case of the ODHP with N2O, the presence of the propane reductant in the reaction system makes the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites much more complicated."
          [7] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mecha- nism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O."
          [8] "Accordingly, there is no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
          [3] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
          [4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective ox- idation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

For all V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion.
          The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as com- pared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction.
          There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant.
          In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2.
          The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx.
          The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2.
          From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
          [4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."
          [5] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."
          [6] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [7] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
          [8] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
          [9] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
          [10] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
          [11] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
          [12] "Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
          [13] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O. Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5. The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2. The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [6] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."

          [10] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [11] "The higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [12] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."

          [23] "On the basis of the obtained densities and the literature9 values for a vanadium monolayer (57 V/nm2), it can be safely concluded that all catalytic materials, except for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, possess VOx species below one vanadium monolayer."

          [27] "According to the literature data,37,42,43 the peak at 864 K could be due to the presence of highly polymerized VOx species or crystalline V2O5."

          [43] "The obtained selectivityconversion relationships with O2 are summarized in Figure 1."
          [44] "Propene selectivity decreases, while CO and CO2 selectivities (the data are not shown) increase with an increase in the degree of propane conversion."
          [45] "Such behavior is explained by consecutive oxidation of the primarily formed propene to carbon oxides."
          [46] "For the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, the low propene selectivity at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion is an indication for catalytic activity toward direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to carbon oxides."
          [47] "This reaction pathway does not play any significant role over other catalytic materials with vanadium loading below one monolayer."
          [48] "Over the latter catalysts, CO and CO2 originate mainly via consecutive C3H6 oxidation."
          [49] "Figure 1b illustrates selectivityconversion relationships in the ODP reaction over differently structured VOx species using N2O."
          [50] "As in the presence of O2 (Figure 1a), propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion with N2O, too."
          [51] "However, from the comparison of the results in Figure 1a and b, it is obvious that propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion."
          [52] "This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [53] "From a more detailed analysis of the data in Figure 1, the primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion) and the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx can be derived."
          [54] "These two parameters represent the catalyst activity for direct propane conversion to COx and for consecutive combustion of primarily formed propene, respectively."
          [55] "In the present paper, the dependence of S(C3H6) on X(C3H8) at low propane conversion (<10%) is described by a linear function in eq 1."
          [56] "where S(C3H6)initial and A are the primary propene selectivity and the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, respectively."
          [57] "According to this function, the primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx."
          [58] "This parameter is related to the catalyst activity for propene conversion to carbon oxides."
          [59] "The higher the slope of the function in eq 1, the faster the COx production from C3H6."
          [60] "Establishing the relationships between the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation and the structure of VOx species or the applied oxidizing agent is highly relevant for designing selective catalysts, since propene selectivity in the ODP reaction suffers mainly from the higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."
          [61] "Figure 2 compares the primary S(C3H6) and the catalyst ability (A) for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx over differently structured VOx species in the presence of O2 and N2O."
          [62] "For an O2-containing reaction feed (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40), it is clear that the primary propene selectivity is close for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, and VOx(2.8)/SiO2 materials but is significantly low over VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 (Figure 2 a)."
          [63] "From the characterization results in section 3.1, the latter material possesses microcrystalline V2O5 while other materials are free of microcrystalline V2O5 and possess highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx species."
          [64] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too."
          [65] "The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found:"
          [66] "The degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the same order (section 3.1)."
          [67] "Thus, the higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [68] "This conclusion is in agreement with literature data9 and with our recent results of the ODP reaction on VOx/γ-Al2O3.36"
          [69] "Further insights into the influence of oxidizing agent on product selectivity in the ODP reaction are derived from the analysis of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 ratios at different degrees of propane conversion."
          [70] "Table 1 represents these ratios at propane conversions of ca. 2 and 10%."
          [71] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."
          [72] "However, the ratio of CO2/C3H6 over polymerized VOx species increases from 0.04 to 0.13, while the ratio of CO/C3H6 decreases from 1.7 to 0.27, when N2O is used instead of O2."
          [73] "For both oxidizing agents, the ratios of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 increase with propane conversion, with the former increasing stronger."
          [74] "This increase is less pronounced for a feed with N2O."
          [75] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [76] "This effect is more pronounced for polymerized VOx species."
          [77] "Summarizing, two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [78] "To elucidate possible reasons of the influence of oxidizing agent on the ODP performance of highly dispersed VOx species and microcrystalline V2O5, in-situ UV/vis measurements were performed at 773 K."
          [79] "The degrees of propane and oxidant (O2 and N2O) conversion were controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS)."
          [80] "To ensure a near-to-uniform composition of the studied catalysts along the catalyst bed, propane and oxidant (O2 or N2O) conversions were kept below 5 and 10%, respectively."
          [81] "Figure 3 exemplifies in-situ UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 in oxidizing (O2/Ne = 20/80) and reducing (H2/N2 = 5/95 or C3H8/Ne = 40/60) atmospheres as well as in ODP feeds (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20)."
          [82] "The UV/vis spectrum in a flow of O2 with the absorption at 295 nm is characteristic for tetrahedrally coordinated V5+Ox species."
          [83] "The adsorption in the 400700 nm region (dd transitions of reduced vanadium species) increases upon switching from an O2 flow to a H2 flow (Figure 3a); the UV/vis bands of V4+ and V3+ species appear as broad features in the 400800 nm region (note the nonzero value of the absorption for the reduced samples in this region)."
          [84] "46,47 Similar changes were also observed when the oxidized catalyst was admitted to a C3H8 flow."
          [85] "Since no significant differences in the UV/vis spectra in H2 and C3H8 flows were observed (Figure 3a), the effect of possible carbon-containing deposits in the case of C3H8 flow on the interpretation of UV/vis data can therefore be neglected."
          [86] "Thus, the observed changes in the UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 upon switching from oxidizing to reducing flows reflect the changes in reduction degree of VOx species under different reaction conditions."
          [87] "Taking the above discussion into account, the UV/vis spectra in O2 (20% O2 in Ne) and C3H8 (40% C3H8 in Ne) flows represent oxidized and reduced states of VOx species, respectively."
          [88] "In the following, we compare UV/vis spectra under different ODP conditions (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) with the spectra of oxidized and reduced VOx species to derive insights into the reduction degree of VOx species under reaction conditions."
          [89] "One can see from Figure 3 that the UV/vis spectra during the ODP reaction with O2 (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40) and in an O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) flow are very similar."
          [90] "This means that the oxidation state of VOx species in both cases is close to 5+."
          [91] "However, there is a strong difference between the UV/vis spectra in O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows, while the UV/vis spectra in H2 (H2/N2 = 5/95) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows are very similar."
          [92] "This evidence that the oxidation state of VOx species under conditions of the ODP reaction with N2O (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%) is similar to the reduced one."
          [93] "This means that the oxidation state of vanadium in VOx species decreases from 5+ to 3+ and/or 4+ when the ODP reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2."
          [94] "Another interesting observation from Figure 3 is the appearance of a new band at 400450 nm in the UV/vis spectrum of VOx(2.8)/SiO2 in a C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [95] "A similar band was also identified over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 after 1030 min on stream in C3H8."
          [96] "To prove whether this band may belong to carbon deposits, we performed time-on-stream in-situ UV/vis tests over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 in a H2 flow (H2/N2 = 5/95)."
          [97] "The results are shown in Figure 4."
          [98] "One can see that the band at 400450 nm starts to appear after 10 min and becomes apparent after 30 min on stream in a H2 flow."
          [99] "Since this band appears in the absence of carbon-containing species, its appearance due to coke deposition can be safely excluded."
          [100] "Possible origins of this band are discussed as follows."
          [101] "It is well-known that nondehydrated VOx/silica materials possess octahedral coordinated VOx species, in which adsorbed water is a ligand."
          [102] "On the basis of this experimental fact, it can be suggested that water is formed upon reaction of VOx species over SiO2 and MCM-41 with H2 and adsorbs over reduced VOx species increasing their coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral."
          [103] "However, to draw a more definitive conclusion about the origins of the band at 400450 nm in H2 at 773 K, new additional experiments are required."
          [104] "It is also important to stress that there is no difference in the UV/vis spectra of VOx species under oxidizing conditions before and after treatments in H2 (Figure 4)."
          [105] "Similar results were obtained for all the oxidizing/reduction/reaction cycles described in Figure 3."
          [106] "This means that VOx species remain highly dispersed during the applied treatments and time-on-stream operation."
          [107] "To check if O2 and N2O show different ability (activity) for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species, in-situ UV/vis tests were performed in a transient mode."
          [108] "In these experiments, the oxidized sample was reduced in a flow of C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) at 773 K for 10 min followed by flushing in a Ne flow for 1 min and feeding an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) over the reduced catalyst."
          [109] "The sample was kept in this flow for 30 min to reoxidate reduced VOx species."
          [110] "Hereafter, the reoxidized catalyst was again reduced in C3H8 followed by its reoxidation in a N2O (N2O/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [111] "In all the above experiments, UV/vis spectra from 200 to 800 nm and KubelkaMunk at 700 nm were recorded every 20 and 5 s, respectively."
          [112] "The respective results are summarized in Figure 5 and Figure 6."
          [113] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."
          [114] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."
          [115] "More detailed insights into the kinetics of reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 and reoxidation of reduced ones by O2 and N2O were derived from the analysis of temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function in Figure 6."
          [116] "At time zero, we switched from an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) to a C3H8 flow (C3H8/Ne = 40/60)."
          [117] "As result, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm increases from 0 (fully oxidized VOx species) and reaches a constant value of ca. 0.2 after 5 min on C3H8 stream."
          [118] "Similar changes were observed when H2 was used as a reducing agent instead of C3H8."
          [119] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed changes are due to the reduction of oxidized VOx species by propane and are not due to deposition of carbon-containing species in the case of C3H8."
          [120] "To prove whether the reduction/reoxidation of VOx species is a reversible process, an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) was fed over the reduced sample (at ca. 10 min in Figure 6) followed by C3H8 feeding (at ca. 22 min in Figure 6)."
          [121] "As shown in Figure 6, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm falls from ca. 0.2 to 0 after a few seconds in the O2 flow and reversibly increases to 0.2 in the C3H8 flow."
          [122] "Two important conclusions were derived: (1) reduction/oxidation of VOx species is a reversible process and (2) reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 is slower than reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2."
          [123] "When N2O was used for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species (ca. 3240 min in Figure 6), these species were also reoxidized."
          [124] "However, the temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm are slower than those with O2."
          [125] "From this difference in the temporal profiles, it is concluded that the reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O is slower than by O2."
          [126] "Similar results were obtained for other catalytic materials studied."
          [127] "Taking the difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [128] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [129] "The effect of oxygen species (lattice oxygen or adsorbed) on the ODP reaction was studied by pulsing a mixture of propane and labeled oxygen (18O2) over the catalyst, which was preoxidized by 16O2."
          [130] "COx products containing different oxygen isotopes (16O and 18O) were detected at the reactor outlet."
          [131] "Their transient responses are presented in Figure 7 in a height-normalized form for better comparison of their pulse shapes."
          [132] "The presence of 16O (not pulsed gas-phase oxygen) in CO and CO2 evidences the participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species in combustion of C3H8/C3H6."
          [133] "This result is very similar to previous reported ones over various vanadium-based catalytic materials.27,48,49"
          [134] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
          [135] "However, the concentration of CO2 and CO formed with participation of labeled oxygen (C18O2, C18O16O, and C18O) was significantly lower than C16O2 and C16O."
          [136] "This indicates that C16O and C16O2 are the main COx products."
          [137] "In other words, lattice oxygen of VOx species is mainly responsible for COx formation."
          [138] "Adsorbed oxygen species formed from gas-phase labeled (18O2) oxygen play only a minor role in COx formation under transient vacuum conditions."
          [139] "This may be because the concentration of lattice nonlabeled oxygen in VOx species is considerably higher than that of labeled oxygen in the C3H818O2 pulse."
          [140] "The ratio of vanadium to the amount of 18O2 in one pulse was estimated as ca. 5·104."
          [141] "However, the contribution of adsorbed oxygen species to the formation of COx can be significantly higher under ambient-pressure conditions."
          [142] "We would like to emphasize that no labeled oxygen species in COx was observed in our previous experiments over VOx/γ-Al2O3 under similar conditions in the TAP reactor.27"
          [143] "This can be explained by the fact that incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into VOx species occurs considerably faster over VOx/γ-Al2O3 as compared to SiO2-based catalysts."
          [144] "This assumption is indirectly supported by the recently reported results of the ODP reaction over VOx/Al2O3 50 and VOx/SiO2 51 in cofeed (O2 and C3H8 are fed together) and cyclic (O2 and C3H8 are fed separately and periodically) modes."
          [145] "No substantial differences in propene selectivity between the cofeed and cyclic conditions were found over the alumina-based catalysts, while propene selectivity over the silica-based one was significantly improved when the ODP reaction was performed under the cyclic conditions."
          [146] "In the latter case, the negative effect of adsorbed oxygen species on propene selectivity could be avoided."
          [147] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O."
          [148] "According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [149] "The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2."
          [150] "The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [151] "Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [152] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."
          [153] "The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
          [154] "This is essential for achieving high primary propene selectivity and for suppressing consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2 as shown in Figure 2."
          [155] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
          [156] "Since 710 oxygen atoms are required for COx formation from propane/propene but only one for propene formation, nonselective propane/propene oxidation to COx will be inhibited upon increasing degree of reduction of VOx species."
          [157] "However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for superior performance of N2O as compared to O2."
          [158] "On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."
          [159] "It is well-known 52 that O2 adsorption over reducible metal oxides occurs via a complex sequence of redox processes until O2- (lattice oxygen) is formed."
          [160] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that gas-phase oxygen adsorbs molecularly over anion vacancy of reduced VOx species. 53,54"
          [161] "This biatomic adsorbed oxygen dissociates further yielding lattice oxygen species."
          [162] "Adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species were suggested to be nonselective ones for the ODP reaction over VMgO 55,56 and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 57 catalytic materials."
          [163] "In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O- or O2-, which are considered as selective ones.52"
          [164] "Further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations are in progress with the aim to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species."

[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
          [4] "Taking into account the precision in the measurements, in- troduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes."
          [5] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged."
          [6] "For pure NiMoO4, addition of 300 ppm N2O leads to (Table 2): (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an increase in the selectivity to propylene (+32%), (iii) a decrease in both the conversion of oxygen (19%) and the yield of CO2 (21%)."
          [7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
          [8] "These results could indicate that -Sb2O4 and N2O could probably play the same role, namely, control- ling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction, inhibit- ing non-selective sites."
          [9] "The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products."
          [10] "N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
          [11] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
          [12] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeo- lites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM- 5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
          [2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [5] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxidation, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)."
          [7] "The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products with a prolongation of contact time supports this explanation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indicating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream."
          [8] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."

[1] "N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."
          [2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state."
          [3] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [4] "The Oproduced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene."
          [5] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi- cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain- ing materials [13,2123]."
          [2] "A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24]."
          [3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxida- tion of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.

          [6] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
          [7] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration re- mained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites were present."
          [8] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida- tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."
          [9] "In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation."
          [10] "However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
          [11] "Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to ob- tain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O."
          [12] "The same VOx/ MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane [13,14]."
          [13] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol 1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxi- dizing agent."
          [14] "In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher,amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."
          [15] "Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."

[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"
          [3] "A major draw- back of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, al- though the original catalytic activity was completely recov- ered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003)."
          [4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
          [5] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."
          [6] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

          [6] "To gain a better under- standing of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air,complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed."

          [9] "To the best of our knowledge, in situ in- vestigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported."

          [4] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
          [5] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."

          [9] "The time and degree of deactivation in Fig. 2 depend on the catalyst in question."
          [10] "The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample."
          [11] "The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored."
          [12] "The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2)."
          [13] "The propylene yield is significantly higher in st-H-Z than in c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples is rather similar (especially after 40 min on stream)."
          [14] "This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed performance."
          [15] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5."
          [16] "This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
          [17] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
          [18] "This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by Bula nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of 3001200 ppm."
          [19] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."
          [20] "Our results show that deactivation is slower over the steam- activated zeolites (Fig. 2), with a significantly reduced number of Brnsted sites as a consequence of the steam treatment [21]."
          [21] "A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie- Fe-Z."
          [22] "It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction."
          [23] "Further research is required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP."

[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas."
          [2] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."
          [3] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."
          [4] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."
          [5] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
          [2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
          [3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
          [4] "We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."
          [6] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
          [7] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."
          [8] "One alternative explanation could be the fact that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, so leading to a lower conversion, while selectivity increases."
          [9] "The results obtained when the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4 were similar, but less significant (when 1 vol.% N2O is added,conversion decreases from 7.5 to 4.3% and selectivity increases from 34.8 to 41.9%)."
          [10] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 cat- alyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2)."
          [11] "In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%,respectively."
          [12] "However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%)."
          [13] "This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O."
          [14] "Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst."
          [15] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon."
          [16] "This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable."
          [17] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."
          [18] "N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explain- ing the high carbon formation."
          [19] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
          [2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
          [3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
          [4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
          [5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
          [6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."
          [7] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
          [8] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation.
          The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane.
          A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature.
          The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4).
          Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O.
          The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx.
          Such intermediates appear to be essential for propene production. Accordingly, the performance of FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated ODH of propane is severely deteriorated in the presence of small amounts of O2.
          Because the initial ODHP performance was recovered upon air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles has been evaluated.
          The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may also explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K.
          The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2.
          The efficient utilization of N2O in tail-gases should involve a previous purification step. As shown here, the presence of O2 (a typical component of tail-gases) has a negative impact on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5.



[1] "Recently, it has been pro- posed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted con- siderable attention [213]."
          [2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."
          [3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
          [4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination."
          [5] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."
          [6] "In the case of the ODHP with N2O, the presence of the propane reductant in the reaction system makes the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites much more complicated."
          [7] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mecha- nism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O."
          [8] "Accordingly, there is no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
          [3] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
          [4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective ox- idation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

For all V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion.
          The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as com- pared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction.
          There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant.
          In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2.
          The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx.
          The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2.
          From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
          [4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."
          [5] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."
          [6] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [7] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
          [8] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
          [9] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
          [10] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
          [11] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
          [12] "Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
          [13] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O. Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5. The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2. The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [6] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."

          [9] "The primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [10] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [11] "The higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [12] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."

          [18] "As reported in ref 20, the pore structure of MCM-41 is completely destroyed in this sample."
          [19] "Small V2O5 crystallites were observed in this sample by means of ex-situ XRD analysis."
          [20] "The XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to ca. 5 wt % do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase."
          [21] "Additional UV/vis and Raman spectroscopic characterization studies (the data are not shown for brevity) did not indicate a possible presence of XRD-amorphous crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles for samples possessing up to 5.3 wt % vanadium."
          [22] "The calculated vanadium surface densities are 0.37, 0.6, 1.38, and 25.4 for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, VOx(2.9)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, respectively."
          [23] "On the basis of the obtained densities and the literature9 values for a vanadium monolayer (57 V/nm2), it can be safely concluded that all catalytic materials, except for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, possess VOx species below one vanadium monolayer."
          [24] "A single maximum of H2 consumption at ca. 801 and 806 K was observed upon reduction of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 and VOx (2.8)/SiO2, respectively."
          [25] "Additionally to the maximal H2 consumption at 810 K, a small shoulder at ca. 860 K was identified in the TPR profile of the VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 sample."
          [26] "This shoulder becomes more pronounced for the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where crystalline V2O5 phase was identified by XRD analysis."
          [27] "According to the literature data,37,42,43 the peak at 864 K could be due to the presence of highly polymerized VOx species or crystalline V2O5."
          [28] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material at apparent surface vanadium densities below one monolayer."
          [29] "The relative degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the order"
          [30] "The VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possesses microcrystalline V2O5 phase."

          [33] "Since the amount of N2O was double that of O2, both of the above reaction feeds contained the same amount of oxygen atoms."
          [34] "This allows the comparison of the influence of oxidizing agents on the ODP reaction."

          [36] "The TOF values were calculated taking the total amount of vanadium atoms into account."
          [37] "This table illustrates that the catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples."
          [38] "This may be due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species over the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst as shown in section 3.1."
          [39] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
          [40] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."
          [41] "For establishing overall mechanistic scheme of the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O over VOx species of different degrees of polymerization, catalytic performance (product selectivity) was determined at different contact times, that is, different degrees of propane conversion."
          [42] "This knowledge is of high importance for catalyst designing, because it provides essential information on the sequence of product formation, that is, the catalyst ability for C3H8 conversion to C3H6 and COx as well as for consecutive C3H6 combustion."
          [43] "The obtained selectivityconversion relationships with O2 are summarized in Figure 1."
          [44] "Propene selectivity decreases, while CO and CO2 selectivities (the data are not shown) increase with an increase in the degree of propane conversion."
          [45] "Such behavior is explained by consecutive oxidation of the primarily formed propene to carbon oxides."
          [46] "For the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, the low propene selectivity at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion is an indication for catalytic activity toward direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to carbon oxides."
          [47] "This reaction pathway does not play any significant role over other catalytic materials with vanadium loading below one monolayer."
          [48] "Over the latter catalysts, CO and CO2 originate mainly via consecutive C3H6 oxidation."
          [49] "Figure 1b illustrates selectivityconversion relationships in the ODP reaction over differently structured VOx species using N2O."
          [50] "As in the presence of O2 (Figure 1a), propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion with N2O, too."
          [51] "However, from the comparison of the results in Figure 1a and b, it is obvious that propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion."
          [52] "This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [53] "From a more detailed analysis of the data in Figure 1, the primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion) and the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx can be derived."
          [54] "These two parameters represent the catalyst activity for direct propane conversion to COx and for consecutive combustion of primarily formed propene, respectively."
          [55] "In the present paper, the dependence of S(C3H6) on X(C3H8) at low propane conversion (<10%) is described by a linear function in eq 1."
          [56] "where S(C3H6)initial and A are the primary propene selectivity and the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, respectively."
          [57] "According to this function, the primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx."
          [58] "This parameter is related to the catalyst activity for propene conversion to carbon oxides."
          [59] "The higher the slope of the function in eq 1, the faster the COx production from C3H6."
          [60] "Establishing the relationships between the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation and the structure of VOx species or the applied oxidizing agent is highly relevant for designing selective catalysts, since propene selectivity in the ODP reaction suffers mainly from the higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."
          [61] "Figure 2 compares the primary S(C3H6) and the catalyst ability (A) for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx over differently structured VOx species in the presence of O2 and N2O."
          [62] "For an O2-containing reaction feed (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40), it is clear that the primary propene selectivity is close for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, and VOx(2.8)/SiO2 materials but is significantly low over VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 (Figure 2 a)."
          [63] "From the characterization results in section 3.1, the latter material possesses microcrystalline V2O5 while other materials are free of microcrystalline V2O5 and possess highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx species."
          [64] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too."
          [65] "The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found:"
          [66] "The degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the same order (section 3.1)."
          [67] "Thus, the higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [68] "This conclusion is in agreement with literature data9 and with our recent results of the ODP reaction on VOx/γ-Al2O3.36"
          [69] "Further insights into the influence of oxidizing agent on product selectivity in the ODP reaction are derived from the analysis of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 ratios at different degrees of propane conversion."
          [70] "Table 1 represents these ratios at propane conversions of ca. 2 and 10%."
          [71] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."
          [72] "However, the ratio of CO2/C3H6 over polymerized VOx species increases from 0.04 to 0.13, while the ratio of CO/C3H6 decreases from 1.7 to 0.27, when N2O is used instead of O2."
          [73] "For both oxidizing agents, the ratios of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 increase with propane conversion, with the former increasing stronger."
          [74] "This increase is less pronounced for a feed with N2O."
          [75] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [76] "This effect is more pronounced for polymerized VOx species."
          [77] "Summarizing, two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [78] "To elucidate possible reasons of the influence of oxidizing agent on the ODP performance of highly dispersed VOx species and microcrystalline V2O5, in-situ UV/vis measurements were performed at 773 K."
          [79] "The degrees of propane and oxidant (O2 and N2O) conversion were controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS)."
          [80] "To ensure a near-to-uniform composition of the studied catalysts along the catalyst bed, propane and oxidant (O2 or N2O) conversions were kept below 5 and 10%, respectively."
          [81] "Figure 3 exemplifies in-situ UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 in oxidizing (O2/Ne = 20/80) and reducing (H2/N2 = 5/95 or C3H8/Ne = 40/60) atmospheres as well as in ODP feeds (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20)."
          [82] "The UV/vis spectrum in a flow of O2 with the absorption at 295 nm is characteristic for tetrahedrally coordinated V5+Ox species."
          [83] "The adsorption in the 400700 nm region (dd transitions of reduced vanadium species) increases upon switching from an O2 flow to a H2 flow (Figure 3a); the UV/vis bands of V4+ and V3+ species appear as broad features in the 400800 nm region (note the nonzero value of the absorption for the reduced samples in this region)."
          [84] "46,47 Similar changes were also observed when the oxidized catalyst was admitted to a C3H8 flow."
          [85] "Since no significant differences in the UV/vis spectra in H2 and C3H8 flows were observed (Figure 3a), the effect of possible carbon-containing deposits in the case of C3H8 flow on the interpretation of UV/vis data can therefore be neglected."
          [86] "Thus, the observed changes in the UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 upon switching from oxidizing to reducing flows reflect the changes in reduction degree of VOx species under different reaction conditions."
          [87] "Taking the above discussion into account, the UV/vis spectra in O2 (20% O2 in Ne) and C3H8 (40% C3H8 in Ne) flows represent oxidized and reduced states of VOx species, respectively."
          [88] "In the following, we compare UV/vis spectra under different ODP conditions (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) with the spectra of oxidized and reduced VOx species to derive insights into the reduction degree of VOx species under reaction conditions."
          [89] "One can see from Figure 3 that the UV/vis spectra during the ODP reaction with O2 (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40) and in an O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) flow are very similar."
          [90] "This means that the oxidation state of VOx species in both cases is close to 5+."
          [91] "However, there is a strong difference between the UV/vis spectra in O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows, while the UV/vis spectra in H2 (H2/N2 = 5/95) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows are very similar."
          [92] "This evidence that the oxidation state of VOx species under conditions of the ODP reaction with N2O (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%) is similar to the reduced one."
          [93] "This means that the oxidation state of vanadium in VOx species decreases from 5+ to 3+ and/or 4+ when the ODP reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2."
          [94] "Another interesting observation from Figure 3 is the appearance of a new band at 400450 nm in the UV/vis spectrum of VOx(2.8)/SiO2 in a C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [95] "A similar band was also identified over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 after 1030 min on stream in C3H8."
          [96] "To prove whether this band may belong to carbon deposits, we performed time-on-stream in-situ UV/vis tests over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 in a H2 flow (H2/N2 = 5/95)."
          [97] "The results are shown in Figure 4."
          [98] "One can see that the band at 400450 nm starts to appear after 10 min and becomes apparent after 30 min on stream in a H2 flow."
          [99] "Since this band appears in the absence of carbon-containing species, its appearance due to coke deposition can be safely excluded."
          [100] "Possible origins of this band are discussed as follows."
          [101] "It is well-known that nondehydrated VOx/silica materials possess octahedral coordinated VOx species, in which adsorbed water is a ligand."
          [102] "On the basis of this experimental fact, it can be suggested that water is formed upon reaction of VOx species over SiO2 and MCM-41 with H2 and adsorbs over reduced VOx species increasing their coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral."
          [103] "However, to draw a more definitive conclusion about the origins of the band at 400450 nm in H2 at 773 K, new additional experiments are required."
          [104] "It is also important to stress that there is no difference in the UV/vis spectra of VOx species under oxidizing conditions before and after treatments in H2 (Figure 4)."
          [105] "Similar results were obtained for all the oxidizing/reduction/reaction cycles described in Figure 3."
          [106] "This means that VOx species remain highly dispersed during the applied treatments and time-on-stream operation."
          [107] "To check if O2 and N2O show different ability (activity) for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species, in-situ UV/vis tests were performed in a transient mode."
          [108] "In these experiments, the oxidized sample was reduced in a flow of C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) at 773 K for 10 min followed by flushing in a Ne flow for 1 min and feeding an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) over the reduced catalyst."
          [109] "The sample was kept in this flow for 30 min to reoxidate reduced VOx species."
          [110] "Hereafter, the reoxidized catalyst was again reduced in C3H8 followed by its reoxidation in a N2O (N2O/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [111] "In all the above experiments, UV/vis spectra from 200 to 800 nm and KubelkaMunk at 700 nm were recorded every 20 and 5 s, respectively."
          [112] "The respective results are summarized in Figure 5 and Figure 6."
          [113] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."
          [114] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."
          [115] "More detailed insights into the kinetics of reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 and reoxidation of reduced ones by O2 and N2O were derived from the analysis of temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function in Figure 6."
          [116] "At time zero, we switched from an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) to a C3H8 flow (C3H8/Ne = 40/60)."
          [117] "As result, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm increases from 0 (fully oxidized VOx species) and reaches a constant value of ca. 0.2 after 5 min on C3H8 stream."
          [118] "Similar changes were observed when H2 was used as a reducing agent instead of C3H8."
          [119] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed changes are due to the reduction of oxidized VOx species by propane and are not due to deposition of carbon-containing species in the case of C3H8."
          [120] "To prove whether the reduction/reoxidation of VOx species is a reversible process, an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) was fed over the reduced sample (at ca. 10 min in Figure 6) followed by C3H8 feeding (at ca. 22 min in Figure 6)."
          [121] "As shown in Figure 6, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm falls from ca. 0.2 to 0 after a few seconds in the O2 flow and reversibly increases to 0.2 in the C3H8 flow."
          [122] "Two important conclusions were derived: (1) reduction/oxidation of VOx species is a reversible process and (2) reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 is slower than reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2."
          [123] "When N2O was used for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species (ca. 3240 min in Figure 6), these species were also reoxidized."
          [124] "However, the temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm are slower than those with O2."
          [125] "From this difference in the temporal profiles, it is concluded that the reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O is slower than by O2."
          [126] "Similar results were obtained for other catalytic materials studied."
          [127] "Taking the difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [128] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [129] "The effect of oxygen species (lattice oxygen or adsorbed) on the ODP reaction was studied by pulsing a mixture of propane and labeled oxygen (18O2) over the catalyst, which was preoxidized by 16O2."
          [130] "COx products containing different oxygen isotopes (16O and 18O) were detected at the reactor outlet."
          [131] "Their transient responses are presented in Figure 7 in a height-normalized form for better comparison of their pulse shapes."
          [132] "The presence of 16O (not pulsed gas-phase oxygen) in CO and CO2 evidences the participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species in combustion of C3H8/C3H6."
          [133] "This result is very similar to previous reported ones over various vanadium-based catalytic materials.27,48,49"
          [134] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
          [135] "However, the concentration of CO2 and CO formed with participation of labeled oxygen (C18O2, C18O16O, and C18O) was significantly lower than C16O2 and C16O."
          [136] "This indicates that C16O and C16O2 are the main COx products."
          [137] "In other words, lattice oxygen of VOx species is mainly responsible for COx formation."
          [138] "Adsorbed oxygen species formed from gas-phase labeled (18O2) oxygen play only a minor role in COx formation under transient vacuum conditions."
          [139] "This may be because the concentration of lattice nonlabeled oxygen in VOx species is considerably higher than that of labeled oxygen in the C3H818O2 pulse."
          [140] "The ratio of vanadium to the amount of 18O2 in one pulse was estimated as ca. 5·104."
          [141] "However, the contribution of adsorbed oxygen species to the formation of COx can be significantly higher under ambient-pressure conditions."
          [142] "We would like to emphasize that no labeled oxygen species in COx was observed in our previous experiments over VOx/γ-Al2O3 under similar conditions in the TAP reactor.27"
          [143] "This can be explained by the fact that incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into VOx species occurs considerably faster over VOx/γ-Al2O3 as compared to SiO2-based catalysts."
          [144] "This assumption is indirectly supported by the recently reported results of the ODP reaction over VOx/Al2O3 50 and VOx/SiO2 51 in cofeed (O2 and C3H8 are fed together) and cyclic (O2 and C3H8 are fed separately and periodically) modes."
          [145] "No substantial differences in propene selectivity between the cofeed and cyclic conditions were found over the alumina-based catalysts, while propene selectivity over the silica-based one was significantly improved when the ODP reaction was performed under the cyclic conditions."
          [146] "In the latter case, the negative effect of adsorbed oxygen species on propene selectivity could be avoided."
          [147] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O."
          [148] "According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [149] "The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2."
          [150] "The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [151] "Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [152] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."
          [153] "The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
          [154] "This is essential for achieving high primary propene selectivity and for suppressing consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2 as shown in Figure 2."
          [155] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
          [156] "Since 710 oxygen atoms are required for COx formation from propane/propene but only one for propene formation, nonselective propane/propene oxidation to COx will be inhibited upon increasing degree of reduction of VOx species."
          [157] "However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for superior performance of N2O as compared to O2."
          [158] "On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."
          [159] "It is well-known 52 that O2 adsorption over reducible metal oxides occurs via a complex sequence of redox processes until O2- (lattice oxygen) is formed."
          [160] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that gas-phase oxygen adsorbs molecularly over anion vacancy of reduced VOx species. 53,54"
          [161] "This biatomic adsorbed oxygen dissociates further yielding lattice oxygen species."
          [162] "Adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species were suggested to be nonselective ones for the ODP reaction over VMgO 55,56 and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 57 catalytic materials."
          [163] "In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O- or O2-, which are considered as selective ones.52"
          [164] "Further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations are in progress with the aim to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species."

[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
          [4] "Taking into account the precision in the measurements, in- troduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes."
          [5] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged."
          [6] "For pure NiMoO4, addition of 300 ppm N2O leads to (Table 2): (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an increase in the selectivity to propylene (+32%), (iii) a decrease in both the conversion of oxygen (19%) and the yield of CO2 (21%)."
          [7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
          [8] "These results could indicate that -Sb2O4 and N2O could probably play the same role, namely, control- ling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction, inhibit- ing non-selective sites."
          [9] "The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products."
          [10] "N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
          [11] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
          [12] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeo- lites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM- 5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
          [2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [5] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxidation, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)."
          [7] "The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products with a prolongation of contact time supports this explanation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indicating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream."
          [8] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."

[1] "N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."
          [2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state."
          [3] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [4] "The Oproduced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene."
          [5] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi- cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain- ing materials [13,2123]."
          [2] "A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24]."
          [3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxida- tion of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.

          [6] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
          [7] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration re- mained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites were present."
          [8] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida- tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."
          [9] "In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation."
          [10] "However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
          [11] "Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to ob- tain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O."
          [12] "The same VOx/ MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane [13,14]."
          [13] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol 1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxi- dizing agent."
          [14] "In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher,amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."
          [15] "Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."

[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"
          [3] "A major draw- back of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, al- though the original catalytic activity was completely recov- ered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003)."
          [4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
          [5] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."
          [6] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

[1] "The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor and to the ability of determined iron species for coordinating re- active atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane [4]."

          [4] "The level of detail and accuracy for in situ investigation of coke formation as obtained by TEOM cannot be accomplished using typical approaches to study deactivation, in which coke is characterized after exposing the catalyst to reaction condi- tions and taking samples at defined times for ex situ analyses [1416]."
          [5] "However, TEOM does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level, be- cause the nature of coke as well as its interaction with chemical groups in the zeolite cannot be probed."
          [6] "To gain a better under- standing of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air,complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed."
          [7] "In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion [1720], by monitoring in real time the formation of carbona- ceous deposits and eventual changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous ma- terial."
          [8] "Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction."
          [9] "To the best of our knowledge, in situ in- vestigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported."
          [10] "Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts (i.e., to what extent the catalytic performance is recovered on successive re- action and regeneration cycles) has not yet been addressed in detail."

[1] "Much research effort is currently devoted to the selective activation and functionalization of light alkanes (methane,ethane, propane, and butane) for obtaining petrochemicals directly or their respective olefinic feedstocks."
          [2] "Many studies have explored the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, a key building block in the petrochemical industry."
          [3] "Relatively complex multimetallic mixed oxides based on Vand Mo are considered as the most efficient catalysts in this reaction, with propene yields in the range of 1030% using O2 as the oxidant [1]."
          [4] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
          [5] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."
          [6] "Besides, iron zeolites strongly deactivate during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation and it is unclear from these publications whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time."
          [7] "The highest propylene yield was obtained over steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 (22%), followed by the iron zeolites prepared by liquid-ion exchange (16%) and chemical vapor deposition (9%)."

          [9] "The time and degree of deactivation in Fig. 2 depend on the catalyst in question."
          [10] "The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample."
          [11] "The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored."
          [12] "The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2)."
          [13] "The propylene yield is significantly higher in st-H-Z than in c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples is rather similar (especially after 40 min on stream)."
          [14] "This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed performance."
          [15] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5."
          [16] "This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
          [17] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
          [18] "This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by Bula nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of 3001200 ppm."
          [19] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."
          [20] "Our results show that deactivation is slower over the steam- activated zeolites (Fig. 2), with a significantly reduced number of Brnsted sites as a consequence of the steam treatment [21]."
          [21] "A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie- Fe-Z."
          [22] "It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction."
          [23] "Further research is required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP."

[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas."
          [2] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."
          [3] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."
          [4] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."
          [5] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
          [2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
          [3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
          [4] "We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."
          [6] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
          [7] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."
          [8] "One alternative explanation could be the fact that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, so leading to a lower conversion, while selectivity increases."
          [9] "The results obtained when the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4 were similar, but less significant (when 1 vol.% N2O is added,conversion decreases from 7.5 to 4.3% and selectivity increases from 34.8 to 41.9%)."
          [10] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 cat- alyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2)."
          [11] "In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%,respectively."
          [12] "However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%)."
          [13] "This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O."
          [14] "Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst."
          [15] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon."
          [16] "This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable."
          [17] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."
          [18] "N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explain- ing the high carbon formation."
          [19] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
          [2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
          [3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
          [4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
          [5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
          [6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."
          [7] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
          [8] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation.
          The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane.
          A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature.
          The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4).
          Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O.
          The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx.
          Such intermediates appear to be essential for propene production. Accordingly, the performance of FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated ODH of propane is severely deteriorated in the presence of small amounts of O2.
          Because the initial ODHP performance was recovered upon air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles has been evaluated.
          The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may also explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K.
          The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2.
          The efficient utilization of N2O in tail-gases should involve a previous purification step. As shown here, the presence of O2 (a typical component of tail-gases) has a negative impact on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5.



[1] "Recently, it has been pro- posed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted con- siderable attention [213]."
          [2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."
          [3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
          [4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination."
          [5] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."
          [6] "In the case of the ODHP with N2O, the presence of the propane reductant in the reaction system makes the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites much more complicated."
          [7] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mecha- nism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O."
          [8] "Accordingly, there is no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
          [3] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
          [4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective ox- idation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

For all V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion.
          The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as com- pared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction.
          There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant.
          In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2.
          The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx.
          The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2.
          From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
          [4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."
          [5] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."
          [6] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [7] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
          [8] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
          [9] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
          [10] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
          [11] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
          [12] "Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
          [13] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O. Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5. The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2. The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [6] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."
          [7] "The XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to ca. 5 wt % do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase."
          [8] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
          [9] "The primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [10] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [11] "The higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [12] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [13] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."
          [14] "The BET values of unloaded MCM-41, MCM-48, and SiO2 support materials amounted to 1040, 1049, and 300 m2/g, respectively."
          [15] "Vanadium-loaded MCM-41 and SiO2 materials showed a decrease in the specific surface area by a factor of ca. 20% for vanadium loadings up to 5.3 wt %."
          [16] "The VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 catalyst lost ca. 50% of the original surface area of MCM-48."
          [17] "The SBET value (52 m2/g) of VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 is significantly lower than those of the other catalysts."
          [18] "As reported in ref 20, the pore structure of MCM-41 is completely destroyed in this sample."
          [19] "Small V2O5 crystallites were observed in this sample by means of ex-situ XRD analysis."
          [20] "The XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to ca. 5 wt % do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase."
          [21] "Additional UV/vis and Raman spectroscopic characterization studies (the data are not shown for brevity) did not indicate a possible presence of XRD-amorphous crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles for samples possessing up to 5.3 wt % vanadium."
          [22] "The calculated vanadium surface densities are 0.37, 0.6, 1.38, and 25.4 for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, VOx(2.9)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, respectively."
          [23] "On the basis of the obtained densities and the literature9 values for a vanadium monolayer (57 V/nm2), it can be safely concluded that all catalytic materials, except for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, possess VOx species below one vanadium monolayer."
          [24] "A single maximum of H2 consumption at ca. 801 and 806 K was observed upon reduction of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 and VOx (2.8)/SiO2, respectively."
          [25] "Additionally to the maximal H2 consumption at 810 K, a small shoulder at ca. 860 K was identified in the TPR profile of the VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 sample."
          [26] "This shoulder becomes more pronounced for the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where crystalline V2O5 phase was identified by XRD analysis."
          [27] "According to the literature data,37,42,43 the peak at 864 K could be due to the presence of highly polymerized VOx species or crystalline V2O5."
          [28] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material at apparent surface vanadium densities below one monolayer."
          [29] "The relative degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the order"
          [30] "The VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possesses microcrystalline V2O5 phase."
          [31] "The next section establishes correlations between the nature of VOx species and their performance in the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O."
          [32] "Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."
          [33] "Since the amount of N2O was double that of O2, both of the above reaction feeds contained the same amount of oxygen atoms."
          [34] "This allows the comparison of the influence of oxidizing agents on the ODP reaction."
          [35] "The TOF (turnover frequency) values of propane conversion in the presence of O2 and N2O over VOx species below (VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48) and above (VOx(11.2)/MCM-41) one monolayer are compared in Table 1."
          [36] "The TOF values were calculated taking the total amount of vanadium atoms into account."
          [37] "This table illustrates that the catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples."
          [38] "This may be due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species over the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst as shown in section 3.1."
          [39] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
          [40] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."
          [41] "For establishing overall mechanistic scheme of the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O over VOx species of different degrees of polymerization, catalytic performance (product selectivity) was determined at different contact times, that is, different degrees of propane conversion."
          [42] "This knowledge is of high importance for catalyst designing, because it provides essential information on the sequence of product formation, that is, the catalyst ability for C3H8 conversion to C3H6 and COx as well as for consecutive C3H6 combustion."
          [43] "The obtained selectivityconversion relationships with O2 are summarized in Figure 1."
          [44] "Propene selectivity decreases, while CO and CO2 selectivities (the data are not shown) increase with an increase in the degree of propane conversion."
          [45] "Such behavior is explained by consecutive oxidation of the primarily formed propene to carbon oxides."
          [46] "For the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, the low propene selectivity at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion is an indication for catalytic activity toward direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to carbon oxides."
          [47] "This reaction pathway does not play any significant role over other catalytic materials with vanadium loading below one monolayer."
          [48] "Over the latter catalysts, CO and CO2 originate mainly via consecutive C3H6 oxidation."
          [49] "Figure 1b illustrates selectivityconversion relationships in the ODP reaction over differently structured VOx species using N2O."
          [50] "As in the presence of O2 (Figure 1a), propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion with N2O, too."
          [51] "However, from the comparison of the results in Figure 1a and b, it is obvious that propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion."
          [52] "This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [53] "From a more detailed analysis of the data in Figure 1, the primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion) and the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx can be derived."
          [54] "These two parameters represent the catalyst activity for direct propane conversion to COx and for consecutive combustion of primarily formed propene, respectively."
          [55] "In the present paper, the dependence of S(C3H6) on X(C3H8) at low propane conversion (<10%) is described by a linear function in eq 1."
          [56] "where S(C3H6)initial and A are the primary propene selectivity and the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, respectively."
          [57] "According to this function, the primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx."
          [58] "This parameter is related to the catalyst activity for propene conversion to carbon oxides."
          [59] "The higher the slope of the function in eq 1, the faster the COx production from C3H6."
          [60] "Establishing the relationships between the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation and the structure of VOx species or the applied oxidizing agent is highly relevant for designing selective catalysts, since propene selectivity in the ODP reaction suffers mainly from the higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."
          [61] "Figure 2 compares the primary S(C3H6) and the catalyst ability (A) for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx over differently structured VOx species in the presence of O2 and N2O."
          [62] "For an O2-containing reaction feed (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40), it is clear that the primary propene selectivity is close for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, and VOx(2.8)/SiO2 materials but is significantly low over VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 (Figure 2 a)."
          [63] "From the characterization results in section 3.1, the latter material possesses microcrystalline V2O5 while other materials are free of microcrystalline V2O5 and possess highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx species."
          [64] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too."
          [65] "The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found:"
          [66] "The degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the same order (section 3.1)."
          [67] "Thus, the higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [68] "This conclusion is in agreement with literature data9 and with our recent results of the ODP reaction on VOx/γ-Al2O3.36"
          [69] "Further insights into the influence of oxidizing agent on product selectivity in the ODP reaction are derived from the analysis of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 ratios at different degrees of propane conversion."
          [70] "Table 1 represents these ratios at propane conversions of ca. 2 and 10%."
          [71] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."
          [72] "However, the ratio of CO2/C3H6 over polymerized VOx species increases from 0.04 to 0.13, while the ratio of CO/C3H6 decreases from 1.7 to 0.27, when N2O is used instead of O2."
          [73] "For both oxidizing agents, the ratios of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 increase with propane conversion, with the former increasing stronger."
          [74] "This increase is less pronounced for a feed with N2O."
          [75] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [76] "This effect is more pronounced for polymerized VOx species."
          [77] "Summarizing, two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [78] "To elucidate possible reasons of the influence of oxidizing agent on the ODP performance of highly dispersed VOx species and microcrystalline V2O5, in-situ UV/vis measurements were performed at 773 K."
          [79] "The degrees of propane and oxidant (O2 and N2O) conversion were controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS)."
          [80] "To ensure a near-to-uniform composition of the studied catalysts along the catalyst bed, propane and oxidant (O2 or N2O) conversions were kept below 5 and 10%, respectively."
          [81] "Figure 3 exemplifies in-situ UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 in oxidizing (O2/Ne = 20/80) and reducing (H2/N2 = 5/95 or C3H8/Ne = 40/60) atmospheres as well as in ODP feeds (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20)."
          [82] "The UV/vis spectrum in a flow of O2 with the absorption at 295 nm is characteristic for tetrahedrally coordinated V5+Ox species."
          [83] "The adsorption in the 400700 nm region (dd transitions of reduced vanadium species) increases upon switching from an O2 flow to a H2 flow (Figure 3a); the UV/vis bands of V4+ and V3+ species appear as broad features in the 400800 nm region (note the nonzero value of the absorption for the reduced samples in this region)."
          [84] "46,47 Similar changes were also observed when the oxidized catalyst was admitted to a C3H8 flow."
          [85] "Since no significant differences in the UV/vis spectra in H2 and C3H8 flows were observed (Figure 3a), the effect of possible carbon-containing deposits in the case of C3H8 flow on the interpretation of UV/vis data can therefore be neglected."
          [86] "Thus, the observed changes in the UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 upon switching from oxidizing to reducing flows reflect the changes in reduction degree of VOx species under different reaction conditions."
          [87] "Taking the above discussion into account, the UV/vis spectra in O2 (20% O2 in Ne) and C3H8 (40% C3H8 in Ne) flows represent oxidized and reduced states of VOx species, respectively."
          [88] "In the following, we compare UV/vis spectra under different ODP conditions (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) with the spectra of oxidized and reduced VOx species to derive insights into the reduction degree of VOx species under reaction conditions."
          [89] "One can see from Figure 3 that the UV/vis spectra during the ODP reaction with O2 (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40) and in an O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) flow are very similar."
          [90] "This means that the oxidation state of VOx species in both cases is close to 5+."
          [91] "However, there is a strong difference between the UV/vis spectra in O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows, while the UV/vis spectra in H2 (H2/N2 = 5/95) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows are very similar."
          [92] "This evidence that the oxidation state of VOx species under conditions of the ODP reaction with N2O (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%) is similar to the reduced one."
          [93] "This means that the oxidation state of vanadium in VOx species decreases from 5+ to 3+ and/or 4+ when the ODP reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2."
          [94] "Another interesting observation from Figure 3 is the appearance of a new band at 400450 nm in the UV/vis spectrum of VOx(2.8)/SiO2 in a C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [95] "A similar band was also identified over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 after 1030 min on stream in C3H8."
          [96] "To prove whether this band may belong to carbon deposits, we performed time-on-stream in-situ UV/vis tests over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 in a H2 flow (H2/N2 = 5/95)."
          [97] "The results are shown in Figure 4."
          [98] "One can see that the band at 400450 nm starts to appear after 10 min and becomes apparent after 30 min on stream in a H2 flow."
          [99] "Since this band appears in the absence of carbon-containing species, its appearance due to coke deposition can be safely excluded."
          [100] "Possible origins of this band are discussed as follows."
          [101] "It is well-known that nondehydrated VOx/silica materials possess octahedral coordinated VOx species, in which adsorbed water is a ligand."
          [102] "On the basis of this experimental fact, it can be suggested that water is formed upon reaction of VOx species over SiO2 and MCM-41 with H2 and adsorbs over reduced VOx species increasing their coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral."
          [103] "However, to draw a more definitive conclusion about the origins of the band at 400450 nm in H2 at 773 K, new additional experiments are required."
          [104] "It is also important to stress that there is no difference in the UV/vis spectra of VOx species under oxidizing conditions before and after treatments in H2 (Figure 4)."
          [105] "Similar results were obtained for all the oxidizing/reduction/reaction cycles described in Figure 3."
          [106] "This means that VOx species remain highly dispersed during the applied treatments and time-on-stream operation."
          [107] "To check if O2 and N2O show different ability (activity) for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species, in-situ UV/vis tests were performed in a transient mode."
          [108] "In these experiments, the oxidized sample was reduced in a flow of C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) at 773 K for 10 min followed by flushing in a Ne flow for 1 min and feeding an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) over the reduced catalyst."
          [109] "The sample was kept in this flow for 30 min to reoxidate reduced VOx species."
          [110] "Hereafter, the reoxidized catalyst was again reduced in C3H8 followed by its reoxidation in a N2O (N2O/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [111] "In all the above experiments, UV/vis spectra from 200 to 800 nm and KubelkaMunk at 700 nm were recorded every 20 and 5 s, respectively."
          [112] "The respective results are summarized in Figure 5 and Figure 6."
          [113] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."
          [114] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."
          [115] "More detailed insights into the kinetics of reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 and reoxidation of reduced ones by O2 and N2O were derived from the analysis of temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function in Figure 6."
          [116] "At time zero, we switched from an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) to a C3H8 flow (C3H8/Ne = 40/60)."
          [117] "As result, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm increases from 0 (fully oxidized VOx species) and reaches a constant value of ca. 0.2 after 5 min on C3H8 stream."
          [118] "Similar changes were observed when H2 was used as a reducing agent instead of C3H8."
          [119] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed changes are due to the reduction of oxidized VOx species by propane and are not due to deposition of carbon-containing species in the case of C3H8."
          [120] "To prove whether the reduction/reoxidation of VOx species is a reversible process, an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) was fed over the reduced sample (at ca. 10 min in Figure 6) followed by C3H8 feeding (at ca. 22 min in Figure 6)."
          [121] "As shown in Figure 6, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm falls from ca. 0.2 to 0 after a few seconds in the O2 flow and reversibly increases to 0.2 in the C3H8 flow."
          [122] "Two important conclusions were derived: (1) reduction/oxidation of VOx species is a reversible process and (2) reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 is slower than reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2."
          [123] "When N2O was used for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species (ca. 3240 min in Figure 6), these species were also reoxidized."
          [124] "However, the temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm are slower than those with O2."
          [125] "From this difference in the temporal profiles, it is concluded that the reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O is slower than by O2."
          [126] "Similar results were obtained for other catalytic materials studied."
          [127] "Taking the difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [128] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [129] "The effect of oxygen species (lattice oxygen or adsorbed) on the ODP reaction was studied by pulsing a mixture of propane and labeled oxygen (18O2) over the catalyst, which was preoxidized by 16O2."
          [130] "COx products containing different oxygen isotopes (16O and 18O) were detected at the reactor outlet."
          [131] "Their transient responses are presented in Figure 7 in a height-normalized form for better comparison of their pulse shapes."
          [132] "The presence of 16O (not pulsed gas-phase oxygen) in CO and CO2 evidences the participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species in combustion of C3H8/C3H6."
          [133] "This result is very similar to previous reported ones over various vanadium-based catalytic materials.27,48,49"
          [134] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
          [135] "However, the concentration of CO2 and CO formed with participation of labeled oxygen (C18O2, C18O16O, and C18O) was significantly lower than C16O2 and C16O."
          [136] "This indicates that C16O and C16O2 are the main COx products."
          [137] "In other words, lattice oxygen of VOx species is mainly responsible for COx formation."
          [138] "Adsorbed oxygen species formed from gas-phase labeled (18O2) oxygen play only a minor role in COx formation under transient vacuum conditions."
          [139] "This may be because the concentration of lattice nonlabeled oxygen in VOx species is considerably higher than that of labeled oxygen in the C3H818O2 pulse."
          [140] "The ratio of vanadium to the amount of 18O2 in one pulse was estimated as ca. 5·104."
          [141] "However, the contribution of adsorbed oxygen species to the formation of COx can be significantly higher under ambient-pressure conditions."
          [142] "We would like to emphasize that no labeled oxygen species in COx was observed in our previous experiments over VOx/γ-Al2O3 under similar conditions in the TAP reactor.27"
          [143] "This can be explained by the fact that incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into VOx species occurs considerably faster over VOx/γ-Al2O3 as compared to SiO2-based catalysts."
          [144] "This assumption is indirectly supported by the recently reported results of the ODP reaction over VOx/Al2O3 50 and VOx/SiO2 51 in cofeed (O2 and C3H8 are fed together) and cyclic (O2 and C3H8 are fed separately and periodically) modes."
          [145] "No substantial differences in propene selectivity between the cofeed and cyclic conditions were found over the alumina-based catalysts, while propene selectivity over the silica-based one was significantly improved when the ODP reaction was performed under the cyclic conditions."
          [146] "In the latter case, the negative effect of adsorbed oxygen species on propene selectivity could be avoided."
          [147] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O."
          [148] "According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [149] "The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2."
          [150] "The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [151] "Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [152] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."
          [153] "The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
          [154] "This is essential for achieving high primary propene selectivity and for suppressing consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2 as shown in Figure 2."
          [155] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
          [156] "Since 710 oxygen atoms are required for COx formation from propane/propene but only one for propene formation, nonselective propane/propene oxidation to COx will be inhibited upon increasing degree of reduction of VOx species."
          [157] "However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for superior performance of N2O as compared to O2."
          [158] "On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."
          [159] "It is well-known 52 that O2 adsorption over reducible metal oxides occurs via a complex sequence of redox processes until O2- (lattice oxygen) is formed."
          [160] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that gas-phase oxygen adsorbs molecularly over anion vacancy of reduced VOx species. 53,54"
          [161] "This biatomic adsorbed oxygen dissociates further yielding lattice oxygen species."
          [162] "Adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species were suggested to be nonselective ones for the ODP reaction over VMgO 55,56 and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 57 catalytic materials."
          [163] "In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O- or O2-, which are considered as selective ones.52"
          [164] "Further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations are in progress with the aim to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species."

[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
          [4] "Taking into account the precision in the measurements, in- troduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes."
          [5] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged."
          [6] "For pure NiMoO4, addition of 300 ppm N2O leads to (Table 2): (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an increase in the selectivity to propylene (+32%), (iii) a decrease in both the conversion of oxygen (19%) and the yield of CO2 (21%)."
          [7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
          [8] "These results could indicate that -Sb2O4 and N2O could probably play the same role, namely, control- ling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction, inhibit- ing non-selective sites."
          [9] "The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products."
          [10] "N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
          [11] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
          [12] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeo- lites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM- 5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
          [2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [5] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxidation, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)."
          [7] "The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products with a prolongation of contact time supports this explanation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indicating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream."
          [8] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."

[1] "N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."
          [2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state."
          [3] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [4] "The Oproduced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene."
          [5] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi- cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain- ing materials [13,2123]."
          [2] "A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24]."
          [3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxida- tion of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.

          [6] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
          [7] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration re- mained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites were present."
          [8] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida- tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."
          [9] "In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation."
          [10] "However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
          [11] "Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to ob- tain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O."
          [12] "The same VOx/ MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane [13,14]."
          [13] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol 1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxi- dizing agent."
          [14] "In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher,amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."
          [15] "Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."

[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"
          [3] "A major draw- back of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, al- though the original catalytic activity was completely recov- ered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003)."
          [4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
          [5] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."
          [6] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

          [4] "The level of detail and accuracy for in situ investigation of coke formation as obtained by TEOM cannot be accomplished using typical approaches to study deactivation, in which coke is characterized after exposing the catalyst to reaction condi- tions and taking samples at defined times for ex situ analyses [1416]."
          [5] "However, TEOM does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level, be- cause the nature of coke as well as its interaction with chemical groups in the zeolite cannot be probed."
          [6] "To gain a better under- standing of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air,complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed."
          [7] "In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion [1720], by monitoring in real time the formation of carbona- ceous deposits and eventual changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous ma- terial."

          [3] "Relatively complex multimetallic mixed oxides based on Vand Mo are considered as the most efficient catalysts in this reaction, with propene yields in the range of 1030% using O2 as the oxidant [1]."
          [4] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
          [5] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."
          [6] "Besides, iron zeolites strongly deactivate during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation and it is unclear from these publications whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time."

          [9] "The time and degree of deactivation in Fig. 2 depend on the catalyst in question."
          [10] "The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample."
          [11] "The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored."
          [12] "The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2)."
          [13] "The propylene yield is significantly higher in st-H-Z than in c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples is rather similar (especially after 40 min on stream)."
          [14] "This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed performance."
          [15] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5."
          [16] "This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
          [17] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
          [18] "This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by Bula nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of 3001200 ppm."
          [19] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."
          [20] "Our results show that deactivation is slower over the steam- activated zeolites (Fig. 2), with a significantly reduced number of Brnsted sites as a consequence of the steam treatment [21]."
          [21] "A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie- Fe-Z."
          [22] "It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction."
          [23] "Further research is required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP."

[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas."
          [2] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."
          [3] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."
          [4] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."
          [5] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
          [2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
          [3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
          [4] "We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."
          [6] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
          [7] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."
          [8] "One alternative explanation could be the fact that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, so leading to a lower conversion, while selectivity increases."
          [9] "The results obtained when the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4 were similar, but less significant (when 1 vol.% N2O is added,conversion decreases from 7.5 to 4.3% and selectivity increases from 34.8 to 41.9%)."
          [10] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 cat- alyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2)."
          [11] "In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%,respectively."
          [12] "However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%)."
          [13] "This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O."
          [14] "Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst."
          [15] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon."
          [16] "This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable."
          [17] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."
          [18] "N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explain- ing the high carbon formation."
          [19] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
          [2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
          [3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
          [4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
          [5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
          [6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."
          [7] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
          [8] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation.
          The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane.
          A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature.
          The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4).
          Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O.
          The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx.
          Such intermediates appear to be essential for propene production. Accordingly, the performance of FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated ODH of propane is severely deteriorated in the presence of small amounts of O2.
          Because the initial ODHP performance was recovered upon air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles has been evaluated.
          The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may also explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K.
          The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2.
          The efficient utilization of N2O in tail-gases should involve a previous purification step. As shown here, the presence of O2 (a typical component of tail-gases) has a negative impact on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5.



[1] "Recently, it has been pro- posed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted con- siderable attention [213]."
          [2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."
          [3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
          [4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination."
          [5] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."
          [6] "In the case of the ODHP with N2O, the presence of the propane reductant in the reaction system makes the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites much more complicated."
          [7] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mecha- nism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O."
          [8] "Accordingly, there is no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
          [3] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
          [4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective ox- idation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

For all V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion.
          The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as com- pared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction.
          There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant.
          In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2.
          The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx.
          The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2.
          From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
          [4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."
          [5] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."
          [6] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [7] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
          [8] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
          [9] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
          [10] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
          [11] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
          [12] "Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
          [13] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O. Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5. The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2. The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [6] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."

          [11] "The higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [12] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."

          [23] "On the basis of the obtained densities and the literature9 values for a vanadium monolayer (57 V/nm2), it can be safely concluded that all catalytic materials, except for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, possess VOx species below one vanadium monolayer."

          [46] "For the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, the low propene selectivity at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion is an indication for catalytic activity toward direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to carbon oxides."

          [59] "The higher the slope of the function in eq 1, the faster the COx production from C3H6."
          [60] "Establishing the relationships between the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation and the structure of VOx species or the applied oxidizing agent is highly relevant for designing selective catalysts, since propene selectivity in the ODP reaction suffers mainly from the higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."
          [61] "Figure 2 compares the primary S(C3H6) and the catalyst ability (A) for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx over differently structured VOx species in the presence of O2 and N2O."
          [62] "For an O2-containing reaction feed (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40), it is clear that the primary propene selectivity is close for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, and VOx(2.8)/SiO2 materials but is significantly low over VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 (Figure 2 a)."
          [63] "From the characterization results in section 3.1, the latter material possesses microcrystalline V2O5 while other materials are free of microcrystalline V2O5 and possess highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx species."
          [64] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too."
          [65] "The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found:"
          [66] "The degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the same order (section 3.1)."
          [67] "Thus, the higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [68] "This conclusion is in agreement with literature data9 and with our recent results of the ODP reaction on VOx/γ-Al2O3.36"
          [69] "Further insights into the influence of oxidizing agent on product selectivity in the ODP reaction are derived from the analysis of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 ratios at different degrees of propane conversion."
          [70] "Table 1 represents these ratios at propane conversions of ca. 2 and 10%."
          [71] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."
          [72] "However, the ratio of CO2/C3H6 over polymerized VOx species increases from 0.04 to 0.13, while the ratio of CO/C3H6 decreases from 1.7 to 0.27, when N2O is used instead of O2."
          [73] "For both oxidizing agents, the ratios of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 increase with propane conversion, with the former increasing stronger."
          [74] "This increase is less pronounced for a feed with N2O."
          [75] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [76] "This effect is more pronounced for polymerized VOx species."
          [77] "Summarizing, two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [78] "To elucidate possible reasons of the influence of oxidizing agent on the ODP performance of highly dispersed VOx species and microcrystalline V2O5, in-situ UV/vis measurements were performed at 773 K."
          [79] "The degrees of propane and oxidant (O2 and N2O) conversion were controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS)."
          [80] "To ensure a near-to-uniform composition of the studied catalysts along the catalyst bed, propane and oxidant (O2 or N2O) conversions were kept below 5 and 10%, respectively."
          [81] "Figure 3 exemplifies in-situ UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 in oxidizing (O2/Ne = 20/80) and reducing (H2/N2 = 5/95 or C3H8/Ne = 40/60) atmospheres as well as in ODP feeds (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20)."
          [82] "The UV/vis spectrum in a flow of O2 with the absorption at 295 nm is characteristic for tetrahedrally coordinated V5+Ox species."
          [83] "The adsorption in the 400700 nm region (dd transitions of reduced vanadium species) increases upon switching from an O2 flow to a H2 flow (Figure 3a); the UV/vis bands of V4+ and V3+ species appear as broad features in the 400800 nm region (note the nonzero value of the absorption for the reduced samples in this region)."
          [84] "46,47 Similar changes were also observed when the oxidized catalyst was admitted to a C3H8 flow."
          [85] "Since no significant differences in the UV/vis spectra in H2 and C3H8 flows were observed (Figure 3a), the effect of possible carbon-containing deposits in the case of C3H8 flow on the interpretation of UV/vis data can therefore be neglected."
          [86] "Thus, the observed changes in the UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 upon switching from oxidizing to reducing flows reflect the changes in reduction degree of VOx species under different reaction conditions."
          [87] "Taking the above discussion into account, the UV/vis spectra in O2 (20% O2 in Ne) and C3H8 (40% C3H8 in Ne) flows represent oxidized and reduced states of VOx species, respectively."
          [88] "In the following, we compare UV/vis spectra under different ODP conditions (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) with the spectra of oxidized and reduced VOx species to derive insights into the reduction degree of VOx species under reaction conditions."
          [89] "One can see from Figure 3 that the UV/vis spectra during the ODP reaction with O2 (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40) and in an O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) flow are very similar."
          [90] "This means that the oxidation state of VOx species in both cases is close to 5+."
          [91] "However, there is a strong difference between the UV/vis spectra in O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows, while the UV/vis spectra in H2 (H2/N2 = 5/95) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows are very similar."
          [92] "This evidence that the oxidation state of VOx species under conditions of the ODP reaction with N2O (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%) is similar to the reduced one."
          [93] "This means that the oxidation state of vanadium in VOx species decreases from 5+ to 3+ and/or 4+ when the ODP reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2."
          [94] "Another interesting observation from Figure 3 is the appearance of a new band at 400450 nm in the UV/vis spectrum of VOx(2.8)/SiO2 in a C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [95] "A similar band was also identified over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 after 1030 min on stream in C3H8."
          [96] "To prove whether this band may belong to carbon deposits, we performed time-on-stream in-situ UV/vis tests over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 in a H2 flow (H2/N2 = 5/95)."
          [97] "The results are shown in Figure 4."
          [98] "One can see that the band at 400450 nm starts to appear after 10 min and becomes apparent after 30 min on stream in a H2 flow."
          [99] "Since this band appears in the absence of carbon-containing species, its appearance due to coke deposition can be safely excluded."
          [100] "Possible origins of this band are discussed as follows."
          [101] "It is well-known that nondehydrated VOx/silica materials possess octahedral coordinated VOx species, in which adsorbed water is a ligand."
          [102] "On the basis of this experimental fact, it can be suggested that water is formed upon reaction of VOx species over SiO2 and MCM-41 with H2 and adsorbs over reduced VOx species increasing their coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral."
          [103] "However, to draw a more definitive conclusion about the origins of the band at 400450 nm in H2 at 773 K, new additional experiments are required."
          [104] "It is also important to stress that there is no difference in the UV/vis spectra of VOx species under oxidizing conditions before and after treatments in H2 (Figure 4)."
          [105] "Similar results were obtained for all the oxidizing/reduction/reaction cycles described in Figure 3."
          [106] "This means that VOx species remain highly dispersed during the applied treatments and time-on-stream operation."
          [107] "To check if O2 and N2O show different ability (activity) for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species, in-situ UV/vis tests were performed in a transient mode."
          [108] "In these experiments, the oxidized sample was reduced in a flow of C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) at 773 K for 10 min followed by flushing in a Ne flow for 1 min and feeding an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) over the reduced catalyst."
          [109] "The sample was kept in this flow for 30 min to reoxidate reduced VOx species."
          [110] "Hereafter, the reoxidized catalyst was again reduced in C3H8 followed by its reoxidation in a N2O (N2O/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [111] "In all the above experiments, UV/vis spectra from 200 to 800 nm and KubelkaMunk at 700 nm were recorded every 20 and 5 s, respectively."
          [112] "The respective results are summarized in Figure 5 and Figure 6."
          [113] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."
          [114] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."
          [115] "More detailed insights into the kinetics of reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 and reoxidation of reduced ones by O2 and N2O were derived from the analysis of temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function in Figure 6."
          [116] "At time zero, we switched from an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) to a C3H8 flow (C3H8/Ne = 40/60)."
          [117] "As result, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm increases from 0 (fully oxidized VOx species) and reaches a constant value of ca. 0.2 after 5 min on C3H8 stream."
          [118] "Similar changes were observed when H2 was used as a reducing agent instead of C3H8."
          [119] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed changes are due to the reduction of oxidized VOx species by propane and are not due to deposition of carbon-containing species in the case of C3H8."
          [120] "To prove whether the reduction/reoxidation of VOx species is a reversible process, an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) was fed over the reduced sample (at ca. 10 min in Figure 6) followed by C3H8 feeding (at ca. 22 min in Figure 6)."
          [121] "As shown in Figure 6, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm falls from ca. 0.2 to 0 after a few seconds in the O2 flow and reversibly increases to 0.2 in the C3H8 flow."
          [122] "Two important conclusions were derived: (1) reduction/oxidation of VOx species is a reversible process and (2) reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 is slower than reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2."
          [123] "When N2O was used for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species (ca. 3240 min in Figure 6), these species were also reoxidized."
          [124] "However, the temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm are slower than those with O2."
          [125] "From this difference in the temporal profiles, it is concluded that the reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O is slower than by O2."
          [126] "Similar results were obtained for other catalytic materials studied."
          [127] "Taking the difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [128] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [129] "The effect of oxygen species (lattice oxygen or adsorbed) on the ODP reaction was studied by pulsing a mixture of propane and labeled oxygen (18O2) over the catalyst, which was preoxidized by 16O2."
          [130] "COx products containing different oxygen isotopes (16O and 18O) were detected at the reactor outlet."
          [131] "Their transient responses are presented in Figure 7 in a height-normalized form for better comparison of their pulse shapes."
          [132] "The presence of 16O (not pulsed gas-phase oxygen) in CO and CO2 evidences the participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species in combustion of C3H8/C3H6."
          [133] "This result is very similar to previous reported ones over various vanadium-based catalytic materials.27,48,49"
          [134] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
          [135] "However, the concentration of CO2 and CO formed with participation of labeled oxygen (C18O2, C18O16O, and C18O) was significantly lower than C16O2 and C16O."
          [136] "This indicates that C16O and C16O2 are the main COx products."
          [137] "In other words, lattice oxygen of VOx species is mainly responsible for COx formation."
          [138] "Adsorbed oxygen species formed from gas-phase labeled (18O2) oxygen play only a minor role in COx formation under transient vacuum conditions."
          [139] "This may be because the concentration of lattice nonlabeled oxygen in VOx species is considerably higher than that of labeled oxygen in the C3H818O2 pulse."
          [140] "The ratio of vanadium to the amount of 18O2 in one pulse was estimated as ca. 5·104."
          [141] "However, the contribution of adsorbed oxygen species to the formation of COx can be significantly higher under ambient-pressure conditions."
          [142] "We would like to emphasize that no labeled oxygen species in COx was observed in our previous experiments over VOx/γ-Al2O3 under similar conditions in the TAP reactor.27"
          [143] "This can be explained by the fact that incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into VOx species occurs considerably faster over VOx/γ-Al2O3 as compared to SiO2-based catalysts."
          [144] "This assumption is indirectly supported by the recently reported results of the ODP reaction over VOx/Al2O3 50 and VOx/SiO2 51 in cofeed (O2 and C3H8 are fed together) and cyclic (O2 and C3H8 are fed separately and periodically) modes."
          [145] "No substantial differences in propene selectivity between the cofeed and cyclic conditions were found over the alumina-based catalysts, while propene selectivity over the silica-based one was significantly improved when the ODP reaction was performed under the cyclic conditions."
          [146] "In the latter case, the negative effect of adsorbed oxygen species on propene selectivity could be avoided."
          [147] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O."
          [148] "According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [149] "The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2."
          [150] "The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [151] "Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [152] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."
          [153] "The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
          [154] "This is essential for achieving high primary propene selectivity and for suppressing consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2 as shown in Figure 2."
          [155] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
          [156] "Since 710 oxygen atoms are required for COx formation from propane/propene but only one for propene formation, nonselective propane/propene oxidation to COx will be inhibited upon increasing degree of reduction of VOx species."
          [157] "However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for superior performance of N2O as compared to O2."
          [158] "On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."
          [159] "It is well-known 52 that O2 adsorption over reducible metal oxides occurs via a complex sequence of redox processes until O2- (lattice oxygen) is formed."
          [160] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that gas-phase oxygen adsorbs molecularly over anion vacancy of reduced VOx species. 53,54"
          [161] "This biatomic adsorbed oxygen dissociates further yielding lattice oxygen species."
          [162] "Adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species were suggested to be nonselective ones for the ODP reaction over VMgO 55,56 and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 57 catalytic materials."
          [163] "In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O- or O2-, which are considered as selective ones.52"
          [164] "Further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations are in progress with the aim to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species."

[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
          [4] "Taking into account the precision in the measurements, in- troduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes."
          [5] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged."
          [6] "For pure NiMoO4, addition of 300 ppm N2O leads to (Table 2): (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an increase in the selectivity to propylene (+32%), (iii) a decrease in both the conversion of oxygen (19%) and the yield of CO2 (21%)."
          [7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
          [8] "These results could indicate that -Sb2O4 and N2O could probably play the same role, namely, control- ling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction, inhibit- ing non-selective sites."
          [9] "The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products."
          [10] "N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
          [11] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
          [12] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeo- lites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM- 5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
          [2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [5] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxidation, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)."
          [7] "The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products with a prolongation of contact time supports this explanation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indicating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream."
          [8] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."

[1] "N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."
          [2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state."
          [3] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [4] "The Oproduced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene."
          [5] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi- cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain- ing materials [13,2123]."
          [2] "A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24]."
          [3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxida- tion of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.

          [6] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
          [7] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration re- mained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites were present."
          [8] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida- tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."
          [9] "In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation."
          [10] "However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
          [11] "Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to ob- tain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O."
          [12] "The same VOx/ MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane [13,14]."

          [14] "In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher,amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."
          [15] "Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."

[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"
          [3] "A major draw- back of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, al- though the original catalytic activity was completely recov- ered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003)."
          [4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
          [5] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."
          [6] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

          [6] "To gain a better under- standing of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air,complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed."

          [4] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
          [5] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."
          [6] "Besides, iron zeolites strongly deactivate during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation and it is unclear from these publications whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time."

          [9] "The time and degree of deactivation in Fig. 2 depend on the catalyst in question."
          [10] "The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample."
          [11] "The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored."
          [12] "The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2)."
          [13] "The propylene yield is significantly higher in st-H-Z than in c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples is rather similar (especially after 40 min on stream)."
          [14] "This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed performance."
          [15] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5."
          [16] "This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
          [17] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
          [18] "This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by Bula nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of 3001200 ppm."
          [19] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."
          [20] "Our results show that deactivation is slower over the steam- activated zeolites (Fig. 2), with a significantly reduced number of Brnsted sites as a consequence of the steam treatment [21]."
          [21] "A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie- Fe-Z."
          [22] "It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction."
          [23] "Further research is required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP."

[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas."
          [2] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."
          [3] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."
          [4] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."
          [5] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
          [2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
          [3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
          [4] "We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."
          [6] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
          [7] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."
          [8] "One alternative explanation could be the fact that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, so leading to a lower conversion, while selectivity increases."
          [9] "The results obtained when the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4 were similar, but less significant (when 1 vol.% N2O is added,conversion decreases from 7.5 to 4.3% and selectivity increases from 34.8 to 41.9%)."
          [10] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 cat- alyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2)."
          [11] "In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%,respectively."
          [12] "However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%)."
          [13] "This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O."
          [14] "Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst."
          [15] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon."
          [16] "This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable."
          [17] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."
          [18] "N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explain- ing the high carbon formation."
          [19] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
          [2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
          [3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
          [4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
          [5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
          [6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."
          [7] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
          [8] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation.
          The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane.
          A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature.
          The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4).
          Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O.
          The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx.
          Such intermediates appear to be essential for propene production. Accordingly, the performance of FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated ODH of propane is severely deteriorated in the presence of small amounts of O2.
          Because the initial ODHP performance was recovered upon air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles has been evaluated.
          The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may also explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K.
          The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2.
          The efficient utilization of N2O in tail-gases should involve a previous purification step. As shown here, the presence of O2 (a typical component of tail-gases) has a negative impact on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5.



[1] "Recently, it has been pro- posed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted con- siderable attention [213]."
          [2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."
          [3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
          [4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination."
          [5] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."
          [6] "In the case of the ODHP with N2O, the presence of the propane reductant in the reaction system makes the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites much more complicated."
          [7] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mecha- nism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O."
          [8] "Accordingly, there is no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
          [3] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
          [4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective ox- idation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

For all V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion.
          The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as com- pared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction.
          There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant.
          In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2.
          The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx.
          The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2.
          From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
          [4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."
          [5] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."
          [6] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [7] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
          [8] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
          [9] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
          [10] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
          [11] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
          [12] "Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
          [13] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O. Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5. The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2. The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [6] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."
          [7] "The XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to ca. 5 wt % do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase."
          [8] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
          [9] "The primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [10] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [11] "The higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [12] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [13] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."
          [14] "The BET values of unloaded MCM-41, MCM-48, and SiO2 support materials amounted to 1040, 1049, and 300 m2/g, respectively."
          [15] "Vanadium-loaded MCM-41 and SiO2 materials showed a decrease in the specific surface area by a factor of ca. 20% for vanadium loadings up to 5.3 wt %."
          [16] "The VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 catalyst lost ca. 50% of the original surface area of MCM-48."
          [17] "The SBET value (52 m2/g) of VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 is significantly lower than those of the other catalysts."
          [18] "As reported in ref 20, the pore structure of MCM-41 is completely destroyed in this sample."
          [19] "Small V2O5 crystallites were observed in this sample by means of ex-situ XRD analysis."
          [20] "The XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to ca. 5 wt % do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase."
          [21] "Additional UV/vis and Raman spectroscopic characterization studies (the data are not shown for brevity) did not indicate a possible presence of XRD-amorphous crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles for samples possessing up to 5.3 wt % vanadium."
          [22] "The calculated vanadium surface densities are 0.37, 0.6, 1.38, and 25.4 for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, VOx(2.9)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, respectively."
          [23] "On the basis of the obtained densities and the literature9 values for a vanadium monolayer (57 V/nm2), it can be safely concluded that all catalytic materials, except for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, possess VOx species below one vanadium monolayer."
          [24] "A single maximum of H2 consumption at ca. 801 and 806 K was observed upon reduction of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 and VOx (2.8)/SiO2, respectively."
          [25] "Additionally to the maximal H2 consumption at 810 K, a small shoulder at ca. 860 K was identified in the TPR profile of the VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 sample."
          [26] "This shoulder becomes more pronounced for the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where crystalline V2O5 phase was identified by XRD analysis."
          [27] "According to the literature data,37,42,43 the peak at 864 K could be due to the presence of highly polymerized VOx species or crystalline V2O5."
          [28] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material at apparent surface vanadium densities below one monolayer."
          [29] "The relative degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the order"
          [30] "The VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possesses microcrystalline V2O5 phase."
          [31] "The next section establishes correlations between the nature of VOx species and their performance in the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O."
          [32] "Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."
          [33] "Since the amount of N2O was double that of O2, both of the above reaction feeds contained the same amount of oxygen atoms."
          [34] "This allows the comparison of the influence of oxidizing agents on the ODP reaction."
          [35] "The TOF (turnover frequency) values of propane conversion in the presence of O2 and N2O over VOx species below (VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48) and above (VOx(11.2)/MCM-41) one monolayer are compared in Table 1."
          [36] "The TOF values were calculated taking the total amount of vanadium atoms into account."
          [37] "This table illustrates that the catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples."
          [38] "This may be due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species over the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst as shown in section 3.1."
          [39] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
          [40] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."
          [41] "For establishing overall mechanistic scheme of the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O over VOx species of different degrees of polymerization, catalytic performance (product selectivity) was determined at different contact times, that is, different degrees of propane conversion."
          [42] "This knowledge is of high importance for catalyst designing, because it provides essential information on the sequence of product formation, that is, the catalyst ability for C3H8 conversion to C3H6 and COx as well as for consecutive C3H6 combustion."
          [43] "The obtained selectivityconversion relationships with O2 are summarized in Figure 1."
          [44] "Propene selectivity decreases, while CO and CO2 selectivities (the data are not shown) increase with an increase in the degree of propane conversion."
          [45] "Such behavior is explained by consecutive oxidation of the primarily formed propene to carbon oxides."
          [46] "For the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, the low propene selectivity at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion is an indication for catalytic activity toward direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to carbon oxides."
          [47] "This reaction pathway does not play any significant role over other catalytic materials with vanadium loading below one monolayer."
          [48] "Over the latter catalysts, CO and CO2 originate mainly via consecutive C3H6 oxidation."
          [49] "Figure 1b illustrates selectivityconversion relationships in the ODP reaction over differently structured VOx species using N2O."
          [50] "As in the presence of O2 (Figure 1a), propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion with N2O, too."
          [51] "However, from the comparison of the results in Figure 1a and b, it is obvious that propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion."
          [52] "This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [53] "From a more detailed analysis of the data in Figure 1, the primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion) and the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx can be derived."
          [54] "These two parameters represent the catalyst activity for direct propane conversion to COx and for consecutive combustion of primarily formed propene, respectively."
          [55] "In the present paper, the dependence of S(C3H6) on X(C3H8) at low propane conversion (<10%) is described by a linear function in eq 1."
          [56] "where S(C3H6)initial and A are the primary propene selectivity and the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, respectively."
          [57] "According to this function, the primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx."
          [58] "This parameter is related to the catalyst activity for propene conversion to carbon oxides."
          [59] "The higher the slope of the function in eq 1, the faster the COx production from C3H6."
          [60] "Establishing the relationships between the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation and the structure of VOx species or the applied oxidizing agent is highly relevant for designing selective catalysts, since propene selectivity in the ODP reaction suffers mainly from the higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."
          [61] "Figure 2 compares the primary S(C3H6) and the catalyst ability (A) for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx over differently structured VOx species in the presence of O2 and N2O."
          [62] "For an O2-containing reaction feed (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40), it is clear that the primary propene selectivity is close for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, and VOx(2.8)/SiO2 materials but is significantly low over VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 (Figure 2 a)."
          [63] "From the characterization results in section 3.1, the latter material possesses microcrystalline V2O5 while other materials are free of microcrystalline V2O5 and possess highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx species."
          [64] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too."
          [65] "The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found:"
          [66] "The degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the same order (section 3.1)."
          [67] "Thus, the higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [68] "This conclusion is in agreement with literature data9 and with our recent results of the ODP reaction on VOx/γ-Al2O3.36"
          [69] "Further insights into the influence of oxidizing agent on product selectivity in the ODP reaction are derived from the analysis of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 ratios at different degrees of propane conversion."
          [70] "Table 1 represents these ratios at propane conversions of ca. 2 and 10%."
          [71] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."
          [72] "However, the ratio of CO2/C3H6 over polymerized VOx species increases from 0.04 to 0.13, while the ratio of CO/C3H6 decreases from 1.7 to 0.27, when N2O is used instead of O2."
          [73] "For both oxidizing agents, the ratios of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 increase with propane conversion, with the former increasing stronger."
          [74] "This increase is less pronounced for a feed with N2O."
          [75] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [76] "This effect is more pronounced for polymerized VOx species."
          [77] "Summarizing, two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [78] "To elucidate possible reasons of the influence of oxidizing agent on the ODP performance of highly dispersed VOx species and microcrystalline V2O5, in-situ UV/vis measurements were performed at 773 K."
          [79] "The degrees of propane and oxidant (O2 and N2O) conversion were controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS)."
          [80] "To ensure a near-to-uniform composition of the studied catalysts along the catalyst bed, propane and oxidant (O2 or N2O) conversions were kept below 5 and 10%, respectively."
          [81] "Figure 3 exemplifies in-situ UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 in oxidizing (O2/Ne = 20/80) and reducing (H2/N2 = 5/95 or C3H8/Ne = 40/60) atmospheres as well as in ODP feeds (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20)."
          [82] "The UV/vis spectrum in a flow of O2 with the absorption at 295 nm is characteristic for tetrahedrally coordinated V5+Ox species."
          [83] "The adsorption in the 400700 nm region (dd transitions of reduced vanadium species) increases upon switching from an O2 flow to a H2 flow (Figure 3a); the UV/vis bands of V4+ and V3+ species appear as broad features in the 400800 nm region (note the nonzero value of the absorption for the reduced samples in this region)."
          [84] "46,47 Similar changes were also observed when the oxidized catalyst was admitted to a C3H8 flow."
          [85] "Since no significant differences in the UV/vis spectra in H2 and C3H8 flows were observed (Figure 3a), the effect of possible carbon-containing deposits in the case of C3H8 flow on the interpretation of UV/vis data can therefore be neglected."
          [86] "Thus, the observed changes in the UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 upon switching from oxidizing to reducing flows reflect the changes in reduction degree of VOx species under different reaction conditions."
          [87] "Taking the above discussion into account, the UV/vis spectra in O2 (20% O2 in Ne) and C3H8 (40% C3H8 in Ne) flows represent oxidized and reduced states of VOx species, respectively."
          [88] "In the following, we compare UV/vis spectra under different ODP conditions (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) with the spectra of oxidized and reduced VOx species to derive insights into the reduction degree of VOx species under reaction conditions."
          [89] "One can see from Figure 3 that the UV/vis spectra during the ODP reaction with O2 (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40) and in an O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) flow are very similar."
          [90] "This means that the oxidation state of VOx species in both cases is close to 5+."
          [91] "However, there is a strong difference between the UV/vis spectra in O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows, while the UV/vis spectra in H2 (H2/N2 = 5/95) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows are very similar."
          [92] "This evidence that the oxidation state of VOx species under conditions of the ODP reaction with N2O (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%) is similar to the reduced one."
          [93] "This means that the oxidation state of vanadium in VOx species decreases from 5+ to 3+ and/or 4+ when the ODP reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2."
          [94] "Another interesting observation from Figure 3 is the appearance of a new band at 400450 nm in the UV/vis spectrum of VOx(2.8)/SiO2 in a C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [95] "A similar band was also identified over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 after 1030 min on stream in C3H8."
          [96] "To prove whether this band may belong to carbon deposits, we performed time-on-stream in-situ UV/vis tests over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 in a H2 flow (H2/N2 = 5/95)."
          [97] "The results are shown in Figure 4."
          [98] "One can see that the band at 400450 nm starts to appear after 10 min and becomes apparent after 30 min on stream in a H2 flow."
          [99] "Since this band appears in the absence of carbon-containing species, its appearance due to coke deposition can be safely excluded."
          [100] "Possible origins of this band are discussed as follows."
          [101] "It is well-known that nondehydrated VOx/silica materials possess octahedral coordinated VOx species, in which adsorbed water is a ligand."
          [102] "On the basis of this experimental fact, it can be suggested that water is formed upon reaction of VOx species over SiO2 and MCM-41 with H2 and adsorbs over reduced VOx species increasing their coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral."
          [103] "However, to draw a more definitive conclusion about the origins of the band at 400450 nm in H2 at 773 K, new additional experiments are required."
          [104] "It is also important to stress that there is no difference in the UV/vis spectra of VOx species under oxidizing conditions before and after treatments in H2 (Figure 4)."
          [105] "Similar results were obtained for all the oxidizing/reduction/reaction cycles described in Figure 3."
          [106] "This means that VOx species remain highly dispersed during the applied treatments and time-on-stream operation."
          [107] "To check if O2 and N2O show different ability (activity) for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species, in-situ UV/vis tests were performed in a transient mode."
          [108] "In these experiments, the oxidized sample was reduced in a flow of C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) at 773 K for 10 min followed by flushing in a Ne flow for 1 min and feeding an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) over the reduced catalyst."
          [109] "The sample was kept in this flow for 30 min to reoxidate reduced VOx species."
          [110] "Hereafter, the reoxidized catalyst was again reduced in C3H8 followed by its reoxidation in a N2O (N2O/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [111] "In all the above experiments, UV/vis spectra from 200 to 800 nm and KubelkaMunk at 700 nm were recorded every 20 and 5 s, respectively."
          [112] "The respective results are summarized in Figure 5 and Figure 6."
          [113] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."
          [114] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."
          [115] "More detailed insights into the kinetics of reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 and reoxidation of reduced ones by O2 and N2O were derived from the analysis of temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function in Figure 6."
          [116] "At time zero, we switched from an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) to a C3H8 flow (C3H8/Ne = 40/60)."
          [117] "As result, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm increases from 0 (fully oxidized VOx species) and reaches a constant value of ca. 0.2 after 5 min on C3H8 stream."
          [118] "Similar changes were observed when H2 was used as a reducing agent instead of C3H8."
          [119] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed changes are due to the reduction of oxidized VOx species by propane and are not due to deposition of carbon-containing species in the case of C3H8."
          [120] "To prove whether the reduction/reoxidation of VOx species is a reversible process, an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) was fed over the reduced sample (at ca. 10 min in Figure 6) followed by C3H8 feeding (at ca. 22 min in Figure 6)."
          [121] "As shown in Figure 6, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm falls from ca. 0.2 to 0 after a few seconds in the O2 flow and reversibly increases to 0.2 in the C3H8 flow."
          [122] "Two important conclusions were derived: (1) reduction/oxidation of VOx species is a reversible process and (2) reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 is slower than reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2."
          [123] "When N2O was used for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species (ca. 3240 min in Figure 6), these species were also reoxidized."
          [124] "However, the temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm are slower than those with O2."
          [125] "From this difference in the temporal profiles, it is concluded that the reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O is slower than by O2."
          [126] "Similar results were obtained for other catalytic materials studied."
          [127] "Taking the difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [128] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [129] "The effect of oxygen species (lattice oxygen or adsorbed) on the ODP reaction was studied by pulsing a mixture of propane and labeled oxygen (18O2) over the catalyst, which was preoxidized by 16O2."
          [130] "COx products containing different oxygen isotopes (16O and 18O) were detected at the reactor outlet."
          [131] "Their transient responses are presented in Figure 7 in a height-normalized form for better comparison of their pulse shapes."
          [132] "The presence of 16O (not pulsed gas-phase oxygen) in CO and CO2 evidences the participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species in combustion of C3H8/C3H6."
          [133] "This result is very similar to previous reported ones over various vanadium-based catalytic materials.27,48,49"
          [134] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
          [135] "However, the concentration of CO2 and CO formed with participation of labeled oxygen (C18O2, C18O16O, and C18O) was significantly lower than C16O2 and C16O."
          [136] "This indicates that C16O and C16O2 are the main COx products."
          [137] "In other words, lattice oxygen of VOx species is mainly responsible for COx formation."
          [138] "Adsorbed oxygen species formed from gas-phase labeled (18O2) oxygen play only a minor role in COx formation under transient vacuum conditions."
          [139] "This may be because the concentration of lattice nonlabeled oxygen in VOx species is considerably higher than that of labeled oxygen in the C3H818O2 pulse."
          [140] "The ratio of vanadium to the amount of 18O2 in one pulse was estimated as ca. 5·104."
          [141] "However, the contribution of adsorbed oxygen species to the formation of COx can be significantly higher under ambient-pressure conditions."
          [142] "We would like to emphasize that no labeled oxygen species in COx was observed in our previous experiments over VOx/γ-Al2O3 under similar conditions in the TAP reactor.27"
          [143] "This can be explained by the fact that incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into VOx species occurs considerably faster over VOx/γ-Al2O3 as compared to SiO2-based catalysts."
          [144] "This assumption is indirectly supported by the recently reported results of the ODP reaction over VOx/Al2O3 50 and VOx/SiO2 51 in cofeed (O2 and C3H8 are fed together) and cyclic (O2 and C3H8 are fed separately and periodically) modes."
          [145] "No substantial differences in propene selectivity between the cofeed and cyclic conditions were found over the alumina-based catalysts, while propene selectivity over the silica-based one was significantly improved when the ODP reaction was performed under the cyclic conditions."
          [146] "In the latter case, the negative effect of adsorbed oxygen species on propene selectivity could be avoided."
          [147] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O."
          [148] "According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [149] "The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2."
          [150] "The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [151] "Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [152] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."
          [153] "The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
          [154] "This is essential for achieving high primary propene selectivity and for suppressing consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2 as shown in Figure 2."
          [155] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
          [156] "Since 710 oxygen atoms are required for COx formation from propane/propene but only one for propene formation, nonselective propane/propene oxidation to COx will be inhibited upon increasing degree of reduction of VOx species."
          [157] "However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for superior performance of N2O as compared to O2."
          [158] "On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."
          [159] "It is well-known 52 that O2 adsorption over reducible metal oxides occurs via a complex sequence of redox processes until O2- (lattice oxygen) is formed."
          [160] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that gas-phase oxygen adsorbs molecularly over anion vacancy of reduced VOx species. 53,54"
          [161] "This biatomic adsorbed oxygen dissociates further yielding lattice oxygen species."
          [162] "Adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species were suggested to be nonselective ones for the ODP reaction over VMgO 55,56 and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 57 catalytic materials."
          [163] "In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O- or O2-, which are considered as selective ones.52"
          [164] "Further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations are in progress with the aim to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species."

[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
          [4] "Taking into account the precision in the measurements, in- troduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes."
          [5] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged."
          [6] "For pure NiMoO4, addition of 300 ppm N2O leads to (Table 2): (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an increase in the selectivity to propylene (+32%), (iii) a decrease in both the conversion of oxygen (19%) and the yield of CO2 (21%)."
          [7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
          [8] "These results could indicate that -Sb2O4 and N2O could probably play the same role, namely, control- ling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction, inhibit- ing non-selective sites."
          [9] "The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products."
          [10] "N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
          [11] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
          [12] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeo- lites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM- 5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
          [2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [5] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxidation, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)."
          [7] "The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products with a prolongation of contact time supports this explanation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indicating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream."
          [8] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."

[1] "N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."
          [2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state."
          [3] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [4] "The Oproduced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene."
          [5] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi- cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain- ing materials [13,2123]."
          [2] "A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24]."
          [3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxida- tion of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.

          [6] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
          [7] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration re- mained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites were present."
          [8] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida- tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."
          [9] "In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation."
          [10] "However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
          [11] "Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to ob- tain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O."
          [12] "The same VOx/ MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane [13,14]."

          [15] "Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."

(1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"
          [3] "A major draw- back of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, al- though the original catalytic activity was completely recov- ered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003)."
          [4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
          [5] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."
          [6] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

          [4] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
          [5] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."
          [6] "Besides, iron zeolites strongly deactivate during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation and it is unclear from these publications whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time."
          [7] "The highest propylene yield was obtained over steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 (22%), followed by the iron zeolites prepared by liquid-ion exchange (16%) and chemical vapor deposition (9%)."
          [8] "The positive effect of steaming on the catalytic performance of iron zeolites for different conver- sions involving N2O, including direct decomposition [15],benzene hydroxylation [14,16,17], and propane oxidation [4,5] has been previously reported."
          [9] "The time and degree of deactivation in Fig. 2 depend on the catalyst in question."
          [10] "The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample."
          [11] "The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored."
          [12] "The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2)."
          [13] "The propylene yield is significantly higher in st-H-Z than in c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples is rather similar (especially after 40 min on stream)."
          [14] "This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed performance."
          [15] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5."
          [16] "This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
          [17] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
          [18] "This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by Bula nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of 3001200 ppm."
          [19] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."
          [20] "Our results show that deactivation is slower over the steam- activated zeolites (Fig. 2), with a significantly reduced number of Brnsted sites as a consequence of the steam treatment [21]."
          [21] "A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie- Fe-Z."
          [22] "It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction."
          [23] "Further research is required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP."

[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas."
          [2] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."
          [3] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."
          [4] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."
          [5] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
          [2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
          [3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
          [4] "We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."
          [6] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
          [7] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."
          [8] "One alternative explanation could be the fact that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, so leading to a lower conversion, while selectivity increases."
          [9] "The results obtained when the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4 were similar, but less significant (when 1 vol.% N2O is added,conversion decreases from 7.5 to 4.3% and selectivity increases from 34.8 to 41.9%)."
          [10] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 cat- alyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2)."
          [11] "In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%,respectively."
          [12] "However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%)."
          [13] "This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O."
          [14] "Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst."
          [15] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon."
          [16] "This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable."
          [17] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."
          [18] "N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explain- ing the high carbon formation."
          [19] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
          [2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
          [3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
          [4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
          [5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
          [6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."
          [7] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
          [8] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation.
          The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane.
          A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature.
          The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4).
          Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O.
          The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx.
          Such intermediates appear to be essential for propene production. Accordingly, the performance of FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated ODH of propane is severely deteriorated in the presence of small amounts of O2.
          Because the initial ODHP performance was recovered upon air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles has been evaluated.
          The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may also explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K.
          The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2.
          The efficient utilization of N2O in tail-gases should involve a previous purification step. As shown here, the presence of O2 (a typical component of tail-gases) has a negative impact on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5.



[1] "Recently, it has been pro- posed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted con- siderable attention [213]."
          [2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."
          [3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
          [4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination."
          [5] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."
          [6] "In the case of the ODHP with N2O, the presence of the propane reductant in the reaction system makes the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites much more complicated."
          [7] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mecha- nism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O."
          [8] "Accordingly, there is no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
          [3] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
          [4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective ox- idation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

For all V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion.
          The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as com- pared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction.
          There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant.
          In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2.
          The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx.
          The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2.
          From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
          [4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."
          [5] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."
          [6] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [7] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
          [8] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
          [9] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
          [10] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
          [11] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
          [12] "Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
          [13] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O. Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5. The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2. The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [6] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."

          [9] "The primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [10] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [11] "The higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [12] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."

          [21] "Additional UV/vis and Raman spectroscopic characterization studies (the data are not shown for brevity) did not indicate a possible presence of XRD-amorphous crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles for samples possessing up to 5.3 wt % vanadium."
          [22] "The calculated vanadium surface densities are 0.37, 0.6, 1.38, and 25.4 for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, VOx(2.9)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, respectively."
          [23] "On the basis of the obtained densities and the literature9 values for a vanadium monolayer (57 V/nm2), it can be safely concluded that all catalytic materials, except for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, possess VOx species below one vanadium monolayer."
          [24] "A single maximum of H2 consumption at ca. 801 and 806 K was observed upon reduction of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 and VOx (2.8)/SiO2, respectively."
          [25] "Additionally to the maximal H2 consumption at 810 K, a small shoulder at ca. 860 K was identified in the TPR profile of the VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 sample."
          [26] "This shoulder becomes more pronounced for the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where crystalline V2O5 phase was identified by XRD analysis."
          [27] "According to the literature data,37,42,43 the peak at 864 K could be due to the presence of highly polymerized VOx species or crystalline V2O5."
          [28] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material at apparent surface vanadium densities below one monolayer."
          [29] "The relative degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the order"
          [30] "The VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possesses microcrystalline V2O5 phase."
          [31] "The next section establishes correlations between the nature of VOx species and their performance in the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O."
          [32] "Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."
          [33] "Since the amount of N2O was double that of O2, both of the above reaction feeds contained the same amount of oxygen atoms."
          [34] "This allows the comparison of the influence of oxidizing agents on the ODP reaction."
          [35] "The TOF (turnover frequency) values of propane conversion in the presence of O2 and N2O over VOx species below (VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48) and above (VOx(11.2)/MCM-41) one monolayer are compared in Table 1."
          [36] "The TOF values were calculated taking the total amount of vanadium atoms into account."
          [37] "This table illustrates that the catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples."
          [38] "This may be due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species over the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst as shown in section 3.1."
          [39] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
          [40] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."
          [41] "For establishing overall mechanistic scheme of the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O over VOx species of different degrees of polymerization, catalytic performance (product selectivity) was determined at different contact times, that is, different degrees of propane conversion."
          [42] "This knowledge is of high importance for catalyst designing, because it provides essential information on the sequence of product formation, that is, the catalyst ability for C3H8 conversion to C3H6 and COx as well as for consecutive C3H6 combustion."
          [43] "The obtained selectivityconversion relationships with O2 are summarized in Figure 1."
          [44] "Propene selectivity decreases, while CO and CO2 selectivities (the data are not shown) increase with an increase in the degree of propane conversion."
          [45] "Such behavior is explained by consecutive oxidation of the primarily formed propene to carbon oxides."
          [46] "For the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, the low propene selectivity at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion is an indication for catalytic activity toward direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to carbon oxides."
          [47] "This reaction pathway does not play any significant role over other catalytic materials with vanadium loading below one monolayer."
          [48] "Over the latter catalysts, CO and CO2 originate mainly via consecutive C3H6 oxidation."
          [49] "Figure 1b illustrates selectivityconversion relationships in the ODP reaction over differently structured VOx species using N2O."
          [50] "As in the presence of O2 (Figure 1a), propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion with N2O, too."
          [51] "However, from the comparison of the results in Figure 1a and b, it is obvious that propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion."
          [52] "This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [53] "From a more detailed analysis of the data in Figure 1, the primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion) and the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx can be derived."
          [54] "These two parameters represent the catalyst activity for direct propane conversion to COx and for consecutive combustion of primarily formed propene, respectively."
          [55] "In the present paper, the dependence of S(C3H6) on X(C3H8) at low propane conversion (<10%) is described by a linear function in eq 1."
          [56] "where S(C3H6)initial and A are the primary propene selectivity and the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, respectively."
          [57] "According to this function, the primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx."
          [58] "This parameter is related to the catalyst activity for propene conversion to carbon oxides."
          [59] "The higher the slope of the function in eq 1, the faster the COx production from C3H6."
          [60] "Establishing the relationships between the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation and the structure of VOx species or the applied oxidizing agent is highly relevant for designing selective catalysts, since propene selectivity in the ODP reaction suffers mainly from the higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."
          [61] "Figure 2 compares the primary S(C3H6) and the catalyst ability (A) for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx over differently structured VOx species in the presence of O2 and N2O."
          [62] "For an O2-containing reaction feed (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40), it is clear that the primary propene selectivity is close for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, and VOx(2.8)/SiO2 materials but is significantly low over VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 (Figure 2 a)."
          [63] "From the characterization results in section 3.1, the latter material possesses microcrystalline V2O5 while other materials are free of microcrystalline V2O5 and possess highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx species."
          [64] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too."
          [65] "The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found:"
          [66] "The degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the same order (section 3.1)."
          [67] "Thus, the higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [68] "This conclusion is in agreement with literature data9 and with our recent results of the ODP reaction on VOx/γ-Al2O3.36"
          [69] "Further insights into the influence of oxidizing agent on product selectivity in the ODP reaction are derived from the analysis of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 ratios at different degrees of propane conversion."
          [70] "Table 1 represents these ratios at propane conversions of ca. 2 and 10%."
          [71] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."
          [72] "However, the ratio of CO2/C3H6 over polymerized VOx species increases from 0.04 to 0.13, while the ratio of CO/C3H6 decreases from 1.7 to 0.27, when N2O is used instead of O2."
          [73] "For both oxidizing agents, the ratios of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 increase with propane conversion, with the former increasing stronger."
          [74] "This increase is less pronounced for a feed with N2O."
          [75] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [76] "This effect is more pronounced for polymerized VOx species."
          [77] "Summarizing, two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [78] "To elucidate possible reasons of the influence of oxidizing agent on the ODP performance of highly dispersed VOx species and microcrystalline V2O5, in-situ UV/vis measurements were performed at 773 K."
          [79] "The degrees of propane and oxidant (O2 and N2O) conversion were controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS)."
          [80] "To ensure a near-to-uniform composition of the studied catalysts along the catalyst bed, propane and oxidant (O2 or N2O) conversions were kept below 5 and 10%, respectively."
          [81] "Figure 3 exemplifies in-situ UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 in oxidizing (O2/Ne = 20/80) and reducing (H2/N2 = 5/95 or C3H8/Ne = 40/60) atmospheres as well as in ODP feeds (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20)."
          [82] "The UV/vis spectrum in a flow of O2 with the absorption at 295 nm is characteristic for tetrahedrally coordinated V5+Ox species."
          [83] "The adsorption in the 400700 nm region (dd transitions of reduced vanadium species) increases upon switching from an O2 flow to a H2 flow (Figure 3a); the UV/vis bands of V4+ and V3+ species appear as broad features in the 400800 nm region (note the nonzero value of the absorption for the reduced samples in this region)."
          [84] "46,47 Similar changes were also observed when the oxidized catalyst was admitted to a C3H8 flow."
          [85] "Since no significant differences in the UV/vis spectra in H2 and C3H8 flows were observed (Figure 3a), the effect of possible carbon-containing deposits in the case of C3H8 flow on the interpretation of UV/vis data can therefore be neglected."
          [86] "Thus, the observed changes in the UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 upon switching from oxidizing to reducing flows reflect the changes in reduction degree of VOx species under different reaction conditions."
          [87] "Taking the above discussion into account, the UV/vis spectra in O2 (20% O2 in Ne) and C3H8 (40% C3H8 in Ne) flows represent oxidized and reduced states of VOx species, respectively."
          [88] "In the following, we compare UV/vis spectra under different ODP conditions (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) with the spectra of oxidized and reduced VOx species to derive insights into the reduction degree of VOx species under reaction conditions."
          [89] "One can see from Figure 3 that the UV/vis spectra during the ODP reaction with O2 (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40) and in an O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) flow are very similar."
          [90] "This means that the oxidation state of VOx species in both cases is close to 5+."
          [91] "However, there is a strong difference between the UV/vis spectra in O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows, while the UV/vis spectra in H2 (H2/N2 = 5/95) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows are very similar."
          [92] "This evidence that the oxidation state of VOx species under conditions of the ODP reaction with N2O (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%) is similar to the reduced one."
          [93] "This means that the oxidation state of vanadium in VOx species decreases from 5+ to 3+ and/or 4+ when the ODP reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2."
          [94] "Another interesting observation from Figure 3 is the appearance of a new band at 400450 nm in the UV/vis spectrum of VOx(2.8)/SiO2 in a C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [95] "A similar band was also identified over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 after 1030 min on stream in C3H8."
          [96] "To prove whether this band may belong to carbon deposits, we performed time-on-stream in-situ UV/vis tests over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 in a H2 flow (H2/N2 = 5/95)."
          [97] "The results are shown in Figure 4."
          [98] "One can see that the band at 400450 nm starts to appear after 10 min and becomes apparent after 30 min on stream in a H2 flow."
          [99] "Since this band appears in the absence of carbon-containing species, its appearance due to coke deposition can be safely excluded."
          [100] "Possible origins of this band are discussed as follows."
          [101] "It is well-known that nondehydrated VOx/silica materials possess octahedral coordinated VOx species, in which adsorbed water is a ligand."
          [102] "On the basis of this experimental fact, it can be suggested that water is formed upon reaction of VOx species over SiO2 and MCM-41 with H2 and adsorbs over reduced VOx species increasing their coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral."
          [103] "However, to draw a more definitive conclusion about the origins of the band at 400450 nm in H2 at 773 K, new additional experiments are required."
          [104] "It is also important to stress that there is no difference in the UV/vis spectra of VOx species under oxidizing conditions before and after treatments in H2 (Figure 4)."
          [105] "Similar results were obtained for all the oxidizing/reduction/reaction cycles described in Figure 3."
          [106] "This means that VOx species remain highly dispersed during the applied treatments and time-on-stream operation."
          [107] "To check if O2 and N2O show different ability (activity) for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species, in-situ UV/vis tests were performed in a transient mode."
          [108] "In these experiments, the oxidized sample was reduced in a flow of C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) at 773 K for 10 min followed by flushing in a Ne flow for 1 min and feeding an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) over the reduced catalyst."
          [109] "The sample was kept in this flow for 30 min to reoxidate reduced VOx species."
          [110] "Hereafter, the reoxidized catalyst was again reduced in C3H8 followed by its reoxidation in a N2O (N2O/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [111] "In all the above experiments, UV/vis spectra from 200 to 800 nm and KubelkaMunk at 700 nm were recorded every 20 and 5 s, respectively."
          [112] "The respective results are summarized in Figure 5 and Figure 6."
          [113] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."
          [114] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."
          [115] "More detailed insights into the kinetics of reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 and reoxidation of reduced ones by O2 and N2O were derived from the analysis of temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function in Figure 6."
          [116] "At time zero, we switched from an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) to a C3H8 flow (C3H8/Ne = 40/60)."
          [117] "As result, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm increases from 0 (fully oxidized VOx species) and reaches a constant value of ca. 0.2 after 5 min on C3H8 stream."
          [118] "Similar changes were observed when H2 was used as a reducing agent instead of C3H8."
          [119] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed changes are due to the reduction of oxidized VOx species by propane and are not due to deposition of carbon-containing species in the case of C3H8."
          [120] "To prove whether the reduction/reoxidation of VOx species is a reversible process, an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) was fed over the reduced sample (at ca. 10 min in Figure 6) followed by C3H8 feeding (at ca. 22 min in Figure 6)."
          [121] "As shown in Figure 6, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm falls from ca. 0.2 to 0 after a few seconds in the O2 flow and reversibly increases to 0.2 in the C3H8 flow."
          [122] "Two important conclusions were derived: (1) reduction/oxidation of VOx species is a reversible process and (2) reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 is slower than reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2."
          [123] "When N2O was used for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species (ca. 3240 min in Figure 6), these species were also reoxidized."
          [124] "However, the temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm are slower than those with O2."
          [125] "From this difference in the temporal profiles, it is concluded that the reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O is slower than by O2."
          [126] "Similar results were obtained for other catalytic materials studied."
          [127] "Taking the difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [128] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [129] "The effect of oxygen species (lattice oxygen or adsorbed) on the ODP reaction was studied by pulsing a mixture of propane and labeled oxygen (18O2) over the catalyst, which was preoxidized by 16O2."
          [130] "COx products containing different oxygen isotopes (16O and 18O) were detected at the reactor outlet."
          [131] "Their transient responses are presented in Figure 7 in a height-normalized form for better comparison of their pulse shapes."
          [132] "The presence of 16O (not pulsed gas-phase oxygen) in CO and CO2 evidences the participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species in combustion of C3H8/C3H6."
          [133] "This result is very similar to previous reported ones over various vanadium-based catalytic materials.27,48,49"
          [134] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
          [135] "However, the concentration of CO2 and CO formed with participation of labeled oxygen (C18O2, C18O16O, and C18O) was significantly lower than C16O2 and C16O."
          [136] "This indicates that C16O and C16O2 are the main COx products."
          [137] "In other words, lattice oxygen of VOx species is mainly responsible for COx formation."
          [138] "Adsorbed oxygen species formed from gas-phase labeled (18O2) oxygen play only a minor role in COx formation under transient vacuum conditions."
          [139] "This may be because the concentration of lattice nonlabeled oxygen in VOx species is considerably higher than that of labeled oxygen in the C3H818O2 pulse."
          [140] "The ratio of vanadium to the amount of 18O2 in one pulse was estimated as ca. 5·104."
          [141] "However, the contribution of adsorbed oxygen species to the formation of COx can be significantly higher under ambient-pressure conditions."
          [142] "We would like to emphasize that no labeled oxygen species in COx was observed in our previous experiments over VOx/γ-Al2O3 under similar conditions in the TAP reactor.27"
          [143] "This can be explained by the fact that incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into VOx species occurs considerably faster over VOx/γ-Al2O3 as compared to SiO2-based catalysts."
          [144] "This assumption is indirectly supported by the recently reported results of the ODP reaction over VOx/Al2O3 50 and VOx/SiO2 51 in cofeed (O2 and C3H8 are fed together) and cyclic (O2 and C3H8 are fed separately and periodically) modes."
          [145] "No substantial differences in propene selectivity between the cofeed and cyclic conditions were found over the alumina-based catalysts, while propene selectivity over the silica-based one was significantly improved when the ODP reaction was performed under the cyclic conditions."
          [146] "In the latter case, the negative effect of adsorbed oxygen species on propene selectivity could be avoided."
          [147] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O."
          [148] "According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [149] "The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2."
          [150] "The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [151] "Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [152] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."
          [153] "The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
          [154] "This is essential for achieving high primary propene selectivity and for suppressing consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2 as shown in Figure 2."
          [155] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
          [156] "Since 710 oxygen atoms are required for COx formation from propane/propene but only one for propene formation, nonselective propane/propene oxidation to COx will be inhibited upon increasing degree of reduction of VOx species."
          [157] "However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for superior performance of N2O as compared to O2."
          [158] "On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."
          [159] "It is well-known 52 that O2 adsorption over reducible metal oxides occurs via a complex sequence of redox processes until O2- (lattice oxygen) is formed."
          [160] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that gas-phase oxygen adsorbs molecularly over anion vacancy of reduced VOx species. 53,54"
          [161] "This biatomic adsorbed oxygen dissociates further yielding lattice oxygen species."
          [162] "Adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species were suggested to be nonselective ones for the ODP reaction over VMgO 55,56 and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 57 catalytic materials."
          [163] "In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O- or O2-, which are considered as selective ones.52"
          [164] "Further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations are in progress with the aim to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species."

[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
          [4] "Taking into account the precision in the measurements, in- troduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes."
          [5] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged."
          [6] "For pure NiMoO4, addition of 300 ppm N2O leads to (Table 2): (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an increase in the selectivity to propylene (+32%), (iii) a decrease in both the conversion of oxygen (19%) and the yield of CO2 (21%)."
          [7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
          [8] "These results could indicate that -Sb2O4 and N2O could probably play the same role, namely, control- ling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction, inhibit- ing non-selective sites."
          [9] "The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products."
          [10] "N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
          [11] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
          [12] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeo- lites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM- 5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
          [2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [5] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxidation, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)."
          [7] "The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products with a prolongation of contact time supports this explanation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indicating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream."
          [8] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."

[1] "N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."
          [2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state."
          [3] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [4] "The Oproduced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene."
          [5] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi- cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain- ing materials [13,2123]."
          [2] "A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24]."
          [3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxida- tion of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.

          [6] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
          [7] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration re- mained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites were present."
          [8] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida- tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."
          [9] "In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation."
          [10] "However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
          [11] "Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to ob- tain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O."
          [12] "The same VOx/ MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane [13,14]."
          [13] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol 1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxi- dizing agent."
          [14] "In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher,amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."
          [15] "Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."

[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"
          [3] "A major draw- back of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, al- though the original catalytic activity was completely recov- ered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003)."
          [4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
          [5] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."
          [6] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

          [4] "The level of detail and accuracy for in situ investigation of coke formation as obtained by TEOM cannot be accomplished using typical approaches to study deactivation, in which coke is characterized after exposing the catalyst to reaction condi- tions and taking samples at defined times for ex situ analyses [1416]."
          [5] "However, TEOM does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level, be- cause the nature of coke as well as its interaction with chemical groups in the zeolite cannot be probed."
          [6] "To gain a better under- standing of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air,complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed."
          [7] "In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion [1720], by monitoring in real time the formation of carbona- ceous deposits and eventual changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous ma- terial."

          [9] "To the best of our knowledge, in situ in- vestigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported."
          [10] "Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts (i.e., to what extent the catalytic performance is recovered on successive re- action and regeneration cycles) has not yet been addressed in detail."

          [4] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
          [5] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."
          [6] "Besides, iron zeolites strongly deactivate during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation and it is unclear from these publications whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time."

          [9] "The time and degree of deactivation in Fig. 2 depend on the catalyst in question."
          [10] "The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample."
          [11] "The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored."
          [12] "The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2)."
          [13] "The propylene yield is significantly higher in st-H-Z than in c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples is rather similar (especially after 40 min on stream)."
          [14] "This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed performance."
          [15] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5."
          [16] "This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
          [17] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
          [18] "This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by Bula nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of 3001200 ppm."
          [19] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."
          [20] "Our results show that deactivation is slower over the steam- activated zeolites (Fig. 2), with a significantly reduced number of Brnsted sites as a consequence of the steam treatment [21]."
          [21] "A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie- Fe-Z."
          [22] "It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction."
          [23] "Further research is required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP."

[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas."
          [2] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."
          [3] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."
          [4] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."
          [5] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
          [2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
          [3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
          [4] "We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
          [5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."
          [6] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
          [7] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."
          [8] "One alternative explanation could be the fact that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, so leading to a lower conversion, while selectivity increases."
          [9] "The results obtained when the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4 were similar, but less significant (when 1 vol.% N2O is added,conversion decreases from 7.5 to 4.3% and selectivity increases from 34.8 to 41.9%)."
          [10] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 cat- alyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2)."
          [11] "In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%,respectively."
          [12] "However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%)."
          [13] "This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O."
          [14] "Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst."
          [15] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon."
          [16] "This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable."
          [17] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."
          [18] "N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explain- ing the high carbon formation."
          [19] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
          [2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
          [3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
          [4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
          [5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
          [6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."
          [7] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
          [8] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation.
          The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane.
          A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature.
          The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4).
          Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O.
          The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx.
          Such intermediates appear to be essential for propene production. Accordingly, the performance of FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated ODH of propane is severely deteriorated in the presence of small amounts of O2.
          Because the initial ODHP performance was recovered upon air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles has been evaluated.
          The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may also explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K.
          The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2.
          The efficient utilization of N2O in tail-gases should involve a previous purification step. As shown here, the presence of O2 (a typical component of tail-gases) has a negative impact on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5.



[1] "Recently, it has been pro- posed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted con- siderable attention [213]."
          [2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."
          [3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
          [4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination."
          [5] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."
          [6] "In the case of the ODHP with N2O, the presence of the propane reductant in the reaction system makes the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites much more complicated."
          [7] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mecha- nism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O."
          [8] "Accordingly, there is no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
          [3] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
          [4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective ox- idation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

For all V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion.
          The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as com- pared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction.
          There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant.
          In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2.
          The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx.
          The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2.
          From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
          [4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."
          [5] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."
          [6] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [7] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
          [8] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
          [9] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
          [10] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
          [11] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
          [12] "Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
          [13] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O. Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5. The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2. The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
          [6] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."

          [11] "The higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [12] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."

          [23] "On the basis of the obtained densities and the literature9 values for a vanadium monolayer (57 V/nm2), it can be safely concluded that all catalytic materials, except for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, possess VOx species below one vanadium monolayer."

          [27] "According to the literature data,37,42,43 the peak at 864 K could be due to the presence of highly polymerized VOx species or crystalline V2O5."

          [46] "For the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, the low propene selectivity at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion is an indication for catalytic activity toward direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to carbon oxides."

          [53] "From a more detailed analysis of the data in Figure 1, the primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion) and the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx can be derived."

          [57] "According to this function, the primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx."
          [58] "This parameter is related to the catalyst activity for propene conversion to carbon oxides."
          [59] "The higher the slope of the function in eq 1, the faster the COx production from C3H6."
          [60] "Establishing the relationships between the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation and the structure of VOx species or the applied oxidizing agent is highly relevant for designing selective catalysts, since propene selectivity in the ODP reaction suffers mainly from the higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."

          [62] "For an O2-containing reaction feed (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40), it is clear that the primary propene selectivity is close for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, and VOx(2.8)/SiO2 materials but is significantly low over VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 (Figure 2 a)."
          [63] "From the characterization results in section 3.1, the latter material possesses microcrystalline V2O5 while other materials are free of microcrystalline V2O5 and possess highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx species."
          [64] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too."
          [65] "The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found:"
          [66] "The degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the same order (section 3.1)."
          [67] "Thus, the higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [68] "This conclusion is in agreement with literature data9 and with our recent results of the ODP reaction on VOx/γ-Al2O3.36"
          [69] "Further insights into the influence of oxidizing agent on product selectivity in the ODP reaction are derived from the analysis of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 ratios at different degrees of propane conversion."
          [70] "Table 1 represents these ratios at propane conversions of ca. 2 and 10%."
          [71] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."
          [72] "However, the ratio of CO2/C3H6 over polymerized VOx species increases from 0.04 to 0.13, while the ratio of CO/C3H6 decreases from 1.7 to 0.27, when N2O is used instead of O2."
          [73] "For both oxidizing agents, the ratios of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 increase with propane conversion, with the former increasing stronger."
          [74] "This increase is less pronounced for a feed with N2O."
          [75] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
          [76] "This effect is more pronounced for polymerized VOx species."
          [77] "Summarizing, two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
          [78] "To elucidate possible reasons of the influence of oxidizing agent on the ODP performance of highly dispersed VOx species and microcrystalline V2O5, in-situ UV/vis measurements were performed at 773 K."
          [79] "The degrees of propane and oxidant (O2 and N2O) conversion were controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS)."
          [80] "To ensure a near-to-uniform composition of the studied catalysts along the catalyst bed, propane and oxidant (O2 or N2O) conversions were kept below 5 and 10%, respectively."
          [81] "Figure 3 exemplifies in-situ UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 in oxidizing (O2/Ne = 20/80) and reducing (H2/N2 = 5/95 or C3H8/Ne = 40/60) atmospheres as well as in ODP feeds (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20)."
          [82] "The UV/vis spectrum in a flow of O2 with the absorption at 295 nm is characteristic for tetrahedrally coordinated V5+Ox species."
          [83] "The adsorption in the 400700 nm region (dd transitions of reduced vanadium species) increases upon switching from an O2 flow to a H2 flow (Figure 3a); the UV/vis bands of V4+ and V3+ species appear as broad features in the 400800 nm region (note the nonzero value of the absorption for the reduced samples in this region)."
          [84] "46,47 Similar changes were also observed when the oxidized catalyst was admitted to a C3H8 flow."
          [85] "Since no significant differences in the UV/vis spectra in H2 and C3H8 flows were observed (Figure 3a), the effect of possible carbon-containing deposits in the case of C3H8 flow on the interpretation of UV/vis data can therefore be neglected."
          [86] "Thus, the observed changes in the UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 upon switching from oxidizing to reducing flows reflect the changes in reduction degree of VOx species under different reaction conditions."
          [87] "Taking the above discussion into account, the UV/vis spectra in O2 (20% O2 in Ne) and C3H8 (40% C3H8 in Ne) flows represent oxidized and reduced states of VOx species, respectively."
          [88] "In the following, we compare UV/vis spectra under different ODP conditions (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) with the spectra of oxidized and reduced VOx species to derive insights into the reduction degree of VOx species under reaction conditions."
          [89] "One can see from Figure 3 that the UV/vis spectra during the ODP reaction with O2 (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40) and in an O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) flow are very similar."
          [90] "This means that the oxidation state of VOx species in both cases is close to 5+."
          [91] "However, there is a strong difference between the UV/vis spectra in O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows, while the UV/vis spectra in H2 (H2/N2 = 5/95) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows are very similar."
          [92] "This evidence that the oxidation state of VOx species under conditions of the ODP reaction with N2O (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%) is similar to the reduced one."
          [93] "This means that the oxidation state of vanadium in VOx species decreases from 5+ to 3+ and/or 4+ when the ODP reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2."
          [94] "Another interesting observation from Figure 3 is the appearance of a new band at 400450 nm in the UV/vis spectrum of VOx(2.8)/SiO2 in a C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [95] "A similar band was also identified over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 after 1030 min on stream in C3H8."
          [96] "To prove whether this band may belong to carbon deposits, we performed time-on-stream in-situ UV/vis tests over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 in a H2 flow (H2/N2 = 5/95)."
          [97] "The results are shown in Figure 4."
          [98] "One can see that the band at 400450 nm starts to appear after 10 min and becomes apparent after 30 min on stream in a H2 flow."
          [99] "Since this band appears in the absence of carbon-containing species, its appearance due to coke deposition can be safely excluded."
          [100] "Possible origins of this band are discussed as follows."
          [101] "It is well-known that nondehydrated VOx/silica materials possess octahedral coordinated VOx species, in which adsorbed water is a ligand."
          [102] "On the basis of this experimental fact, it can be suggested that water is formed upon reaction of VOx species over SiO2 and MCM-41 with H2 and adsorbs over reduced VOx species increasing their coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral."
          [103] "However, to draw a more definitive conclusion about the origins of the band at 400450 nm in H2 at 773 K, new additional experiments are required."
          [104] "It is also important to stress that there is no difference in the UV/vis spectra of VOx species under oxidizing conditions before and after treatments in H2 (Figure 4)."
          [105] "Similar results were obtained for all the oxidizing/reduction/reaction cycles described in Figure 3."
          [106] "This means that VOx species remain highly dispersed during the applied treatments and time-on-stream operation."
          [107] "To check if O2 and N2O show different ability (activity) for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species, in-situ UV/vis tests were performed in a transient mode."
          [108] "In these experiments, the oxidized sample was reduced in a flow of C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) at 773 K for 10 min followed by flushing in a Ne flow for 1 min and feeding an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) over the reduced catalyst."
          [109] "The sample was kept in this flow for 30 min to reoxidate reduced VOx species."
          [110] "Hereafter, the reoxidized catalyst was again reduced in C3H8 followed by its reoxidation in a N2O (N2O/Ne = 40/60) flow."
          [111] "In all the above experiments, UV/vis spectra from 200 to 800 nm and KubelkaMunk at 700 nm were recorded every 20 and 5 s, respectively."
          [112] "The respective results are summarized in Figure 5 and Figure 6."
          [113] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."
          [114] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."
          [115] "More detailed insights into the kinetics of reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 and reoxidation of reduced ones by O2 and N2O were derived from the analysis of temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function in Figure 6."
          [116] "At time zero, we switched from an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) to a C3H8 flow (C3H8/Ne = 40/60)."
          [117] "As result, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm increases from 0 (fully oxidized VOx species) and reaches a constant value of ca. 0.2 after 5 min on C3H8 stream."
          [118] "Similar changes were observed when H2 was used as a reducing agent instead of C3H8."
          [119] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed changes are due to the reduction of oxidized VOx species by propane and are not due to deposition of carbon-containing species in the case of C3H8."
          [120] "To prove whether the reduction/reoxidation of VOx species is a reversible process, an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) was fed over the reduced sample (at ca. 10 min in Figure 6) followed by C3H8 feeding (at ca. 22 min in Figure 6)."
          [121] "As shown in Figure 6, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm falls from ca. 0.2 to 0 after a few seconds in the O2 flow and reversibly increases to 0.2 in the C3H8 flow."
          [122] "Two important conclusions were derived: (1) reduction/oxidation of VOx species is a reversible process and (2) reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 is slower than reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2."
          [123] "When N2O was used for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species (ca. 3240 min in Figure 6), these species were also reoxidized."
          [124] "However, the temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm are slower than those with O2."
          [125] "From this difference in the temporal profiles, it is concluded that the reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O is slower than by O2."
          [126] "Similar results were obtained for other catalytic materials studied."
          [127] "Taking the difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [128] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [129] "The effect of oxygen species (lattice oxygen or adsorbed) on the ODP reaction was studied by pulsing a mixture of propane and labeled oxygen (18O2) over the catalyst, which was preoxidized by 16O2."
          [130] "COx products containing different oxygen isotopes (16O and 18O) were detected at the reactor outlet."
          [131] "Their transient responses are presented in Figure 7 in a height-normalized form for better comparison of their pulse shapes."
          [132] "The presence of 16O (not pulsed gas-phase oxygen) in CO and CO2 evidences the participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species in combustion of C3H8/C3H6."
          [133] "This result is very similar to previous reported ones over various vanadium-based catalytic materials.27,48,49"
          [134] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
          [135] "However, the concentration of CO2 and CO formed with participation of labeled oxygen (C18O2, C18O16O, and C18O) was significantly lower than C16O2 and C16O."
          [136] "This indicates that C16O and C16O2 are the main COx products."
          [137] "In other words, lattice oxygen of VOx species is mainly responsible for COx formation."
          [138] "Adsorbed oxygen species formed from gas-phase labeled (18O2) oxygen play only a minor role in COx formation under transient vacuum conditions."
          [139] "This may be because the concentration of lattice nonlabeled oxygen in VOx species is considerably higher than that of labeled oxygen in the C3H818O2 pulse."
          [140] "The ratio of vanadium to the amount of 18O2 in one pulse was estimated as ca. 5·104."
          [141] "However, the contribution of adsorbed oxygen species to the formation of COx can be significantly higher under ambient-pressure conditions."
          [142] "We would like to emphasize that no labeled oxygen species in COx was observed in our previous experiments over VOx/γ-Al2O3 under similar conditions in the TAP reactor.27"
          [143] "This can be explained by the fact that incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into VOx species occurs considerably faster over VOx/γ-Al2O3 as compared to SiO2-based catalysts."
          [144] "This assumption is indirectly supported by the recently reported results of the ODP reaction over VOx/Al2O3 50 and VOx/SiO2 51 in cofeed (O2 and C3H8 are fed together) and cyclic (O2 and C3H8 are fed separately and periodically) modes."
          [145] "No substantial differences in propene selectivity between the cofeed and cyclic conditions were found over the alumina-based catalysts, while propene selectivity over the silica-based one was significantly improved when the ODP reaction was performed under the cyclic conditions."
          [146] "In the latter case, the negative effect of adsorbed oxygen species on propene selectivity could be avoided."
          [147] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O."
          [148] "According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
          [149] "The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2."
          [150] "The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
          [151] "Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
          [152] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."
          [153] "The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
          [154] "This is essential for achieving high primary propene selectivity and for suppressing consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2 as shown in Figure 2."
          [155] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
          [156] "Since 710 oxygen atoms are required for COx formation from propane/propene but only one for propene formation, nonselective propane/propene oxidation to COx will be inhibited upon increasing degree of reduction of VOx species."
          [157] "However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for superior performance of N2O as compared to O2."
          [158] "On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."
          [159] "It is well-known 52 that O2 adsorption over reducible metal oxides occurs via a complex sequence of redox processes until O2- (lattice oxygen) is formed."
          [160] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that gas-phase oxygen adsorbs molecularly over anion vacancy of reduced VOx species. 53,54"
          [161] "This biatomic adsorbed oxygen dissociates further yielding lattice oxygen species."
          [162] "Adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species were suggested to be nonselective ones for the ODP reaction over VMgO 55,56 and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 57 catalytic materials."
          [163] "In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O- or O2-, which are considered as selective ones.52"
          [164] "Further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations are in progress with the aim to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species."

[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
          [4] "Taking into account the precision in the measurements, in- troduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes."
          [5] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged."
          [6] "For pure NiMoO4, addition of 300 ppm N2O leads to (Table 2): (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an increase in the selectivity to propylene (+32%), (iii) a decrease in both the conversion of oxygen (19%) and the yield of CO2 (21%)."
          [7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
          [8] "These results could indicate that -Sb2O4 and N2O could probably play the same role, namely, control- ling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction, inhibit- ing non-selective sites."
          [9] "The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products."
          [10] "N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
          [11] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
          [12] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeo- lites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM- 5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
          [2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
          [5] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxidation, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)."
          [7] "The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products with a prolongation of contact time supports this explanation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indicating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream."
          [8] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."
