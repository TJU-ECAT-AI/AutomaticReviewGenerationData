Four
 series
 of  chromium
 oxide-based
 catalysts
 containing
 0.7–7  wt.%  of  Cr  were
 prepared
 by  incip-
ient
 wetness
 impregnation
 of  conventional
 amorphous
 silicas
 (SiO2-p;  SBET =  261  m2 g−1 and
 SiO2-a;
SBET =  477  m2 g−1)
 and  mesoporous
 siliceous
 sieves
 with  cubic
 (SBA-1;  SBET =  1181  m2 g−1)  and
 hexagonal
(SBA-15;
 SBET =
 750  m2 g−1)  pore  structure.
 The  combination
 of
 different
 techniques
 (chemical
 analysis
with
 Bunsen–Rupp
 method,
 ICP,  XRD,
 UV–vis
 DRS  and  quantitative/qualitative
 H2-TPR)  in the  char-
acterization
 of  the  calcined
 catalysts
 revealed
 that  the  chromium
 species
 anchored
 on  the surface
 of
mesoporous
 supports
 show  structural
 properties
 similar  to  those
 on  the
 conventional
 silicas,
 but  a  higher
dispersion
 of  chromium
 species
 could
 be achieved
 using  mesoporous
 supports
 due
 to
 their
 much  higher
SBET.  This  reﬂects  in  higher  content
 of
 Cr6+ species
 stabilized
 in  comparison
 with
 conventional
 silicas.
The
 Cr6+ species
 was  found
 to be  crucial
 for  high
 activity  in  the  dehydrogenation
 of  propane
 with  CO2
(DHP–CO2).  The
 rate  of  propene
 formation
 increases
 almost
 proportionally
 to the  concentration
 of  Cr6+
species
 in  the  calcined
 catalysts.
 In  situ
 UV–vis
 DRS  measurements
 during
 DHP–CO2 process  evidences
that
 the  Cr6+ species
 are  reduced
 rapidly  (in  a stream
 of  CO2 +  propane)
 to Cr3+ and  Cr2+ species
 indicating
that
 the  Cr6+ species
 are  rather
 precursor
 than  active  sites,  similar
 as  in  nonoxidative
 dehydrogenation
of
 propane
 (DHP).
 The
 reduction
 of
 Cr6+ species
 generates
 dispersed
 Cr3+ and
 Cr2+ sites  at the beginning
of
 the  DHP–CO2 that  participate
 in  nonoxidative
 pathway
 of  propene
 formation.
 In  the  presence
 of  CO2,
Cr3+ and  Cr2+ sites,  may  participate
 additionally
 in  an  alternative
 oxidative
 pathway
 of  propene  formation
and
 in  a consumption
 of  hydrogen
 produced
 in  the  DHP  by  reverse
 water-gas
 shift  reaction.

 Introduction
Dehydrogenation
 of
 light
 alkanes
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2 is
 con-
sidered
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 alternative
 methods
 of
 obtaining
 valuable
alkenes
 with
 a
 higher
 yield
 than
 in
 the
 non-oxidative
 dehydrogena-
tion
 variation,
 as
 well
 as
 a
 method
 of
 chemical
 CO2 utilization.
 Many
recent
 investigations
 have
 focused
 on
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
to
 propene
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2.
 These
 investigations
 have
 been
encouraged
 by
 a
 strong
 demand
 for
 propene,
 which
 has
 become
one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 petrochemicals
 used
 for
 the
 produc-
tion
 of
 a
 variety
 of
 polymers
 and
 chemical
 intermediates,
 such
 as:
polypropylene,
 acrylonitile,
 OXO
 alcohols,
 isopropyl
 alcohol,
 acrylic
acid
 and
 propylene
 oxide.
So
 far,
 different
 bulk
 and
 supported
 oxide-based
 materials
 con-
taining
 active
 species,
 such
 as:
 Cr
 [1–14],
 Ga
 [6,14–20],
 Zn
 [21],
 Fe
[22],
 V
 [10,23,24],
 In
 [25,26]
 and
 Mn  [27,28]
 have
 been
 investigated
as
 catalysts
 for
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2.

The
 results
 of
 these
 investigations
 lead
 to
 the
 following
 general
conclusions:
(i)
 In
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2,
 propene
 is
 obtained
 simultaneously
with
 dehydrogenation
 and
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 path-
ways.
 The
 promoting
 effect
 of
 CO2 is
 explained
 either
 by
 its
participation
 in
 direct
 oxidation
 of
 propane
 to
 propene
 (1)
 or
the
 consumption
 of
 hydrogen
 in
 the
 reverse
 water-gas
 shift
reaction
 –
 RWGS
 (2),
 which
 shifts
 the
 equilibrium
 of
 propane
dehydrogenation
 (3).

The
 ﬁrst,
 direct
 oxidative
 pathway
 with
 CO2 was
 proposed
in
 the
 case
 of
 redox
 oxides
 (Cr,
 V
 and
 Fe),
 whereas
 in
 the
 case
of
 nonredox
 materials,
 such
 as
 gallium
 oxide-based
 catalysts,
CO2 participates
 mainly
 in
 the
 removal
 of
 H2 in
 the
 reverse
water-gas
 shift
 reaction.
(ii)
 The
 oxide
 catalysts
 which
 are
 active
 in
 the
 non-oxidative
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 propane
 are
 also
 active
 in
 the
 process
 with
 CO2.

Among
 the
 investigated
 materials,
 those
 containing
 Cr
 or
 Ga
were
 found
 to
 be
 the
 most
 active
 and
 selective.
(iii)
 Depending
 on
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 support,
 CO2 has
 a
 promot-
ing
 or
 poisoning
 effect
 on
 its
 catalytic
 properties.
 This
 can
be
 seen
 most
 clearly
 in
 the
 case
 of
 supported
 chromium
 and
gallium
 oxide
 materials.
 CO2 has
 a
 negative
 effect
 on
 the
Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst,
 while
 a
 promoting
 effect
 is
 observed
 over
the
 Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst
 [8,9,13].
 In
 the
 case
 of
 gallium
 oxide
materials,
 CO2 enhances
 the
 dehydrogenation
 activity
 of
 the
Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst
 but
 suppresses
 that
 of
 the
 Ga2O3/Al2O3
and
 Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts
 [17].
The
 catalytic
 activity
 of
 silica-supported
 chromium
 oxide
 mate-
rials
 (Cr/silica)
 depends
 on
 several
 factors
 including
 oxidation
states,
 the
 structure
 of
 the
 Cr
 species
 and
 chromium–silica
 interac-
tion.
 These
 factors
 are
 inﬂuenced
 by
 the
 type
 of
 the
 Cr
 precursor,
preparation
 conditions
 (e.g.,
 calcination
 temperature),
 Cr
 content
and
 the
 properties
 of
 the
 silica
 support
 (e.g.
 iso-electric
 point
 –
IEP)
 [29–31].  Cr
 species
 on
 3+,
 5+
 and
 6+
 oxidation
 states
 coexist
on
 the
 surface
 of
 oxidized
 Cr/silica
 catalysts.
 Below
 the
 monolayer
coverage
 of
 silica,
 Cr
 species
 in
 the
 higher
 oxidation
 states,
 mainly
as
 Cr6+ species
 in
 the
 form
 of
 mono-
 and
 polychromates,
 dominate.
These
 highly
 dispersed
 and
 fully
 accessible
 for
 reactants
 species
 are
believed
 to
 be
 the
 active
 sites
 or
 the
 precursors
 of
 the
 active
 sites
[2,4,32–35].
 When
 the
 Cr
 content
 exceeds
 the
 monolayer
 coverage,
amorphous
 and
 crystalline
 -Cr2O3 are
 formed
 [35].
 The
 forma-
tion
 of
 crystalline
 -Cr2O3,
 which
 is
 the
 most
 thermodynamically
stable
 chromium
 oxide
 phase,
 is
 accelerated
 by
 high
 temperature
and
 by
 the
 excess
 of
 water
 [30].
 The
 presence
 of
 -Cr2O3 on
 the
surface
 of
 silica
 has
 a
 negative
 inﬂuence
 on
 the
 catalytic
 activity
as
 not
 all
 of
 the
 Cr
 atoms
 are
 accessible
 to
 the
 reactant
 molecules.
Moreover,
 crystalline
 -Cr2O3 is
 highly
 resistant
 to
 hydrogen
 and
oxygen
 what
 makes
 it
 useless
 as
 a
 catalyst
 [30].
The
 above
 general
 description
 concerning
 Cr/SiO2 systems
 indi-
cates
 that
 for
 obtaining
 a
 high
 activity,
 a
 high
 dispersion
 of
 Cr
species
 has
 to
 be
 achieved.
 Therefore,
 more
 attention
 has
 been
recently
 paid
 to
 using
 high
 surface
 area
 mesoporous
 materials
 as
the
 supports
 for
 dispersing
 of
 chromium
 species.
 These
 materi-
als
 possess
 a
 2–4
 times
 larger
 surface
 area
 than
 the
 commercial
silica
 gels
 and
 have
 a
 uniform
 pore
 structure.
 So
 far,
 different
Cr-containing
 mesoporous
 sieves
 (MCM-41,
 SBA-1,
 SBA-15
 and
MSU-x)
 prepared
 with
 various
 techniques
 have
 been
 investigated
in
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 with
 CO2 [1,3–5,7,11,12].
In
 this
 work
 we
 presented
 a
 comparative
 study
 of
 the
 catalytic
performance
 of
 chromium
 oxide
 supported
 on
 different
 siliceous
supports
 including
 mesoporous
 sieves
 with
 cubic
 (SBA-1)
 and
hexagonal
 (SBA-15)
 pore
 structure
 and
 two
 commercially
 available
silica.
 Using
 various
 physicochemical
 characterization
 techniques
we
 investigated
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 Cr
 loading
 and
 supports
 proper-
ties
 on
 the
 surface
 composition
 and
 Cr
 dispersion.
 Finally
 based
 on
the
 characterization
 results
 of
 catalysts
 we
 discussed
 the
 catalytic
performance
 in
 the
 DHP–CO2 process.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Preparation
 of
 mesoporous
 supports
 and
 catalysts
Cetyltriethylammonium
 bromide
 (CTEABr)
 was
 synthesized
 by
reaction
 of
 1-bromohexadecane
 (97%,
 Aldrich)
 with
 an
 equimolar
amount
 of
 triethylamine
 (98%,
 Fluka)
 in
 ethanol
 (99.8%,
 Chempur)
under
 reﬂux
 for
 72
 h.
 The
 surfactant
 cetyltriethylammonium
bromide
 (CTEABr)
 was
 puriﬁed
 by
 recrystallization
 from
 chloro-
form/ethyl
 acetate
 mixture
 [36].
SBA-1
 was
 prepared
 under
 acidic
 conditions
 using
 CTEABr
 as
the
 surfactant
 and
 tetraethyl
 orthosilicate
 (TEOS)
 as
 the
 silica
source
 according
 to
 a
 literature
 procedure
 [37].
 In
 a
 typical
 syn-
thesis,
 10
 g
 of
 CTEABr,
 1157
 cm3 of
 distilled
 water
 and
 566
 cm3 of
hydrochloric
 acid
 (37%,
 Chempur)
 were
 combined
 to
 form
 a
 homo-
geneous
 solution,
 which
 was
 cooled
 to
 0 ◦C
 and
 stirred
 (400
 rpm)
for
 30
 min.
 Then
 27.90
 cm3 of
 TEOS
 (98%,
 Aldrich)
 precooled
 to
 0 ◦C
was
 added,
 while
 vigorous
 stirring.
 The
 molar
 composition
 of
 the
reaction
 mixture
 was
 TEOS:CTEABr:HCl:H2O
 =
 1:0.2:56:700.
 Stir-
ring
 was
 continued
 for
 4
 h
 until
 precipitation
 of
 the
 silica-surfactant
assemblies
 was
 complete.
 Next,
 the
 material
 formed
 at
 0 ◦C
 was
aged
 in
 the
 reaction
 mixture
 by
 heating
 at
 100 ◦C
 for
 1
 h,
 to
 improve
cross-linking
 of
 the
 silica
 framework.
 The
 resultant
 precipitate
 was
ﬁltered
 off
 and
 dried
 (without
 washing)
 at
 60 ◦C
 overnight.
 This
material
 was
 washed
 with
 ethanol–water–HCl
 mixture,
 dried
 and
then
 calcined
 in
 air
 by
 rising
 temperature
 from
 ambient
 to
 550 ◦C
over
 9
 h
 period
 and
 then
 keeping
 it
 at
 550 ◦C
 for
 another
 12
 h.
SBA-15
 was
 synthesized
 under
 acidic
 conditions
 using
 Pluronic
P123
 triblock
 copolymer
 (EO20PO70EO20,
 Mav =
 5800,
 from
 Aldrich)
and
 tetraethyl
 orthosilicate
 (TEOS)
 as
 the
 silica
 source.
 In
 a
polypropylene
 bottle,
 8
 g
 of
 Pluronic
 P123
 was
 dissolved
 in
 a
 solu-
tion
 containing
 60
 g
 of
 distilled
 water
 and
 120
 g
 of
 2
 M
 HCl
 at
 35 ◦C.
The
 mixture
 was
 vigorously
 stirred
 until
 complete
 dissolution
 of
Pluronic
 P123.
 Next,
 17
 g
 of
 TEOS
 (98%,
 Aldrich)
 was
 added
 drop-
wise
 to
 the
 clear
 solution,
 while
 continues
 stirring
 (400
 rpm)
 at
35 ◦C.
 Finally,
 the
 mixture
 was
 stirred
 (400
 rpm)
 for
 another
 20
 h
at
 35 ◦C
 and
 then
 hydrothermally
 treated
 under
 static
 conditions
for
 24
 h
 at
 90 ◦C.
 The
 resultant
 white
 precipitate
 was
 ﬁltered
 off
without
 washing,
 dried
 overnight
 at
 60 ◦C
 and
 calcined
 as
 SBA-1
material.
Catalysts
 with
 0.7,
 2.1,
 3.4
 and
 6.8
 wt.%
 of
 Cr
 were
 prepared
 by
the
 incipient
 wetness
 method
 using
 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O
 (Polish
 Chemi-
cal
 Reagents,
 POCh)
 as
 a
 chromium
 source.
 Before
 the
 impregnation
all
 of
 the
 silica
 supports
 were
 dried
 for
 12
 h
 at
 120 ◦C.
 Typically,
1
 g
 of
 a
 mesoporous
 support
 (SBA-1
 or
 SBA-15)
 was
 treated
 with
4.0
 cm3 of
 an
 aqueous
 solution
 containing
 the
 desired
 amount
of
 Cr(NO3)3,
 while
 1
 g
 of
 a
 commercial
 silica
 material
 (SiO2-p
from
 POCh
 or
 SiO2-a
 from
 Aldrich)
 was
 treated
 with
 0.8
 cm3 of
the
 precursor
 solution.
 The
 impregnated
 samples
 were
 dried
 at
room
 temperature
 overnight,
 then
 for
 6
 h
 at
 60 ◦C
 and
 ﬁnally
 cal-
cined
 at
 550 ◦C
 for
 6
 h
 in
 air.
 According
 the
 above
 procedure,
 four
series
 of
 catalysts
 were
 obtained
 and
 were
 designated
 as
 Crx/SBA-
1,
 Crx/SBA-15,
 Crx/SiO2-a
 and
 Crx/SiO2-p,
 respectively,
 where
 x
expresses
 the
 establish
 Cr
 content
 in
 wt.%
 of
 Cr.
2.2.
 Characterization
Total
 Cr
 content
 (Crtot)
 in
 the
 catalysts
 was
 determined
 by
 ICP
spectrometry
 (Perkin
 Elmer
 ELAN
 6100).
 The
 catalysts
 samples
were
 dissolved
 in
 a
 mixture
 of
 HF
 and
 HNO3.
The
 amount
 of
 Cr6+ species
 in
 the
 fresh
 catalysts
 was
 determined
by
 chemical
 analysis
 (Bunsen–Rupp
 method)
 [38].
 The
 method
relies
 on
 treating
 a
 sample
 of
 fresh
 catalyst
 with
 concentrated
 HCl
which
 leads
 to
 reduction
 of
 Cr6+ ions
 to
 Cr3+,
 according
 to
 the
 formal
reaction:
 Cr2O72−+
 6Cl−+
 14H+ =
 3Cl2 +
 2Cr3+ +
 7H2O.
 The
 evolved
Cl2 is
 quantitatively
 determined
 by
 iodometric
 titration.
 It
 should
be
 noted
 that
 in
 this
 method,
 Cr5+ species
 (if
 present
 in
 the
 sample)
are
 determined
 together
 with
 Cr6+ species.
 However,
 the
 amount
of
 the
 former
 species
 in
 the
 supported
 catalysts
 was
 assumed
 to
 be
small,
 typically
 below
 a
 few
 percent
 of
 the
 total
 Cr
 content
 [39,40].
The
 apparatus
 for
 performing
 the
 analysis
 was
 described
 by
 Dere ´
n
et
 al.
 [41].
 In
 a
 typical
 procedure,
 200
 mg  of
 fresh
 catalysts
 was
placed
 into
 a
 vessel
 and
 after
 puriﬁcation
 in
 argon
 ﬂow,
 20
 cm3 of
HCl
 (36
 wt.%,
 POCh)
 was
 added.
 In
 order
 to
 accelerate
 evolving
 of
Cl2,
 the
 mixture
 was
 heated
 up
 to
 80 ◦C
 for
 0.5
 h.
 During
 the
 heating,
the
 mixture
 of
 gases
 (Ar,
 Cl2,
 H2O
 and
 HCl)
 was
 passed
 through
 a
second
 vessel
 ﬁlled
 with
 0.1
 M
 solution
 of
 KI
 (100
 cm3).

Nitrogen
 adsorption–desorption
 isotherms
 were
 measured
 at
−196 ◦C
 using
 a
 Quantachrome
 Autosorb-1
 instrument.
 The
 sam-
ples
 were
 degassed
 at
 250 ◦C
 before
 measurements.
 Speciﬁc

 was
 calculated
 using
 the
 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
 (BET)
method
 within
 the
 relative
 pressure
 range
 P/P0 =
 0.05–0.25.
 Pore
size
 distribution
 was
 determined
 from
 the
 branch
 of
 the
 adsorption
curve,
 using
 the
 Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
 (BJH)
 model.
 Pore
 volume
was
 obtained
 from
 the
 volumes
 of
 nitrogen
 adsorbed
 at
 P/P0 =
 0.95
or

 Air
 Liquide)
served
 as
 a
 combined
 carrier
 and
 reducing
 gas
 at
 a
 total
 ﬂow
 rate
30
 cm3 min−1.
 The
 ﬂow
 rate
 of
 the
 reduction
 mixture
 was
 regulated
by
 mass
 ﬂow
 controller.
 Before
 H2-TPR
 experiments,
 all
 the
 samples
were
 dried
 for
 12
 h
 at
 120 ◦C.
 The
 dry
 catalyst
 sample
 (100
 mg)
 was
preheated
 in
 air
 (99.96
 vol.%,
 Linde)
 at
 550 ◦C
 for
 30
 min
 and
 then
in
 dry
 He
 (99.999
 vol.%,
 Linde,)
 stream
 for
 next
 30
 min.
 Finally,
 the
sample
 was
 cooled
 down
 in
 the
 He
 stream
 and
 the
 H2-TPR
 exper-
iments
 were
 carried
 out.
 The
 temperature
 was
 raised
 from
 100
 to
650 ◦C
 at
 a
 ramp
 rate
 10 ◦C
 min−1.
 The
 H2 consumption
 was
 mea-

 by
 a
 thermal

 and
 NiO

was
 used
 as
 a

 Catalytic
 tests
The
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 (99.6
 vol.%,
 Linde)
 in
 the
 pres-
ence
 of
 CO2 (99.996
 vol.%,
 Linde)
 was
 carried
 out
 in
 a
 ﬂow-type
quartz
 reactor.
 The
 reactor
 was
 a
 single
 quartz
 piece
 with
 two
 sec-
tions:
 inlet
 section
 has
 10
 mm  in
 internal
 diameter
 and
 150
 mm
long
 and
 an
 outlet
 section
 has
 6
 mm
 internal
 diameter
 and
 120
 mm
long.
 The
 two
 sections
 are
 tapered
 and
 the
 catalysts
 bed
 was
located
 on
 quartz
 wool
 just
 above
 the
 tapered
 region.
 The
 rector
was
 packed
 with
 200
 mg  of
 the
 catalyst
 (grain
 size
 0.2–0.3
 mm).
The
 catalyst
 was
 preheated
 in
 a
 stream
 of
 dry
 argon
 (99.999
 vol.%,
Linde)
 for
 30
 min
 at
 550 ◦C
 before
 each
 test,
 and
 then
 the
 reaction
was
 started
 at
 set
 temperature
 (550
 or
 650 ◦C)
 under
 atmospheric
pressure.
 The
 dehydrogenation
 feed
 consisted
 of
 a
 mixture
 of
CO2:C3H8:He
 =
 5:1:9.
 The
 total
 ﬂow
 rate
 was
 30
 cm3 min−1.
 Test
on
 the
 empty
 reactor
 indicates
 that
 at
 650 ◦C
 propane
 conversion
not
 exceeds
 2.5%.
 Calculation

 criteria
 [42]
 indi-
cates
 that
 no
 heat
 and

 exists
 under

 applied
 in
 this
 paper.
The
 reactants
 and

 were
 analyzed
 on-line
 using
 a
gas
 chromatograph
 (Agilent
 6890N)
 equipped
 with
 two
 columns
(Hayesep
 Q
 and
 molecular
 sieve

 and
 a
 thermal

detector.
 The
 column
 packed

 was
 used
 for
 separa-
tion
 of
 H2,
 CO2,
 C2H4,
 C2H6,
 C3H6 and

 The

The

 take
 into

 the
 conversion
 of

 because
 its

 estimate.
 The
 coke
 amount
 was
 esti-
mated
 independently
 from
 the
 amounts
 of
 CO
 and
 CO2 evolved
during
 oxidative
 regeneration
 of
 the
 catalysts.
 In
 these
 experiments
after
 480
 min-on-stream
 the
 catalyst
 was
 heated
 in
 dry
 air
 at
 the
rate
 15 ◦C
 min−1 from

 to
 the
 ﬁnal
 temperature
of
 600 ◦C.
 The
 evolved
 carbon
 oxides
 were
 analyzed
 by
 GC
 equipped

 These
 results
 indicate
 that
 in
 all

 the
 total

 propane
 converted

 not

SBA-15
 were

 with
 X-ray

 (Fig.

The

 characteristic
 for
the

 which
 is
 indexed

 Furthermore,
 the

 reveal
 that
both
 materials
 consist
 of
 aggregated

 (Fig.

SBA-1
 has
 a

 The

 that
 is
attributed

 show
 a

The

 obtained
from
 the

 that
 decreases
 in
 the
 following

 The

 Base

 characterization
3.2.1.
 Cr
 surface
 composition
 over
 various
 siliceous
 supports
The
 presence
 of
 Cr6+ and
 Cr3+ species
 in
 the
 calcined
 catalysts
was
 investigated
 with
 UV–vis
 DR
 spectroscopy
 (Fig.
 3(A–D)).
In
 all
 of
 the
 spectra,
 two
 intensive
 absorption
 bands
 at
 270
 and
360
 nm
 dominate.
 They
 originate
 from
 O
 →
 Cr6+ charge
 transfer
transitions
 of
 chromate
 species.
 Particularly,
 the
 bands
 at
 270
 nm
and
 360
 nm
 are
 the
 results
 of
 the
 transfer
 transitions 1A1 →1T2
(1t1 →
 7t2 and
 6t2 →
 2e)
 and
 1A1 →
 1
 T2 (1t1 →
 2e),
 respectively
[31,48].
 An
 additional
 shoulder
 band
 at
 about
 455
 nm,
 typical
 for
dichromates
 [49],
 is
 also
 present
 and
 its
 intensity
 rises
 gradually
with
 the
 total
 Cr
 content
 indicating
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 polymer-
ization
 degree
 of
 the
 Cr6+ species.
 Moreover,
 the
 latter
 band
 shifts
slightly
 to
 a
 higher
 wavelength
 and
 becomes
 more
 asymmetric
 with
the
 increasing
 Crtot content.
 This
 suggests
 that
 at
 a
 higher
 content,
the
 band
 characteristic
 for
 dichromates
 (455
 nm)
 overlaps
 with
 the
weak
 band
 characteristic
 for
 the
 d–d
 transition
 of
 Cr3+ (A2g →
 T1g)
located
 at
 about
 465
 nm.
 The
 presence
 of
 the
 Cr3+ species
 in

samples
 with
 a
 higher
 Crtot content

sitions

 in

 The

 is

 in
 the

 of
 the
 Crx/SiO2-p,
Crx/SiO2-a
 and
 Crx/SBA-15
 catalysts
 with
 2.1,
 3.4
 and
 6.8
 wt.%
 of
Cr,
 while
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 Crx/SBA-1
 series,
 the
 band
 at
 600
 nm
appears
 only
 in
 the
 spectrum
 of
 the
 sample
 with
 the
 highest
 Cr
content
 (Cr6.8/SBA-1).
 Moreover,
 in
 the
 Crx/SiO2-p,
 Crx/SiO2-a
 and
Crx/SBA-15
 series,
 the
 intensity
 of
 the
 600
 nm
 band
 increases
 grad-
ually
 with
 the
 increase
 of
 the
 Cr
 content,
 indicating
 that
 the
 Cr3+
species
 are
 produced
 after
 exceeding
 the
 monolayer
 coverage
 of
the
 support.
The
 presence
 of
 the
 Cr3+ species
 in
 the
 catalysts
 with
 high
 Cr
loadings
 was
 conﬁrmed
 with

the
 XRD
 results
 reveals
 that
 the
 lines
 of
 -Cr2O3 were
 absent
 in
 the
patterns
 of
 Cr2.1/SiO2-a
 and
 Cr2.1/SBA-15.
 In
 this
 case,
 the
 weak
absorption
 band
 at
 600
 nm
 was
 found
 with
 UV–vis
 DRS.
 This
 may
be
 explained
 either
 by
 high
 dispersion
 or
 by
 a
 smaller
 size
 of
 Cr2O3
crystals.
 However,
 XRD
 is
 not
 a
 sensitive
 technique,
 therefore
 we
cannot
 exclude
 that
 the
 absence
 of
 the
 patterns
 corresponding
 to
-Cr2O3 is
 due
 to
 the
 detection
 limit
 of
 this
 technique.
In
 the
 case
 of
 silica-supported
 chromium
 oxide
 materials,
 crys-
talline
 Cr2O3 particles
 are
 detected
 at
 relatively
 low
 Cr
 contents
 in
comparison
 to
 other
 supports,
 such
 as
 Al2O3 and
 ZrO2.
 For
 exam-
ple,
 Gaspar
 et
 al.
 [29]
 have
 detected
 crystalline
 Cr2O3 in
 the
 Cr/SiO2
samples
 with
 the
 Cr
 content
 of
 1.5
 wt.%,
 while
 McDaniel
 and
 Welch
[50]
 observed
 that
 Cr2O3 was
 formed
 starting
 from
 2.9
 wt.%
 of
Cr.
 Other
 authors
 observed
 the
 formation
 of
 agglomerated
 Cr2O3
species
 even
 in
 Cr/SiO2 samples
 with
 less
 than
 1.5
 wt.%
 of
 Cr
 [32,51].
Such
 tendency
 to
 form
 Cr2O3 clusters,
 rather
 than
 a
 well-dispersed
phase,
 is
 due
 to
 a
 low
 concentration
 of
 reactive
 hydroxyl
 groups
on
 the
 silica
 surface.
 Our
 XRD
 results
 indicate
 that
 in
 the
 group
of
 catalysts
 obtained
 with
 the
 same
 procedure
 (preparation
 condi-
tions,
 precursor,
 etc.)
 the
 formation
 of
 crystalline
 Cr2O3 depends
on
 the
 silica
 support’s
 properties.
 The
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 of
 the
support
 is
 important
 to
 maintain
 a
 high
 dispersion
 of
 chromium
species.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 the
 SiO2-p
 support
 which
 has
 the
 low-
est
 surface
 area
 (SBET =
 261
 m2 g−1),
 crystalline
 Cr2O3 appeared
 in
the
 samples
 starting
 from
 2.1
 wt.%
 of
 Cr,
 while
 over
 SiO2-a
 which
has
 a
 moderate
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 (SBET =
 477
 m2 g−1)
 crystalline
Cr2O3 was
 detected
 with
 XRD
 above
 3.4
 wt.%
 of
 Cr.
 At
 a
 similar
total
 Cr
 content,
 the
 Cr2O3 particles
 appear
 over
 SBA-15-supported
materials
 (SBET =
 750
 m2 g−1).
 The
 latter
 results
 are
 in
 good
 agree-
ment
 with
 the
 recent
 report
 of
 Zhang
 et
 al.
 [52].
 On
 the
 basis
 of
Raman,
 XPS,
 XRD
 and
 UV–vis
 DRS
 studies
 it
 has
 been
 estimated
that
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 CrOx/SBA-15
 catalysts
 (SBET =
 796
 m2 g−1 of
SBA-15
 support),
 obtained
 with
 the
 impregnation
 method,
 agglom-
erated
 Cr3+ species
 appear
 above
 3.6
 wt.%
 of
 Cr
 (Cr
 surface
 density
0.54
 Cr-at.
 nm−2).
 In
 contrast,
 over
 the
 SBA-1
 support
 that
 has
 the
highest
 surface
 area
 (SBET =
 1181
 m2 g−1),
 -Cr2O3 particles
 were
found
 only
 in
 the
 Cr6.8/SBA-1
 sample.
 Similarly
 to
 our
 previous
investigations,
 concerning
 Cr/MCM-41
 systems
 (SBET =
 997
 m2 g−1
of
 MCM-41
 support),
 crystalline
 Cr2O3 was
 detected
 with
 XRD
 in
the
 samples
 with
 the
 Cr
 content
 above
 6.8
 wt.%
 [3].

 the

 of

 in

were
 determined.
In
 the
 case
 of
 the
 Crx/SiO2-a,
 Crx/SBA-15
 and
 Crx/SBA-1
 cat-
alysts,
 the
 content
 of
 the
 Cr6+ species
 increases
 gradually
 with
the
 increase
 of
 Crtot loading,
 while
 in
 the
 Crx/SiO2-p
 series,
 the
maximum
 Cr6+ content
 is
 reached
 in
 the
 Cr3.4/SiO2-p
 catalysts.
 In
the
 latter
 case,
 the
 Cr6+ content
 is
 1.19
 wt.%
 (0.61
 Cr6+ ions
 nm−2)
what
 is
 in
 agreement
 with
 the
 results
 of
 Hakuli
 et
 al.
 [32]
 who
reported
 1.03
 wt.%
 for
 a
 similar
 catalytic
 system
 (using
 SiO2 with
SBET =
 317
 m2 g−1).
 Furthermore,
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 the
 amount
 of
 Crtot
and
 the
 Cr6+ species
 concentration,
 the
 fraction
 of
 the
 Cr3+ species
oxidized
 to
 Cr6+ was
 calculated
 (the
 last
 column
 in
 Table
 2).
 In
all
 of
 the
 catalysts’
 series,
 the
 highest
 fraction
 of
 chromium
 sta-
bilized
 as
 the
 Cr6+ species
 is
 obtained
 at
 the
 lowest
 Crtot content.
The
 Cr6+/Crtot ratio
 decreases
 with
 the
 increase
 of
 the
 Cr
 content,
however
 detailed
 behaviour
 varies
 with
 the
 type
 of
 the
 support.
In
 the
 case
 of
 the
 Crx/SBA-1
 and
 Crx/SBA-15
 series
 the
 Cr6+/Crtot
ratio
 remains
 almost
 constant
 at
 medium
 Crtot contents,
 while
 it
decreases
 at
 the
 highest
 contents.
 In
 contrast
 in
 the
 Crx/SiO2-a
 and
Crx/SiO2-p
 series
 the
 increase
 of
 Crtot always
 leads
 to
 a
 decrease
 of
the
 Cr6+/Crtot ratio.
The

 analysis’
 results
 are
 in
 good
 agreement
 with
the

 Catalysts’
 redox
 properties
Fig.
 5
 presents
 the
 temperature-programmed
 reduction
 proﬁles
of
 the
 fresh
 catalysts.
In
 all
 of
 the
 proﬁles,
 the
 main
 reduction
 peak
 appears
 in
 the
temperature
 range
 between
 400
 and
 460 ◦C.
 This
 peak
 was
 assigned
to
 the
 reduction
 of
 Cr6+ to
 Cr3+ or
 Cr2+ species
 directly
 attached
 to
the
 silica
 materials
 [32].
 Moreover,
 in
 all
 of
 the
 series
 of
 catalysts,
the
 temperature
 maximum
 position
 shifts
 to
 lower
 values
 with
 the
increase
 of
 the
 Cr
 content
 what
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 change
in
 the
 polymerization
 degree
 of
 the
 Cr6+ species.
 Furthermore,
 in
the
 proﬁle
 of
 the
 catalysts
 with
 the
 highest
 Cr
 content
 (except
 for
Cr6.8/SBA-1)
 an
 additional
 reduction
 peak
 at
 ca.
 270–300 ◦C
 has
appeared.
 The
 location
 of
 this
 peak
 coincides
 with
 low
 temperature
reduction
 maximum
 observed
 for
 bulk
 -Cr2O3,
 what
 is
 assigned
to
 the
 reduction
 of
 Cr6+ to
 Cr3+ or
 Cr2+ species
 dispersed
 on
 -Cr2O3
[3,32,53].
Quantitative
 information
 concerning
 the
 H2-consumption
 was
obtained
 from
 the
 TPR
 peak
 areas
 with
 an
 appropriate
 calibra-
tion
 of
 the
 TCD
 signal.
 Fig.
 6(A
 and
 B)
 shows
 the
 variation
 of
H2-consumption
 with
 the
 Crtot and
 Cr6+ content
 as
 well
 as
 the
expected
 H2-consumption
 in
 Cr6+ reduction
 to
 Cr3+ and
 Cr2+
species
 (dot
 lines).
 The
 expected
 values
 were
 calculated
 with
 the
assumption
 that
 all
 chromium
 species
 presented
 in
 the
 catalysts
are
 stabilized
 as
 Cr6+ species
 and
 they
 are
 reduced
 selectively
either
 to
 Cr3+ (2CrO3 +
 3H2 =
 Cr2O3 +
 3H2O;
 H2/Cr
 =
 1.5)
 or
 to
 Cr2+
(CrO3 +
 2H2 =
 CrO2 +
 2H2O;
 H2/Cr
 =
 2.0)
 species.
Fig.
 6(A)
 clearly
 shows
 that
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 catalysts
 with
the
 lowest
 Crtot content,
 the
 H2-consumption
 varies
 within
 a
 nar-
row
 range,
 close
 to
 the
 expected
 values.
 The
 differences
 between
the
 expected
 and
 measured
 H2-consumptions
 increase
 together
with
 the
 rise
 of
 the
 Crtot content.
 This
 indicates
 that
 the
 fraction
of
 nonredox
 Cr
 species
 increases
 rapidly
 above
 the
 monolayer
 cov-
erage.
 Moreover,
 with
 the
 rise
 of
 the
 Crtot content,
 the
 difference
in
 H2-consumption
 between
 the
 catalysts
 series
 also
 increases.
 In
the
 series
 of
 Crx/SiO2-p
 catalysts,
 the
 maximum
 H2-consumption
is
 obtained
 for
 the
 Cr2.1/SiO2-p
 catalyst
 and
 then
 declines
 slightly
for
 the
 catalysts
 with
 higher
 Cr
 contents,
 whereas
 in
 the
 case
 of
Crx/SiO2-a,
 Crx/SBA-15
 and
 Crx/SBA-1
 series,
 the
 rise
 of
 Crtot con-
tent
 (in
 the
 investigated
 range)
 always
 leads
 to
 an
 increase
 of
 the
H2-consumption.
 However,
 the
 H2-consumption
 increases
 more
sharply
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Crx/SBA-1
 series
 than
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Crx/SBA-
15
 and
 Crx/SiO2-a
 series,
 what
 indicates
 that
 SBA-1
 may
 stabilize
a
 much
 bigger
 number
 of
 Cr6+ species
 than
 the
 other
 investigated
supports.
Fig.
 6(B)
 shows
 the
 relation
 between
 the
 H2-consumption
 and
the
 Cr6+ species
 content
 in
 fresh
 catalysts
 determined
 with
 the
Bunsen–Rupp
 method.
 In
 all
 of
 the
 cases
 the
 H2-consumption
 varies
within
 the
 range
 of
 the
 expected
 values
 for
 Cr6+ reduction
 to
 Cr3+
and
 Cr2+ species
 what
 indicates
 that
 both
 of
 the
 species
 exist
 in
 the
H2-reduced
 catalysts.
 Additionally,
 the
 variations
 of
 H2/Cr6+ ratio
with
 the
 Crtot content
 are
 presented
 in
 Fig.
 6(B)
 (inset).
 In
 all
 of
the
 catalyst
 series,
 the
 ratio
 of
 H2/Cr6+ decreases
 gradually
 with
the
 increase
 of
 the
 Crtot content.
 For
 catalysts
 with
 the
 lowest
 Crtot
content
 (∼0.7
 wt.%)
 the
 ratios
 of
 H2/Cr6+ are
 in
 the
 range
 of
 2.0–1.9
what
 indicates
 a
 deep
 reduction
 of
 Cr6+ to
 Cr2+ species,
 whereas
 at
the
 highest
 Crtot content
 the
 ratios
 decrease
 to
 1.55–1.75
 proving
a
 formation
 of
 Cr3+ together
 with
 Cr2+ species.
 A
 similar
 variation
between
 the
 total
 Cr
 content
 in
 the
 catalyst
 and
 the
 concentra-
tion
 of
 Cr2+ and
 Cr3+ species
 in
 catalysts
 reduced
 with
 CO
 or
 H2
has
 been
 previously
 reported
 [31,32]. It
 has
 been
 proposed
 that
 the
Cr2+/Cr3+ratio
 is
 strongly
 inﬂuenced
 by
 chromium
 dispersion.
 At
 a
low
 Cr
 content,
 where
 a
 high
 dispersion
 is
 expected,
 Cr3+ species
migration
 to
 stable
 Cr2O3 clusters
 is
 slow,
 therefore
 Cr3+ may
 be
 fur-
ther
 reduced
 to
 Cr2+.
 However,
 at
 a
 high
 Cr
 content
 the
 dispersion
is
 lower,
 therefore
 the
 reduction
 stops
 at
 Cr2O3 [31].

 for
high
 activity.
Over
 the

resources
 of
 the
 primary
 products
 in
 DHP–CO2 are
 the
 mentioned
above
 three
 reactions.
 Based
 on
 these
 results
 we
 cannot
 indicate
 the
pathway
 of
 CO
 formation,
 because
 it
 can
 be
 produced
 simultane-
ously
 both
 in
 the
 (1)
 and
 (2)
 reactions.
 However,
 taking
 to
 assume
that
 the
 values
 of
 (CO
 +
 H2)/C3H6 ∼
= 1
 and
 the
 ratios
 of
 CO/H2 (the
last
 column
 in
 Table
 3)
 we
 can
 softly
 estimate
 that
 at
 steady
 sate
not
 less
 than
 50%
 of
 propene
 is
 produced
 by
 dehydrogenation
 of
propane
 reaction.
Fig.
 7(A)
 shows
 the
 variation
 between
 the
 Crtot content
 in
 the
four
 series
 of
 catalysts
 and
 the
 initial
 rate
 of
 propene
 formation
 in
the
 DHP–CO2 at
 550 ◦C.
In
 the
 presence
 of
 catalysts
 with
 comparable
 Crtot contents,
the
 rate
 of
 propene
 formation
 decreases
 in
 the
 following
 order:
Crx/SBA-1
 >
 Crx/SBA-15
 >
 Crx/SiO2-a
 >
 Crx/SiO2-p.
 Moreover,
 in
 the
particular
 series
 of
 catalysts,
 the
 rate
 of
 propene
 formation
increases
 steeply
 with
 the
 increase
 of
 the
 Crtot content
 to
 about
2.1
 wt.
 %
 in
 the
 Crx/SiO2-p
 series
 and
 to
 about
 3.4
 wt.%
 in
 the
 other
series.
 After
 exceeding
 the
 mentioned
 contents
 of
 Crtot,
 the
 rate
either
 decreases
 as
 in
 the
 Crx/SiO2-p
 and
 Crx/SiO2-a
 series
 or
 only
slightly
 rises
 as
 in
 the
 other
 investigated
 series
 of
 catalysts.
The
 above
 described
 variation
 between
 Crtot content
 and
propene
 formation
 rate
 can
 be
 explained
 based
 on
 the
 charac-
terization
 results.
 The
 unfavourable
 effect
 observed
 at
 high
 Crtot
contents
 is
 a
 result
 of
 less/no
 active
 crystalline
 -Cr2O3 formation
which
 is
 created
 after
 exceeding
 the
 monolayer
 coverage
 of
 the
 sup-
port.
 It
 is
 clear
 from
 Fig.
 7(B)
 that
 in
 all
 series
 of
 catalysts
 the
 rate
increases
 clearly
 until
 the
 Crtot content
 density
 not
 exceed
 about
 1
Cr
 at.
 nm−2.
 XRD
 results
 (Fig.
 4(A–D))
 proved
 that
 the
 particles
 of
-Cr2O3 are
 presented
 in
 all
 the
 catalysts
 with
 Crtot surface
 density
at
 and
 above
 1
 Cr
 at.
 nm−2.
On
 the
 other
 hand,
 high
 activity
 is
 related
 to
 dispersed
 species.
The
 characterization
 results
 indicate
 that
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 all
 fresh
catalysts
 dominate
 Cr6+ species.
 The
 H2-TPR
 quantitative
 measures
(Fig.
 5(A))
 and
 titrations
 performed
 for
 fresh
 catalysts
 with
 the
 use
of
 the
 Bunsen–Rupp
 method
 (Table
 2),
 proved
 that
 the
 concen-
tration
 of
 Cr6+ species
 in
 the
 catalysts
 changes,
 depending
 on
 the
support
 properties
 and
 Crtot loading,
 in
 a
 way
 similar
 to
 the
 rate
of
 propene
 formation
 in
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 with
 CO2
(Fig.
 7(A)).
 A
 clear
 proportion
 between
 the
 content
 of
 the
 precur-
sor
 of
 active
 sites
 (Cr6+ species)
 in
 calcined
 catalysts
 and
 the
 rate
of
 propene
 formation
 is
 presented
 in
 Fig.
 7(C).
 Regardless
 to
 the
siliceous
 support
 used,
 the
 rate
 increases
 together
 with
 the
 increase
of
 the
 Cr6+ content
 in
 the
 fresh
 catalysts.
In
 the
 case
 of
 silica-supported
 chromium
 oxide
 catalysts,
 it
 has
been
 revealed
 that
 highly
 dispersed,
 coordinately
 unsaturated
 Cr3+
and/or
 Cr2+ sites
 are
 responsible
 for
 the
 activity
 in
 the
 process
 of
nonoxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 hydrocarbons
 [32,39,54].  These
sites
 are
 created
 in
 the
 initial
 stage
 of
 the
 process
 as
 a
 result
 of
reduction
 with
 the
 substrates
 (hydrocarbons)
 of
 the
 dispersed
 Cr6+
species
 present
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 fresh
 or
 regenerated
 with
 air
 cat-
alysts.
 In
 the
 DHP–CO2 the
 primary
 role
 of
 Cr6+ species
 is
 similar
 as
in
 the
 nonoxidative
 reaction.
 E.g.
 Cr6+ species
 present
 in
 the
 fresh
or
 regenerated
 catalysts
 are
 precursors
 of
 highly
 dispersed
 Cr3+
and
 Cr2+ species
 which
 exhibit
 a
 high
 activity
 in
 the
 nonoxidative
pathway
 of
 propene
 formation.
It
 should
 be
 also
 pointed
 that
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2 propene
can
 be
 produced
 not
 only
 by
 nonoxidative
 dehydrogenation
 but
also
 by
 the
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 pathway
 (reactions
 (4)
 and
(5)).
 In
 such
 redox
 cycle
 may
 participates
 Cr6+ species
 are
 reduced
to
 Cr3+ species
 by
 hydrocarbons
 (4)
 and,
 inversely,
 the
 Cr3+ species
are
 oxidized
 with
 CO2 (5)

Taking
 the
 above
 into

 the
 behaviour
 of
 the

during

 with

 monitored
 with
 UV–vis
 dif-
fuse
 reﬂectance
 spectroscopy.

 of

 at

 transfer
of
 chromates
 (at

 disappear
 in
 the
 ﬁrst
 minute
of
 the
 process,
 while
 at
 the
 same
 time
 a
 new
 band
 around
 700
 nm
appears.
 The
 latter
 band
 is
 a
 superposition
 of
 two
 bands
 characteris-
tic
 for
 pseudo-tetrahedral
 Cr2+ (5Tg →5E2g)
 and
 pseudo-octahedral
Cr2+/3+ (5Tg →5E2g/4Tg →4E2g)
 transitions
 and
 it
 indicates
 the
 pres-
ence
 of
 Cr3+/2+ species
 in
 the
 reduced
 catalysts
 [49].
 From
 the
above
 experiment
 it
 is
 clear
 that
 the
 potentially
 active
 in
 oxida-
tive
 dehydrogenation
 Cr6+ species,
 present
 in
 the
 calcined
 catalyst,
are
 unstable
 under
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 with
 CO2 reac-
tion
 conditions.
 The
 Cr6+ species
 are
 rapidly
 reduced
 to
 Cr3+ and
Cr2+ species
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 process
 what
 indicates
 that
CO2 is
 not
 an
 effective
 oxidation
 agent
 and
 under
 the
 reaction
 con-
ditions
 cannot
 stop
 the
 Cr6+ species’
 reduction.
 This
 conclusion
 is
in
 agreement
 with
 our
 and
 other
 researchers’
 observations
 accord-
ing
 to
 which
 CO2 exerts
 a
 very
 small
 oxidative
 effect
 during
 the
regeneration
 of
 reduced
 catalysts
 with
 hydrogen
 or
 hydrocarbons
[3,9,12].
To
 summarize,
 we  can
 conclude
 that
 the
 proportion
 between
 the
catalytic
 performances
 and
 the
 concentration
 of
 the
 Cr6+ species
reported
 in
 Fig.
 7(C)
 is
 due
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 these
 species
 are
 the
precursors
 of
 the
 dispersed
 Cr3+ and
 Cr2+ sites
 which
 have
 a
 high
activity
 in
 the
 nonoxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane.
 However,
the
 in
 situ
 UV–vis
 DR
 experiment
 did
 not
 exclude
 an
 oxidative
pathway
 of
 propene
 formation.
 Both,
 the
 in
 situ
 UV–vis
 DR
 and
quantitative
 H2-TPR
 results
 indicate
 that
 the
 Cr2+ and
 Cr3+ species
exist
 in
 the
 reduced
 catalysts.
 In
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2,
 these
 species
may  participate
 in
 a
 redox
 cycle.
 Such
 oxidation–reduction
 cycles
between
 Cr3+ and
 Cr2+ species
 have
 been
 reported
 in
 many
 reac-
tions
 including
 the
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 ethylbenzene
with
 CO2 as
 well
 as
 the
 reverse
 water-gas
 shift
 reaction
 [56,57].

In
 the
 case
 of
 silica-supported
 chromium
 oxide
 catalysts
 the
deactivation
 can
 be
 caused
 by
 several
 reasons,
 like
 inactive
 Cr
species
 formation
 or
 coke
 deposition.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 Crx/SBA-1
 and
Crx/SBA-15,
 the
 destruction
 of
 mesoporous
 rearrangement
 could
be
 an
 additional
 reason.
 However,
 our
 previous
 investigation
 con-
cerning
 Cr-SBA-1
 systems
 obtained
 with
 direct
 methods
 indicated
that
 several
 dehydrogenation-regeneration
 cycles
 lead
 to
 a
 small,
irreversible
 deactivation
 (deactivation
 that
 cannot
 be
 remove
 by
oxidation
 in
 air)
 assigned
 either
 to
 inactive
 species
 formation
 or
pores
 structure
 destruction
 [4].  This
 leads
 us
 to
 conclusion
 that
 the
primary
 reason
 of
 deactivation
 under
 investigated
 conditions
 in
 the
case
 of
 mesoporous
 catalysts
 (Cr3.4/SBA-1,
 Cr3.4/SBA-15)
 is
 coke
deposition.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 Cr3.4/SiO2-a,
 and
 Cr3.4/SiO2-p
 catalysts
we
 cannot
 exclude
 that
 additional
 reason
 is
 also
 deactivation
 by
inactive
 Cr
 species
 formation
 as
 reported
 previous
 [12].
The
 comparison
 of
 the
 deactivation
 data
 summarized
 in
 Table
 4
with
 the
 catalytic
 results
 presented
 in
 Fig.
 9(A)
 indicates
 that
 the
activity
 loss
 and
 the
 coke
 amount
 rise
 together
 with
 the
 increase
 of
activity.
 Such
 a
 relation
 between
 the
 catalytic
 activity
 and
 the
 deac-
tivation
 data
 can
 be
 explained
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 substrate–product
reactivity.
 Several
 recent
 investigations
 have
 concluded
 that
 in
 the
dehydrogenation
 with
 CO2,
 coke
 is
 produced
 more
 intensively
 from
unsaturated
 hydrocarbons
 than
 from
 the
 saturated
 ones
 [12,58].
Our
 results
 are
 in
 good
 agreement
 with
 that
 observation.
 The
increase
 of
 propene
 concentration
 leads
 to
 an
 increase
 of
 mass
of
 the
 created
 coke
 deposit.
 The
 preliminary
 formation
 of
 coke
from
 propene
 in
 secondary
 reactions
 has
 been
 also
 conﬁrmed
 with
the
 in
 situ
 UV–vis
 DR
 investigation
 during
 nonoxidative
 dehydro-
genation
 of
 propane.
 With
 the
 use
 a
 reactor
 system
 equipped
 with
UV–vis
 diffuse
 reﬂectance
 probes
 (located
 at
 different
 catalyst
 bed
heights).
 Nijhuis
 et
 al.
 [59]
 have
 shown
 that
 the
 coke
 formation
 rate
is
 higher
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 catalyst
 bed,
 where
 the
 concentration
 of
more
 reactive
 propene
 is
 higher.
Finally,
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 Cr3.4/SiO2-p
 catalyst,
 the
 reac-
tion
 conditions
 needed
 for
 obtaining
 the
 initial
 rate
 of

 to
 that

 was

 The

 was
 estimated
on
 the
 basis
 of

 in

 (the

 taking

It
 is
 clear
 from

 over

 the

 leads

 leads
to

 Conclusions
Four
 different
 series
 of
 silica
 supported
 chromium
 oxide-based
catalysts
 varying
 in
 Cr
 content
 were
 prepared
 with
 the
 incipient
wetness
 method,
 characterized
 with
 various
 techniques
 and
 tested
in
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 with
 CO2.
 On
 the
 basis
 of
 the
 results,
the
 following
 conclusions
 can
 be
 drawn:
• In
 terms
 of
 quality,
 similar
 types
 of
 Cr
 sites
 exist
 on
 the
 surface
of
 the
 investigated
 materials.
 The
 Cr6+ species
 directly
 attached
to
 the
 support
 dominate
 at
 a
 low
 total
 Cr
 content,
 whereas
 at
 a
higher
 content,
 after
 exceeding
 monolayer
 coverage
 of
 supports,
the
 particles
 of
 Cr2O3 are
 produced.
• The
 quantitative
 composition
 of
 the
 investigated
 materials
strongly
 depends
 on
 the
 support’s
 properties.
 The
 concentration
of
 the
 Cr6+ species,
 the
 percentage
 of
 the
 Cr3+ species
 (precursor)
oxidized
 to
 high
 valence
 states
 as
 well
 as
 the
 monolayer
 cov-
erage,
 above
 which
 crystalline
 -Cr2O3 is
 produced,
 depend
 on
the
 support’s
 properties,
 especially
 its
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area,
 e.g.
SBA-1
 which
 has
 a
 large
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 stabilizes
 more
 Cr6+
species
 than
 SBA-15
 and
 commercial
 silica
 materials
 which
 have
2–4
 times
 lower
 speciﬁc
 surface
 areas.
• A
 high
 number
 of
 Cr6+ species
 in
 the
 calcined
 catalysts
 is
 crucial
for
 their
 high
 catalytic
 activity
 in
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
to
 propene
 with
 CO2.
 In
 the
 presence
 of
 feed
 (propane
 +
 CO2),
 the
Cr6+ species
 are
 rapidly
 reduced
 to
 dispersed
 Cr2+ and
 Cr3+ species
which
 exhibit
 a
 high
 catalytic
 performance.
 In
 the
 presence
 of
CO2,
 the
 dispersed
 Cr2+ and
 Cr3+ species
 may
 participate
 both
 in
oxidative
 and
 nonoxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane.
