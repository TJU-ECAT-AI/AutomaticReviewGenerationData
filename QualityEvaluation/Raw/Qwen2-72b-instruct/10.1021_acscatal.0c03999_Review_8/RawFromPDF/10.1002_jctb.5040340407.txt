Keywords: Propane; catalytic dehydrogenation; effect of sulphur dioxide; palladium- 
alumina catalyst. 
A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an 
oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional 
dehydrogenation. Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been 
proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research 
on this type of reaction is reported in the literature.'-5 
Although different catalysts, mainly metal oxides and sulphides, have been used for the above 
process, little has been published on the kinetics5 
and/or the use of metals as catalysts for this type of 
rea~tion.~ 
The present communication deals with preliminary kinetic investigations of the reaction of 
propane and propane with sulphur dioxide over a palladium-alumina catalyst. This formed part of

the author's studies of the catalytic behaviour of chromia-alumina and palladium-alumina in 
propane dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene? potentially important 
industrial processes. In order to resolve some of the kinetic uncertainties of such processes, the rate 
dependence on selected partial pressures of propane were studied under controlled conditions. 
Propane, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur dioxide were high purity products (BOC). Catalyst, 
containing 0.5% by wt Pd-AI2O3 
was supplied by Engelhard (UK) with fairly uniform particles of 
about 1.6mm in size and surface area of 250 m2 g-'. Kinetic measurements were carried out in a 
fixed bed flow reactor similar to that used earlier' and at a total pressure of about 100 kPa. The 
temperature of the reactor was kept constant to within 21 
K. The products were analysed by gas 
chromatography. 
The space velocity used was fairly high (600 h-I) and close to industrial rates (the considerable gas 
flow eliminates the possibility of external diffusion inhibition). The high activation energies and the 
absence of discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots (Figure 1) indicate that the investigations were 
carried out in ranges well removed from inter- and intra-diffusion conditions. 
The catalyst activity was constant over a period of 3 h before it lost some of its activity owing to 
coke formation. 
Complete regeneration occurred easily with oxygen followed by hydrogen at 773 K. 
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated in the temperature range 
825-884 K. The effect of propane partial pressure (nitrogen was used as a diluent) on the rate of 
dehydrogenation to propylene is shown in Figure 2. The results suggest first order kinetics with an

apparent activation energy of 128 
kJ mol-' (Figure 1). This value is lower than those obtained on 
Pt-AlZ02 
(170.1 kJ mol-l) and on chromia-aluminag (141.7 kJ mol-'), suggesting that Pd-AlZO3 
is 
more active in facilitating the breakage of a C-H bond in the propane molecule. 
The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as 
shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably. For 
example at 855 K, selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion (with 0.0134 mol of 
sulphur dioxide present in the feed) as compared with 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the 
absence of SOz. 
An apparent activation energy of 109.5 
kJ mol-' was obtained from Figure 1. 
The 
reaction of propane with sulphur dioxide can be written as:

In the present experiments, in addition to HzS and H20, the effluent from reaction (1) also 
contained carbon dioxide. This was formed in large amounts at the early stages of the reaction and 
then decreased with operating time, suggesting that the catalyst was quite active initially. In one 
experiment the selectivity to propylene formation increased from 14.8 to 20.3% over a period of 
50 min. 
In conclusion it appears from the data obtained that the effect of sulphur dioxide on the 
mechanism of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is complex. The presence of COz, 
among 
other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the 
propylene product may be oxidised to C02 and HzO.
