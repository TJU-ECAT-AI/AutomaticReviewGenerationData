Abstract
PtSnK/ZSM-5 catalysts with different amounts of K were prepared by the sequential impregnation method on HZSM-5 zeolites, and their catalytic activities and stabilities in propane dehydrogenation were investigated. The effect of the addition of K on the physicochemical properties was studied by means of BET, XRD, SEM, NH3-TPD, TPR, and TPO. The results indicated that the addition of K had an obvious impact on the catalytic performance of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst. A suitable amount of K could not only change the acid of the catalysts but also improve the relation between metals and the support, thus reduce the deactivation rate and increase the selectivity to propylene. It was found that the propylene selectivity and yield could reach the maximum when the content of K was 0.8%.

1 Introduction
Due to its important role in a myriad of chemical applications such in the production of polypropylene, cumene, etc., the propylene has gained more and more attention [1]. So far, a major part of the propylene demand has been supplied by conventional crackers [2–4]. Nevertheless, these conventional crackers are failing to meet the need of the increasing demands of the propylene [5]. As a result, the new technologies of dehydrogenation of propane for propylene have been developed. Among these methods, dehydrogenation of propane has gained more and more focus as a result of its special advantages.
As the propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, it requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propylene. However, the high reaction temperature favors thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes which lead to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation [5]. Consequently, it is important to develop a catalyst exhibiting high activity, high stability, and high selectivity for the industrialization of propane dehydrogenation [6].
So far, the most researches were mainly on the chromium and platinum based catalysts which loaded on the different supporters. As the chromium posed great danger to the environment, the platinum supported catalysts are mainly studied. The researches on the platinum supported on the alumina have been carried out many years and made great progresses [7–11], the main method taken to modify the Pt based catalysts is to add some metals such as Re, In, Sn, Ga, Bi [12–15]. However, the catalysts still have some defects on the stability and activity. Recently, Pt/ZSM-5 applied as a catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation has been extended investigated as a result of its specific framework structure and the low aluminum content. Then, the modification of the Pt/ZSM-5 deserved more and more attention from both theoretical and practical points of view [16, 17].
In our previous study, many studies were carried out on the Pt/ZSM-5 [18–24]. Promoters such as Sn, Na, La, and Mg have been already added. It’s believed that Sn reduces coke formation by suppressing side reactions thus increasing catalyst stability, increases the dispersion of Pt by its geometrical effect thus increasing the catalyst activity. The addition of Na, La, and Mg can neutralize the strong acid sites on the surface of the catalysts and improve the relationships among the metals and the supporters.
Many researches had been already studied on the effect of addition of K to the PtSn/Al2O3, the Josephine et al. [25] found that the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/K-L maintained the higher dehydrogenation selectivity but led to the lower isobutene conversion, improved the resistance of these catalysts to coking and decreased the size of the Pt surface ensembles, thereby suppressing the hydrogenolysis, isomerization and coking reactions. Tasbihi et al. [26] also found that suitable and sufficient weight percentage of K as the promoter for reducing acidity of the support caused the highest selectivity to isobutene.
Although the addition of K on the PtSn/Al2O3 was proved to improve the catalytic properties greatly, no detail data about the K added to the PtSn/ZSM-5 was supplied by the papers so far. In order to further the study, PtSnK/ZSM-5 catalysts with different amounts of potassium were prepared for propane dehydrogenation in this paper. Technologies including XRD, nitrogen adsorption, metal dispersion, NH3-TPD, TPR, and TPO were used to study the catalysts’ characterization.
2 Experimental
2.1 Catalysts Preparation
PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation method. The powder H-ZSM-5 was impregnated at 80 °C for 4 h in solutions mixture of 0.033 M H2PtCl6, 0.153 M SnCl4 then dried at 80 °C for 3 h. The metal content in the sample was 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.0 wt% Sn.
PtSnK/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by the sequential impregnation method. HZSM-5 powder was initially impregnated in an aqueous solution of different molal concentration of KCl at 80 °C for 4 h, impregnated a second time in the same method of PtSn/ZSM-5. The nominal composition of each sample was 0.5 wt% Pt, 1.0 wt% Sn, and w% K.
2.2 Catalysts Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the different samples were obtained on a XD-3A X-ray powder diffractometer coupled to a copper anode tube. The Ka radiation was selected with a diffracted beam monochromator. An angular range 2β from 0° to 90° was recorded using step scanning and long counting times to determine the positions of the ZSM-5 peaks.
N2-adsorption studies were used to examine the porous properties of each sample. The measurements were carried out on Micromeritics ASAP 2020 adsorptive and desorptive apparatus, and all the samples were pretreated in vacuum at 350 °C for 4 h before the measurement. The specific surface area was obtained using the BET method. The microporous volume was calculated from the t-plot method.
Metal dispersion was measured by the ASAP 2020 chemisorption software; the data was investigated for the characters about the Pt particles on the catalysts. About 0.8 g of sample was measured; H2 was used as adsorption gas. All the samples were pretreated in the vacuum first at 250 °C for 4 h, then with the flow of H2 at 500 °C for 120 min, analyzed at 35 °C.
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were carried out to determine the acid properties of zeolites by using ammonia as an adsorbate. About 0.15 g of sample was placed in a quartz reactor and saturated with ammonia at room temperature. TPD was carried out from 100 to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and with helium (30 ml min−1) as the carrier gas.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was measured with the same apparatus as that of NH3-TPD. Prior to the TPR experiments, the catalysts were dried in flowing N2 at 100 °C for 1 h. 5% H2/N2 was used as the reducing gas at a flow rate of 35 ml min−1. The rate of temperature rise in the TPR experiment was 10 °C min−1 up to 800 °C.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was measured with the apparatus as the same as TPR. About 0.05 g of sample was placed in a quartz reactor at room temperature, then heated up to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in a 5% O2/He mixture (30 ml min−1).
2.3 Catalytic Reaction
Propane dehydrogenation was carried out in a quartz tubular micro-reactor which is showed in Fig. 1. The catalyst (mass 2 g) was placed into the center of the reactor with the reaction condition of conditions of 590 °C for reaction temperature, 0.1 MPa pressure, H2/C3 = 0.25 (molar ratio) and the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is 3 h−1. The reaction products were analyzed with an online GC-14C gas chromatography.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Analysis of XRD
XRD patterns of the different catalysts imply that the addition of the K did not influence the structure of the zeolite. As the average diameters of K+ are 0.133 nm which is less than those of ZSM-5 pore mouth, so it’s possible that part of K+ cations enter into the main channels of ZSM-5 zeolite during the process of impregnation. According to the previous results [19–21], the platinum species were well dispersed on the external surface of the catalyst. Due to their relatively large average diameters, the platinum species are well dispersed on the external surface of the catalysts.
Furthermore, it can be seen from the Fig. 2 that the intensities of peaks of PtSnK/ZSM-5 below 20° 2θ decrease as the K species loading increases. Generally, the low-angle XRD intensities in the pattern of ZSM-5 are sensitive to the presence of any species inside the channels [21] and the peak at 2θ = 8–9° and 2θ = 23–25° are the typical peaks of the ZSM-5, which means the loading of K does not destruct the structure of the support.

Therefore, the decreases of peak intensity of low-angle also imply the entrance of K species into the channels.
Table 1 lists the basic characterization data of the different catalysts. As can be seen from the table, the surface area tends to decrease with the increase of K loading. These results again imply that some K species have already entered into the channels and the other load on the external surface of the zeilote. The continuously addition of K can influence the metallic Pt dispersion obviously, we can find the catalyst with the content of K is 0.8%, the Pt Metal Dispersion has the highest value, which means that the suitable amount of K added to the catalyst may help the dispersion of the Pt, the PtSnK(0.8%)/ZSM-5 catalyst has the most active sites. As the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst occurs mainly on metallic Pt, the change about the dispersion of Pt particles would have some impacts on the activity of the catalysts.

3.2 Temperature-programmed Reduction
Temperature-programmed Reduction is an ideal technology to provide the data about interactions of metals and zeolites influenced by the addition of K. Figure 5 shows the TPR profiles of different catalysts. It is observed that the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst presents three peaks: a peak at about 300 °C, and also two other peaks at about 450 and 600 °C. Generally, the signal at 300 °C is ascribed to reduction of Pt species, whereas the high-temperature peaks represent reduction of Sn4+ to Sn2+ and Sn2+ to Sn0, respectively [25]. When the content of potassium is in the range of 0.2%–0.8%, no obvious changes in the shape of TPR profiles are observed except that the reduction temperature of Pt species movies towards the lower range.

Full size image
With the continuous addition of K (1.2%), the reduction peak area of Sn species at high temperature increases obviously, indicating that the addition of potassium promotes the reduction of Sn species. It’s clearly that the reduction peak at high temperature shifts toward the lower range continuously, thus shortening the distance of the two reduction peaks for Sn species between the low and high temperatures. Thus, the corresponding hydrogen consumption peaks about the reduction of Sn species are almost overlapped so that we hardly distinguished the two peaks.
These results indicate that the excessive addition of K weakens the interactions between Sn species and ZSM-5 carrier obviously, thus making the reduction of Sn species to form Sn0 easily. According to Tasbihi et al. [26], the addition of K and Sn to Pt led to a direct interaction between these metals. Therefore, it can be concluded that the excessive addition of potassium has significantly affected the interaction between Pt and Sn and help the formation of Pt–Sn alloy. According to the previous studies, the Pt–Sn alloy is post great harm to the catalyst’s activity. It may be the main reason to the lower activity with excessive addition of potassium.
3.3 NH3-TPD Measurements
As the addition of the K also has a great influence on the acid sites on the catalysts, Fig. 6 shows the NH3-TPD profiles of different catalysts. From the profiles, it can be seen that there are two desorption peaks: the first desorption peak at about 240 °C and the second one at about 450 °C. It generally attributes the first peak to the weak acid sites on Si–O-Si and some physical ammonia adsorption, whereas the second peak is assigned to the strong acid sites, which are related to the framework Al species [27, 28].

Full size image
From the profiles, we can find that the acid sites decreased after the addition of K. With the increasing amount of potassium, the peak in the low temperature has the tendency to move toward to the lower temperature and the high temperature peak almost disappears. These indicate that the addition of K may neutralize the strong acid sites preferentially and the continuous addition of K, the acid intensities decrease monotonously. However, K is also the weak acid while it is the strong base. As a result, with the continuous addition of K, some acid sites of moderate intensity appear, implying that the excessive addition of K (1.2%) increases the catalyst weak acidity obviously.
3.4 Influence of K on Coke Deposits of PtSn/ZSM-5 Catalyst
The catalysts would lose their activity after a long time of reaction. Generally, the main reason to the de-active is the coke deposition on the catalyst, which blocks the activity sites where the Pt species dispersed on and plugs up the channel where the propylene outflows. So it’s important to take the factor of anti-coking into the catalyst modification. It can be concluded from the previous study, the process of coke formation on the external surface and the supporter channels of the catalyst mainly involves the highly dehydrogenated of hydrocarbon on the surface of active sites and the succedent oligomerization and cyclization on the acid sites of the catalyst [29]. According to this mechanism, some reaction products during the process of propane dehydrogenation, such as propene and ethene will also form into carbon deposits.
Figure 7 shows the TPO profiles of the different catalysts. It’s reported that there were two kinds of cokes on the zeolite catalyst [30], one kind of cokes deposits on the surface of the metal presents the peak at the low temperature, whereas the other kind of cokes formed in the channel of the zeolite presents the peak at the higher temperature about at 520 °C. From the TPO profiles, we can only find the peaks at the high temperature. This is because in 8 h reaction, the low-temperature coke is too little to be detected. However, the high temperature peak is clear, it can be seen that the carbon amount decreases gradually as the addition of K. The main reason to this is the addition of K neutralizes some acid sites especially the high intensity acid sites of the catalyst, thus inhibiting the process of transform and aggradation of the coke precursors on the acid surface of the catalyst, which favors improved action of coke. And these results are according to the conclusion from the NH3-TPD profiles.

3.5 Influence of K on Catalytic Properties of Catalyst
The changes of the conversion of the propane are presented in the Fig. 6, the initial activity of the PtSn/ZSM-5 is high, but the reaction stability is very poor. After 8 h reaction, the conversion of the propane has declined to 16.8%. Opposite to this, an obvious improvement in the catalytic stability is observed after the addition of 0.5wt% potassium. The more content of K added the more stable of the conversion. As for the PtSnK(0.8%)/ZSM-5 catalyst, the propane conversion decreases only about 1.9% after the reaction. However, with the excessive addition of potassium, not only the decreased initial activity but also the degressive reaction stability is found.
These results indicate that the addition of K has obvious impact on the catalytic properties of PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It’s reported that the catalysts are bifunctional and the two active centers of PtSn/ZSM-5 (the metal particle and the acid site) may work collaboratively [31]. It’s reasonable to reach a conclusion that an optimum ratio between the active sites and the acid sites may exist. It can be seen from the Fig. 5 that the active sites are stabilized from PtSn(0.5)/ZSM-5 to PtSnK(1.2%)/ZSM-5 catalysts and the catalytic acidity decreases at the same time. Therefore, the initial matching between the metallic function and acid function of PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst is improved. From Fig. 8, It is clear that the PtSnK(0.8%)/ZSM-5 catalyst possesses the best ratio between the number of active sites and the number of acid sites. However, with the continuous addition of K, the character of Pt active sites has changed obviously. In these cases, Pt metal dispersion has reduced as the excess addition of K (after the content is 0.8%). As a result, the multiple interactions between Pt, SnOx and K+ can coexist and the catalytic performance can be affected certainly because these interactions between the three components are considered to be responsible for the stabilization of Pt in its oxidized state [32]. In other words, more amounts of Pt may exist as the style of Pt–Sn alloy with the excess addition of K, which diminishes the character of Pt active sites. Therefore, the initial matching between the metallic function and acid function in PtSnK(0.8%)/ZSM-5 catalyst would be destroyed effectively, which is disadvantageous to the reaction. Because of it, the initial propane conversion of PtSnK(1.2%)/ZSM-5 catalyst drops to 28.4%.

Figure 9 shows the change of propylene selectivity. We can see from the profiles, the selectivity of propylene increased greatly with the continuously addition of K. When the content of K is 0.8%, the average selectivity to propylene is 91.43%, while the PtSn/ZSM-5 has only 37.3%. According to the NH3-TPD results, the addition of K can neutralize some acid sites where the by-products such as methane, ethane, and ethene generated. However, as the continuously addition of K, the weak acid sites has increased, which decrease the selectivity to the propylene. It’s reported that there are two kinds of active Pt species loading on the surface of the catalyst, named M1 sites and M2 sites [33]. Due to more Pt species, M1 is apt to the reactions of cracking and hydrogenolysis, while M2 sites correspond to the sites in which Pt anchors an Sn oxide surface, then forms a “sandwich” structure. The two sites are the main reaction active sites for the dehydrogenation of propane. As mentioned above, the excessive addition of K promotes the reduction of the Sn species, which can destroy the initial M2 sites with the “sandwich” structure. Consequently, the main active sites of the catalysts are M1 sites. It is obviously that different amounts of K can have an obvious impact on the catalytic behavior of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.

4 Conclusion
From the above results, it is clear that the addition of K has a great influence on the catalytic performance of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Suitable amount of K can not only decrease the acid sites on the surface, but also improve the interaction of the metallic Pt, Sn and the supporter, leading to the best matching of metallic function and acid function of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst, which will improve the activity of the catalysts and prevent the coke formation of the catalysts.
However, excessive addition of K will continuously reduce the strong acid sites which do great influence to the dehydrogenation reaction and decrease the Pt metal dispersion, break the best ratio of acid sites and active sites; thus the activity and the stability of the catalysts will decrease obviously.
Consequently, the addition of suitable amount of K has a great advantage to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
