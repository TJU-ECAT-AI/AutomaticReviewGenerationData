In the last 20 years, nanostructured gold species have received increasing attention due to their activity in
many reactions such as selective oxidations and reductions of ﬁne organic chemicals, both in gas phase
and in liquid phase. Here, we report that gold nanoparticles prepared from Au/CH3COCH3 solution
(obtained from gold vapours and acetone by the Metal Vapour Synthesis technique) can be directly
deposited on a wide series of different supports (C, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CeO2, TiO2 and ZrO2) with their small
dimensions being maintained. The supported gold nanoclusters thus obtained are effective catalysts
for the hydrosilylation of acetylenic compounds. The catalytic performance of Au is deﬁned by two major
factors: particle size and choice of support. For instance, the results obtained from the reaction of 1-hex-
yne with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05 mol%) demonstrate the high selectivity and
the excellent speciﬁc activities typical of these gold catalysts.

1. Introduction
Gold is a metal that has fascinated mankind since it was ﬁrst
discovered. Its ductility and its ability to preserve colour and bril-
liance when exposed to the atmosphere led it to be considered the
most noble of metals and used as a base material for many beauti-
ful historical artefacts and works of art. While the golden metal
fascinated ancient alchemists, modern chemists considered it too
noble to be catalytically active until the last two decades. The dis-
coveries made contemporaneously by Haruta [1] and Hutchings [2]
demonstrated that gold, when sub-divided to the nanoscale, could
be not only a good catalyst, but even the best catalyst for CO oxi-
dation and ethyne chlorination. In particular, Haruta pointed out
that the catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles in the low temper-
ature CO oxidation was markedly enhanced when the particles
were less than 6 nm in diameter. Not long after these two discov-
eries, the interest in gold as a homogeneous and heterogeneous
catalyst expanded as demonstrated by several recent reviews [3–
9]. Today the ‘‘yellow metal” is considered the catalyst of choice
for many reactions such as the direct formation of hydrogen perox-
ide from H2 and O2 [10], the hydrogenation of N–O bonds [11], the
selective oxidation of hydrocarbons [12–15] (propene and styrene
epoxidation, the conversion of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and
cyclohexanone, the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones,
and of sugars and polyols to acids) and the addition of nucleophiles
to C–C multiple bonds. Indeed the ability of gold to coordinate with
triple bonds has no parallel with other transition metals. Upon
coordination and formation of the corresponding adduct, the al-
kyne becomes activated and more reactive towards nucleophiles
such as alcohols [16], water [17], amines [18] and hydrosilanes.
In the ﬁeld of hydrosilylation reactions, gold was ignored until
2000 when Hosomi and co-workers [19] described the ﬁrst exam-
ple of silane addition to aldehydes using a catalytic amount of
AuCl(PPh3). Their work stimulated other research groups [20–25]
that investigated gold-catalyzed hydrosilylations of carbonyl and
oleﬁn substrates. Recently, we published [26] the regioselective
hydrosilylation of 1-hexyne activated by gold nanoparticles sup-
ported on carbon and c-Al2O3. We compared the catalytic perfor-
mance of gold species with the performance of platinum-based
catalysts and observed an opposite afﬁnity between the two metals
and the silanes. Indeed, a gold catalyst was required in the reac-
tions performed with Me2PhSiH or Et3SiH, while a platinum spe-
cies had to be used in the presence of chlorosilanes. Both
platinum- and gold-supported nanoparticles were generated using
the Metal Vapour Synthesis technique [27] (MVS), a versatile
method that can be employed for the preparation of colloidal
solutions of metal nanoclusters, which can be directly deposited

on organic or inorganic matrices with a chosen metal loading and
without any further activation process. In the case of gold-sup-
ported catalysts, the dimensions of the particles are quite impor-
tant since it is now well established that the catalytic activity of
Au depends on a large extent on the size of the nanoparticles
[1,3–9], but other effects such as the nature of the support mate-
rial, the Au/support interface, the particle shape and the loading
of the metal on the inorganic matrix may also be of great impor-
tance [28–33]. Here, we report of the extension of the MVS tech-
nique to the preparation of supported gold nanoparticles with
different sizes and metal loadings, and of a detailed investigation
of the factors that can affect their catalytic activity in the hydrosi-
lylation of 1-hexyne with Et3SiH, this being chosen as the reference
reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. General
All operations involving the products from Metal Vapour Syn-
thesis (MVS) were performed under a dry argon atmosphere. The
co-vaporization of gold and acetone was carried out in a static
reactor as previously described [34]. The ‘‘acetone-solvated Au
atoms” solution was worked up under argon atmosphere with
the use of standard Schlenk techniques. The amount of gold in
these solutions was determined by atomic absorption spectrome-
try in an electrically heated graphite furnace with a Perkin–Elmer
4100ZL instrument. Acetone was puriﬁed by conventional meth-
ods, distilled and stored under argon. 1-Hexyne and triethylsilane
were commercial products, and were distilled and degassed before
use. Commercial c-Al2O3 (Chimet product, type 49, 3.1 lm average
particle size, surface area 110 m2 g1), C (Chimet product, surface
area 890 m2 g1), TiO2 (Aldrich product, powder, P99.9%, 1.0 lm
average particle size, surface area 5.8 m2 g1), ZrO2 (Aldrich prod-
uct, powder, 99%, 0.88 lm average particle size, surface area
4.9 m2 g1), Fe2O3 (Aldrich product, powder, 99.5%, 1.0 lm average
particle size, surface area 2.1 m2 g1), CeO2 (Aldrich product, pow-
der, P99.9%, 1.45 lm average particle size, surface area 2.0 m2 g1)
were dried in a static oven before use. The GLC analyses were per-
formed on a Perkin–Elmer Auto System gas chromatograph,
equipped with a ﬂame ionization detector (FID), using a SiO2 col-
umn (DB1, 30 m  0.52 mm, 5 lm) and helium as carrier gas.
2.2. Preparation of catalysts
In a typical experiment, gold vapours generated by resistive
heating of an alumina crucible ﬁlled with ca. 500 mg of gold pellets
were co-condensed at liquid nitrogen temperature with acetone
(100 ml) in the glass reactor chamber of the MVS apparatus for a
chosen time. The reactor chamber was warmed to the melting
point of the solid matrix, and the resulting deep purple solution
was siphoned at a low temperature into a Schlenk tube and kept
in a refrigerator at 20 C. Three different gold/acetone ‘‘solutions”
were prepared in which 0.16, 0.43 and 1.42 mg Au/ml acetone
were present as determined by atomic absorption analysis. Pairs
of catalysts with the same ﬁnal Au content were prepared from dif-
ferent amounts of gold/acetone solutions with low (0.16 mg Au/ml
acetone) or high (1.42 mg Au/ml acetone) gold concentration. The
member of such pairs will be labelled as LC or HC, respectively.
2.2.1. Preparation of Al2O3-supported catalysts
Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05%, w/w). 1.6 ml (0.25 mg Au) of the gold/acetone
solution (0.16 mg/ml) were added to a suspension of 0.5 g of c-
Al2O3 in acetone (20 ml). The mixture was stirred for 2 h at room
temperature and the colourless supernatant solution was removed
with a siphon. The solid was washed with 20  2 ml of n-pentane,
and dried under reduced pressure.
Au/c-Al2O3 (0.10%, w/w, LC). 15 ml (2.4 mg Au) of the gold/acetone
solution (0.16 mg/ml) were added to a suspension of 2.4 g of c-
Al2O3 in acetone (20 ml). The mixture was stirred for 2 h at room
temperature, and the colourless supernatant solution was removed
with a siphon. The solid was washed with 20  2 ml of n-pentane
and dried under reduced pressure.
Au/c-Al2O3 (0.10%, w/w, HC). 1.4 ml (2 mg Au) of the gold/acetone
solution (1.42 mg/ml) were added to a suspension of 2 g of c-
Al2O3 in acetone (30 ml). The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room
temperature, and the colourless supernatant solution was removed
with a siphon. The solid was washed with 20  2 ml of n-pentane
and dried under reduced pressure.
Au/c-Al2O3 (0.50%, w/w). 11.6 ml (5 mg Au) of the gold/acetone
solution (0.43 mg/ml) were added to a suspension of 1 g of c-
Al2O3 in acetone (20 ml). The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room
temperature, and the colourless supernatant solution was removed
with a siphon. The solid was washed with 20  2 ml of n-pentane
and dried under reduced pressure.
Au/c-Al2O3 (2.00%, w/w). 9.3 ml (4 mg Au) of the gold/acetone solu-
tion (0.43 mg/ml) were added to a suspension of 0.2 g of c-Al2O3 in
acetone (10 ml). The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temper-
ature, and the colourless supernatant solution was removed with a
siphon. The solid was washed with 20  2 ml of n-pentane and
dried under reduced pressure.
2.2.2. Preparation of carbon-supported catalysts
Au/C (0.10%, w/w, LC). 15 ml (2.4 mg Au) of the gold/acetone solu-
tion (0.16 mg/ml) were added to a suspension of 2.4 g of carbon
in acetone (20 ml). The mixture was stirred for 48 h at room tem-
perature. The organic phase was removed under vacuum and the
solid was dried (0.1 mmHg).
Au/C (0.10%, w/w, HC). 1.4 ml (2 mg Au) of the gold/acetone solu-
tion (1.42 mg/ml) were added to a suspension of 2 g of carbon in
acetone (30 ml). The mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temper-
ature. The organic phase was removed under vacuum and the solid
was dried (0.1 mmHg).
2.2.3. Preparation of MeOx-supported catalysts
Au/Fe2O3 (0.10%, w/w). 2.4 ml (1 mg Au) of the gold/acetone solu-
tion (0.43 mg/ml) were added to a suspension of 1 g of Fe2O3 in
acetone (20 ml). The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temper-
ature. The colourless supernatant solution was removed with a si-
phon, and the solid was washed with 20  2 ml of n-pentane and
dried under reduced pressure.
Au/Fe2O3 (4.50%, w/w). 21 ml (9 mg Au) of the gold/acetone solu-
tion (0.43 mg/ml) were added to a suspension of 0.2 g of Fe2O3 in
acetone (10 ml). The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temper-
ature. The organic layer was removed under vacuum and the solid
was dried (0.1 mmHg).
Au/TiO2 (0.10%, w/w). 2.4 ml (1 mg Au) of the gold/acetone solution
(0.43 mg/ml) were added to a suspension of 1 g of TiO2 in acetone
(20 ml). The mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature. The
organic layer was removed under vacuum and the solid was dried
(0.1 mmHg).
Au/TiO2 (1.48%, w/w). 3.4 ml (1 mg Au) of the gold/acetone solution
(0.43 mg/ml) were added to a suspension of 1 g of TiO2 in acetone

(20 ml). The mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature. The

(0.1 mmHg).
Au/CeO2 (0.10%, w/w). 2.4 ml (1 mg Au) of the gold/acetone solu-

organic layer was removed under vacuum and the solid was dried
(0.1 mmHg).
2.3. Catalytic tests
Catalytic runs were carried out in Pyrex Carius tubes ﬁtted with
Rotaﬂo taps. To a certain amount of Au/support were added via
syringe 4 mmol (0.46 ml) of 1-hexyne and 2 mmol of the triethyl-
silane (0.16 ml). The suspension was stirred for a chosen time at
the reported temperature and ﬁltered on Celite, and the ﬁltrate
was evaporated under vacuum to remove the excess 1-hexyne.
The crude products were characterized by GC analysis and their
1H NMR proton signals.
2.4. Characterization of the catalysts
Electron micrographs were obtained with a Jeol 2000EX micro-
scope. Before being introduced into the instrument, the samples, in
the form of powders, were ultrasonically dispersed in isopropyl
alcohol and a drop of the suspension was deposited on a copper
grid covered with a lacy carbon ﬁlm. Mean particle sizes (dm) were
calculated from the formula dm ¼ P dini= P ni, where ni is the
number of particles of diameter di, while the width of the distribu-
tion

3. Results and discussion
Initially we focused our attention on the preparation of various
catalysts based on the Metal Vapour Synthesis (MVS) technique;
several samples of gold nanoparticles dispersed on inorganic sup-
ports, such as c-Al2O3, carbon, Fe2O3, TiO2, CeO2 and ZrO2, and with
different metal loadings were obtained.
3.1. Preparation and characterization of the catalysts
Gold nanoparticles were prepared by means of the MVS tech-
nique. According to previously described procedures [33], gold
and acetone were vaporized under vacuum and deposited on the
frozen walls (198 C) of a glass reactor, generating a purple solid
matrix. During the warm-up stage from 196 to 20 C the matrix
melted, and nucleation and growth processes of the metal particles
took place leading to gold nanoclusters weakly stabilized by the
acetone molecules, the so-called ‘‘solvated metal atoms”. These
MVS ‘‘solutions” of Au/CH3COCH3 were then added at room tem-
perature to a suitable amount of the support till decolourization
of the suspension occurred, which is indicative of the complete
deposition of the Au particles on the inorganic matrices.
Motivated by the extensive work of Klabunde and co-workers
[34,35] on the inﬂuence of the gold content in the solutions of ace-
tone-solvated atoms on the sizes of the nanoparticles in the result-
ing powders, we prepared Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensates with
different gold/acetone concentrations: 0.16 mg/ml (low concentra-
tion, LC) and 1.42 mg/ml (high concentration, HC), respectively.
These systems were used as the starting materials for the deposi-
tion of Au nanoparticles on supports as depicted in Scheme 1.
The morphological features of these catalytic systems were
investigated by HRTEM. The micrographs and the size distributions
of the metal particles obtained for Au/C and Au/c-Al2O3 prepared
from LC and HC solutions are displayed in Fig. 1.
It can be observed that gold nanoparticles deposited on both
supports from LC solutions exhibit a very similar particle size dis-
tribution over the 2.0–10.0 nm range, with an average diameter
(hdi) of ca. 4.8 nm and a width (r) of ca. 2.00 nm (Fig. 1 a and b).
In contrast, the catalysts prepared from HC solutions exhibit a
notably wider distribution of metal particle size (4.0–20 nm), with
a signiﬁcant fraction of particles larger than 10 nm in size (Fig. 1 c
and d). Furthermore, the large particles appeared to be polycrystal-
line in nature, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1d. In agreement with
Klabunde’s observations [35], our results indicate the important
inﬂuence exerted by the concentration of the MVS solution on
the aggregation phenomena of the nanoparticles and consequently
on their dimensions.
Next, starting from MVS diluted ‘‘solutions” of Au/CH3COCH3
(0.16–0.43 mg/ml) we prepared three samples of nanoparticles
supported on alumina characterized by different metal loading
(0.05%, 0.50% and 2.00%, w/w). We were particularly intrigued by
the possibility of keeping the particle sizes very small even when
the amount of metal on the support was increased. The corre-
sponding HRTEM histograms are displayed in Fig. 2.

Analogously to the results of the HRTEM analysis on the LC
samples (Fig. 1), the histograms of the size distribution of metal
particles
of
the
three
catalysts
appeared
quite
narrow
(2–
12 nm) with the mean diameter slightly increasing from 4.4 to
5.3 nm, when the metal loading was increased from 0.05% to
2.00% (w/w) (Fig. 2). It can be noticed that the histograms related
to the catalysts with the lower Au loading (0.05 wt%, Fig. 2a;
0.10 wt%, Fig. 1b) exhibited the larger standard deviation because
of the broadening towards sizes larger than 5 nm. As it is quite
unexpected that larger relative amounts of bigger particles are
formed at lower metal loading, this feature suggests that the
0.05 wt% Au and 0.10 wt% Au catalysts should contain a number
of very small Au particles (then likely belonging to the class of
clusters), more abundant for 0.05 wt% Au, that escaped the detec-
tion by HRTEM.
Nevertheless, the microscopy analysis results conﬁrmed that
nanoparticles essentially smaller than 10 nm in size and homoge-
neously dispersed on c-Al2O3 can be generated if diluted solutions
of gold/acetone were chosen as starting material.
Finally, using the 0.43 mg/ml Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensate, we
prepared four gold species deposited on CeO2, Fe2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2
with a metal loading of 0.10% (w/w) in order to investigate the pos-
sible effects of the different supports on the Au nanoparticles size.
Representative HRTEM images and particle size distributions are
reported in Fig. 3.
In general, the dispersion of Au on the support appeared highly
homogeneous for all the samples considered, and the size of the
particles lay mostly between 2.0 and 8.0 nm. The resulting size dis-
tributions exhibited some common features along the series of the
four materials: quite narrow (between 1.5 and 2.1 nm) around the
mean value, which lay in the 3.7–4.9 nm range, and slightly asym-
metric towards the larger sizes, especially for the Au/TiO2 system.
In this last case, general, HRTEM micrographs revealed a hemi-
spheric/polyhedral shape for the gold nanoparticles deposited on
the metal oxides, with a quite wide area of interaction with the
support (see inset in Fig. 3).
These results clearly demonstrated that the dimensions of the
gold nanoparticles depended strictly on the metal concentration
of the co-condensate precursors, but were only slightly affected
by the nature of the inorganic matrices chosen for the preparation
of the supported catalysts.
This trend was conﬁrmed by the gold particle size distributions
of two catalysts, Au/Fe2O3 (4.50%), and Au/TiO2 (1.48%), obtained
by the deposition of a diluted MVS solution (0.43 mg/ml) (Fig. 4).

As already observed for the alumina-supported gold nanoparti-
cles (Fig. 2), a large increase of the metal loading from 0.10% to
4.50% or 1.48% (w/w) did not cause much variation of the gold par-
ticles sizes, which were now in the range of 5.4–6.4 nm with re-
spect to 4.0–4.8 nm (Fig. 3b and c vs. Fig. 4a and b, respectively).
3.2. Hydrosilylation reactions
The catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was then evalu-
ated in the hydrosilylation of 1-hexyne with Et3SiH; the reactions
were performed without solvent, at 90 C, with a molar ratio sub-
strate/Au = 2000 mmol/mmol (Scheme 2). First of all, the perfor-
mances of the supported gold nanoparticles prepared form the
LC and HC solutions (Fig. 1) were evaluated. The obtained results
are summarized in Table 1.
As highlighted by the reported data, the Au/c-Al2O3 (LC) and
Au/C (LC) (0.1%, w/w) catalysts showed very high activity (Table
1, SA = 6480, entry 1, and 5680, entry 2, respectively) and regiose-
lectivity towards the (E)-3 isomer (Table 1, 93% and 98%, entries 1
and 2). By contrast, the analogous Au/c-Al2O3 (HC) and Au/C (HC)
systems prepared from more concentrated gold/acetone solutions
(1.42 mg/ml), and containing particles of larger diameter (4–
20 nm, Fig. 1), were completely inactive even after long reaction
times. These results conﬁrmed a good correlation between the
nanoparticles sizes and the catalytic activity of gold as already ob-
served by Haruta in his pioneer work on CO oxidation [1].
Intrigued by these initial data, we tested in the hydrosilylation
process of 1-hexyne with Et3SiH the Au/c-Al2O3 catalysts charac-
terized by different metal loadings (0.05%, 0.50% and 2.00%, w/w,
Fig. 2) and obtained starting from diluted MVS solutions (0.16–
0.43 mg/ml) (Table 2).
All the employed catalysts were very active and selective to-
wards the formation of (E)-1-(trimethylsilyl)-1-hexene (E)-3,
although a reduction of the catalytic efﬁciency was observed when
the gold amount on the support increased. Indeed, the lower was
the metal loading, the higher was the speciﬁc activity (Table 2, en-
try 1). Considering that the HRTEM analysis had shown similar
nanoparticle dimensions for the four catalysts (Figs. 1b and 2),
the catalytic performance of the 0.05% Au/c-Al2O3 sample could
be ascribed to the presence of very small nanocluster that might
escape the detection by TEM. Another fact that could inﬂuence
the speciﬁc activity of the 0.05% Au/c-Al2O3 sample could be the
high dispersion of the gold on alumina and consequently the pres-
ence of isolated Au nanoparticles readily available for the catalysis.
At this stage, our investigation was devoted to the catalytic
activity of the nanoparticles deposited on different supports

(CeO2, Fe2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2 characterized by similar superﬁcial
areas, i.e., 2–6 m2 g1, and chemical purity >99%) but with the
same amount of gold (0.1%, w/w) prepared from the 0.43 mg/ml
solution of Au/CH3COCH3. These samples were studied in the
hydrosilylation reaction (Scheme 2 and Table 3) under the same
reaction conditions as for the previously reported Au/c-Al2O3 and
Au/C systems (Table 1).
As can be seen from Table 3, the MVS-derived gold nanoparti-
cles, prepared from solvated Au atoms at low concentration, depos-
ited on ceria (Table 3, entry 1) and iron oxide (Table 3, entry 2)
showed high catalytic activity, which was comparable with those
previously reported for Au/c-Al2O3 (LC) (Table 1, entry 1) and
Au/C (LC) (Table 1, entry 2) species. In particular, the Au/CeO2 cat-
alyst showed the best efﬁciency leading to the E isomer with a spe-
ciﬁc activity of 6480 h1 and a selectivity of 98%. In contrast, Au/
TiO2 and Au/ZrO2 samples showed high selectivity towards (E)-3
(Table 3, entries 3 and 4, 95% and 96%, respectively), but displayed
signiﬁcantly lower speciﬁc activities (3840 and 1600 h1) than the
other tested catalysts.
The morphological features of the four catalysts obtained from
the HRTEM analysis (Fig. 3) were not sufﬁcient to rationalize the
different behaviour observed. Indeed, all the supported gold
nanoclusters had diameters between 2 and 8 nm, and resulted
highly dispersed on the inorganic matrices. Nevertheless, the shape
of the distributions and the relative population of the classes
exhibited some differences. The metal speciﬁc surface area (SSA)
was therefore calculated (as indicated in Section 2), resulting in
the following values: 25, 28, 20 and 32 m2 g1, for the Au/CeO2,
Au/Fe2O3, Au/TiO2 and Au/ZrO2 catalysts, in the order (Table 3, col-
umn 8). However, the differences among these values could not ac-
count for the different catalytic behaviour of the materials, as can
be inferred from the observed trends of the relative speciﬁc activity
and relative speciﬁc metal surface areas (Table 3, columns 7 and 9).
Furthermore, differences in the relative abundance of the vari-
ous size classes cannot easily account for the differences in cata-
lytic activity. For instance, in the case of the most active catalyst
(Au/CeO2, Fig. 3a), ca. 70% of the Au particles are larger than
4 nm, while particles of this size account only for 30% of the metal
phase present in the Au/ZrO2 catalyst (Fig. 3d), the less active one,
but this correlation does not hold for the other two systems.
Thus, other features of the metal particles should also contrib-
ute to the activity in the title reactions, such as particular surface
geometric and electronic states resulting from a proper combina-
tion of size, shape and interaction with the support. As for this last
aspect, during TEM observation of Au/TiO2 and Au/ZrO2, few Au
particles appeared suitably located on the surface of the grains of
the supports to allow the observation of an extended interface with
the support (see insets of Fig. 3c and d). Unluckily, no metal parti-
cles properly oriented to obtain equivalent images were observed
in the case of Au/CeO2 and Au/Fe2O3.

In order to examine the catalytic potential of the Metal Vapour
Synthesis technique, the performances of the MVS supported
nanoparticles were then compared with those of commercially
available species. Indeed, some years ago, the World Gold Council
began to purchase gold nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 3.7–
3.8 nm, deposited on Fe2O3 and TiO2 with metal loadings of 4.50%
and 1.48% (w/w), respectively. As a consequence, using the diluted
0.43 mg/ml solution of gold/acetone, we prepared two samples of
Au/Fe2O3 (4.50%) and Au/TiO2 (1.48%) which were tested in the ref-
erence reaction together with the commercial catalysts (Scheme 2
and Table 4).
As is clear from the reported data, the commercial and the MVS
catalysts with the same amount of supported metal showed simi-
lar selectivity and reaction rates (Table 4, entries 1, 2, 4 and 5). It is
noteworthy that HRTEM analysis of the gold nanoparticles coming
from the MVS solutions (Fig. 4) had showed larger sizes (5.4–
6.4 nm) than the commercial ones (3.7–3.8 nm), thus indicating a
greater efﬁciency of the active sites of the MVS nanoparticles.
Moreover, as already detected in the reactions promoted by Au/
c-Al2O3 (Table 2, entries 2 and 4), when the hydrosilylation process
was performed in the presence of gold nanoparticles supported on
Fe2O3 with a 4.50% (w/w) metal loading, the value of the speciﬁc
activity was about half of that of the 0.10% (w/w) sample (Table
4, entry 2 vs. entry 3). This result can be explained once more with
a greater dispersion of the metal observed for the 0.1% (w/w) Au/
Fe2O3 catalyst (Fig. 3b).
On the contrary, in the case of Au/TiO2 species, the sample with
larger quantities of gold (1.48%, w/w) was much more reactive
than the corresponding 0.10% (w/w) catalyst. The changes in the
metal particle size distribution of the two samples cannot account
for the increase of speciﬁc activity as the Au/TiO2 with the higher
loading exhibits larger mean particle size and a broader distribu-
tion. It is worth noticing, however, that a larger fraction of small
particles (below 3 nm) are observed in the 1.48% (w/w) Au/TiO2
catalyst. Since it is quite unlikely that smaller particles are pro-
duced by increasing the metal loading, it can be hypothesized that
in the 0.10% (w/w) Au/TiO2 a signiﬁcant part of gold is present in
the form of very small particles/clusters (below 1 nm, not observa-
ble by TEM) [36]. Under this hypothesis, the poorer catalytic per-
formance of the 0.10 wt% Au/TiO2 suggests a lower activity of
such small particles/clusters, on the contrary of what was proposed
in the case of Au/Al2O3. Such an opposite behaviour might be the
consequence of a different metal/support interaction (‘‘interface
effect”) [37], particularly important in the case of very small
particles.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have found that solvated gold atoms prepared
according to the Metal Vapour Synthesis technique can be used for
the preparation of supported species that provide active catalysts
for the hydrosilylation of terminal acetylenes with high regioselec-
tivity (>90%) for the E isomer. Two main factors seem to play an
important role in the catalytic performance of the supported spe-
cies: the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the
support. As clearly indicated by the HRTEM analysis, diluted MVS
solutions give rise to highly dispersed small gold particles that
show very good speciﬁc activity, whereas concentrated solvated
metal atoms generate supported nanoclusters with a larger size
distribution and mean diameter, which are totally inactive. On
the other hand, starting from a diluted Au/CH3COCH3 co-conden-
sate, supported catalysts with different metal loadings on the
matrices can be prepared without loss of reactivity. Indeed, the in-
crease of the metal content on the support (0.05–4.50%, w/w) does
not cause a marked growth of the gold nanoparticles, the mean
diameter lying in the range between 4.0 and 5.8 nm. However,
ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts did not follow this general
trend. In these cases, a strong interfacial contact between Au and
the metal oxide could reduce the number of active sites of the
catalysts; an increase of the gold amount on the support then
improves the catalytic efﬁciency of these species.
