[1] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation."
[2] "The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane."
[3] "A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield."
[4] "The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature."
[5] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena."
[6] "The fact that the initial and residual propene yields over FeZSM-5 were very similar over the fresh and regenerated FeZSM-5 indicates that the number of active sites in the beginning of the reaction and in steady-state conditions is not reduced in the regenerated samples."
[7] "The novel process presented in this manuscript can be applied for on-site C3H6 production and is particularly attractive if a low-cost source of N2O is available."

1.N2O is a monooxygen donor with high specificity, which can coordinate with reactive atomic oxygen species in iron zeolites to efficiently dehydrogenate propane, making it an ideal oxidant for ODHP. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 is a highly efficient catalyst for N2O-mediated ODHP, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, the catalyst deactivates rapidly due to coke formation, which is a major drawback. The rate of deactivation decreases with increasing temperature. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by various phenomena. The initial and residual propene yields over FeZSM-5 are similar for fresh and regenerated samples, indicating that the number of active sites is not reduced after regeneration. The novel cyclic process for continuous propylene production using N2O as an oxidant is particularly attractive for on-site C3H6 production if a low-cost source of N2O is available. Strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP include developing catalysts with higher resistance to deactivation, optimizing reaction conditions to reduce coke formation, and exploring alternative sources of N2O.

1.N2O是一种具有高特异性的单氧供体，可以与铁沸石中的反应性原子氧物种协调，有效地脱氢丙烷，使其成为ODHP的理想氧化剂。蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5是N2O介导的ODHP的高效催化剂，在723 K时丙烯产量高达25%。然而，催化剂由于焦炭形成而迅速失活，这是一个主要的缺点。失活速率随温度升高而降低。催化剂失活是一个复杂的过程，可能由各种现象引起。FeZSM-5在新鲜和再生样品上的初始和残余丙烯产量相似，表明反应开始和稳态条件下的活性位点数量在再生后没有减少。在有低成本N2O来源的情况下，本文提出的新型连续丙烯生产循环过程特别适用于现场C3H6生产。解决N2O-ODHP限制的策略包括开发抗失活能力更强的催化剂，优化反应条件以减少焦炭形成，以及探索N2O的替代来源。

However, a major drawback is the deactivation of the catalyst by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield.

The use of O2 as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. These findings indicate the vital role of N2O as the oxidant in ODHP over iron zeolites and the detrimental effect of O2 on the process.
2.Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction conditions, such as temperature and space velocity, to minimize coke formation while maintaining high propene yields. Developing catalysts with improved coke resistance and stability, such as modifying the zeolite framework or incorporating additional metal species, could also enhance the performance of N2O-ODHP. Additionally, exploring alternative regeneration methods, such as in situ regeneration using N2O or other selective oxidants, could help maintain catalyst activity over extended periods. Research on the fundamental mechanisms of coke formation and catalyst deactivation could provide insights into developing more stable and efficient catalysts for N2O-ODHP. The development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could also provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O for the process.

1.N2O是过蒸汽活化FeZSM-5在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)中的一种高效氧化剂,在723K时可达到高达25%的丙烯产量。铁沸石在这一过程中的卓越性能归因于N2O作为单氧供体的特异性和沸石中铁形式协调反应性原子氧物种以有效脱氢丙烷的能力。然而,铁沸石在N2O-ODHP中的主要缺点是由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活,导致丙烯产量迅速下降。随着温度的升高,失活速率降低,FeZSM-5在773K时的相对缓慢失活与高N2O转化率有关。使用O2作为FeZSM-5上丙烷氧化脱氢的氧化剂导致与N2O相比非常低的C3H6产量(<5%)。在C3H8+N2O混合物中添加少量O2导致C3H6选择性降低,COx产量增加。这些发现表明N2O作为铁沸石上ODHP的氧化剂的至关重要作用,以及O2对过程的不利影响。
2.解决N2O-ODHP中催化剂失活和稳定性限制的策略包括优化反应条件,如温度和空速,以最小化焦炭形成,同时保持高丙烯产量。开发具有改进焦炭抗性和稳定性的催化剂,如修改沸石框架或掺入其他金属物种,也可以提高N2O-ODHP的性能。此外,探索替代再生方法,如使用N2O或其他选择性氧化剂进行原位再生,可以帮助在延长期内保持催化剂活性。关于焦炭形成和催化剂失活的基本机制的研究可以为开发更稳定和高效的N2O-ODHP催化剂提供见解。开发廉价和选择性的催化剂系统用于低温NH3氧化为N2O也可以为该过程提供低成本和相当纯净的N2O来源。

1.N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using steam-activated FeZSM-5 as a catalyst can achieve propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, the catalyst deactivates strongly due to coke formation. The initial performance can be recovered by air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, leading to the evaluation of a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles. The use of O2 as an oxidant in propane oxidative dehydrogenation over FeZSM-5 leads to very low propene yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream. The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K. The presence of O2 in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5 has a negative impact on the process. Strategies to address these limitations could include the development of catalysts with higher resistance to deactivation, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of a purification step to remove O2 from the N2O feed. Research directions could focus on the development of new catalysts with improved stability and selectivity, the investigation of alternative oxidants that do not lead to deactivation, and the design of more efficient regeneration processes.

1.使用蒸汽活化FeZSM-5作为催化剂的N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)可以在723 K下达到高达25%的丙烯产量。然而,催化剂由于焦炭形成而强烈失活。通过空气再生失活催化剂,可以恢复初始性能,从而评估通过交替反应和再生循环进行连续丙烯生产的工艺。FeZSM-5在丙烷氧化脱氢中使用O2作为氧化剂导致的丙烯产量(<5%)远低于N2O。FeZSM-5在773 K下的相对缓慢失活可与400分钟后测量的高N2O转化率相关联。氧化剂在一定反应温度以上参与焦炭氧化,可能解释FeZSM-5在723和773 K下获得的最终焦炭含量相似。N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢到丙烯过程中O2的存在对FeZSM-5有负面影响。解决这些限制的策略可能包括开发具有更高抗失活性的催化剂,优化反应条件以最小化焦炭形成,以及使用净化步骤去除N2O进料中的O2。研究方向可能集中在开发具有改进稳定性和选择性的新催化剂,调查不会导致失活的替代氧化剂,以及设计更有效的再生过程。
