[1] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation."
[2] "Because the initial ODHP performance was recovered upon air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles has been evaluated."
[3] "Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O."
[4] "The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4)."
[5] "The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may also explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K."
[6] "The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2."
[7] "The efficient utilization of N2O in tail-gases should involve a previous purification step. As shown here, the presence of O2 (a typical component of tail-gases) has a negative impact on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5."

1.N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using steam-activated FeZSM-5 as a catalyst can achieve propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, the catalyst deactivates strongly due to coke formation. The initial performance can be recovered by air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, leading to the evaluation of a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles. The use of O2 as an oxidant in propane oxidative dehydrogenation over FeZSM-5 leads to very low propene yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream. The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K. The presence of O2 in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5 has a negative impact on the process. Strategies to address these limitations could include the development of catalysts with higher resistance to deactivation, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of a purification step to remove O2 from the N2O feed. Research directions could focus on the development of new catalysts with improved stability and selectivity, the investigation of alternative oxidants that do not lead to deactivation, and the design of more efficient regeneration processes.

1.使用蒸汽活化FeZSM-5作为催化剂的N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)可以在723 K下达到高达25%的丙烯产量。然而,催化剂由于焦炭形成而强烈失活。通过空气再生失活催化剂,可以恢复初始性能,从而评估通过交替反应和再生循环进行连续丙烯生产的工艺。FeZSM-5在丙烷氧化脱氢中使用O2作为氧化剂导致的丙烯产量(<5%)远低于N2O。FeZSM-5在773 K下的相对缓慢失活可与400分钟后测量的高N2O转化率相关联。氧化剂在一定反应温度以上参与焦炭氧化,可能解释FeZSM-5在723和773 K下获得的最终焦炭含量相似。N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢到丙烯过程中O2的存在对FeZSM-5有负面影响。解决这些限制的策略可能包括开发具有更高抗失活性的催化剂,优化反应条件以最小化焦炭形成,以及使用净化步骤去除N2O进料中的O2。研究方向可能集中在开发具有改进稳定性和选择性的新催化剂,调查不会导致失活的替代氧化剂,以及设计更有效的再生过程。
