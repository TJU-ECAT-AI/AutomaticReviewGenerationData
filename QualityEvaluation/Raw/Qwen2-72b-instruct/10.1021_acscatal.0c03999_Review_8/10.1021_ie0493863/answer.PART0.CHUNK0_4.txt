1.N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in ODHP over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. The intermediates essential for propene production are negatively impacted by the presence of O2, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated ODHP of propane.

Answer: Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction temperature to reduce deactivation rates, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, and exploring methods to regenerate the catalysts more efficiently. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and identifying catalysts with active sites that are less susceptible to deactivation. Additionally, the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O, making the process more feasible for practical implementation.

1.N2O是过蒸汽活化FeZSM-5在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)中的一种高效氧化剂，在723K时可达到25%的丙烯产量。铁沸石在ODHP中的优异性能归因于N2O作为单氧供体的特异性以及沸石中铁形式协调反应性原子氧物种以有效脱氢丙烷的能力。然而，一个主要缺点是由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活，导致丙烯产量迅速下降。失活速率随温度升高而降低，FeZSM-5在773K时的相对缓慢失活与高N2O转化率有关。在FeZSM-5上使用O2作为ODHP的氧化剂导致与N2O相比非常低的C3H6产量(<5%)。在C3H8+N2O混合物中添加少量O2导致C3H6选择性降低，COx产量增加。对丙烯生产至关重要的中间体受O2存在负面影响，严重恶化FeZSM-5在N2O介导的丙烷ODHP中的性能。

回答：解决N2O-ODHP中催化剂失活和稳定性限制的策略包括优化反应温度以降低失活速率，开发具有改善抗焦炭形成能力的催化剂，以及探索更有效地再生催化剂的方法。研究方向可以集中在理解焦炭形成机制和识别对失活不那么敏感的活性位点的催化剂上。此外，开发廉价和选择性的催化剂系统用于低温NH3氧化为N2O，可以提供低成本和相当纯净的N2O来源，使该过程更适用于实际应用。
