Because the initial ODHP performance was recovered upon air-regeneration of the spent catalyst, a process for continuous propylene production via alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles has been evaluated. A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to on-line analysis of products has been applied to correlate activity, deactivation, and regeneration of FeZSM-5 by simultaneous measurement of reaction and mass changes. This information was used to optimally design the cyclic process. In a system with five fixed-bed reactors in parallel, stable propene yields >20% were demonstrated during continuous operation for 1500 min (12 cycles), using reaction and regeneration periods of 25 and 90 min, respectively, at the same temperature (723 K). This novel process is attractive for on-site C3H6 production using a low-cost source of N2O.

1. Introduction
Propylene, a key building block in the modern petrochemical industry, is mainly produced as a coproduct in ethylene steam crackers and gasoline-making fluidized catalytic crackers. However, as demand for propylene is growing faster than demand for ethylene or gasoline, there is a widening gap between conventional propylene supply and demand. This gap can be bridged by the development of on-purpose propylene technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation and metathesis of ethylene and butylene, which currently account for 23% of the global production. 1 Many recent studies have explored the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as a potential route to propylene to overcome typical drawbacks on the nonoxidative process, that is, thermodynamic limitations and catalyst deactivation by coke. Promising formulations for ODHP are based on modified V and Mo oxides, with propene yields in the range of 1030% using O2 as the oxidant. 2-5 Recent studies have reported the remarkable performance of iron zeolites for the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation according to eq 1. 6-9 This reaction leads to the simultaneous functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas. The most promising zeolitic system reported so far is steam-activated FeZSM-5, displaying initial propene yields up to 25%.6,7 These results are comparable with the highest values reported over V- and Mo-based catalysts with O2. The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane.7 This unique form of oxygen, referred to as α-oxygen, is also responsible for the outstanding catalytic performance of FeZSM-5 in hydroxylation of paraffins to alcohols and of aromatic hydrocarbons to phenols with N2O. 10,11 A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.7 Preliminary tests showed that the original catalytic activity of FeZSM-5 was completely recovered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min.6 On this basis, the present work was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of a cyclically operated process for continuous C3H6 production via ODHP with N2O using FeZSM-5. This was achieved in a configuration of fixed-bed reactors in parallel with alternation of reaction and regeneration steps, according to the concept in Figure 1. The TEOM technique was applied to evaluate catalytic performance, deactivation, and regeneration, to rationally engineer the cyclic process.

2. Experimental Methods
2.1. Catalyst. Details on the hydrothermal synthesis of FeZSM-5 have been described elsewhere. 12 The as-synthesized sample was calcined in air and activated in flowing steam (30 vol % H2O and 30 mL STP min-1 of N2) at ambient pressure and 873 K during 5 h. Extensive characterization of this catalyst, with a molar Si/Al ratio of 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe, can be found in recent publications. 12-15 Briefly, steam treatment leads to the extraction of framework iron in isomorphously substituted FeZSM-5 and originates active extraframework iron species. The nature and distribution of iron species in the final catalyst depend on the steam activation conditions (temperature and steam partial pressure) as well as on the composition of the zeolite framework.13,15 The particular catalyst used here possesses a rather heterogeneous constitution with respect to iron, where extraframework isolated iron ions and oligonuclear iron oxo-clusters in the zeolite pores coexist with iron oxide nanoparticles of 12 nm.
2.2. TEOM Studies. Reaction, coke deactivation, and regeneration studies were carried out in a Rupprecht & Patashnick TEOM 1500 pulse mass analyser. The TEOM (tapered element oscillating microbalance) consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gassolid reactions. 16,17 The TEOM measures mass changes based on inertial forces, presenting various key advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow profile, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and buoyancy phenomena, (ii) a very fast response time resolution (0.1 s), and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
Figure 2 shows the experimental procedure applied for the coking experiments. The TEOM reactor was carefully loaded with 30 mg of catalyst (sieve fraction 125200 μm), firmly packed between two plugs of quartz wool. The catalyst was then pretreated in flowing He at the reaction temperature for 2 h. When stable baseline was attained, He was replaced by the reaction mixture (a in Figure 2), and mass changes and product gases were continuously monitored. Equal flows of purge gas (He) and reaction gas of 200 mL min-1 were used, and the feed gases were preheated at 423 K. The ODHP with N2O was carried out using a mixture of 100 mbar C3H8 and 100 mbar N2O in He at 673773 K at a total pressure of P = 2 bar and a weight-hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 400000 mL h-1 gcat-1. The influence of O2 on the ODHP reaction was studied by adding 5 mbar O2 to the above C3H8+N2O mixture. The coking reaction was carried out for 400 min, and subsequently the conditions were changed to be identical to those prior to introduction of the reactant (b in Figure 2). The amount of coke (Ccoke) was determined as:where mo is the initial sample amount, Δmt is the total mass uptake measured by the TEOM, and Δmd includes the mass change of the gas density in the tapered element when He was replaced by the reaction mixture and also a small contribution by desorption of volatile components when switching from the reaction mixture back to He.
Figure 2 Typical continuous coking experiment in the TEOM microbalance.
The product gases were analyzed by an on-line micro-GC (Chrompack CP-2002) equipped with a TCD, using Poraplot Q and Molsieve 5A columns. N2O and C3H8 conversions were calculated from the amount of N2 formed and C3H8 reacted, respectively. Propene yield and selectivity have been determined as Y(C3H6) = C(C3H6)/C(C3H8) and S(C3H6) = Y(C3H6)/X(C3H8), respectively, where C(C3H6) is the outlet concentration of propene at a certain time, C(C3H8) is the inlet concentration of propane, and X(C3H8) is the conversion of propane.
Regeneration of the coked FeZSM-5 in air (200 mL min-1) was investigated by following mass changes in two ways: (a) temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) in air, ramping the temperature from 298 to 973 K at 10 K min-1, and (b) isothermal oxidation, switching from He (when stable baseline was reached) to air in the temperature range of 773823 K. TPO experiments require subtraction of a reference run with the uncoked zeolite under the same conditions to correct for the mass change caused by the variation of gas density with temperature. In isothermal regeneration, the mass change was corrected by the change in density upon replacing the inert gas by air.
2.3. Cyclically Operated Reactor. Cyclic experiments for continuous propene production were carried out in a reactor system consisting of three feed sections: purge (He), reaction (N2O+C3H8+He), and regeneration (O2+He), and a battery of five fixed-bed quartz reactors in parallel (4 mm i.d.) with independent feed, pressure, and temperature control. The feed section to each reactor can be selected by means of an arrangement of multi-port valves, and the sequence of cycles can be fully programmed. Cyclic experiments were conducted according to the pattern in Figure 3 and involve reaction (rx) and regeneration (rg) steps, which are mediated by purging steps (p1 and p2). Each of these steps is defined by its temperature and duration. These parameters were determined from the TEOM studies. The duration of one cycle in Figure 3 is defined astcycle = trx + tp1 + trg + tp2. To ensure continuous production of propene, the above steps were synchronized so that at least one of the reactors is always under reaction, while the others are under regeneration and/or purging. Micro-GC analysis monitored the gas effluent from the catalytic reactor under ODHP conditions.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Performance of Fresh FeZSM-5. Previous studies have shown that the initial performance of various steam-activated iron zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta) is rather similar, regardless of the different form(s) of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity.7 Initial propene yields in the range of 1922% at 723 K were achieved over these catalysts, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%). Among the catalysts tested, FeZSM-5 exhibited a slightly higher initial activity and, most importantly, a higher resistance toward deactivation.7 The influence of the reaction temperature on the performance and dynamics of deactivation of FeZSM-5 has been further investigated in this study. Figure 4 shows the coke content, propene yield, and conversions of propane and nitrous oxide versus time on stream during ODHP with N2O at different temperatures, as derived from the TEOM and coupled gas chromatographic analysis. Reaction data at 2 and 400 min on stream, representing the first and the last analysis in our experiments, are hereafter denoted as initial and final (or residual) performance, respectively.
Figure 4 Influence of the reaction temperature on the performance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 during ODHP with N2O: (a) coke content, (b) C3H6 yield, (c) C3H8 conversion, and (d) N2O conversion. Conditions: 100 mbar C3H8 and 100 mbar N2O in He, WHSV = 400000 mL h-1 gcat-1, and P = 2 bar.
Apart from C3H6, other quantified carbon-containing products were COx (from total oxidation), as well as minor amounts C2H4, C2H6, and CH4 (from cracking processes). Previous studies over FeZSM-5 also identified oxygenates, including propionaldehyde and small amounts of acrolein and acetone,6 and traces of alcohols and aromatics were also reported by Bulnek et al.,9 using conventional gas chromatography. The duration of each analysis in these studies was of at least 15 min and up to 100 min. The micro-GC used in this study enabled separation of the reactant (propane) and the desired product (propylene) in ca. 2 min. Fast analysis is essential to precisely follow rapid deactivation processes (vide infra), at the expenses of not having a complete determination of (minor or less important) reaction products.
The initial N2O conversion increases from 76% at 673 K to 100% at 723 and 773 K, while the increase in C3H8 conversion is less pronounced (from 40% to 50%) and does not increase further at 773 K. The propane conversion after 400 min on stream was between 10% and 20% at the temperatures investigated. The final N2O conversion amounts are 14% and 25% at 673 and 723 K, respectively, being remarkably higher at 773 K (72%). The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature. The catalyst typically activates during the first minutes of reaction. This process is particularly noticeable at 723 K, leading to an increase in propene yield from 22% to 25% after ca. 20 min on stream. At 773 and 723 K, a propene yield >20% was preserved during 200 and 100 min, respectively, in contrast to the rapid deactivation at 673 K. In all cases, the decrease of propene yield is coupled with the decrease of C3H8 and N2O conversions.
A good correlation was obtained between the increase of coke content and the decrease of propene yield with time on stream. This indicates that deactivation is caused by coke formation. Coke formation likely originates from polymerization and dehydrogenation (condensation) of propene, the main olefin formed over FeZSM-5. The concentration in the product gas of the other olefin formed (ethylene) was 15 times lower than that of propylene. These reactions leave a layer of highly hydrogen-deficient carbonaceous material on the catalyst surface, making the active sites inaccessible (poisoning of iron species or causing pore blockage). If propylene is the main coke precursor, the amount of coke should give an indication of the catalyst efficiency toward ODHP. In agreement with this, the final coke content at 723 K was 3 times higher than that at 673 K (20 wt % vs 6.7 wt %), while the final coke content at 773 K was 22.7 wt %. A larger difference in the coke content after 400 min on stream could be expected between the experiments at 723 and 773 K, in view of the significantly higher overall production of C3H6 at 773 K. It should be noted that the characteristic inflection point in the coking profiles at the time of the drop of the propene yield at 673 and 723 K, which was also noticed in other iron zeolites,7 was not observed at 773 K. This distinctive behavior can be tentatively related to the slower decrease of propene yield at 773 K, which correlates with a more gradual increase of the coke content.
An additional feature of the TEOM microbalance to follow catalyst deactivation consists of simply monitoring the temperature of the outlet gas by a thermocouple situated at a distance of 3 mm after the catalyst bed. These profiles are shown in Figure 5 for three reaction temperatures. The profiles of coke formation and propene yield, which are also depicted in the same figure, evidence an excellent correlation between outlet gas temperature, mass change due to coking, and catalyst deactivation. A sharp increase of the gas outlet temperature can be observed after switching the feed gas from He to the C3H8+N2O mixture at t = 0 min, as a consequence of the exothermicity of the propane oxidation. The rapid deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 623 K, as concluded from the fast coking rate and the decrease of C3H6 yield during the first 10 min on stream, nicely correlates with the decrease of the temperature of the gas at the reactor outlet. The temperature does not drop to the baseline (temperature in He) due to the residual activity after 400 min (see Figure 4).
Figure 5 Temperature of the gas at the outlet of the catalyst bed in the TEOM during ODHP over FeZSM-5 at (a) 673 K, (b) 723 K, and (c) 773 K (black symbols). Conditions are as in the caption of Figure 4. The profiles of coke and propene yield are depicted in gray (without scale) for comparative purposes.
An excellent agreement is obtained at 723 K too: the outlet gas temperature drops at the inflection point of the coking profile (at ca. 100 min), due to the sudden catalyst deactivation. The experiment at 773 K deviates from the other reaction temperatures, because the decrease of propene yield and propane conversion due to coke deactivation is not accompanied by a decrease in the gas outlet temperature, which remains practically constant at ca. 765 K.
The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4). The partial N2O and CO2 pressures versus time on stream during ODHP at various temperatures in Figure 6 support this. As expected, the amount of CO2 decreases upon deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 673 and 723 K, approaching a nearly constant (residual) value after 10 and 100 min, respectively. Contrarily, the amount of CO2 evolved progressively increases with time on stream at 773 K. This result can be interpreted as follows: upon N2O decomposition, which is favored at high temperature, adsorbed atomic oxygen or desorbed O2 participates, to a certain extent, in the regeneration of the zeolite surface by oxidation of coke, leading to CO2 formation. This leads to a retarded catalyst deactivation. Coke oxidation and N2O decomposition are exothermic processes, and their occurrence substantiates theobservation that the gas temperature at the outlet of the catalyst bed in Figure 5 remains nearly constant, even if the conversion of propane continuously decreases due to catalyst deactivation. The participation of the oxidant in coke oxidation above a certain reaction temperature may also explain the similar final coke content obtained in FeZSM-5 at 723 and 773 K.
Figure 6 Partial pressure of (a) N2O and (b) CO2 at the reactor outlet during ODHP over FeZSM-5 at different reaction temperatures. Other conditions are as in the caption of Figure 4.Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O. 8,18 In an attempt to minimize coke deactivation over FeZSM-5, the effect of O2 addition to the C3H8+N2O mixture on the performance has been investigated. Following the results of Chaki et al., 19 addition of excess O2 in the feed suppresses the formation of carbonaceous deposits in the reaction of C2H4 and N2O over FeZSM-5. Accordingly, our strategy was to combine the specificity of N2O as monooxygen donor in ODHP and the ability of molecular O2 to continuously regenerate the coke deposits formed. The effect of adding small amounts of O2 (molar feed N2O/O2 ratio = 20) on the ODHP performance of FeZSM-5 at 723 K is shown in Figure 7. The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx. As a result, the initial C3H6 yield in the absence of O2 (22%) is reduced to 11% in the presence of O2. TEOM experiments have indeed evidenced a reduced coke amount in the presence of O2 and thus a diminished catalyst deactivation (not shown), which is attributed to the total oxidation by O2 of reaction intermediates leading to coke formation to COx. Such intermediates appear to be essential for propene production. Accordingly, the performance of FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated ODH of propane is severely deteriorated in the presence of small amounts of O2.Figure 7 Influence of O2 addition to the C3H8+N2O mixture on the propane conversion and propene yield at WHSV = 400000 mL h-1 gcat-1 and P = 2 bar. Solid bars: 100 mbar C3H8 and 100 mbar N2O in He. Open bars: 100 mbar C3H8, 100 mbar N2O, and 5 mbar O2 in He.The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2. However, it should be mentioned that the experimental conditions in both studies are not directly comparable. The amount of oxygen used in ref 9 (N2O/O2 = 1.5) was ca. 15 times higher than that in our study (N2O/O2 = 20), and the experiments were carried out in the excess of oxidant (C3H8/(N2O+O2) = 0.3), this ratio being 1 in our experiments. Besides, the space velocity applied (30000 mL h-1 gcat-1) is 1 order of magnitude lower than in our study (400000 mL h-1 gcat-1).
3.2. Regeneration of Coked FeZSM-5. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation poses the problem of catalytic activity restoration, which is commonly reached via oxidative treatment of the coked catalyst with air or oxygen-containing mixtures at relatively high temperatures. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) as well as isothermal oxidation experiments in air were carried out to determine the optimal regeneration conditions (temperature and duration) of the coke-deactivated FeZSM-5. Figure 8a shows the weight loss during TPO experiments over FeZSM-5 after ODHP reaction at 723 K for 400 min (containing 20 wt % coke). Coke oxidation occurs in the temperature range of 650900 K, and the derivative of the weight loss shows a maximum at 795 K. With these data, isothermal regeneration in the temperature range of 723823 K was applied to further establish the duration of the regeneration step. The coke conversion versus time characteristics in Figure 8b were obtained over FeZSM-5, having the same initial coke amount (20 wt %, after ODHP at 723 K for 400 min, see Figure 4a). In good agreement with TPO results, regeneration at 823 K is extremely fast, with a total conversion of coke in ca. 2 min. The time needed for complete combustion of coke is significantly increased at a lower temperature, requiring ca. 40 and 90 min at 773 and 723 K, respectively. Equation 3 was used to model the experimental results in Figure 8b. It can be observed that a first-order kinetics describes well the relation between coke conversion (Xcoke) and time (t). The rate coefficients for coke conversion (k) at the different regeneration temperatures are shown in Figure 8b. The estimated constants increase 1 order of magnitude each 50 K in the temperature range of 723823 K.

Conditions: WHSV = 400000 mL h-1 gcat-1 and P = 2 bar. Lines in (b) represent fitted data according to eq 3.
3.3. Performance of Regenerated FeZSM-5. The results presented so far have been obtained over fresh FeZSM-5 samples. Aiming at a cyclic process, it is essential to analyze the performance of FeZSM-5 after various reaction and regeneration runs in the TEOM with the same sample. The ODHP performance of the fresh and regenerated FeZSM-5 is shown in Figure 9. In agreement with previous observations,6 the initial performance is completely recovered after regeneration. However, the regenerated catalyst deactivates much faster than the fresh one, with a final amount of coke 4 times lower in the regenerated catalyst. This behavior was observed at regeneration temperatures in the range of 723823 K. Remarkably, the residual propylene yield over fresh and regenerated FeZSM-5 is very similar. As shown in Figure 9, the performance of the regenerated zeolite was very reproducible after 2 and 10 consecutive reaction and regeneration runs at 723 K. Therefore, an irreversible change on the fresh catalyst only occurs in the first run.
Figure 9 Comparison of the coke content and C3H6 yield of the fresh FeZSM-5 (1st run, ·) and regenerated FeZSM-5 (2nd run, gray-shaded circle, and 10th run, ). ODHP conditions are as in the caption of Figure 4 at 723 K for 400 min. Regeneration conditions are as in the caption of Figure 8b at 723 K for 90 min.
Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), 20 deactivation can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of active sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites, or (iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space. The fact that the initial and residual propene yields over FeZSM-5 were very similar over the fresh and regenerated FeZSM-5 indicates that the number of active sites in the beginning of the reaction and in steady-state conditions is not reduced in the regenerated samples. However, the different dynamics of deactivation may be related to a fraction of the active species, which is more susceptible toward deactivation or simply not participating in the reaction due to a reduced accessibility. An eventual alteration of a fraction of active iron species in the zeolite channels during the first reaction and/or regeneration run, for example, leading to inactive or inaccessible iron forms, can be assumed. Comparative characterization studies of the iron species and zeolite support in the fresh, spent, and regenerated catalysts, as well as of the nature and location of the coke deposits, will focus our attention to unravel the interesting behavior shown in Figure 9. This understanding may eventually lead to modifications in the zeolite catalyst or operating conditions to maintain the remarkable stability of the fresh FeZSM-5 zeolite in the first period of the ODHP reaction in the regenerated samples. This aspect is of practical importance for extending the duration of the reaction step in the cyclic process presented in the next section.
3.4. Continuous Propylene Production in a Cyclically Operated Reactor. The feasibility of a process for continuous propylene production has been demonstrated in a cyclically operated reactor with five fixed-bed reactors in parallel using the same reaction and regeneration temperature. Figure 10 shows that a continuous propene yield >20% can be maintained over steam-activated FeZSM-5 during 1500 min by alternation of the reaction, purging, and regeneration steps. The TEOM experiments were essential to rationally adjust the parameters of the sequence in Figure 3. Particularly for the example in Figure 10, reaction was carried out at Trx = 723 K for trx = 25 min to maintain the propylene yield over 20%, according to the result in Figure 9 with the regenerated zeolite. Regeneration was carried out at the same temperature as the reaction step (Trg = 723 K) during a period of trg = 90 min, to ensure complete coke combustion according to the TEOM results in Figure 8b. Before and after the regeneration steps, a purging period of tp1 = tp2 = 5 min has been included. The cycle duration in each reactor is 125 min, and 12 consecutive cycles are shown in Figure 10. With these settings, reaction and regeneration can be effective coupled to ensure continuous propene production at the desired yield. Cyclic experiments were also conducted using reaction and regeneration temperatures of 773 K. In this case, regeneration is significantly faster than at 723 K (ca. 40 min, see Figure 8b), thus requiring a reduced number of reactors in parallel (three) for the same duration of the reaction and purging steps as in Figure 10. The reactor configuration presented here resembles the cyclic Catofin process (Lummus) for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes into isobutylene, propylene, and amylenes over a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, where three to eight fixed-bed reactors in parallel are alternatively on stream for reaction and off stream for regeneration by coke burnoff.20
Figure 10 Performance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 for ODHP with N2O in a cyclic process with five fixed-bed reactors in parallel. Sequence conditions (see Figure 3): Trx = Trg = Tp = 723 K, tcycle = 125 min, trx = 25 min, trg = 90 min, and tp1 = tp2 = 5 min. Experimental conditions for reaction and regeneration steps are as in the caption of Figures 4 and 8, respectively.
The novel process presented in this manuscript can be applied for on-site C3H6 production and is particularly attractive if a low-cost source of N2O is available. An appealing process option consists of the utilization of N2O in tail-gas of chemical production plants where N2O is produced in high concentration. This waste-to-chemical concept was introduced by Solutia for the utilization of N2O produced in adipic acid production as a selective oxidant in the one-step hydroxylation of benzene to phenol.11 Other sources of concentrated N2O (up to 50 vol %) include tail-gases of production plants of caprolactan, glyoxal, and in general organic syntheses using HNO3 as an oxidant. 21 The efficient utilization of N2O in tail-gases should involve a previous purification step. As shown here, the presence of O2 (a typical component of tail-gases) has a negative impact on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene over FeZSM-5. The presence of NO traces in the gas however leads to a negative effect on the propylene yield, as shown previously for the reduction of N2O with C3H8 in the presence of excess oxygen. 22 Such a purification/separation process upstream of the cyclic reactor would certainly add a substantial cost to the oxidant. An alternative for low-cost and reasonably pure N2O may arise from the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O. The cost of the oxidant is an essential aspect to further establish the potential application of this technology.
4. Conclusions
Steam-activated FeZSM-5 is a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 2025% at 723773 K. Small amounts of O2 in the C3H8+N2O mixture are detrimental for achieving a high propene selectivity, further indicating the vital role of N2O as the oxidant in ODHP over iron zeolites. The catalyst presents a strong deactivation due to coke formation; its initial activity is recovered by air-regeneration. On this basis, a cyclic process for continuous propylene production has been demonstrated. Propene yields >20% were achieved during a period of 1500 min (12 cycles), in a configuration of five fixed-bed reactors in parallel with alternation of reaction, purging, and regeneration cycles at 723 K. Results from a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to on-line micro-GC analysis were essential to correlate activity, deactivation, and regeneration by simultaneous measurement of reaction and mass changes. This information was used to design the reaction and regeneration sequences (temperature and duration) in the cyclic process. This novel process presents an attractive alternative for the production of moderate (on-purpose) propylene volumes in localized sites having a low-cost source of N2O with a sufficient purity, in view of the detrimental effect of gases such as O2 or NO on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation over Fe-zeolites.

<questions>


Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
