[1] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation."
[2] "The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane."
[3] "A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield."
[4] "The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature."
[5] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena."
[6] "The fact that the initial and residual propene yields over FeZSM-5 were very similar over the fresh and regenerated FeZSM-5 indicates that the number of active sites in the beginning of the reaction and in steady-state conditions is not reduced in the regenerated samples."
[7] "The novel process presented in this manuscript can be applied for on-site C3H6 production and is particularly attractive if a low-cost source of N2O is available."

1.N2O is a monooxygen donor with high specificity, which can coordinate with reactive atomic oxygen species in iron zeolites to efficiently dehydrogenate propane, making it an ideal oxidant for ODHP. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 is a highly efficient catalyst for N2O-mediated ODHP, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, the catalyst deactivates rapidly due to coke formation, which is a major drawback. The rate of deactivation decreases with increasing temperature. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by various phenomena. The initial and residual propene yields over FeZSM-5 are similar for fresh and regenerated samples, indicating that the number of active sites is not reduced after regeneration. The novel cyclic process for continuous propylene production using N2O as an oxidant is particularly attractive for on-site C3H6 production if a low-cost source of N2O is available. Strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP include developing catalysts with higher resistance to deactivation, optimizing reaction conditions to reduce coke formation, and exploring alternative sources of N2O.

1.N2O是一种具有高特异性的单氧供体，可以与铁沸石中的反应性原子氧物种协调，有效地脱氢丙烷，使其成为ODHP的理想氧化剂。蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5是N2O介导的ODHP的高效催化剂，在723 K时丙烯产量高达25%。然而，催化剂由于焦炭形成而迅速失活，这是一个主要的缺点。失活速率随温度升高而降低。催化剂失活是一个复杂的过程，可能由各种现象引起。FeZSM-5在新鲜和再生样品上的初始和残余丙烯产量相似，表明反应开始和稳态条件下的活性位点数量在再生后没有减少。在有低成本N2O来源的情况下，本文提出的新型连续丙烯生产循环过程特别适用于现场C3H6生产。解决N2O-ODHP限制的策略包括开发抗失活能力更强的催化剂，优化反应条件以减少焦炭形成，以及探索N2O的替代来源。
