[5] "The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4)."
[6] "Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O."

1.N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in this process is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation of the catalyst by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. In contrast, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation.
2.Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing reaction conditions, such as temperature and space velocity, to minimize coke formation while maintaining high propene yields. Developing catalysts with improved coke resistance and stability, such as modified iron zeolites or alternative catalyst systems, could also enhance the practical feasibility of N2O-ODHP. Additionally, research on the regeneration of spent catalysts, such as air-regeneration at high temperatures, could help restore catalyst activity and prolong the duration of the reaction step in a cyclic process. The development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O, making the process more economically viable.

1.N2O是过蒸汽活化FeZSM-5在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)过程中的一种高效氧化剂，在723K时可达到高达25%的丙烯产量。铁沸石在这一过程中的卓越性能归因于N2O作为单氧供体的特异性和沸石中铁形式协调反应性原子氧物种以高效脱氢丙烷的能力。然而，催化剂失活的一个主要缺点是由于焦炭形成，导致丙烯产量迅速下降。失活速率随温度升高而降低，773K时相对缓慢的失活与高N2O转化率有关。相比之下，FeZSM-5在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中使用O2作为氧化剂时，C3H6产量(<5%)远低于N2O。在C3H8+N2O混合物中添加少量O2会导致C3H6选择性降低，COx产量增加，严重恶化FeZSM-5在N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢过程中的性能。
2.解决N2O-ODHP中催化剂失活和稳定性限制的策略包括优化反应条件，如温度和空速，以最小化焦炭形成，同时保持高丙烯产量。开发具有改进焦炭抗性和稳定性的催化剂，如改性铁沸石或替代催化剂系统，也可以提高N2O-ODHP的实际可行性。此外，对催化剂再生的研究，如在高温下进行空气再生，可以帮助恢复催化剂活性，延长循环过程中反应步骤的持续时间。开发廉价和选择性的催化剂系统，用于低温NH3氧化为N2O，可以提供低成本和相当纯净的N2O来源，使该过程在经济上更具可行性。
