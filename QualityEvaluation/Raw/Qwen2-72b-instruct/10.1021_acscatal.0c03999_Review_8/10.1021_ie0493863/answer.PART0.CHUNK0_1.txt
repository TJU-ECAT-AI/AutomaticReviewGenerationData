[1] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31.3 and 0.67 wt % Fe) is a highly efficient catalyst for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but strongly deactivates due to coke formation."
[2] "The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane."
[3] "A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield."
[4] "The initial (2022%) and final (710%) C3H6 yields showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 673773 K. However, the rate of deactivation is progressively reduced with an increase in temperature."
[5] "The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%, see Figure 4)."
[6] "Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O."
[7] "The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx."
[8] "Such intermediates appear to be essential for propene production. Accordingly, the performance of FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated ODH of propane is severely deteriorated in the presence of small amounts of O2."

1.N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in this process is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation of the catalyst by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. These findings indicate the vital role of N2O as the oxidant in ODHP over iron zeolites and the detrimental effect of O2 on the process.
2.Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction conditions, such as temperature and space velocity, to minimize coke formation while maintaining high propene yields. Developing catalysts with improved coke resistance and stability, such as modifying the zeolite framework or incorporating additional metal species, could also enhance the performance of N2O-ODHP. Additionally, exploring alternative regeneration methods, such as in situ regeneration using N2O or other selective oxidants, could help maintain catalyst activity over extended periods. Research on the fundamental mechanisms of coke formation and catalyst deactivation could provide insights into developing more stable and efficient catalysts for N2O-ODHP. The development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could also provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O for the process.

1.N2O是过蒸汽活化FeZSM-5在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)中的一种高效氧化剂,在723K时可达到高达25%的丙烯产量。铁沸石在这一过程中的卓越性能归因于N2O作为单氧供体的特异性和沸石中铁形式协调反应性原子氧物种以有效脱氢丙烷的能力。然而,铁沸石在N2O-ODHP中的主要缺点是由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活,导致丙烯产量迅速下降。随着温度的升高,失活速率降低,FeZSM-5在773K时的相对缓慢失活与高N2O转化率有关。使用O2作为FeZSM-5上丙烷氧化脱氢的氧化剂导致与N2O相比非常低的C3H6产量(<5%)。在C3H8+N2O混合物中添加少量O2导致C3H6选择性降低,COx产量增加。这些发现表明N2O作为铁沸石上ODHP的氧化剂的至关重要作用,以及O2对过程的不利影响。
2.解决N2O-ODHP中催化剂失活和稳定性限制的策略包括优化反应条件,如温度和空速,以最小化焦炭形成,同时保持高丙烯产量。开发具有改进焦炭抗性和稳定性的催化剂,如修改沸石框架或掺入其他金属物种,也可以提高N2O-ODHP的性能。此外,探索替代再生方法,如使用N2O或其他选择性氧化剂进行原位再生,可以帮助在延长期内保持催化剂活性。关于焦炭形成和催化剂失活的基本机制的研究可以为开发更稳定和高效的N2O-ODHP催化剂提供见解。开发廉价和选择性的催化剂系统用于低温NH3氧化为N2O也可以为该过程提供低成本和相当纯净的N2O来源。
