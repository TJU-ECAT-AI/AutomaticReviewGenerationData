[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
[2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
[3] "The results obtained lead to a better understanding of the role of oxidant activation and may eventually lead to improved catalyst design and/or process operation."

1.The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of increasing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The study's findings improve understanding of oxidant activation's role, potentially leading to improved catalyst design and process operation.

1.在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂,与其它氧化剂相比,具有提高丙烯选择性的优势。这是因为N2O分解不如O2活化有利,导致活性位点的稳态浓度降低,丙烯选择性增加。研究结果增进了对氧化剂活化作用的理解,可能最终导致催化剂设计和/或工艺操作的改进。
