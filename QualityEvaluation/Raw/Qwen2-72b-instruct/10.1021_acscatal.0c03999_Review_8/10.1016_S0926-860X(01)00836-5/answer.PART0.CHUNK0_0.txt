[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
[2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
[3] "The results obtained lead to a better understanding of the role of oxidant activation and may eventually lead to improved catalyst design and/or process operation."

1.The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been found to increase the selectivity towards propene formation compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation over the studied catalyst materials, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The findings contribute to a better understanding of oxidant activation, which could lead to improved catalyst design and process operation.

1.在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂,与氧气(O2)等其他氧化剂相比,可以提高丙烯的选择性。这是因为N2O分解在研究的催化剂材料上不如O2激活有利,导致活性位点的稳态浓度降低,丙烯选择性提高。这些发现有助于更好地理解氧化剂的激活作用,最终可能促进催化剂设计和/或工艺操作的改进。
