          [1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
          [3] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
          [4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective ox- idation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of increasing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The efficiency of isolated VOx species for selective ODHP is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia. To achieve high performance in ODHP, it is desirable to design catalytic surfaces that are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimized to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. Using N2O instead of O2 can achieve this optimization.

          在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂，与其它氧化剂相比，具有提高丙烯选择性的优势。这是因为N2O分解不如O2激活有利，导致活性位点的稳态浓度降低，丙烯选择性增加。孤立VOx物种在选择性ODHP中的效率被非选择性氧化所叠加，这种氧化发生在未被活性矾覆盖的酸性支撑表面。为了在ODHP中实现高性能，设计催化表面是可取的，这些表面完全被分散良好的矾物种覆盖，以避免丙烯在支撑表面上的强烈吸附。参与丙烷和丙烯活化的活性晶格氧的稳态浓度应进行优化，以控制选择性氧化和燃烧反应。使用N2O代替O2可以实现这种优化。
