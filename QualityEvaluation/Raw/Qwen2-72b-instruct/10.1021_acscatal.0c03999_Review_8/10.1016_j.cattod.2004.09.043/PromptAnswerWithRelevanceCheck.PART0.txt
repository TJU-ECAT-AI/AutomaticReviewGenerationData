[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
[2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
[3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."

[5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."

1.N2O, as a gaseous promoter, can significantly improve the selectivity of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O can inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP while being less oxidant than O2. The addition of N2O can decrease the conversion of propane and oxygen, increase the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decrease the yield and selectivity to CO2.
2.The catalysts employed in this process include NiMoO4 supported on vanadium-containing MCM-41 mesoporous catalysts. The results show that the addition of N2O can lead to an important decrease in the conversion, a significant increase in the selectivity, and some increase in the yield of propylene. The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts.
3.The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include the formation of carbonaceous products and the reduction of the catalysts (molybdenum) in the absence of O2. Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. The use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable because the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon in the absence of O2.
4.Strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the development of more stable and selective catalysts, the optimization of the reaction conditions, and the use of a mixture of N2O and O2 as the oxidant. The use of a mixture of N2O and O2 can ensure the regeneration of the catalysts and prevent the formation of carbonaceous products. The optimization of the reaction conditions can improve the selectivity and yield of propylene. The development of more stable and selective catalysts can improve the stability and efficiency of the process.

1.N2O作为一种气体促进剂，与其它氧化剂相比，在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODP)中可以显著提高丙烯的选择性。这是因为N2O可以抑制O2的吸附，从而限制非选择性氧物种的形成和/或催化剂的氧化速率。当N2O的量高于300 ppm时，来自N2O分解的氧物种也可能发挥作用，表明虽然N2O的氧化性低于O2，但它也能诱导ODP。添加N2O可以降低丙烷和氧气的转化率，提高丙烯的产率和选择性，降低CO2的产率和选择性。
2.在这一过程中使用的催化剂包括NiMoO4支持在含钒MCM-41介孔催化剂上。结果表明，添加N2O可以显著降低转化率，显著提高选择性，并在一定程度上提高丙烯的产率。由于添加N2O，选择性的重要提高为选择性介孔催化剂的应用开辟了广阔的前景。
3.与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括在没有O2的情况下形成碳质产物和催化剂(钼)的还原。在N2O存在的情况下，需要分子氧来氧化和再生催化剂，否则催化剂会迅速失活。在没有O2的情况下，催化剂显示出大量的碳，因此使用纯N2O进行ODP是不可取的。
4.可以解决这些限制，使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选择的策略或研究方向包括开发更稳定和选择性的催化剂，优化反应条件，以及使用N2O和O2的混合物作为氧化剂。使用N2O和O2的混合物可以确保催化剂的再生，防止碳质产物的形成。优化反应条件可以提高丙烯的选择性和产率。开发更稳定和选择性的催化剂可以提高过程的稳定性和效率。

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as a gaseous promoter in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) and catalytic combustion of methane (CCM). In ODP, the addition of 300 ppm N2O can decrease the conversion of propane and oxygen, increase the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decrease the yield and selectivity to CO2. This is because in the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP. However, the conversion of N2O was very low, indicating that the propylene formed is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O. Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst. In the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon, indicating that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable. Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation.

2.The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODP has several advantages over other oxidants. Firstly, N2O can improve the selectivity to propylene, which is the desired product in ODP. Secondly, N2O can inhibit the non-selective sites, leading to a lower conversion and higher selectivity. However, there are also critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. In the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon, indicating that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable. Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation. To address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, strategies or research directions could include: (i) developing more stable catalysts that can withstand the reducing environment created by N2O, (ii) optimizing the reaction conditions to maximize the selectivity to propylene while minimizing the formation of carbonaceous deposits, (iii) exploring the use of other promoters or co-promoters that can enhance the stability and activity of the catalysts, and (iv) investigating the mechanism of N2O dissociation and its role in the ODP reaction.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被用作丙烷氧化脱氢(ODP)和甲烷催化燃烧(CCM)的气体促进剂。在ODP中，添加300 ppm N2O可以降低丙烷和氧气的转化率，提高丙烯的产率和选择性，降低CO2的产率和选择性。这是因为，在N2O的存在下，催化位点处于更还原的状态，因此，以更选择性的方式工作。当N2O的量高于300 ppm时，来自N2O分解的氧物种也可能发挥作用，表明尽管N2O的氧化性低于O2，但它也能诱导ODP。然而，N2O的转化率非常低，表明形成的丙烯并非完全由于N2O的ODP。丙烯也可能通过另一种机制形成，可能涉及催化剂的晶格氧。在没有O2的情况下，催化剂显示出大量的碳，表明仅使用N2O进行ODP是不可取的。在N2O存在的情况下，需要分子氧来氧化和再生催化剂，否则催化剂会迅速失活。N2O还原催化剂(钼)，解释了高碳的形成。这些结果强烈表明，NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41催化剂存在下N2O的潜在作用是抑制非选择性位点，仅使用N2O形成的丙烯非常低，O2和N2O(作为促进剂)的存在可以充分解释催化剂在ODP中更好的选择性，这是由于在反应过程中调节了它们适当的氧化态。
2.在ODP中使用N2O作为氧化剂与其它氧化剂相比有几个优点。首先，N2O可以提高对丙烯的选择性，这是ODP中期望的产品。其次，N2O可以抑制非选择性位点，导致较低的转化率和较高的选择性。然而，催化剂失活和稳定性也存在关键挑战。在没有O2的情况下，催化剂显示出大量的碳，表明仅使用N2O进行ODP是不可取的。在N2O存在的情况下，需要分子氧来氧化和再生催化剂，否则催化剂会迅速失活。N2O还原催化剂(钼)，解释了高碳的形成。为了解决这些限制，并可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用实施选项，策略或研究方向可能包括：(i)开发能承受N2O产生的还原环境的更稳定催化剂，(ii)优化反应条件，以最大化对丙烯的选择性，同时最小化碳沉积物的形成，(iii)探索使用其他促进剂或共促进剂，以增强催化剂的稳定性和活性，(iv)研究N2O分解的机制及其在ODP反应中的作用。

8.An alternative explanation is that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, leading to a lower conversion while selectivity increases.
9.The increase of yield may be due to the fact that in a consecutive reaction pattern, the yield to the intermediate species product shows a maximum when increasing reactants conversion, while its selectivity decreases.
10.When the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4, the addition of 1 vol.% N2O decreases the conversion from 7.5 to 4.3% and increases the selectivity from 34.8 to 41.9%.
11.An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2).
12.In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%, respectively.
13.However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%).
14.This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O.
15.Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst.
16.On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon.
17.This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable.
18.Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly.
19.N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation.
20.These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non-selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction.

1.当添加为气态促进剂时，N2O会改变丙烷氧化脱氢(ODP)和甲烷催化燃烧(CCM)的催化性能。
2.在ODP中，添加300 ppm N2O会降低丙烷和氧气的转化率，提高丙烯的产率和选择性，同时降低CO2的产率和选择性。
3.在N2O存在下，催化位点处于更还原的状态，从而导致更选择性的反应。
4.N2O可能抑制O2的吸附，限制非选择性氧物种的形成和/或催化剂的氧化速率。
5.当N2O的量高于300 ppm时，来自N2O解离的氧物种也可能发挥作用，表明N2O也能诱导ODP。
6.N2O的添加显著提高了ODP的选择性，为选择性介孔催化剂的应用开辟了广阔的前景。
7.N2O添加的主要后果可归因于支撑介孔催化剂上非选择性位点数量的减少。
8.另一种解释是N2O抑制了非选择性丙烷活化位点，导致转化率降低，而选择性提高。
9.产率的增加可能是由于在连续反应模式下，当反应物转化率增加时，中间物种产物的产率达到最大，而其选择性降低。
10.当催化剂含有一层NiMoO4时，添加1 vol.% N2O会使转化率从7.5%降低到4.3%，选择性从34.8%提高到41.9%。
11.在仅含5 vol.% N2O(即无O2)的情况下，1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41催化剂得到了有趣的结果。
12.在这种情况下，丙烷的转化率为6.8%，丙烯的产率和选择性分别为3.2和47.5%。
13.然而，N2O的转化率非常低(仅为0.5%)。
14.这一结果表明，形成的丙烯(3.2%)并非完全由N2O的ODP产生。
15.丙烯也可能通过另一种机制形成，可能涉及催化剂的晶格氧。
16.另一方面，在没有O2的情况下，催化剂显示出大量的碳。
17.这一观察结果表明，仅使用N2O进行ODP是不可取的。
18.在N2O存在下，分子氧对于氧化和再生催化剂是必要的，否则催化剂会迅速失活。
19.N2O还原催化剂(钼)，解释了高碳的形成。
20.这些结果强烈表明：(i)在NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41催化剂存在下，N2O的潜在作用是抑制非选择性位点，(ii)仅使用N2O形成丙烯的量非常低，(iii)O2和N2O(作为促进剂)的存在可以充分解释催化剂在ODP中更好的选择性，这是由于在反应过程中调节了它们适当的氧化态。

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
[2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
[3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
[4] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to modify the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction. Principally, it decreases the conversion of propane and oxygen, increases the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decreases the yield and selectivity to CO2. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, leading to a more selective reaction. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP, although less oxidant than O2. However, the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable as molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation. It is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction.

1.一氧化二氮（N2O）已被证明可以改变同一催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODP）反应中的催化性能。主要表现为降低丙烷和氧气的转化率，提高丙烯的产率和选择性，降低CO2的产率和选择性。在N2O存在下，催化位点处于更还原的状态，导致反应更具选择性。当N2O的量高于300 ppm时，来自N2O分解的氧物种也可能发挥作用，表明N2O虽然不如O2氧化性强，但也能诱导ODP。然而，仅使用N2O进行ODP是不可取的，因为在N2O存在下，需要分子氧来氧化和再生催化剂，否则催化剂会迅速失活。N2O会还原催化剂（钼），解释了高碳形成的原因。正是O2和N2O（作为促进剂）的存在，才能充分解释催化剂在ODP中更好的选择性，这是由于它们在反应过程中对催化剂适当氧化态的调节。
