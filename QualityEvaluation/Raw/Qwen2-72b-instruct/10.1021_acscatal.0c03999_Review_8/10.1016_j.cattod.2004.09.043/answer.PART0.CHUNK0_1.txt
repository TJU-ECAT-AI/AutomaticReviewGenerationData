[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
[2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
[3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
[4] "We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
[5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."
[6] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
[7] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."
[8] "One alternative explanation could be the fact that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, so leading to a lower conversion, while selectivity increases."
[9] "The results obtained when the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4 were similar, but less significant (when 1 vol.% N2O is added,conversion decreases from 7.5 to 4.3% and selectivity increases from 34.8 to 41.9%)."
[10] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 cat- alyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2)."
[11] "In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%,respectively."
[12] "However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%)."
[13] "This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O."
[14] "Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst."
[15] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon."
[16] "This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable."
[17] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."
[18] "N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explain- ing the high carbon formation."
[19] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

1.N2O, as a gaseous promoter, can significantly improve the selectivity of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O can inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP while being less oxidant than O2. The addition of N2O can decrease the conversion of propane and oxygen, increase the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decrease the yield and selectivity to CO2.
2.The catalysts employed in this process include NiMoO4 supported on vanadium-containing MCM-41 mesoporous catalysts. The results show that the addition of N2O can lead to an important decrease in the conversion, a significant increase in the selectivity, and some increase in the yield of propylene. The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts.
3.The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include the formation of carbonaceous products and the reduction of the catalysts (molybdenum) in the absence of O2. Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. The use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable because the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon in the absence of O2.
4.Strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the development of more stable and selective catalysts, the optimization of the reaction conditions, and the use of a mixture of N2O and O2 as the oxidant. The use of a mixture of N2O and O2 can ensure the regeneration of the catalysts and prevent the formation of carbonaceous products. The optimization of the reaction conditions can improve the selectivity and yield of propylene. The development of more stable and selective catalysts can improve the stability and efficiency of the process.

1.N2O作为一种气体促进剂，与其它氧化剂相比，在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODP)中可以显著提高丙烯的选择性。这是因为N2O可以抑制O2的吸附，从而限制非选择性氧物种的形成和/或催化剂的氧化速率。当N2O的量高于300 ppm时，来自N2O分解的氧物种也可能发挥作用，表明虽然N2O的氧化性低于O2，但它也能诱导ODP。添加N2O可以降低丙烷和氧气的转化率，提高丙烯的产率和选择性，降低CO2的产率和选择性。
2.在这一过程中使用的催化剂包括NiMoO4支持在含钒MCM-41介孔催化剂上。结果表明，添加N2O可以显著降低转化率，显著提高选择性，并在一定程度上提高丙烯的产率。由于添加N2O，选择性的重要提高为选择性介孔催化剂的应用开辟了广阔的前景。
3.与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括在没有O2的情况下形成碳质产物和催化剂(钼)的还原。在N2O存在的情况下，需要分子氧来氧化和再生催化剂，否则催化剂会迅速失活。在没有O2的情况下，催化剂显示出大量的碳，因此使用纯N2O进行ODP是不可取的。
4.可以解决这些限制，使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选择的策略或研究方向包括开发更稳定和选择性的催化剂，优化反应条件，以及使用N2O和O2的混合物作为氧化剂。使用N2O和O2的混合物可以确保催化剂的再生，防止碳质产物的形成。优化反应条件可以提高丙烯的选择性和产率。开发更稳定和选择性的催化剂可以提高过程的稳定性和效率。
