[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."
[2] "The addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
[3] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
[4] "We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
[5] "When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, another phenomenon probably takes place. Oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that, while being less oxidant than O2, N2O is also able to induce the ODP."
[6] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
[7] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."
[8] "One alternative explanation could be the fact that N2O inhibits the sites for non-selective propane activation, so leading to a lower conversion, while selectivity increases."
[9] "The results obtained when the catalyst contains one monolayer of NiMoO4 were similar, but less significant (when 1 vol.% N2O is added,conversion decreases from 7.5 to 4.3% and selectivity increases from 34.8 to 41.9%)."
[10] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 cat- alyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2)."
[11] "In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%,respectively."
[12] "However, the conversion of N2O was very low (only 0.5%)."
[13] "This result indicates that the propylene formed (3.2%) is not exclusively due to the ODP with N2O."
[14] "Propylene is also formed by another mechanism, probably involving lattice oxygen from the catalyst."
[15] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon."
[16] "This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable."
[17] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."
[18] "N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explain- ing the high carbon formation."
[19] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

1.N2O as a gaseous promoter has been used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) and catalytic combustion of methane (CCM).
2.The addition of 300 ppm N2O can decrease the conversion of propane and oxygen, increase the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decrease the yield and selectivity to CO2.
3.In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, leading to higher selectivity.
4.N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts.
5.When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)作为一种气体促进剂,已被用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODP)和甲烷催化燃烧(CCM)。
2.添加300 ppm N2O可以降低丙烷和氧气的转化率,提高丙烯的产率和选择性,降低二氧化碳的产率和选择性。
3.在N2O存在下,催化位点处于更还原的状态,从而提高选择性。
4.N2O可能抑制O2的吸附,限制非选择性氧物种的形成和/或催化剂的氧化速率。
5.当N2O的量高于300 ppm时,来自N2O分解的氧物种也可能发挥作用,表明N2O也能诱导ODP。
6.N2O的添加显著提高了反应的选择性,为选择性介孔催化剂的应用开辟了广阔的前景。
7.N2O添加的主要后果可归因于支撑介孔催化剂上非选择性位点数量的减少。
8.另一种解释是N2O抑制了非选择性丙烷活化位点,导致转化率降低,而选择性增加。
9.当催化剂含有一个单层的NiMoO4时,添加1 vol.% N2O将转化率从7.5降低到4.3%,选择性从34.8增加到41.9%。
10.在仅含5 vol.% N2O(即无O2)的情况下,1 (单层)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41催化剂得到了有趣的结果。
11.在这种情况下,丙烷的转化率为6.8%,丙烯的产率和选择性分别为3.2和47.5%。
12.然而,N2O的转化率非常低(仅为0.5%)。
13.这一结果表明,形成的丙烯(3.2%)并非仅由N2O的ODP引起。
14.丙烯也可能通过另一种机制形成,可能涉及催化剂的晶格氧。
15.另一方面,在没有O2的情况下,催化剂显示出大量的碳。
16.这一观察结果表明,仅使用N2O进行ODP是不可取的。
17.在N2O存在下,分子氧对于氧化和再生催化剂是必要的,否则催化剂会迅速失活。
18.N2O还原催化剂(钼),解释了高碳的形成。
19.这些结果强烈表明,N2O在NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41催化剂存在下可能抑制非选择性位点,仅使用N2O形成的丙烯非常低,而O2和N2O(作为促进剂)的存在可以充分解释催化剂在ODP中更好的选择性,这是由于它们在反应过程中适当氧化态的调节。
