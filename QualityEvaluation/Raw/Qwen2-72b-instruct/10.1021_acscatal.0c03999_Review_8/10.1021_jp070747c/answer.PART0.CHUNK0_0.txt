[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O. Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
[2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
[3] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
[4] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5. The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2. The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
[5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is attributed to the higher degree of reduction of vanadium oxide (VOx) species when N2O is used, which is beneficial for achieving high propene selectivity. However, the activity of the ODHP reaction with N2O is lower than with O2. Various catalysts have been employed in this process, including VOx supported on silica (SiO2), MCM-41, and MCM-48. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis. The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is responsible for the lower ODHP activity with N2O. The reaction scheme for the ODHP using O2 or N2O involves parallel and consecutive steps, with propane directly converted to propene and carbon oxides (COx). The importance of direct propane conversion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is higher with O2 than with N2O. N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process include the lower activity with N2O and the need to maintain a high degree of reduction of VOx species. Strategies to address these limitations could involve developing more stable and active catalysts, optimizing reaction conditions to enhance the reoxidation ability of N2O, and exploring alternative oxidants that can maintain high propene selectivity while improving activity. Research directions could focus on understanding the fundamental mechanisms of N2O activation and VOx reoxidation, as well as the role of support materials in stabilizing VOx species.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中显示出比其他氧化剂如氧气(O2)更高的丙烯选择性。这归因于使用N2O时,五氧化二钒(VOx)物种具有更高的还原度,这对实现高丙烯选择性有益。然而,与O2相比,N2O的ODHP反应活性较低。在这一过程中,使用了各种催化剂,包括二氧化硅(SiO2)、MCM-41和MCM-48支持的VOx。使用原位UV/vis分析研究了VOx物种的氧化还原动力学。N2O对还原VOx物种的再氧化能力较低,是N2O下ODHP活性较低的原因。使用O2或N2O的ODHP反应方案涉及并行和连续步骤,其中丙烷直接转化为丙烯和碳氧化物(COx)。与N2O相比,直接丙烷转化和连续丙烯氧化为COx的重要性更高。N2O不会产生非选择性吸附氧物种,这些物种由O2形成,催化非选择性连续丙烯氧化为COx。N2O-ODHP过程与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括N2O下的较低活性和维持VOx物种高还原度的需要。解决这些限制的策略可能涉及开发更稳定和活性更高的催化剂,优化反应条件以增强N2O的再氧化能力,并探索可以维持高丙烯选择性同时提高活性的替代氧化剂。研究方向可以集中在理解N2O激活和VOx再氧化的基本机制,以及支撑材料在稳定VOx物种中的作用。
