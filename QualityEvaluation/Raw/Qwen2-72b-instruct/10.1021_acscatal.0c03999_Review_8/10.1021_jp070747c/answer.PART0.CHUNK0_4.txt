[1] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."
[2] "The BET values of unloaded MCM-41, MCM-48, and SiO2 support materials amounted to 1040, 1049, and 300 m2/g, respectively."
[3] "Vanadium-loaded MCM-41 and SiO2 materials showed a decrease in the specific surface area by a factor of ca. 20% for vanadium loadings up to 5.3 wt %."
[4] "The VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 catalyst lost ca. 50% of the original surface area of MCM-48."
[5] "The SBET value (52 m2/g) of VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 is significantly lower than those of the other catalysts."
[6] "As reported in ref 20, the pore structure of MCM-41 is completely destroyed in this sample."
[7] "Small V2O5 crystallites were observed in this sample by means of ex-situ XRD analysis."
[8] "The XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to ca. 5 wt % do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase."
[9] "Additional UV/vis and Raman spectroscopic characterization studies (the data are not shown for brevity) did not indicate a possible presence of XRD-amorphous crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles for samples possessing up to 5.3 wt % vanadium."
[10] "The calculated vanadium surface densities are 0.37, 0.6, 1.38, and 25.4 for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, VOx(2.9)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, respectively."
[11] "On the basis of the obtained densities and the literature9 values for a vanadium monolayer (57 V/nm2), it can be safely concluded that all catalytic materials, except for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41, possess VOx species below one vanadium monolayer."
[12] "A single maximum of H2 consumption at ca. 801 and 806 K was observed upon reduction of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 and VOx (2.8)/SiO2, respectively."
[13] "Additionally to the maximal H2 consumption at 810 K, a small shoulder at ca. 860 K was identified in the TPR profile of the VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 sample."
[14] "This shoulder becomes more pronounced for the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where crystalline V2O5 phase was identified by XRD analysis."
[15] "According to the literature data,37,42,43 the peak at 864 K could be due to the presence of highly polymerized VOx species or crystalline V2O5."
[16] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material at apparent surface vanadium densities below one monolayer."
[17] "The relative degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the order"
[18] "The VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possesses microcrystalline V2O5 phase."
[19] "The next section establishes correlations between the nature of VOx species and their performance in the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O."
[20] "Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."
[21] "Since the amount of N2O was double that of O2, both of the above reaction feeds contained the same amount of oxygen atoms."
[22] "This allows the comparison of the influence of oxidizing agents on the ODP reaction."
[23] "The TOF (turnover frequency) values of propane conversion in the presence of O2 and N2O over VOx species below (VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48) and above (VOx(11.2)/MCM-41) one monolayer are compared in Table 1."
[24] "The TOF values were calculated taking the total amount of vanadium atoms into account."
[25] "This table illustrates that the catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples."
[26] "This may be due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species over the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst as shown in section 3.1."
[27] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
[28] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."
[29] "For establishing overall mechanistic scheme of the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O over VOx species of different degrees of polymerization, catalytic performance (product selectivity) was determined at different contact times, that is, different degrees of propane conversion."
[30] "This knowledge is of high importance for catalyst designing, because it provides essential information on the sequence of product formation, that is, the catalyst ability for C3H8 conversion to C3H6 and COx as well as for consecutive C3H6 combustion."
[31] "The obtained selectivityconversion relationships with O2 are summarized in Figure 1."
[32] "Propene selectivity decreases, while CO and CO2 selectivities (the data are not shown) increase with an increase in the degree of propane conversion."
[33] "Such behavior is explained by consecutive oxidation of the primarily formed propene to carbon oxides."
[34] "For the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, the low propene selectivity at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion is an indication for catalytic activity toward direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to carbon oxides."
[35] "This reaction pathway does not play any significant role over other catalytic materials with vanadium loading below one monolayer."
[36] "Over the latter catalysts, CO and CO2 originate mainly via consecutive C3H6 oxidation."
[37] "Figure 1b illustrates selectivityconversion relationships in the ODP reaction over differently structured VOx species using N2O."
[38] "As in the presence of O2 (Figure 1a), propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion with N2O, too."
[39] "However, from the comparison of the results in Figure 1a and b, it is obvious that propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion."
[40] "This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
[41] "From a more detailed analysis of the data in Figure 1, the primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of propane conversion) and the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx can be derived."
[42] "These two parameters represent the catalyst activity for direct propane conversion to COx and for consecutive combustion of primarily formed propene, respectively."
[43] "In the present paper, the dependence of S(C3H6) on X(C3H8) at low propane conversion (<10%) is described by a linear function in eq 1."
[44] "where S(C3H6)initial and A are the primary propene selectivity and the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, respectively."
[45] "According to this function, the primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx."
[46] "This parameter is related to the catalyst activity for propene conversion to carbon oxides."
[47] "The higher the slope of the function in eq 1, the faster the COx production from C3H6."
[48] "Establishing the relationships between the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation and the structure of VOx species or the applied oxidizing agent is highly relevant for designing selective catalysts, since propene selectivity in the ODP reaction suffers mainly from the higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."
[49] "Figure 2 compares the primary S(C3H6) and the catalyst ability (A) for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx over differently structured VOx species in the presence of O2 and N2O."
[50] "For an O2-containing reaction feed (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40), it is clear that the primary propene selectivity is close for VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, and VOx(2.8)/SiO2 materials but is significantly low over VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 (Figure 2 a)."
[51] "From the characterization results in section 3.1, the latter material possesses microcrystalline V2O5 while other materials are free of microcrystalline V2O5 and possess highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx species."
[52] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too."
[53] "The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found:"
[54] "The degree of polymerization of VOx species follows the same order (section 3.1)."
[55] "Thus, the higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
[56] "This conclusion is in agreement with literature data9 and with our recent results of the ODP reaction on VOx/γ-Al2O3.36"
[57] "Further insights into the influence of oxidizing agent on product selectivity in the ODP reaction are derived from the analysis of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 ratios at different degrees of propane conversion."
[58] "Table 1 represents these ratios at propane conversions of ca. 2 and 10%."
[59] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."
[60] "However, the ratio of CO2/C3H6 over polymerized VOx species increases from 0.04 to 0.13, while the ratio of CO/C3H6 decreases from 1.7 to 0.27, when N2O is used instead of O2."
[61] "For both oxidizing agents, the ratios of CO/C3H6 and CO2/C3H6 increase with propane conversion, with the former increasing stronger."
[62] "This increase is less pronounced for a feed with N2O."
[63] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
[64] "This effect is more pronounced for polymerized VOx species."
[65] "Summarizing, two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
[66] "To elucidate possible reasons of the influence of oxidizing agent on the ODP performance of highly dispersed VOx species and microcrystalline V2O5, in-situ UV/vis measurements were performed at 773 K."
[67] "The degrees of propane and oxidant (O2 and N2O) conversion were controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS)."
[68] "To ensure a near-to-uniform composition of the studied catalysts along the catalyst bed, propane and oxidant (O2 or N2O) conversions were kept below 5 and 10%, respectively."
[69] "Figure 3 exemplifies in-situ UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41, VOx(2.8)/SiO2, and VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 in oxidizing (O2/Ne = 20/80) and reducing (H2/N2 = 5/95 or C3H8/Ne = 40/60) atmospheres as well as in ODP feeds (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20)."
[70] "The UV/vis spectrum in a flow of O2 with the absorption at 295 nm is characteristic for tetrahedrally coordinated V5+Ox species."
[71] "The adsorption in the 400700 nm region (dd transitions of reduced vanadium species) increases upon switching from an O2 flow to a H2 flow (Figure 3a); the UV/vis bands of V4+ and V3+ species appear as broad features in the 400800 nm region (note the nonzero value of the absorption for the reduced samples in this region)."
[72] "46,47 Similar changes were also observed when the oxidized catalyst was admitted to a C3H8 flow."
[73] "Since no significant differences in the UV/vis spectra in H2 and C3H8 flows were observed (Figure 3a), the effect of possible carbon-containing deposits in the case of C3H8 flow on the interpretation of UV/vis data can therefore be neglected."
[74] "Thus, the observed changes in the UV/vis spectra of VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 upon switching from oxidizing to reducing flows reflect the changes in reduction degree of VOx species under different reaction conditions."
[75] "Taking the above discussion into account, the UV/vis spectra in O2 (20% O2 in Ne) and C3H8 (40% C3H8 in Ne) flows represent oxidized and reduced states of VOx species, respectively."
[76] "In the following, we compare UV/vis spectra under different ODP conditions (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) with the spectra of oxidized and reduced VOx species to derive insights into the reduction degree of VOx species under reaction conditions."
[77] "One can see from Figure 3 that the UV/vis spectra during the ODP reaction with O2 (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40) and in an O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) flow are very similar."
[78] "This means that the oxidation state of VOx species in both cases is close to 5+."
[79] "However, there is a strong difference between the UV/vis spectra in O2 (O2/Ne = 20/80) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows, while the UV/vis spectra in H2 (H2/N2 = 5/95) and N2OC3H8 (N2O/C3H8/Ne = 40/40/20) flows are very similar."
[80] "This evidence that the oxidation state of VOx species under conditions of the ODP reaction with N2O (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%) is similar to the reduced one."
[81] "This means that the oxidation state of vanadium in VOx species decreases from 5+ to 3+ and/or 4+ when the ODP reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2."
[82] "Another interesting observation from Figure 3 is the appearance of a new band at 400450 nm in the UV/vis spectrum of VOx(2.8)/SiO2 in a C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) flow."
[83] "A similar band was also identified over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 after 1030 min on stream in C3H8."
[84] "To prove whether this band may belong to carbon deposits, we performed time-on-stream in-situ UV/vis tests over VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 in a H2 flow (H2/N2 = 5/95)."
[85] "The results are shown in Figure 4."
[86] "One can see that the band at 400450 nm starts to appear after 10 min and becomes apparent after 30 min on stream in a H2 flow."
[87] "Since this band appears in the absence of carbon-containing species, its appearance due to coke deposition can be safely excluded."
[88] "Possible origins of this band are discussed as follows."
[89] "It is well-known that nondehydrated VOx/silica materials possess octahedral coordinated VOx species, in which adsorbed water is a ligand."
[90] "On the basis of this experimental fact, it can be suggested that water is formed upon reaction of VOx species over SiO2 and MCM-41 with H2 and adsorbs over reduced VOx species increasing their coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral."
[91] "However, to draw a more definitive conclusion about the origins of the band at 400450 nm in H2 at 773 K, new additional experiments are required."
[92] "It is also important to stress that there is no difference in the UV/vis spectra of VOx species under oxidizing conditions before and after treatments in H2 (Figure 4)."
[93] "Similar results were obtained for all the oxidizing/reduction/reaction cycles described in Figure 3."
[94] "This means that VOx species remain highly dispersed during the applied treatments and time-on-stream operation."
[95] "To check if O2 and N2O show different ability (activity) for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species, in-situ UV/vis tests were performed in a transient mode."
[96] "In these experiments, the oxidized sample was reduced in a flow of C3H8 (C3H8/Ne = 40/60) at 773 K for 10 min followed by flushing in a Ne flow for 1 min and feeding an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) over the reduced catalyst."
[97] "The sample was kept in this flow for 30 min to reoxidate reduced VOx species."
[98] "Hereafter, the reoxidized catalyst was again reduced in C3H8 followed by its reoxidation in a N2O (N2O/Ne = 40/60) flow."
[99] "In all the above experiments, UV/vis spectra from 200 to 800 nm and KubelkaMunk at 700 nm were recorded every 20 and 5 s, respectively."
[100] "The respective results are summarized in Figure 5 and Figure 6."
[101] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."
[102] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."
[103] "More detailed insights into the kinetics of reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 and reoxidation of reduced ones by O2 and N2O were derived from the analysis of temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function in Figure 6."
[104] "At time zero, we switched from an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) to a C3H8 flow (C3H8/Ne = 40/60)."
[105] "As result, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm increases from 0 (fully oxidized VOx species) and reaches a constant value of ca. 0.2 after 5 min on C3H8 stream."
[106] "Similar changes were observed when H2 was used as a reducing agent instead of C3H8."
[107] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed changes are due to the reduction of oxidized VOx species by propane and are not due to deposition of carbon-containing species in the case of C3H8."
[108] "To prove whether the reduction/reoxidation of VOx species is a reversible process, an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80) was fed over the reduced sample (at ca. 10 min in Figure 6) followed by C3H8 feeding (at ca. 22 min in Figure 6)."
[109] "As shown in Figure 6, the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm falls from ca. 0.2 to 0 after a few seconds in the O2 flow and reversibly increases to 0.2 in the C3H8 flow."
[110] "Two important conclusions were derived: (1) reduction/oxidation of VOx species is a reversible process and (2) reduction of oxidized VOx species by C3H8 is slower than reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2."
[111] "When N2O was used for the reoxidation of reduced VOx species (ca. 3240 min in Figure 6), these species were also reoxidized."
[112] "However, the temporal changes in the KubelkaMunk function at 700 nm are slower than those with O2."
[113] "From this difference in the temporal profiles, it is concluded that the reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O is slower than by O2."
[114] "Similar results were obtained for other catalytic materials studied."
[115] "Taking the difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
[116] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
[117] "The effect of oxygen species (lattice oxygen or adsorbed) on the ODP reaction was studied by pulsing a mixture of propane and labeled oxygen (18O2) over the catalyst, which was preoxidized by 16O2."
[118] "COx products containing different oxygen isotopes (16O and 18O) were detected at the reactor outlet."
[119] "Their transient responses are presented in Figure 7 in a height-normalized form for better comparison of their pulse shapes."
[120] "The presence of 16O (not pulsed gas-phase oxygen) in CO and CO2 evidences the participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species in combustion of C3H8/C3H6."
[121] "This result is very similar to previous reported ones over various vanadium-based catalytic materials.27,48,49"
[122] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
[123] "However, the concentration of CO2 and CO formed with participation of labeled oxygen (C18O2, C18O16O, and C18O) was significantly lower than C16O2 and C16O."
[124] "This indicates that C16O and C16O2 are the main COx products."
[125] "In other words, lattice oxygen of VOx species is mainly responsible for COx formation."
[126] "Adsorbed oxygen species formed from gas-phase labeled (18O2) oxygen play only a minor role in COx formation under transient vacuum conditions."
[127] "This may be because the concentration of lattice nonlabeled oxygen in VOx species is considerably higher than that of labeled oxygen in the C3H818O2 pulse."
[128] "The ratio of vanadium to the amount of 18O2 in one pulse was estimated as ca. 5·104."
[129] "However, the contribution of adsorbed oxygen species to the formation of COx can be significantly higher under ambient-pressure conditions."
[130] "We would like to emphasize that no labeled oxygen species in COx was observed in our previous experiments over VOx/γ-Al2O3 under similar conditions in the TAP reactor.27"
[131] "This can be explained by the fact that incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into VOx species occurs considerably faster over VOx/γ-Al2O3 as compared to SiO2-based catalysts."
[132] "This assumption is indirectly supported by the recently reported results of the ODP reaction over VOx/Al2O3 50 and VOx/SiO2 51 in cofeed (O2 and C3H8 are fed together) and cyclic (O2 and C3H8 are fed separately and periodically) modes."
[133] "No substantial differences in propene selectivity between the cofeed and cyclic conditions were found over the alumina-based catalysts, while propene selectivity over the silica-based one was significantly improved when the ODP reaction was performed under the cyclic conditions."
[134] "In the latter case, the negative effect of adsorbed oxygen species on propene selectivity could be avoided."
[135] "The results of steady-state ODP studies suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O."
[136] "According to this scheme, C3H8 is directly converted to C3H6 and COx, with the latter reaction path playing a significant role for VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."
[137] "The formed propene is further converted to CO and CO2."
[138] "The importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
[139] "Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation."
[140] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."
[141] "The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
[142] "This is essential for achieving high primary propene selectivity and for suppressing consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2 as shown in Figure 2."
[143] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
[144] "Since 710 oxygen atoms are required for COx formation from propane/propene but only one for propene formation, nonselective propane/propene oxidation to COx will be inhibited upon increasing degree of reduction of VOx species."
[145] "However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for superior performance of N2O as compared to O2."
[146] "On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."
[147] "It is well-known 52 that O2 adsorption over reducible metal oxides occurs via a complex sequence of redox processes until O2- (lattice oxygen) is formed."
[148] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that gas-phase oxygen adsorbs molecularly over anion vacancy of reduced VOx species. 53,54"
[149] "This biatomic adsorbed oxygen dissociates further yielding lattice oxygen species."
[150] "Adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species were suggested to be nonselective ones for the ODP reaction over VMgO 55,56 and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 57 catalytic materials."
[151] "In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O- or O2-, which are considered as selective ones.52"
[152] "Further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations are in progress with the aim to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx.
2.A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5.
3.Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.

1.一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出相对于其他氧化剂的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂可导致与氧气（O2）相比，在广泛的丙烷转化率范围内具有更高的丙烯选择性。这种改善的选择性归因于N2O能够实现更高的初始丙烯选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性。N2O比O2更慢地重新氧化还原的VOx物种，这对于抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx至关重要。氧物种的性质也起着作用，N2O不会产生非选择性的吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx。
2.在ODHP过程中，已经使用了各种催化剂，包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48。这些催化剂使用了包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序还原（TPR）、UV/vis、拉曼和X射线衍射（XRD）在内的多种技术进行了表征。随着钒负载量的增加，催化剂的比表面积降低，VOx物种的聚合度受支撑材料的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂的催化活性略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48样品，这可能归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。观察到最低活性是在VOx(11.2)/MCM-41样品上，该样品具有微晶V2O5。
3.催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的非选择性吸附氧物种的形成来帮助缓解这些问题。然而，N2O的较低活性与O2相比也可能是一个限制。解决这些挑战的策略包括优化催化剂结构和组成以增强稳定性和选择性，开发方法来再生失活的催化剂，以及探索可以提供高选择性和活性同时保持催化剂稳定性的替代氧化剂。
