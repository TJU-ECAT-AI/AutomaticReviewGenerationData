[1] "The results of our detailed physicochemical characterization (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) analysis of VOx/MCM-41 materials have been previously published,20 the most relevant results are briefly reported together with those for VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MCM-48."
[2] "The XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to ca. 5 wt % do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase."
[3] "The lowest TOF value was obtained over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, where microcrystalline V2O5 phase was detected."
[4] "The primary C3H6 selectivity is obtained from the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx."
[5] "This means that consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx (mainly to CO) is reduced in the presence of N2O."
[6] "The higher polymerized VOx species, the higher their activity for consecutive propene oxidation."
[7] "The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process, which has advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 catalysts shows that the XRD patterns of VOx/MCM-48 and VOx/SiO2 with vanadium loading up to about 5 wt% do not show any signs of crystalline V2O5 phase, indicating that these catalysts have a high dispersion of vanadium oxide species. However, the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample possesses microcrystalline V2O5 phase, which has the lowest turnover frequency (TOF) value. The primary propylene selectivity is determined by the intersect of the fitted line with the S(C3H6) axis, while the slope of the line represents the catalyst's ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The presence of N2O reduces consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx, mainly to CO, compared to O2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation. The lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2.

1.一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，与其它氧化剂相比，具有较高的丙烯选择性优势。对VOx/MCM-41、VOx/SiO2和VOx/MCM-48催化剂的研究表明，VOx/MCM-48和VOx/SiO2在钒负载量约为5 wt%时的XRD图谱中没有显示出V2O5晶相的迹象，这表明这些催化剂具有高分散的钒氧化物物种。然而，VOx(11.2)/MCM-41样品具有微晶V2O5相，其具有最低的周转频率（TOF）值。初级丙烯选择性由与S(C3H6)轴相交的拟合线的交点确定，而直线的斜率代表催化剂连续将丙烯氧化为COx的能力。在N2O存在下，与O2相比，连续C3H6氧化为COx，主要是CO，被减少。聚合度较高的VOx物种具有较高的连续丙烯氧化活性。N2O对还原VOx物种的再氧化能力较低，是N2O下ODP活性低于O2的原因。
