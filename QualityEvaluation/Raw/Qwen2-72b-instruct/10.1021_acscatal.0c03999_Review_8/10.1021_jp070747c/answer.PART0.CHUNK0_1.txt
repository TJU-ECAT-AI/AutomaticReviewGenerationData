1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用与其它氧化剂如氧气(O2)相比具有优势,主要体现在其能够实现更高的丙烯选择性。对VOx/MCM-41、VOx/SiO2和VOx/MCM-48材料的研究表明,N2O能够导致钒物种更高的还原度,这对于实现高初始丙烯选择性和抑制连续丙烯氧化为CO和CO2至关重要。高聚合度的VOx物种具有更高的连续丙烯氧化活性,而直接丙烷氧化和连续丙烯氧化为COx在O2存在下的重要性远高于N2O。催化性能由氧化剂的活化决定,N2O较低的氧化能力调节了钒物种的还原度,导致VOx物种更高的还原度。这种效应与活性晶格氧物种的空间分离有关,降低了活性氧物种的表面密度。然而,VOx物种的还原度并不是N2O优于O2的唯一原因。氧物种的性质也影响COx的形成,在某些催化材料上,吸附(非晶格)氧物种对于ODHP反应是非选择性的。相比之下,N2O在可还原金属氧化物上的分解产生单核氧物种,被认为是选择性的。与N2O-ODHP相关的催化剂失活和稳定性关键挑战包括需要钒物种的高还原度以及防止非选择性氧物种的形成。解决这些限制的策略可能涉及开发具有受控活性氧物种表面密度的催化剂,以及优化反应条件以促进选择性氧物种的形成。研究方向可以集中在理解氧物种形成机制及其在ODHP过程选择性中的作用,以及开发能够在N2O-ODHP条件下保持高活性和选择性的新型催化剂配方。
