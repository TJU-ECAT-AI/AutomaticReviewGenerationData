[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O. Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."

1.N2O has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized.

1.与O2相比，N2O在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODP)反应中，使用氧化铝和二氧化硅支撑的钒催化剂时，显示出增加丙烯选择性的效果。然而，N2O的ODP活性低于O2。VOx物种的还原程度对于实现高丙烯选择性至关重要。氧物种的性质，无论是吸附(非晶格)还是晶格，也会影响COx的形成。吸附氧物种被认为是某些催化剂上ODP反应的非选择性。使用原位UV/vis分析研究了VOx物种的氧化还原动力学，对不同VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48材料在ODP反应中的催化性能进行了表征。
