1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) when used as an oxidant. This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and, consequently, suppressed consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用时,与氧气(O2)相比,显著提高了丙烯选择性。这种改善在各种催化剂上都有观察到,包括蒸汽活化的含铁沸石、块状钒氧化物和含钒支撑材料。关于N2O对n-丁烷氧化脱氢的类似效果也已在钒镁氧化物催化剂上报道。N2O对ODHP反应的积极作用归因于与O2相比,VOx物种的还原形式的再氧化较慢,导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低,从而抑制了丙烯连续氧化为二氧化碳。然而,VOx位点对连续丙烯氧化的活性随着聚集度的增加而增加。只要钒表面浓度保持在单层覆盖以下,丙烯选择性差异不大,只有孤立的VOx位点和小的二维VxOy簇存在。当V2O5纳米晶体占主导时,不仅丙烯选择性急剧下降,而且在两种氧化剂存在下,丙烷的直接完全氧化也会发生,尽管在N2O存在下,这种不利影响不那么明显。最近的一项研究表明,与N2O相比,从气相O2中形成的其他氧物种(VOx物种的非晶格氧)参与了COx的形成。然而,关于从O2和N2O还原VOx物种再氧化过程中形成的活性氧物种的性质,只有有限的实验信息。
