1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) when used as an oxidant. This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The same VOx/MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0.016 molC3H8 mol-1 V s-1 has been measured with O2 used as an oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被证明在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中用作氧化剂时,与分子氧(O2)相比,可以显著提高丙烯选择性。这种改进在各种催化剂上都有观察到,包括蒸汽活化铁含沸石、块状钒氧化物和含钒支撑材料。关于N2O的类似效果也已在钒镁氧化物催化剂上丁烷氧化脱氢中报道。N2O对ODHP反应的积极作用归因于与O2相比,VOx物种的还原形式的再氧化速度较慢,导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低,从而抑制了丙烯连续氧化为二氧化碳。然而,VOx位点对连续丙烯氧化的活性随聚集度的增加而增加。只要钒表面浓度保持在单层覆盖以下,丙烯选择性差异不大,此时只有孤立的VOx位点和小的二维VxOy簇存在。当V2O5纳米晶粒占主导时,不仅丙烯选择性急剧下降,而且在两种氧化剂存在下,丙烷的直接完全氧化也会发生,尽管这种不利影响在N2O存在下不太明显。最近的一项研究表明,与N2O相比,从气相O2中形成的其他氧物种(VOx物种的非晶格氧)参与了COx的形成。然而,关于从O2和N2O还原VOx物种再氧化过程中形成的活性氧物种的性质,可用的实验信息有限。本研究的目的是获得实验证据,证明在O2和N2O存在下,在MCM-41上还原的高分散VOx物种再氧化过程中形成的氧物种的性质和结构。本研究中使用的VOx/MCM-41催化剂以前已在丙烷氧化脱氢中进行了表征和测试。使用O2作为氧化剂时,测得的丙烷转化周转频率为0.016 molC3H8 mol-1 V s-1。相比之下,使用N2O时,相应的值仅为一半,而丙烯选择性更高,在丙烷转化率约为10%时,丙烯选择性为80%,而使用O2时仅为50%。由于以前假设的几种氧物种具有顺磁性,因此在受控气氛条件下应用了EPR光谱,以实验上识别从气相N2O和O2在VOx/MCM-41上形成的氧物种,并探索这些物种对C3H8、C3H6和CO氧化的反应性。
