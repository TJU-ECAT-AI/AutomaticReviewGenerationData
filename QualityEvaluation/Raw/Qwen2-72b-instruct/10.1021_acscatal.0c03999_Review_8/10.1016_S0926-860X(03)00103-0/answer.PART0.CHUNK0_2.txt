1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature focuses on the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process with N2O as a gas dope. It discusses the effects of N2O on the catalyst's performance, including the reduction of molybdenum atoms and the formation of carbonaceous products at high N2O concentrations. The challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are not explicitly addressed, but the literature suggests that the optimal concentration of N2O is critical to maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity. Strategies to address these limitations could include optimizing the N2O concentration, developing more stable catalyst formulations, and investigating the mechanisms of catalyst deactivation to inform the design of more robust catalysts.

1.文献没有直接比较N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的丙烯选择性与其他氧化剂。但是，它确实指出N2O在其他氧化反应中比分子氧更具选择性。文献集中讨论了在ODHP过程中使用N2O作为气体掺杂剂的镍钼催化剂的使用。它讨论了N2O对催化剂性能的影响，包括钼原子的还原和在高N2O浓度下形成碳化产物。没有明确地解决与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战，但文献表明，N2O的最优浓度对于维持催化剂活性和选择性至关重要。解决这些限制的策略可能包括优化N2O浓度，开发更稳定的催化剂配方，并研究催化剂失活的机制，以指导更坚固催化剂的设计。
