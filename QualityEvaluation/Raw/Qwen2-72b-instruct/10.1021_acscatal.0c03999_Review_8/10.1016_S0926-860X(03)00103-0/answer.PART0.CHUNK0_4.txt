1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature discusses the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process and the effects of adding N2O as a gas dope on the catalytic performance. The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances, with a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a decrease in oxygen consumption and CO2 yield at low concentrations of N2O. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity in propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products are formed. The literature does not address the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. However, it does suggest that adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts and improve their catalytic performances.

1.文献没有直接比较N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)过程中的丙烯选择性与其他氧化剂。但是，它确实指出N2O在其他氧化反应中比分子氧更具选择性。文献讨论了镍钼催化剂在ODHP过程中的应用以及添加N2O作为气体助剂对催化性能的影响。添加N2O会改变催化性能，丙烷转化率降低，丙烯产率和选择性增加，氧气消耗和CO2产率降低，当N2O浓度较低时。当N2O浓度较高时，丙烯的选择性降低，形成碳质产物。文献没有讨论N2O-ODHP过程中与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。但是，它确实建议，调整N2O等促进剂的浓度可能是一种有用的工具，可以调节氧化物催化剂的氧化状态，从而改善其催化性能。
