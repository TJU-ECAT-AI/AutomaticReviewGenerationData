1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature focuses on the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process with N2O as a gas dope. It discusses the effects of N2O on the catalyst's performance, including the reduction of molybdenum at the surface, which improves the selectivity to propylene at low concentrations of N2O. The literature does not address the challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the context of N2O-ODHP. It does not propose strategies or research directions to address these limitations.

1.文献没有直接比较N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的丙烯选择性与其他氧化剂。但是，它确实指出N2O在其他氧化反应中比分子氧更具选择性。文献重点讨论了在N2O作为气体助剂的ODHP过程中使用镍钼催化剂。它讨论了N2O对催化剂性能的影响，包括在N2O低浓度下表面钼的还原，这提高了对丙烯的选择性。文献没有讨论与N2O-ODHP相关的催化剂失活和稳定性挑战。它没有提出策略或研究方向来解决这些限制。
