1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does mention that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature focuses on the effects of N2O on nickel molybdate catalysts, showing that N2O modifies the catalytic performances, leading to a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a decrease in oxygen consumption and CO2 formation at low concentrations. At higher concentrations, N2O causes a deeper reduction of the catalyst, leading to a decrease in propylene selectivity and an increase in carbonaceous product formation. The literature does not discuss the challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the context of N2O-ODHP. However, it does suggest that adjusting the concentration of N2O could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts and improve their catalytic performances.

1.文献没有直接比较N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的丙烯选择性与其他氧化剂的比较。但是，它确实提到N2O在其他氧化反应中比分子氧更具选择性。文献重点介绍了N2O对镍钼催化剂的影响，表明N2O改变了催化性能，导致丙烷转化率降低，丙烯产率和选择性增加，氧气消耗和CO2形成减少，浓度较低时。在较高浓度下，N2O导致催化剂深度还原，导致丙烯选择性降低，碳质产物形成增加。文献没有讨论N2O-ODHP中与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战。但是，它确实建议调整N2O的浓度可以是调节氧化物催化剂的氧化状态和改善其催化性能的有用工具。
