1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature discusses the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process and the effects of adding N2O as a gas dope on the catalytic performance. The addition of N2O modifies the oxidation state of the catalyst, leading to changes in activity and selectivity. The literature does not address the challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the context of N2O-ODHP. It does not propose strategies or research directions to address these limitations.

1.文献没有直接比较N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的丙烯选择性与其他氧化剂。但是，它确实指出N2O在其他氧化反应中比分子氧更具选择性。文献讨论了镍钼催化剂在ODHP过程中的应用，以及添加N2O作为气体助剂对催化性能的影响。添加N2O会改变催化剂的氧化态，从而改变活性和选择性。文献没有讨论与N2O-ODHP相关的催化剂失活和稳定性挑战，也没有提出解决这些限制的策略或研究方向。
