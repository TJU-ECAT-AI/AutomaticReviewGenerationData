The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with Fe-ZSM-5 exhibiting superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in the ODHP process, regardless of the oxidant used. The presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the deactivation mechanisms, development of more stable catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize catalyst lifetime. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用已引起广泛关注，作为氧气的替代品。N2O的主要优势在于其能够以更高的选择性生产丙烯，与氧气相比，氧气倾向于过度氧化丙烷，导致二氧化碳(CO和CO2)的形成和较低的烯烃产量。铁沸石，特别是Fe-ZSM-5，已被开发为这种过程的独特催化剂，Fe-ZSM-5在N2O的ODHP中表现出优越的性能，经过严重煅烧。然而，催化剂失活仍然是ODHP过程中的一个关键挑战，无论使用哪种氧化剂。丙烷作为还原剂的存在使一氧化二氮在铁沸石上的转化复杂化，而N2O-ODHP中催化剂的失活机制尚未完全理解。解决这些限制的策略可能包括进一步研究失活机制，开发更稳定的催化剂，以及优化反应条件以最小化焦炭的形成并最大化催化剂的寿命。这些努力可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实践实施选择。
