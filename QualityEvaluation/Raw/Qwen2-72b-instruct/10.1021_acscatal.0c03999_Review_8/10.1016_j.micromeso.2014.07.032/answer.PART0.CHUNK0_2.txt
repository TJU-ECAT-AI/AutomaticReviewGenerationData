[1] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention [213]."
[2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."
[3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
[4] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant. In a general sense, formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are responsible for catalyst deactivation. However, the specification of coke and its origin are not fully understood. Accordingly, there is no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites have emerged as promising catalysts for N2O-ODHP, particularly for the conversion of propane to propylene. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge, with the deposition of coke on the catalyst surface being a primary cause. The exact nature of the coke and its origin are not fully understood, which hinders the development of effective strategies to prevent coke deposition and extend catalyst lifetime. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation, further research is needed to understand the deactivation mechanisms and develop catalysts with improved stability and coke resistance.

使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用已引起广泛关注,作为氧气的替代品。N2O的主要优势在于与氧气相比,它能够以更高的选择性生产丙烯,氧气倾向于过度氧化丙烷,导致碳氧化物的形成和较低的烯烃产率。铁沸石已被开发为N2O-ODHP的有前途的催化剂,特别是将丙烷转化为丙烯。然而,催化剂失活仍然是一个关键挑战,催化剂表面焦炭的形成和沉积是主要原因。焦炭的确切性质及其来源尚不完全清楚,这阻碍了防止焦炭沉积和延长催化剂寿命的有效策略的发展。为了克服这些限制,使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用实施选项,需要进一步研究以了解失活机制,并开发具有改进稳定性和焦炭抗性的催化剂。
