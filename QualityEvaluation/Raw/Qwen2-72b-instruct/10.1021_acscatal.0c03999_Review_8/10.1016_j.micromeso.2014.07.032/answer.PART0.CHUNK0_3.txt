The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained considerable attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to other oxidants. When dioxygen is used, over-oxidation leads to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2), resulting in low olefin selectivity and yield. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process. Fe-ZSM-5, prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as the iron precursor, has shown superior performance for ODHP with N2O, achieving a maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency. FeOAl species have been identified as the active sites in this catalyst. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in ODHP, regardless of whether dioxygen or N2O is used. The formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are responsible for deactivation, but the specific nature of the coke and its origin are not fully understood, limiting the ability to prevent coke deposition and increase catalyst lifetime. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the nature of coke formation and the development of more stable catalysts that resist coke deposition. Additionally, optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize propylene yield could make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用已引起广泛关注,作为对氧气的替代。N2O的主要优势在于其能够以更高的选择性生产丙烯,与其他氧化剂相比。当使用氧气时,过度氧化会导致一氧化碳(CO)和二氧化碳(CO2)的形成,导致低的烯烃选择性和产量。铁-沸石,特别是Fe-ZSM-5,已被开发为这种过程的独特催化剂。Fe-ZSM-5,通过使用二茂铁作为铁前体的固态交换方法制备,在N2O-ODHP中表现出优越的性能,实现了30%的最大初始丙烯产量和高周转频率。FeOAl物种已被鉴定为这种催化剂中的活性位点。然而,催化剂失活仍然是ODHP中的关键挑战,无论使用氧气还是N2O。催化剂表面的焦炭形成和沉积是失活的原因,但焦炭的具体性质和其起源尚未完全理解,限制了防止焦炭沉积和增加催化剂寿命的能力。解决这些限制的策略可能包括进一步研究焦炭形成性质和开发更稳定的催化剂,以抵抗焦炭沉积。此外,优化反应条件以最小化焦炭形成并最大化丙烯产量,可以使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实践实施选择。
