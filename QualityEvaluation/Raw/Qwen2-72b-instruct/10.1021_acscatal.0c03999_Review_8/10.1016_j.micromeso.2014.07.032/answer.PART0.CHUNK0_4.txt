The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained considerable attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to other oxidants. When dioxygen is used, over-oxidation leads to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2), resulting in low olefin selectivity and yield. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with FeOAl species identified as the active sites. Fe-ZSM-5, prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as the iron precursor, has shown superior performance for ODHP with N2O, achieving a maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge, as the formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface lead to decreased activity and lifetime. The exact nature of the coke and its origin are not fully understood, making it difficult to develop effective strategies to prevent coke deposition and increase catalyst stability. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research could focus on developing more stable catalysts, understanding the deactivation mechanisms, and finding ways to prevent coke formation.

使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用已引起广泛关注，作为氧气的替代品。N2O的主要优势在于与其它氧化剂相比，它能以更高的选择性生产丙烯。当使用氧气时，过度氧化会导致一氧化碳(CO)和二氧化碳(CO2)的形成，导致低的烯烃选择性和产量。铁沸石，特别是Fe-ZSM-5，已被开发为这一过程的独特催化剂，FeOAl物种被鉴定为活性位点。通过固态交换方法使用二茂铁作为铁前体制备的Fe-ZSM-5在N2O-ODHP中表现出优异的性能，实现了30%的最大初始丙烯产率和高周转频率。然而，催化剂失活仍然是一个关键的挑战，因为催化剂表面焦炭的形成和沉积导致活性降低和寿命缩短。焦炭的确切性质及其来源尚不完全清楚，这使得很难开发有效的策略来防止焦炭沉积和提高催化剂稳定性。为了克服这些限制，使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选择，研究可以集中在开发更稳定的催化剂，理解失活机制，以及寻找防止焦炭形成的方法。
