The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention due to its advantages in propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. When dioxygen is used, over-oxidation leads to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2), resulting in low olefin selectivity and yield. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for ODHP with N2O, with FeOAl species identified as the active sites. Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has shown superior performance for ODHP with N2O, achieving a maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge, with the formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface being the primary cause. The specification of coke and its origin are not fully understood, and there is currently no effective means to prevent coke deposition and increase catalyst lifetime in ODHP with N2O.

To address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts with improved coke resistance. This could involve the design of catalysts with tailored active sites that minimize coke formation, or the development of methods to regenerate catalysts in situ. Additionally, understanding the mechanism of coke formation and its impact on catalyst performance could lead to strategies for its prevention or mitigation. The use of advanced characterization techniques to monitor catalyst behavior under reaction conditions could provide insights into the deactivation process and guide the development of more stable catalysts.

使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用因其在丙烯选择性方面相对于其他氧化剂的优势而受到广泛关注。当使用氧气时,过度氧化会导致一氧化碳(CO)和二氧化碳(CO2)的形成,导致低烯烃选择性和产量。铁沸石,特别是Fe-ZSM-5,已被开发为N2O ODHP的独特催化剂,FeOAl物种被鉴定为活性位点。通过固态交换方法使用二茂铁作为铁前体制备的Fe-ZSM-5在N2O ODHP中表现出优异的性能,实现了30%的最大初始丙烯产量和高周转频率。然而,催化剂失活仍然是一个关键挑战,催化剂表面焦炭的形成和沉积是主要原因。焦炭的规格及其来源尚未完全理解,目前没有有效的方法来防止焦炭沉积和增加N2O ODHP中的催化剂寿命。

为了克服这些限制,使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用实施选项,研究方向可以集中在开发更稳定的催化剂,提高焦炭抗性。这可能涉及设计具有最小焦炭形成的定制活性位点的催化剂,或开发原位催化剂再生方法。此外,了解焦炭形成机制及其对催化剂性能的影响可能导致预防或缓解的策略。在反应条件下使用先进的表征技术监测催化剂行为可以提供对失活过程的见解,并指导更稳定催化剂的开发。
