The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with Fe-ZSM-5 exhibiting superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in the ODHP process, regardless of the oxidant used. The presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the deactivation mechanisms, development of more stable catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize catalyst lifetime. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用已引起广泛关注，作为氧气的替代品。N2O的主要优势在于其能够以更高的选择性生产丙烯，与氧气相比，氧气倾向于过度氧化丙烷，导致二氧化碳(CO和CO2)的形成和较低的烯烃产量。铁沸石，特别是Fe-ZSM-5，已被开发为这种过程的独特催化剂，Fe-ZSM-5在N2O的ODHP中表现出优越的性能，经过严重煅烧。然而，催化剂失活仍然是ODHP过程中的一个关键挑战，无论使用哪种氧化剂。丙烷作为还原剂的存在使一氧化二氮在铁沸石上的转化复杂化，而N2O-ODHP中催化剂的失活机制尚未完全理解。解决这些限制的策略可能包括进一步研究失活机制，开发更稳定的催化剂，以及优化反应条件以最小化焦炭的形成并最大化催化剂的寿命。这些努力可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实践实施选择。

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention due to its advantages in propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants.

The specification of coke and its origin are not fully understood, and there is currently no effective means to prevent coke deposition and increase catalyst lifetime in ODHP with N2O.

To address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts with improved coke resistance. This could involve the design of catalysts with tailored active sites that minimize coke formation, or the development of methods to regenerate catalysts in situ. Additionally, understanding the mechanism of coke formation and its impact on catalyst performance could lead to strategies for its prevention or mitigation. The use of advanced characterization techniques to monitor catalyst behavior under reaction conditions could provide insights into the deactivation process and guide the development of more stable catalysts.

使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用因其在丙烯选择性方面相对于其他氧化剂的优势而受到广泛关注。当使用氧气时,过度氧化会导致一氧化碳(CO)和二氧化碳(CO2)的形成,导致低烯烃选择性和产量。铁沸石,特别是Fe-ZSM-5,已被开发为N2O ODHP的独特催化剂,FeOAl物种被鉴定为活性位点。通过固态交换方法使用二茂铁作为铁前体制备的Fe-ZSM-5在N2O ODHP中表现出优异的性能,实现了30%的最大初始丙烯产量和高周转频率。然而,催化剂失活仍然是一个关键挑战,催化剂表面焦炭的形成和沉积是主要原因。焦炭的规格及其来源尚未完全理解,目前没有有效的方法来防止焦炭沉积和增加N2O ODHP中的催化剂寿命。

为了克服这些限制,使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用实施选项,研究方向可以集中在开发更稳定的催化剂,提高焦炭抗性。这可能涉及设计具有最小焦炭形成的定制活性位点的催化剂,或开发原位催化剂再生方法。此外,了解焦炭形成机制及其对催化剂性能的影响可能导致预防或缓解的策略。在反应条件下使用先进的表征技术监测催化剂行为可以提供对失活过程的见解,并指导更稳定催化剂的开发。
