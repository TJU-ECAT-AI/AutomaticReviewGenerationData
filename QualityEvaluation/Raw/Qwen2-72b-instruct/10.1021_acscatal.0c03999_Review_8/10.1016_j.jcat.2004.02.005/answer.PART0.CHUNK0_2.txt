[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."
[2] "A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking."
[3] "The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts."
[4] "The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior."
[5] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
[6] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
[7] "The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained."
[8] "A major drawback of FeMFI zeo- lites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield."
[9] "The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions."
[10] "The mass uptake is then determined by the change of the oscillating frequency."
[11] "The TEOM reactor was loaded with 30 mg of catalyst (sieve fraction 125200 m), firmly packed between two plugs of quartz wool."
[12] "The He flow was replaced by the reaction mix- ture, and mass changes and evolved product gases were continuously monitored."
[13] "The product gases were analyzed by an on-line micro-GC (Chrompack CP-2002) equipped with a TCD, using Poraplot Q and Molsieve 5A columns."
[14] "The conversions of N2O and C3H8 were determined from the amounts of N2 formed and C3H8 disappeared, respectively."
[15] "Propene yield and selectivity were calculated as Y(C3H6) = C(C3H6)/Co(C3H8) and S(C3H6) = Y(C3H6)/X(C3H8),respectively, where C(C3H6) is the outlet propene concen- tration at a certain time, Co(C3H8) is the inlet concentration of propane, and X(C3H8) is the conversion of propane."
[16] "The synthesized Fe-zeolites have a very simi- lar iron content, and the molar Si/Al ratio in ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA is nearly identical."
[17] "The amount of iron in the steamed commercial ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA zeo- lites was 3040 times lower."
[18] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and FeBEA ze- olites showed initial propene yields in the range of 19 22% at 723 K, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%), and complete Table 1."
[19] "The interaction of C3H8 with the iron zeolites in the absence of N2O did not lead to propene production, indicating the es- sential role of the oxidant for propane dehydrogenation."
[20] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances."
[21] "The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites."
[22] "The initial propene yields over c-Fe-silicalite and ex-Fe-silicalite largely differ (5 and 22%, respectively)."
[23] "The initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar in the steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), the acidic properties of the zeolite (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and the catalyst constitution with respect to iron."
[24] "However, the dynamics of the reaction (deactivation behav- ior and coke formation) are considerably different."
[25] "Coke deposits likely originate by condensation of propene,the main olefin formed over all the catalysts investigated."
[26] "Traces of ethylene were also detected (ca. 15 times lower concentration than propene)."
[27] "As shown in Fig. 1, deactivation of ex-FeBEA is very rapid."
[28] "The yield of propene rapidly decreases during the first 5 min on stream, and the catalyst is completely deac- tivated after 50 min."
[29] "The sudden activity drop nicely co- incides with the sharp increase of the coke content, and the coking profile reaches a well-defined plateau when the conversion of C3H8 approaches zero and thus propene pro- duction vanishes."
[30] "A residual N2O conversion of 7% was ob- tained."
[31] "The rate of deactivation over ex-Fe-silicalite was significantly lower than over ex-FeBEA; the continu- ous decline of the C3H6 yield over ex-Fe-silicalite is clearly connected with the more gradual increase of the coke con- tent, in contrast to ex-FeBEA."
[32] "Ex-FeZSM-5 preserves a very low residual propene yield after 400 min on stream with a N2O conversion of 12%."
[33] "The remarkable behavior of ex- FeZSM-5 against deactivation deviates from the former iron zeolites."
[34] "First of all, ex-FeZSM-5 activates during the first 20 min on stream, with an increase in propene yield from 22 to 25%."
[35] "This high propene yield over ex-FeZSM-5 was maintained during 75 min, and the coke content at this particular time is ca. 15 wt%."
[36] "Oppositely, ex-Fe-silicalite and ex-FeBEA were severely or completely deactivated after 75 min on stream."
[37] "After this stable period, the propene yield over ex-FeZSM-5 progressively decreases, but a residual propene yield of 8% is preserved after a reaction period of 400 min, with conver- sions of C3H8 and N2O of 10 and 25%, respectively."
[38] "Considering that propene is the major coke precursor in the process investigated, the amount of coke formed should give a rough indication of the catalyst activity in ODHP."
[39] "Accordingly, the final coke content over ex-FeZSM-5, the most active catalyst in our study is 20 wt%, i.e., ca. 3 times higher than over ex-Fe-silicalite (7.6 wt%) and ex-FeBEA (9.2 wt%)."
[40] "The coke content over calcined c-Fe-silicalite amounts to 4 wt% after 400 min, i.e., half than the amount measured in the corresponding steamed sample."
[41] "However,other factors also affect the amount of coke formed, es- pecially the presence of Brnsted acidic sites in the Al- containing samples or in the calcined zeolites (with iron in framework positions), which may participate in coking via acid-catalyzed carbenium ion reactions."
[42] "Tests with steamed commercial zeolites, containing im- purities of iron, are important for understanding the role of iron on the catalytic performance."
[43] "The higher activity and lower rate of deactivation of ex-H-ZSM-5 (170 ppm Fe) compared to ex-H-BEA (210 ppm Fe) draw parallels with the results obtained over ex-FeZSM-5 (0.67 wt% Fe) and ex-FeBEA (0.61 wt% Fe)."
[44] "Steamed commercial zeolites induced much lower C3H8 and N2O conversions than the synthesized Fe-zeolites (Fig. 2), hence resulting in a lower propene yield and coke content (see Figs. 1 and 2 and Ta- ble 1)."
[45] "This implies a beneficial effect of the amount of iron on the catalytic performance, as it was also concluded in other N2O conversions over Fe-zeolites, e.g., direct decom- position [19] or selective oxidation of benzene to phenol [5]."
[46] "Strikingly, the residual yield of propene over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5 after 400 min on stream was very similar (8%, see Figs. 1 and 2)."
[47] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selec- tive catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat."
[48] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."
[49] "The TEOM tech- nique presented here is a unique tool for the simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking, so that catalyst deac- tivation and coke formation can be precisely monitored and correlated."
[50] "The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature."
[51] "Relevant conclusions on the effect of the amount and form(s) of iron in the catalysts as well as of the zeolite acidity and host on the initial catalytic performance and deactivation behavior can be drawn from our study."
[52] "Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites."
[53] "Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."
[54] "The similar initial degree of N2O and propane conver- sion, as well as propene selectivity (and thus propene yield) obtained over ex-FeZSM-5, ex-FeBEA, and the non-acidic ex-Fe-silicalite further indicates that the origin of the catalyst activity is mainly associated to the presence of extraframe- work iron species."
[55] "The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account."
[56] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O con- versions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
[57] "The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron."
[58] "This indicates that the activity and se- lectivity per iron atom in, e.g., ex-H-ZSM-5, are ca. 10 times higher than in ex-FeZSM-5, suggesting that a significant fraction of iron in the synthesized Fe-zeolites is not utilized."
[59] "In other words, the iron species present in the commercial samples as impurities are considered as highly efficient sites for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with N2O."
[60] "As concluded above, the initial performance of the steam- activated iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is similar, but the deactivation behavior strongly differs."
[61] "Coke formation causes physical blocking of the active reaction sites inside the zeolitic pore system, resulting in a decreased C3H6 yield."
[62] "In general terms, the coking rate in zeolites depends on the acidic sites (number and strength), the zeolite structure, and the reaction conditions [23,24]."
[63] "In the reaction investigated,the nature and location of the active extraframework iron species may play an essential role on the deactivation be- havior too."
[64] "The origin of coke is mainly associated to the condensation of propene, as indicated by direct relation be- tween the propene yield and the amount of coke determined from the TEOM (see Fig. 1 and Table 1)."
[65] "The final amount of coke in ex-FeZSM-5 (with a residual propene yield of 8%) is 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and in the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA (Table 1)."
[66] "The coke content in ex- FeZSM-5 is 45 times higher that in ex-H-ZSM-5, while similar residual propene yields were achieved."
[67] "These results nicely illustrate that, as generally found, the location of coke is far more relevant than the total coke quantity in the deac- tivation process."
[68] "The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels."
[69] "Apparently, these trap cavities cause the entire blocking of the access to the active sites, leading to complete catalyst deactivation."
[70] "The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size."
[71] "Accordingly, coke precursors are not trapped inside the intersections, but diffuse out unless they are too strongly adsorbed."
[72] "As a consequence, deactivation is not complete over these catalysts (particularly ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5), showing a significant residual activity with a slow but continuous increase in the amount of coke."
[73] "This clearly evidences a certain accessibility of the reactants to active iron sites in the zeolite pores."
[74] "The amount of iron sites participating in the reaction leading to propene after 400 min on stream is presumably very low, as suggested by the simi- lar residual performance of ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5."
[75] "One could expect the presence of acidic groups in ex- FeZSM-5 to accelerate the deactivation process due to coke formation during ODHP compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, while the opposite was observed in our experiments."
[76] "Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite [13,14]."
[77] "The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation."
[78] "In this case, de- velopment of mesopores in the zeolites investigated, e.g., by desilication in alkaline medium [14], can be advantageous to improve transport properties and active site accessibility."
[79] "The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite [13], which is confirmed attending to the higher conversion of N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 in Fig. 2."
[80] "This has been attributed to the larger fraction of iron as active oligonuclear iron species in ex- FeZSM-5, which favors oxygen desorption, as compared to ex-Fe-silicalite [14,20]."
[81] "N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[82] "However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx."
[83] "This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface."
[84] "This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O."

10.然后根据振荡频率的变化确定质量吸收。
11.TEOM反应器装有30mg催化剂(125200m筛分)，夹在两个石英毛玻璃塞之间。
12.氦气流被反应混合物取代，连续监测质量变化和生成的产物气体。
13.产物气体由配备TCD的在线微型GC(Chrompack CP-2002)分析，使用Poraplot Q和Molsieve 5A柱。
14.N2O和C3H8的转化率分别从生成的N2量和消失的C3H8量确定。
15.丙烯产量和选择性分别计算为Y(C3H6) = C(C3H6)/Co(C3H8)和S(C3H6) = Y(C3H6)/X(C3H8)，其中C(C3H6)是特定时间的出口丙烯浓度，Co(C3H8)是丙烷的入口浓度，X(C3H8)是丙烷的转化率。
16.合成的Fe-沸石具有非常相似的铁含量，而ex-FeZSM-5和ex-FeBEA的Si/Al摩尔比几乎相同。
17.在蒸汽商业ex-H-ZSM-5和ex-H-BEA沸石中的铁含量低3040倍。
18.蒸汽活化FeZSM-5、Fe-硅酸盐和FeBEA沸石在723K时的初始丙烯产量在19 22%之间，丙烷转化率(约45%)和丙烯选择性(约50%)相似，且完整表1。
19.在没有N2O的情况下，C3H8与铁沸石的相互作用不会导致丙烯的产生，这表明氧化剂在丙烷脱氢中的重要作用。
20.蒸汽活化对于实现优越的催化性能至关重要，这一点从在煅烧铁沸石上获得的反应物和丙烯产量的低转化率得出结论。
21.煅烧沸石上丙烷和N2O的初始转化率与蒸汽沸石相比非常低。
22.煅烧Fe-硅酸盐和ex-Fe-硅酸盐的初始丙烯产量差异很大(5%和22%)。
23.在蒸汽活化铁沸石中，初始N2O和丙烷转化率以及丙烯选择性(因此丙烯产量)相当，无论宿主(MFI vs BEA)、沸石的酸性(ZSM-5 vs硅酸盐)和催化剂中铁的组成如何。
24.然而，反应动力学(失活行为和焦化)大不相同。
25.焦炭沉积可能源于所有研究催化剂中形成的主烯烃丙烯的凝结。
26.还检测到痕量乙烯(浓度比丙烯低约15倍)。
27.如图1所示，ex-FeBEA的失活非常迅速。
28.丙烯产量在前5分钟内迅速下降，催化剂在50分钟后完全失活。
29.活性突然下降与焦炭含量的急剧增加完美吻合，当C3H8转化率接近零，因此丙烯生产消失时，焦化曲线达到一个明确定义的平台。
30.获得了7%的残余N2O转化率。
31.ex-Fe-硅酸盐的失活速率明显低于ex-FeBEA; ex-Fe-硅酸盐上C3H6产量的连续下降明显与焦炭含量的逐渐增加有关，与ex-FeBEA形成对比。
32.ex-FeZSM-5在400分钟后保留了非常低的残余丙烯产量，N2O转化率为12%。
33.ex- FeZSM-5对失活的显著抵抗力偏离了以前的铁沸石。
34.首先，ex-FeZSM-5在前20分钟内激活，丙烯产量从22%增加到25%。
35.这种高丙烯产量在ex-FeZSM-5上维持了75分钟，此时的焦炭含量约为15 wt%。
36.相反，ex-Fe-硅酸盐和ex-FeBEA在75分钟后严重或完全失活。
37.在这一稳定期后，ex-FeZSM-5上的丙烯产量逐渐下降，但在400分钟的反应期后保留了8%的残余丙烯产量，C3H8和N2O的转化率分别为10和25%。
38.考虑到丙烯是研究过程中主要的焦炭前体，形成的焦炭量应该粗略地指示催化剂在ODHP中的活性。
39.因此，我们研究中最活跃的催化剂ex-FeZSM-5的最终焦炭含量为20 wt%，即比ex-Fe-硅酸盐(7.6 wt%)和完全失活的ex-FeBEA(9.2 wt%)高3倍。
40.煅烧c-Fe-硅酸盐400分钟后焦炭含量为4 wt%，即比相应蒸汽样品测量的量少一半。
41.然而，其他因素也会影响形成的焦炭量，特别是在含铝样品或煅烧沸石(铁在框架位置)中存在布伦斯特酸性位点，这些位点可能通过酸催化的碳正离子反应参与焦化。
42.对含有铁杂质的蒸汽商业沸石进行测试对于理解铁在催化性能中的作用很重要。
43.ex-H-ZSM-5(170 ppm Fe)与ex-H-BEA(210 ppm Fe)相比，活性更高，失活速率更低，这与在ex-FeZSM-5(0.67 wt% Fe)和ex-FeBEA(0.61 wt% Fe)上获得的结果相平行。
44.商业沸石诱导的C3H8和N2O转化率远低于合成Fe-沸石(图2)，因此导致丙烯产量和焦炭含量较低(见图1和2以及表1)。
45.这表明铁含量对催化性能有有益影响，正如在其他Fe-沸石上的N2O转化中得出的结论，例如直接分解[19]或苯选择性氧化为苯酚[5]。
46.令人惊讶的是，ex-FeZSM-5和ex-H-ZSM-5在400分钟后丙烯的残余产量非常相似(8%，见图1和2)。
47.蒸汽活化Fe-沸石是丙烷与N2O氧化脱氢(ODH)的高活性和选择性催化剂，在723K和400,000 ml h1 g1 cat的空间速度下，丙烯产量可达25%。
48.该过程的主要缺点是催化剂因焦炭而失活，尽管在773K[12]的氧气中再生焦炭沸石后，初始高活性完全恢复。
49.这里提出的TEOM技术是同时测量反应和焦化的独特工具，因此可以精确监测和相关催化剂失活和焦炭形成。
50.TEOM比传统重力微天平具有三个主要优势：(i)明确定义的流型，消除了可能的(热和质量)扩散和浮力现象；(ii)非常快的响应时间分辨率(0.1 s)；(iii)整个压力和温度范围内的高质
