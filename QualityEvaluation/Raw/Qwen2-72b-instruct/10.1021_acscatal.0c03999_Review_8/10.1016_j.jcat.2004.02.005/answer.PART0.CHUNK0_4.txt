1.N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) as catalysts can achieve initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, these catalysts deactivate due to coke formation. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts. The nature and distribution of these species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior. FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while FeBEA deactivates rapidly and completely. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is significantly higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, despite the latter having 30-40 times lower iron content. The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained. A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield. The TEOM technique, which consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance, can correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking. The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: a well-defined flow pattern, a very fast response time resolution, and a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature. Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites. Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide. The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account. The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites is significantly higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30-40 times more iron. The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels. The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size. The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated with the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
2.Strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP include the development of more stable catalysts with reduced coke formation, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize deactivation, and the use of regeneration techniques to restore catalyst activity. Research directions could focus on the synthesis of Fe-zeolites with tailored pore structures and acidity to improve selectivity and stability, the investigation of alternative iron sources and precursors to enhance the dispersion and stability of active sites, and the exploration of hybrid catalysts combining Fe-zeolites with other materials to improve heat management and mass transfer. Additionally, the development of in situ characterization techniques to monitor catalyst deactivation and the identification of coke precursors could provide insights into the deactivation mechanisms and guide the design of more robust catalysts. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages, including high propylene selectivity, the potential for valorization of N2O as an environmentally harmful gas, and the simultaneous valorization of propane as a cheap and abundant feedstock. However, the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP is hindered by the rapid deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation, which limits the process efficiency and economic viability. Addressing these limitations through the development of more stable catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions could make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

1.使用蒸汽活化Fe-沸石（MFI和BEA）作为催化剂的N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢可以达到723K时初始丙烯产量高达25%，但这些催化剂由于焦炭形成而失活。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的框架外铁物种的存在对于产生活性催化剂至关重要。这些物种的性质和分布，沸石宿主和催化剂酸性对初始丙烯产量没有显著影响，但强烈影响失活行为。FeZSM-5显示出对失活的显著抵抗力，而FeBEA则迅速且完全失活。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产量显著高于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA，尽管后者的铁含量低30-40倍。获得了丙醛的显著产量（高达6%）。FeMFI沸石在N2O-ODHP中的主要缺点是由于焦炭导致的失活，导致丙烯产量迅速下降。TEOM技术，由具有高分辨率微平衡的微型反应器组成，可以通过同时测量反应和焦化来关联活性和失活。TEOM与传统重力微平衡相比具有三个主要优势：定义明确的流型，消除可能的（热和质量）扩散和浮力现象；非常快的响应时间分辨率（0.1秒）；以及整个压力和温度范围内的高质量分辨率。蒸汽活化对于实现高催化活性至关重要，这从在煅烧铁沸石上获得的反应物和丙烯产量的低转化率得出结论。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的框架外铁物种负责丙烷与一氧化二氮的氧脱氢。ex-FeZSM-5和ex-Fe-silicalite在考虑它们的铁组成时，初始C3H6产量的差异微乎其微。合成Fe-沸石的初始活性，以每单位时间和催化剂质量转换的C3H8摩尔表示，比商业沸石高23倍，而前者催化剂的铁含量高30-40倍。在ex-FeBEA和ex-H-BEA中观察到的快速失活可以与BEA框架中存在大空腔和相对小的开口相关，特别是在通道的交界处。MFI催化剂的失活速率显著较低，可以与这种沸石结构中不存在大笼子相关，因为通道和交界处的大小相似。蒸汽活化ex-FeZSM-5在N2O-ODHP中的更高失活抗性尚不清楚，但可以暂时与两种催化剂的不同铁组成和/或与原始沸石框架中存在铝相关的不同多孔结构相关。
2.解决N2O-ODHP限制的策略包括开发具有减少焦炭形成的更稳定催化剂，优化反应条件以最小化失活，以及使用再生技术恢复催化剂活性。研究方向可以集中在合成具有定制孔结构和酸度的Fe-沸石，以提高选择性和稳定性，调查替代铁源和前体以增强活性位点的分散性和稳定性，以及探索结合Fe-沸石与其他材料的混合催化剂，以改善热管理和质量传递。此外，开发原位表征技术以监测催化剂失活和焦炭前体的识别可以为失活机制提供见解，并指导更坚固催化剂的设计。N2O作为氧化剂在ODHP中的使用提供了几个优势，包括高丙烯选择性，将N2O作为有害环境气体的价值化潜力，以及同时将丙烷作为廉价和丰富的原料的价值化。然而，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂快速失活限制了过程效率和经济可行性，阻碍了N2O-ODHP的实际实施。通过开发更稳定的催化剂和优化反应条件来解决这些限制，可以使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实际实施选择。
