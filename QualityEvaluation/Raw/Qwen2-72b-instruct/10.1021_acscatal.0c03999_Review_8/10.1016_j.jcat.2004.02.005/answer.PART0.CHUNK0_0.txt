1.N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) as catalysts can achieve initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, these catalysts deactivate due to coke formation. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts. The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior. FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar. The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained. A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield. The TEOM technique, which consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions, presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; a very fast response time resolution (0.1 s); and a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature. Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites. Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide. The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account. The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron. The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels. The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM- 5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP could include the development of more stable catalysts with improved coke resistance, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to restore catalyst activity. Research directions could focus on the design of new catalysts with tailored active sites and pore structures, the investigation of alternative oxidants that may reduce coke formation, and the development of more efficient separation and recovery processes for propylene.

1.使用蒸汽活化Fe-沸石（MFI和BEA）作为催化剂的N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢可以达到初始丙烯产量高达25%，温度为723 K。然而，这些催化剂由于焦炭形成而失活。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的框架外铁物种的存在对于产生活性催化剂至关重要。框架外铁物种的性质和分布，沸石宿主和催化剂酸性对初始丙烯产量没有显著影响，但强烈影响失活行为。FeZSM-5显示出对失活的显著抵抗力，而FeBEA则发生了非常快速和完全的失活。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产量显著高于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA（铁含量低3040倍），尽管400分钟后流上的残余活性非常相似。获得了对丙醛的显著产量（高达6%）。FeMFI沸石在N2O-ODHP中的主要缺点是由于焦炭导致的失活，导致丙烯产量迅速下降。TEOM技术，由具有高分辨率微平衡的微反应器组成，可实时测量气体-固体反应期间的质量变化，与常规重力微平衡相比具有三个主要优势：定义明确的流动模式，消除了可能的（热和质量）扩散和浮力现象；非常快的响应时间分辨率（0.1秒）；以及整个压力和温度范围内的高质质量。蒸汽活化对于实现高催化活性至关重要，正如从铁沸石煅烧后反应物和丙烯产量的低转化率得出的结论。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的框架外铁物种因此负责丙烷与一氧化二氮的氧脱氢。如果考虑到它们相对于铁的组成，ex-FeZSM-5和ex-Fe-silicalite之间的初始C3H6产量之间的差异是微小的。合成Fe-沸石的初始活性，以每单位时间和催化剂质量转换的C3H8摩尔表示，比商业沸石高23倍，而前者催化剂的铁含量高30 40倍。在ex-FeBEA和ex- H-BEA中观察到的快速失活可以与BEA框架中存在大空腔和相对小的开口相关联，特别是在通道的交界处。蒸汽活化ex-FeZSM- 5在N2O-ODHP中的更高失活抗性在现阶段尚不清楚，但可以暂时归因于两种催化剂中不同的铁组成和/或与原始沸石框架中存在铝相关的不同多孔结构。解决N2O-ODHP中催化剂失活和稳定性限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂，具有改进的焦炭抗性，优化反应条件以最小化焦炭形成，以及使用原位再生技术来恢复催化剂活性。研究方向可能集中在设计具有定制活性位点和孔结构的新催化剂，调查可能减少焦炭形成的替代氧化剂，以及开发更有效的丙烯分离和回收过程。
