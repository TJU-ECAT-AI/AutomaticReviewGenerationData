1.N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) as catalysts can achieve initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K.

Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP could include the development of more stable catalysts with improved coke resistance, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to restore catalyst activity. Research directions could focus on the design of new catalysts with tailored active sites and pore structures, the investigation of alternative oxidants that may reduce coke formation, and the development of more efficient separation and recovery processes for propylene.

1.使用蒸汽活化Fe-沸石（MFI和BEA）作为催化剂的N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢可以达到初始丙烯产量高达25%，温度为723 K。然而，这些催化剂由于焦炭形成而失活。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的框架外铁物种的存在对于产生活性催化剂至关重要。框架外铁物种的性质和分布，沸石宿主和催化剂酸性对初始丙烯产量没有显著影响，但强烈影响失活行为。FeZSM-5显示出对失活的显著抵抗力，而FeBEA则发生了非常快速和完全的失活。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产量显著高于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA（铁含量低3040倍），尽管400分钟后流上的残余活性非常相似。获得了对丙醛的显著产量（高达6%）。FeMFI沸石在N2O-ODHP中的主要缺点是由于焦炭导致的失活，导致丙烯产量迅速下降。TEOM技术，由具有高分辨率微平衡的微反应器组成，可实时测量气体-固体反应期间的质量变化，与常规重力微平衡相比具有三个主要优势：定义明确的流动模式，消除了可能的（热和质量）扩散和浮力现象；非常快的响应时间分辨率（0.1秒）；以及整个压力和温度范围内的高质质量。蒸汽活化对于实现高催化活性至关重要，正如从铁沸石煅烧后反应物和丙烯产量的低转化率得出的结论。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的框架外铁物种因此负责丙烷与一氧化二氮的氧脱氢。如果考虑到它们相对于铁的组成，ex-FeZSM-5和ex-Fe-silicalite之间的初始C3H6产量之间的差异是微小的。合成Fe-沸石的初始活性，以每单位时间和催化剂质量转换的C3H8摩尔表示，比商业沸石高23倍，而前者催化剂的铁含量高30 40倍。在ex-FeBEA和ex- H-BEA中观察到的快速失活可以与BEA框架中存在大空腔和相对小的开口相关联，特别是在通道的交界处。蒸汽活化ex-FeZSM- 5在N2O-ODHP中的更高失活抗性在现阶段尚不清楚，但可以暂时归因于两种催化剂中不同的铁组成和/或与原始沸石框架中存在铝相关的不同多孔结构。解决N2O-ODHP中催化剂失活和稳定性限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂，具有改进的焦炭抗性，优化反应条件以最小化焦炭形成，以及使用原位再生技术来恢复催化剂活性。研究方向可能集中在设计具有定制活性位点和孔结构的新催化剂，调查可能减少焦炭形成的替代氧化剂，以及开发更有效的丙烯分离和回收过程。

[9] "The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions."
[10] "The mass uptake is then determined by the change of the oscillating frequency."
[11] "The TEOM reactor was loaded with 30 mg of catalyst (sieve fraction 125200 m), firmly packed between two plugs of quartz wool."
[12] "The He flow was replaced by the reaction mix- ture, and mass changes and evolved product gases were continuously monitored."
[13] "The product gases were analyzed by an on-line micro-GC (Chrompack CP-2002) equipped with a TCD, using Poraplot Q and Molsieve 5A columns."
[14] "The conversions of N2O and C3H8 were determined from the amounts of N2 formed and C3H8 disappeared, respectively."
[15] "Propene yield and selectivity were calculated as Y(C3H6) = C(C3H6)/Co(C3H8) and S(C3H6) = Y(C3H6)/X(C3H8),respectively, where C(C3H6) is the outlet propene concen- tration at a certain time, Co(C3H8) is the inlet concentration of propane, and X(C3H8) is the conversion of propane."
[16] "The synthesized Fe-zeolites have a very simi- lar iron content, and the molar Si/Al ratio in ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA is nearly identical."
[17] "The amount of iron in the steamed commercial ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA zeo- lites was 3040 times lower."
[18] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances."
[19] "The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites."
[20] "The initial propene yields over c-Fe-silicalite and ex-Fe-silicalite largely differ (5 and 22%, respectively)."
[21] "The initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar in the steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), the acidic properties of the zeolite (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and the catalyst constitution with respect to iron."
[22] "However, the dynamics of the reaction (deactivation behav- ior and coke formation) are considerably different."
[23] "Coke deposits likely originate by condensation of propene,the main olefin formed over all the catalysts investigated."
[24] "Traces of ethylene were also detected (ca. 15 times lower concentration than propene)."
[25] "As shown in Fig. 1, deactivation of ex-FeBEA is very rapid."
[26] "The yield of propene rapidly decreases during the first 5 min on stream, and the catalyst is completely deac- tivated after 50 min."
[27] "The rate of deactivation over ex-Fe-silicalite was significantly lower than over ex-FeBEA; the continu- ous decline of the C3H6 yield over ex-Fe-silicalite is clearly connected with the more gradual increase of the coke con- tent, in contrast to ex-FeBEA."
[28] "Ex-FeZSM-5 preserves a very low residual propene yield after 400 min on stream with a N2O conversion of 12%."
[29] "The remarkable behavior of ex- FeZSM-5 against deactivation deviates from the former iron zeolites."
[30] "First of all, ex-FeZSM-5 activates during the first 20 min on stream, with an increase in propene yield from 22 to 25%."
[31] "This high propene yield over ex-FeZSM-5 was maintained during 75 min, and the coke content at this particular time is ca. 15 wt%."
[32] "Oppositely, ex-Fe-silicalite and ex-FeBEA were severely or completely deactivated after 75 min on stream."
[33] "After this stable period, the propene yield over ex-FeZSM-5 progressively decreases, but a residual propene yield of 8% is preserved after a reaction period of 400 min, with conver- sions of C3H8 and N2O of 10 and 25%, respectively."
[34] "Considering that propene is the major coke precursor in the process investigated, the amount of coke formed should give a rough indication of the catalyst activity in ODHP."
[35] "Accordingly, the final coke content over ex-FeZSM-5, the most active catalyst in our study is 20 wt%, i.e., ca. 3 times higher than over ex-Fe-silicalite (7.6 wt%) and ex-FeBEA (9.2 wt%)."
[36] "The coke content over calcined c-Fe-silicalite amounts to 4 wt% after 400 min, i.e., half than the amount measured in the corresponding steamed sample."
[37] "However,other factors also affect the amount of coke formed, es- pecially the presence of Brnsted acidic sites in the Al- containing samples or in the calcined zeolites (with iron in framework positions), which may participate in coking via acid-catalyzed carbenium ion reactions."
[38] "Tests with steamed commercial zeolites, containing im- purities of iron, are important for understanding the role of iron on the catalytic performance."
[39] "The higher activity and lower rate of deactivation of ex-H-ZSM-5 (170 ppm Fe) compared to ex-H-BEA (210 ppm Fe) draw parallels with the results obtained over ex-FeZSM-5 (0.67 wt% Fe) and ex-FeBEA (0.61 wt% Fe)."
[40] "Steamed commercial zeolites induced much lower C3H8 and N2O conversions than the synthesized Fe-zeolites (Fig. 2), hence resulting in a lower propene yield and coke content (see Figs. 1 and 2 and Ta- ble 1)."
[41] "This implies a beneficial effect of the amount of iron on the catalytic performance, as it was also concluded in other N2O conversions over Fe-zeolites, e.g., direct decom- position [19] or selective oxidation of benzene to phenol [5]."
[42] "Strikingly, the residual yield of propene over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5 after 400 min on stream was very similar (8%, see Figs. 1 and 2)."
[43] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selec- tive catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat."
[44] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."
[45] "The TEOM tech- nique presented here is a unique tool for the simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking, so that catalyst deac- tivation and coke formation can be precisely monitored and correlated."
[46] "The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature."
[47] "Relevant conclusions on the effect of the amount and form(s) of iron in the catalysts as well as of the zeolite acidity and host on the initial catalytic performance and deactivation behavior can be drawn from our study."
[48] "Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites."
[49] "The calcined samples contain the majority of iron in tetrahedral positions of the zeolite framework [13,14]."
[50] "Ac- tivation of N2O, the first step in ODHP as well as in other N2O conversions [5,19,20], requires coordination of atomic oxygen to the active site, which is impossible for framework iron."
[51] "Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."
[52] "This result contrasts with for- mer statements of Uddin et al. [9], who claimed that only framework iron in silicalite matrices was selective toward the olefin in the ODH of propane with O2."
[53] "Recent char- acterization of c-Fe-silicalite has shown that a very small fraction of iron is not isomorphously substituted in the ze- olite framework [14,21], either not incorporated during the hydrothermal synthesis or most likely extracted during tem- plate removal by calcination."
[54] "This result suggests that the (low) activity observed in c-Fe-silicalite may even originate from this fraction of iron species in extraframework active positions."
[55] "The similar initial degree of N2O and propane conver- sion, as well as propene selectivity (and thus propene yield) obtained over ex-FeZSM-5, ex-FeBEA, and the non-acidic ex-Fe-silicalite further indicates that the origin of the catalyst activity is mainly associated to the presence of extraframe- work iron species."
[56] "Brnsted acid sites (SiOHM groups with M = Al, Fe) and Lewis acid sites (mainly extraframe- work Al species generated upon steaming [13]) do not seem to be directly involved in the oxidative conversion of propane to propene."
[57] "In agreement, Meloni et al. [22] have also con- cluded that the acidity was not responsible for the initial activity of FeMFI in the one-step hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with N2O."
[58] "Application of Fe-zeolites in oxidations has mainly fo- cused on the MFI matrix [512], while other zeolite types have received little attention."
[59] "The geometrical parameters of the micropores are decisive in stabilizing active iron com- plexes, a difficult task in relatively open spaces."
[60] "This ex- plains the numerous frustrated attempts to produce active catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidation of benzene to phe- nol over iron zeolites with larger pore dimensions (Y, MOR) or mesoporous materials (MCM-41) [5]."
[61] "BEA is a good can- didate attending to the three-dimensional pore structure and larger internal accessibility as compared to MFI."
[62] "The ob- tained initial activity of ex-FeBEA, comparable to that of ex-FeMFI catalysts, has clearly shown that the topology and pore architecture of BEA are suitable for generating active iron species for the N2O-mediated conversion of propane to propene."
[63] "The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account."
[64] "Previous characterization evidenced that ex-Fe-silicalite does not show any sign of iron association, and the majority of extraframework iron species is uniform and well isolated, with a small fraction of iron in framework positions."
[65] "Contrarily, significant iron clustering was observed in ex-FeZSM-5, where extraframework iso- lated iron ions and oligonuclear species in the zeolite chan- nels coexist with iron oxide nanoparticles of 12 nm [13,14,20,21]."
[66] "Based on these results, it is suggested that the initial ODHP performance is not strongly affected by the forms of extraframework iron species in the steam-activated zeolites."
[67] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O con- versions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
[68] "The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron."
[69] "This indicates that the activity and se- lectivity per iron atom in, e.g., ex-H-ZSM-5, are ca. 10 times higher than in ex-FeZSM-5, suggesting that a significant fraction of iron in the synthesized Fe-zeolites is not utilized."
[70] "In other words, the iron species present in the commercial samples as impurities are considered as highly efficient sites for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with N2O."
[71] "As concluded above, the initial performance of the steam- activated iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is similar, but the deactivation behavior strongly differs."
[72] "Coke formation causes physical blocking of the active reaction sites inside the zeolitic pore system, resulting in a decreased C3H6 yield."
[73] "In general terms, the coking rate in zeolites depends on the acidic sites (number and strength), the zeolite structure, and the reaction conditions [23,24]."
[74] "In the reaction investigated,the nature and location of the active extraframework iron species may play an essential role on the deactivation be- havior too."
[75] "The origin of coke is mainly associated to the condensation of propene, as indicated by direct relation be- tween the propene yield and the amount of coke determined from the TEOM (see Fig. 1 and Table 1)."
[76] "The final amount of coke in ex-FeZSM-5 (with a residual propene yield of 8%) is 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and in the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA (Table 1)."
[77] "The coke content in ex- FeZSM-5 is 45 times higher that in ex-H-ZSM-5, while similar residual propene yields were achieved."
[78] "These results nicely illustrate that, as generally found, the location of coke is far more relevant than the total coke quantity in the deac- tivation process."
[79] "The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels."
[80] "Apparently, these trap cavities cause the entire blocking of the access to the active sites, leading to complete catalyst deactivation."
[81] "The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size."
[82] "Accordingly, coke precursors are not trapped inside the intersections, but diffuse out unless they are too strongly adsorbed."
[83] "As a consequence, deactivation is not complete over these catalysts (particularly ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5), showing a significant residual activity with a slow but continuous increase in the amount of coke."
[84] "This clearly evidences a certain accessibility of the reactants to active iron sites in the zeolite pores."
[85] "The amount of iron sites participating in the reaction leading to propene after 400 min on stream is presumably very low, as suggested by the simi- lar residual performance of ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5."
[86] "One could expect the presence of acidic groups in ex- FeZSM-5 to accelerate the deactivation process due to coke formation during ODHP compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, while the opposite was observed in our experiments."
[87] "Perathoner et al. [25] claimed the beneficial effect of Al in the zeo- lite framework to reduce the deactivation rate with respect to Fe-silicalite in the selective oxidation of benzene to phe- nol with N2O."
[88] "Contrarily, Meloni et al. [22] concluded that the surface acidity in FeZSM-5 leads to a faster catalyst de- activation compared to Fe-silicalite in the same reaction."
[89] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM- 5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."
[90] "Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite [13,14]."
[91] "The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation."
[92] "In this case, de- velopment of mesopores in the zeolites investigated, e.g., by desilication in alkaline medium [14], can be advantageous to improve transport properties and active site accessibility."
[93] "The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite [13], which is confirmed attending to the higher conversion of N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 in Fig. 2."
[94] "This has been attributed to the larger fraction of iron as active oligonuclear iron species in ex- FeZSM-5, which favors oxygen desorption, as compared to ex-Fe-silicalite [14,20]."
[95] "N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[96] "However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx."
[97] "This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface."
[98] "This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O."
[99] "Further research will be undertaken to clarify this aspect."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an efficient oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), offering high initial propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K. The use of N2O allows for selective propylene production compared to other oxidants, which may lead to lower yields or the formation of unwanted byproducts. Steam-activated iron zeolites (MFI and BEA) are particularly effective catalysts in this process, with the presence of extraframework iron species being essential for catalytic activity.
2.Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the N2O-ODHP process. Deactivation primarily occurs due to coke formation, which physically blocks active sites within the zeolitic pore system, leading to a decrease in propene yield. The deactivation behavior is influenced by the nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity. FeZSM-5 exhibits remarkable resistance against deactivation, while FeBEA shows rapid and complete deactivation. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is significantly higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, despite similar residual activities after 400 minutes on stream.
3.Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and improve stability in N2O-ODHP include:
   a. Developing catalysts with improved coke resistance, such as FeZSM-5, which has a more open structure that reduces pore blocking by coke and improves transport of reactants and products.
   b. Modifying the zeolite structure to prevent the trapping of coke precursors, as observed in FeBEA, where large cavities with small apertures lead to complete catalyst deactivation.
   c. Enhancing the accessibility of active iron sites within the zeolite pores, potentially through the development of mesopores in the zeolites, which can improve transport properties and active site accessibility.
   d. Investigating the role of iron species in direct N2O decomposition, as highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in this process may have increased resistance toward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

1.一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的高效氧化剂，可在723 K下提供高达25%的初始丙烯产量。N2O的使用允许选择性地生产丙烯，与其它氧化剂相比，后者可能导致较低的产量或形成不希望的副产品。蒸汽活化铁沸石（MFI和BEA）是这一过程中的特别有效的催化剂，其中非框架铁物种的存在对于催化活性至关重要。
2.N2O-ODHP过程中的催化剂失活和稳定性是关键挑战。失活主要由于焦炭形成，它在沸石孔系统中物理堵塞活性位点，导致丙烯产量下降。失活行为受非框架铁物种的性质和分布、沸石主体和催化剂酸性的影响。FeZSM-5表现出对失活的显著抵抗力，而FeBEA显示出快速和完全的失活。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产量显著高于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA，尽管在400分钟后流过时的相似残余活性。
3.解决催化剂失活和提高N2O-ODHP稳定性的策略包括：
   a.开发具有改进焦炭抗性的催化剂，如FeZSM-5，它具有更开放的结构，可以减少焦炭对孔的堵塞，并改善反应物和产物的运输。
   b.修改沸石结构，防止焦炭前体的捕获，如在FeBEA中观察到的，其中大空腔和小孔径导致完全催化剂失活。
   c.增强沸石孔中活性铁位点的可及性，可能通过在沸石中开发介孔，这可以改善运输性质和活性位点的可及性。
   d.研究铁物种在直接N2O分解中的作用，因为这种过程中的高活性Fe-沸石催化剂可能对N2O-ODHP中的焦炭失活具有增强的抵抗力。
   e.需要进一步的研究来阐明失活机制，并开发更稳定的催化剂，以实现N2O-ODHP的实际实施。

[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."
[2] "A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking."
[3] "The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts."
[4] "The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior."
[5] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
[6] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
[7] "The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained."
[8] "A major drawback of FeMFI zeo- lites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield."
[9] "The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions."
[10] "The mass uptake is then determined by the change of the oscillating frequency."
[11] "The TEOM reactor was loaded with 30 mg of catalyst (sieve fraction 125200 m), firmly packed between two plugs of quartz wool."
[12] "The He flow was replaced by the reaction mix- ture, and mass changes and evolved product gases were continuously monitored."
[13] "The product gases were analyzed by an on-line micro-GC (Chrompack CP-2002) equipped with a TCD, using Poraplot Q and Molsieve 5A columns."
[14] "The conversions of N2O and C3H8 were determined from the amounts of N2 formed and C3H8 disappeared, respectively."
[15] "Propene yield and selectivity were calculated as Y(C3H6) = C(C3H6)/Co(C3H8) and S(C3H6) = Y(C3H6)/X(C3H8),respectively, where C(C3H6) is the outlet propene concen- tration at a certain time, Co(C3H8) is the inlet concentration of propane, and X(C3H8) is the conversion of propane."
[16] "The synthesized Fe-zeolites have a very simi- lar iron content, and the molar Si/Al ratio in ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA is nearly identical."
[17] "The amount of iron in the steamed commercial ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA zeo- lites was 3040 times lower."
[18] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and FeBEA ze- olites showed initial propene yields in the range of 19 22% at 723 K, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%), and complete Table 1."
[19] "The interaction of C3H8 with the iron zeolites in the absence of N2O did not lead to propene production, indicating the es- sential role of the oxidant for propane dehydrogenation."
[20] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances."
[21] "The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites."
[22] "The initial propene yields over c-Fe-silicalite and ex-Fe-silicalite largely differ (5 and 22%, respectively)."
[23] "The initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar in the steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), the acidic properties of the zeolite (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and the catalyst constitution with respect to iron."
[24] "However, the dynamics of the reaction (deactivation behav- ior and coke formation) are considerably different."
[25] "Coke deposits likely originate by condensation of propene,the main olefin formed over all the catalysts investigated."
[26] "Traces of ethylene were also detected (ca. 15 times lower concentration than propene)."
[27] "As shown in Fig. 1, deactivation of ex-FeBEA is very rapid."
[28] "The yield of propene rapidly decreases during the first 5 min on stream, and the catalyst is completely deac- tivated after 50 min."
[29] "The sudden activity drop nicely co- incides with the sharp increase of the coke content, and the coking profile reaches a well-defined plateau when the conversion of C3H8 approaches zero and thus propene pro- duction vanishes."
[30] "A residual N2O conversion of 7% was ob- tained."
[31] "The rate of deactivation over ex-Fe-silicalite was significantly lower than over ex-FeBEA; the continu- ous decline of the C3H6 yield over ex-Fe-silicalite is clearly connected with the more gradual increase of the coke con- tent, in contrast to ex-FeBEA."
[32] "Ex-FeZSM-5 preserves a very low residual propene yield after 400 min on stream with a N2O conversion of 12%."
[33] "The remarkable behavior of ex- FeZSM-5 against deactivation deviates from the former iron zeolites."
[34] "First of all, ex-FeZSM-5 activates during the first 20 min on stream, with an increase in propene yield from 22 to 25%."
[35] "This high propene yield over ex-FeZSM-5 was maintained during 75 min, and the coke content at this particular time is ca. 15 wt%."
[36] "Oppositely, ex-Fe-silicalite and ex-FeBEA were severely or completely deactivated after 75 min on stream."
[37] "After this stable period, the propene yield over ex-FeZSM-5 progressively decreases, but a residual propene yield of 8% is preserved after a reaction period of 400 min, with conver- sions of C3H8 and N2O of 10 and 25%, respectively."
[38] "Considering that propene is the major coke precursor in the process investigated, the amount of coke formed should give a rough indication of the catalyst activity in ODHP."
[39] "Accordingly, the final coke content over ex-FeZSM-5, the most active catalyst in our study is 20 wt%, i.e., ca. 3 times higher than over ex-Fe-silicalite (7.6 wt%) and ex-FeBEA (9.2 wt%)."
[40] "The coke content over calcined c-Fe-silicalite amounts to 4 wt% after 400 min, i.e., half than the amount measured in the corresponding steamed sample."
[41] "However,other factors also affect the amount of coke formed, es- pecially the presence of Brnsted acidic sites in the Al- containing samples or in the calcined zeolites (with iron in framework positions), which may participate in coking via acid-catalyzed carbenium ion reactions."
[42] "Tests with steamed commercial zeolites, containing im- purities of iron, are important for understanding the role of iron on the catalytic performance."
[43] "The higher activity and lower rate of deactivation of ex-H-ZSM-5 (170 ppm Fe) compared to ex-H-BEA (210 ppm Fe) draw parallels with the results obtained over ex-FeZSM-5 (0.67 wt% Fe) and ex-FeBEA (0.61 wt% Fe)."
[44] "Steamed commercial zeolites induced much lower C3H8 and N2O conversions than the synthesized Fe-zeolites (Fig. 2), hence resulting in a lower propene yield and coke content (see Figs. 1 and 2 and Ta- ble 1)."
[45] "This implies a beneficial effect of the amount of iron on the catalytic performance, as it was also concluded in other N2O conversions over Fe-zeolites, e.g., direct decom- position [19] or selective oxidation of benzene to phenol [5]."
[46] "Strikingly, the residual yield of propene over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5 after 400 min on stream was very similar (8%, see Figs. 1 and 2)."
[47] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selec- tive catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat."
[48] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."
[49] "The TEOM tech- nique presented here is a unique tool for the simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking, so that catalyst deac- tivation and coke formation can be precisely monitored and correlated."
[50] "The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i) a well-defined flow pattern, eliminating possible (heat and mass) diffusion and bouyancy phenomena; (ii) a very fast response time res- olution (0.1 s); and (iii) a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature."
[51] "Relevant conclusions on the effect of the amount and form(s) of iron in the catalysts as well as of the zeolite acidity and host on the initial catalytic performance and deactivation behavior can be drawn from our study."
[52] "Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites."
[53] "Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."
[54] "The similar initial degree of N2O and propane conver- sion, as well as propene selectivity (and thus propene yield) obtained over ex-FeZSM-5, ex-FeBEA, and the non-acidic ex-Fe-silicalite further indicates that the origin of the catalyst activity is mainly associated to the presence of extraframe- work iron species."
[55] "The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with re- spect to iron is taken into account."
[56] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O con- versions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
[57] "The initial activity of the syn- thesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron."
[58] "This indicates that the activity and se- lectivity per iron atom in, e.g., ex-H-ZSM-5, are ca. 10 times higher than in ex-FeZSM-5, suggesting that a significant fraction of iron in the synthesized Fe-zeolites is not utilized."
[59] "In other words, the iron species present in the commercial samples as impurities are considered as highly efficient sites for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with N2O."
[60] "As concluded above, the initial performance of the steam- activated iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is similar, but the deactivation behavior strongly differs."
[61] "Coke formation causes physical blocking of the active reaction sites inside the zeolitic pore system, resulting in a decreased C3H6 yield."
[62] "In general terms, the coking rate in zeolites depends on the acidic sites (number and strength), the zeolite structure, and the reaction conditions [23,24]."
[63] "In the reaction investigated,the nature and location of the active extraframework iron species may play an essential role on the deactivation be- havior too."
[64] "The origin of coke is mainly associated to the condensation of propene, as indicated by direct relation be- tween the propene yield and the amount of coke determined from the TEOM (see Fig. 1 and Table 1)."
[65] "The final amount of coke in ex-FeZSM-5 (with a residual propene yield of 8%) is 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and in the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA (Table 1)."
[66] "The coke content in ex- FeZSM-5 is 45 times higher that in ex-H-ZSM-5, while similar residual propene yields were achieved."
[67] "These results nicely illustrate that, as generally found, the location of coke is far more relevant than the total coke quantity in the deac- tivation process."
[68] "The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex- H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, espe- cially at the intersection of the channels."
[69] "Apparently, these trap cavities cause the entire blocking of the access to the active sites, leading to complete catalyst deactivation."
[70] "The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size."
[71] "Accordingly, coke precursors are not trapped inside the intersections, but diffuse out unless they are too strongly adsorbed."
[72] "As a consequence, deactivation is not complete over these catalysts (particularly ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5), showing a significant residual activity with a slow but continuous increase in the amount of coke."
[73] "This clearly evidences a certain accessibility of the reactants to active iron sites in the zeolite pores."
[74] "The amount of iron sites participating in the reaction leading to propene after 400 min on stream is presumably very low, as suggested by the simi- lar residual performance of ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5."
[75] "One could expect the presence of acidic groups in ex- FeZSM-5 to accelerate the deactivation process due to coke formation during ODHP compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, while the opposite was observed in our experiments."
[76] "Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite [13,14]."
[77] "The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation."
[78] "In this case, de- velopment of mesopores in the zeolites investigated, e.g., by desilication in alkaline medium [14], can be advantageous to improve transport properties and active site accessibility."
[79] "The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite [13], which is confirmed attending to the higher conversion of N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 in Fig. 2."
[80] "This has been attributed to the larger fraction of iron as active oligonuclear iron species in ex- FeZSM-5, which favors oxygen desorption, as compared to ex-Fe-silicalite [14,20]."
[81] "N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[82] "However, re- combination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx."
[83] "This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface."
[84] "This hypoth- esis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance to- ward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O."
[85] "Further research will be undertaken to clarify this aspect."

79.The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite [13], which is confirmed attending to the higher conversion of N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 in Fig. 2.
80.This has been attributed to the larger fraction of iron as active oligonuclear iron species in ex- FeZSM-5, which favors oxygen desorption, as compared to ex-Fe-silicalite [14,20].
81.N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
82.However, recombination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
83.This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
84.This hypothesis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance toward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.
85.Further research will be undertaken to clarify this aspect.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中效率高，使用蒸汽活化Fe-沸石(MFI和BEA)作为催化剂，初始丙烯产量在723K时可达25%，但催化剂会因焦炭形成而失活。
2.使用与GC分析耦合的锥形元件振荡微天平(TEOM)同时测量反应和焦化，以关联活性和失活。
3.在蒸汽处理过程中生成的框架外铁物种对于产生活性催化剂至关重要。
4.框架外铁物种的性质和分布、沸石宿主和催化剂酸性对初始丙烯产量没有显著影响，但对失活行为有强烈影响。
5.FeZSM-5显示出对失活的显著抵抗力，而FeBEA则表现出非常快速和完全的失活。
6.FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产量明显高于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA(铁含量低3040倍)，尽管400分钟后残余活性非常相似。
7.获得了显著的丙醛产量(高达6%)。
8.FeMFI沸石在N2O-ODHP中的主要缺点是由于焦炭导致的活性快速下降。
9.TEOM由一个具有高分辨率微天平的微型反应器组成，可生成气体-固体反应期间质量变化的实时测量。
10.然后根据振荡频率的变化确定质量吸收。
11.TEOM反应器装有30mg催化剂(125200m筛分)，夹在两个石英毛玻璃塞之间。
12.氦气流被反应混合物取代，连续监测质量变化和生成的产物气体。
13.产物气体由配备TCD的在线微型GC(Chrompack CP-2002)分析，使用Poraplot Q和Molsieve 5A柱。
14.N2O和C3H8的转化率分别从生成的N2量和消失的C3H8量确定。
15.丙烯产量和选择性分别计算为Y(C3H6) = C(C3H6)/Co(C3H8)和S(C3H6) = Y(C3H6)/X(C3H8)，其中C(C3H6)是特定时间的出口丙烯浓度，Co(C3H8)是丙烷的入口浓度，X(C3H8)是丙烷的转化率。
16.合成的Fe-沸石具有非常相似的铁含量，而ex-FeZSM-5和ex-FeBEA的Si/Al摩尔比几乎相同。
17.在蒸汽商业ex-H-ZSM-5和ex-H-BEA沸石中的铁含量低3040倍。
18.蒸汽活化FeZSM-5、Fe-硅酸盐和FeBEA沸石在723K时的初始丙烯产量在19 22%之间，丙烷转化率(约45%)和丙烯选择性(约50%)相似，且完整表1。
19.在没有N2O的情况下，C3H8与铁沸石的相互作用不会导致丙烯的产生，这表明氧化剂在丙烷脱氢中的重要作用。
20.蒸汽活化对于实现优越的催化性能至关重要，这一点从在煅烧铁沸石上获得的反应物和丙烯产量的低转化率得出结论。
21.煅烧沸石上丙烷和N2O的初始转化率与蒸汽沸石相比非常低。
22.煅烧Fe-硅酸盐和ex-Fe-硅酸盐的初始丙烯产量差异很大(5%和22%)。
23.在蒸汽活化铁沸石中，初始N2O和丙烷转化率以及丙烯选择性(因此丙烯产量)相当，无论宿主(MFI vs BEA)、沸石的酸性(ZSM-5 vs硅酸盐)和催化剂中铁的组成如何。
24.然而，反应动力学(失活行为和焦化)大不相同。
25.焦炭沉积可能源于所有研究催化剂中形成的主烯烃丙烯的凝结。
26.还检测到痕量乙烯(浓度比丙烯低约15倍)。
27.如图1所示，ex-FeBEA的失活非常迅速。
28.丙烯产量在前5分钟内迅速下降，催化剂在50分钟后完全失活。
29.活性突然下降与焦炭含量的急剧增加完美吻合，当C3H8转化率接近零，因此丙烯生产消失时，焦化曲线达到一个明确定义的平台。
30.获得了7%的残余N2O转化率。
31.ex-Fe-硅酸盐的失活速率明显低于ex-FeBEA; ex-Fe-硅酸盐上C3H6产量的连续下降明显与焦炭含量的逐渐增加有关，与ex-FeBEA形成对比。
32.ex-FeZSM-5在400分钟后保留了非常低的残余丙烯产量，N2O转化率为12%。
33.ex- FeZSM-5对失活的显著抵抗力偏离了以前的铁沸石。
34.首先，ex-FeZSM-5在前20分钟内激活，丙烯产量从22%增加到25%。
35.这种高丙烯产量在ex-FeZSM-5上维持了75分钟，此时的焦炭含量约为15 wt%。
36.相反，ex-Fe-硅酸盐和ex-FeBEA在75分钟后严重或完全失活。
37.在这一稳定期后，ex-FeZSM-5上的丙烯产量逐渐下降，但在400分钟的反应期后保留了8%的残余丙烯产量，C3H8和N2O的转化率分别为10和25%。
38.考虑到丙烯是研究过程中主要的焦炭前体，形成的焦炭量应该粗略地指示催化剂在ODHP中的活性。
39.因此，我们研究中最活跃的催化剂ex-FeZSM-5的最终焦炭含量为20 wt%，即比ex-Fe-硅酸盐(7.6 wt%)和完全失活的ex-FeBEA(9.2 wt%)高3倍。
40.煅烧c-Fe-硅酸盐400分钟后焦炭含量为4 wt%，即比相应蒸汽样品测量的量少一半。
41.然而，其他因素也会影响形成的焦炭量，特别是在含铝样品或煅烧沸石(铁在框架位置)中存在布伦斯特酸性位点，这些位点可能通过酸催化的碳正离子反应参与焦化。
42.对含有铁杂质的蒸汽商业沸石进行测试对于理解铁在催化性能中的作用很重要。
43.ex-H-ZSM-5(170 ppm Fe)与ex-H-BEA(210 ppm Fe)相比，活性更高，失活速率更低，这与在ex-FeZSM-5(0.67 wt% Fe)和ex-FeBEA(0.61 wt% Fe)上获得的结果相平行。
44.商业沸石诱导的C3H8和N2O转化率远低于合成Fe-沸石(图2)，因此导致丙烯产量和焦炭含量较低(见图1和2以及表1)。
45.这表明铁含量对催化性能有有益影响，正如在其他Fe-沸石上的N2O转化中得出的结论，例如直接分解[19]或苯选择性氧化为苯酚[5]。
46.令人惊讶的是，ex-FeZSM-5和ex-H-ZSM-5在400分钟后丙烯的残余产量非常相似(8%，见图1和2)。
47.蒸汽活化Fe-沸石是丙烷与N2O氧化脱氢(ODH)的高活性和选择性催化剂，在723K和400,000 ml h1 g1 cat的空间速度下，丙烯产量可达25%。
48.该过程的主要缺点是催化剂因焦炭而失活，尽管在773K[12]的氧气中再生焦炭沸石后，初始高活性完全恢复。
49.这里提出的TEOM技术是同时测量反应和焦化的独特工具，因此可以精确监测和相关催化剂失活和焦炭形成。
50.TEOM比传统重力微天平具有三个主要优势：(i)明确定义的流型，消除了可能的(热和质量)扩散和浮力现象；(ii)非常快的响应时间分辨率(0.1 s)；(iii)整个压力和温度范围内的高质

The nature and distribution of these species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior. FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while FeBEA deactivates rapidly and completely. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is significantly higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, despite the latter having 30-40 times lower iron content. The remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained. A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.

2.Strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP include the development of more stable catalysts with reduced coke formation, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize deactivation, and the use of regeneration techniques to restore catalyst activity. Research directions could focus on the synthesis of Fe-zeolites with tailored pore structures and acidity to improve selectivity and stability, the investigation of alternative iron sources and precursors to enhance the dispersion and stability of active sites, and the exploration of hybrid catalysts combining Fe-zeolites with other materials to improve heat management and mass transfer. Additionally, the development of in situ characterization techniques to monitor catalyst deactivation and the identification of coke precursors could provide insights into the deactivation mechanisms and guide the design of more robust catalysts. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages, including high propylene selectivity, the potential for valorization of N2O as an environmentally harmful gas, and the simultaneous valorization of propane as a cheap and abundant feedstock. However, the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP is hindered by the rapid deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation, which limits the process efficiency and economic viability. Addressing these limitations through the development of more stable catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions could make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

1.使用蒸汽活化Fe-沸石（MFI和BEA）作为催化剂的N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢可以达到723K时初始丙烯产量高达25%，但这些催化剂由于焦炭形成而失活。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的框架外铁物种的存在对于产生活性催化剂至关重要。这些物种的性质和分布，沸石宿主和催化剂酸性对初始丙烯产量没有显著影响，但强烈影响失活行为。FeZSM-5显示出对失活的显著抵抗力，而FeBEA则迅速且完全失活。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产量显著高于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA，尽管后者的铁含量低30-40倍。获得了丙醛的显著产量（高达6%）。FeMFI沸石在N2O-ODHP中的主要缺点是由于焦炭导致的失活，导致丙烯产量迅速下降。TEOM技术，由具有高分辨率微平衡的微型反应器组成，可以通过同时测量反应和焦化来关联活性和失活。TEOM与传统重力微平衡相比具有三个主要优势：定义明确的流型，消除可能的（热和质量）扩散和浮力现象；非常快的响应时间分辨率（0.1秒）；以及整个压力和温度范围内的高质量分辨率。蒸汽活化对于实现高催化活性至关重要，这从在煅烧铁沸石上获得的反应物和丙烯产量的低转化率得出结论。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的框架外铁物种负责丙烷与一氧化二氮的氧脱氢。ex-FeZSM-5和ex-Fe-silicalite在考虑它们的铁组成时，初始C3H6产量的差异微乎其微。合成Fe-沸石的初始活性，以每单位时间和催化剂质量转换的C3H8摩尔表示，比商业沸石高23倍，而前者催化剂的铁含量高30-40倍。在ex-FeBEA和ex-H-BEA中观察到的快速失活可以与BEA框架中存在大空腔和相对小的开口相关，特别是在通道的交界处。MFI催化剂的失活速率显著较低，可以与这种沸石结构中不存在大笼子相关，因为通道和交界处的大小相似。蒸汽活化ex-FeZSM-5在N2O-ODHP中的更高失活抗性尚不清楚，但可以暂时与两种催化剂的不同铁组成和/或与原始沸石框架中存在铝相关的不同多孔结构相关。
2.解决N2O-ODHP限制的策略包括开发具有减少焦炭形成的更稳定催化剂，优化反应条件以最小化失活，以及使用再生技术恢复催化剂活性。研究方向可以集中在合成具有定制孔结构和酸度的Fe-沸石，以提高选择性和稳定性，调查替代铁源和前体以增强活性位点的分散性和稳定性，以及探索结合Fe-沸石与其他材料的混合催化剂，以改善热管理和质量传递。此外，开发原位表征技术以监测催化剂失活和焦炭前体的识别可以为失活机制提供见解，并指导更坚固催化剂的设计。N2O作为氧化剂在ODHP中的使用提供了几个优势，包括高丙烯选择性，将N2O作为有害环境气体的价值化潜力，以及同时将丙烷作为廉价和丰富的原料的价值化。然而，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂快速失活限制了过程效率和经济可行性，阻碍了N2O-ODHP的实际实施。通过开发更稳定的催化剂和优化反应条件来解决这些限制，可以使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实际实施选择。
