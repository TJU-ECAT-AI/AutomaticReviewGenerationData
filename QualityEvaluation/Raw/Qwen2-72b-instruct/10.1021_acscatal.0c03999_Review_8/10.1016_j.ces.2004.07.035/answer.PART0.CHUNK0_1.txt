[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
[2] "The interaction of C3H8 with the iron zeolites in the absence of N2O did not lead to propene production, indicating the essential role of the oxygen species from N2O for propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
[4] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."
[5] "The best action to decrease the rate of coke deactivation is to tailor catalyst properties such as active phase, the tex- ture, the diffusion length, and reaction conditions (Moulijn et al., 2001). Following the results of Chaki et al. (2003),addition of O2 in the feed may minimize or even suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits in the reaction of C2H4 and N2O over FeZSM-5."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O.
2.The various catalysts employed in the N2O-ODHP process include Fe-beta, Fe-silicalite, and FeZSM-5. Among these, FeZSM-5 exhibits the lowest rate of deactivation, making it the most suitable for practical implementation.
3.Catalyst deactivation in the N2O-ODHP process is a complex phenomenon that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of the active sites, or a decrease in the accessibility of the pore space. This deactivation is strongly influenced by the zeolite host and the reaction temperature.
4.Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process include tailoring catalyst properties such as the active phase, texture, diffusion length, and reaction conditions. One potential approach is the addition of O2 in the feed, which may minimize or even suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits in the reaction of ethylene (C2H4) and N2O over FeZSM-5.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被证明是丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中比其他氧化剂如氧气(O2)更优越的氧化剂。蒸汽活化铁沸石(Fe-沸石)在773至798 K的温度下实现了24%的初始丙烯产量,这与使用O2的钒(V)和钼(Mo)基催化剂报告的最高产量相当。N2O在这一过程中的基本作用通过以下事实突出显示:当丙烷与铁沸石在没有N2O的情况下相互作用时,不会产生丙烯。
2.在N2O-ODHP过程中使用的各种催化剂包括Fe-beta、Fe-silicalite和FeZSM-5。在这些催化剂中,FeZSM-5表现出最低的失活率,使其成为实际应用中最合适的选择。
3.N2O-ODHP过程中的催化剂失活是一个复杂的现象,可能是由活性位点数量的减少、活性位点质量的降低或孔隙空间可及性的降低引起的。这种失活受到沸石宿主和反应温度的强烈影响。
4.解决N2O-ODHP过程中催化剂失活和稳定性限制的策略包括调整催化剂性质,如活性相、纹理、扩散长度和反应条件。一种潜在的方法是在进料中添加O2,这可能最小化或甚至抑制FeZSM-5上乙烯(C2H4)和N2O反应中碳质沉积物的形成。
