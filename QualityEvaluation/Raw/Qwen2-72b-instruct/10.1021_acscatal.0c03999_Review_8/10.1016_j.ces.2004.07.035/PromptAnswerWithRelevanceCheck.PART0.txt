1.N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation using steam-activated Fe-zeolites has shown superior performance, achieving initial propene yields of 24% at 773-798 K, comparable to the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation varies among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5. The behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space.
2.Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include tailoring catalyst properties such as active phase, texture, diffusion length, and reaction conditions. Chemical reaction engineering solutions can also be applied, using dedicated reactors with catalyst moving from a reaction zone to a regeneration zone. The feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propylene production has been demonstrated using two fixed-bed reactors in parallel, alternating between reaction and regeneration cycles. This novel catalytic process can be economically applied in tail-gases of specific chemical processes where N2O is produced in high concentration.

1.N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢使用蒸汽活化Fe-沸石显示出优越的性能，在773-798 K下实现了24%的初始丙烯产率，与V和Mo基催化剂使用O2报告的最高值相当。Fe-沸石的显著性能归因于N2O作为单氧供体的特异性和沸石中铁形式协调反应性原子氧物种以有效脱氢丙烷的能力。然而，一个主要的缺点是由于焦炭导致的失活，导致丙烯产率的快速下降。失活速率在研究的沸石中差异显著，按以下顺序递减：Fe-beta > Fe-硅沸石 > FeZSM-5。FeZSM-5的行为表明存在对焦炭失活具有不同敏感性的活性铁位点。催化剂失活是一个复杂的过程，可能由一系列各种现象引起。最简单的情况下，根据Moulijn等人(2001)的说法，催化剂失活可能是由以下原因引起的：(i)活性位点数量的减少，(ii)活性位点质量的下降，(iii)孔隙空间可及性的下降。
2.解决N2O-ODHP中催化剂失活和稳定性限制的策略包括调整催化剂性质，如活性相、纹理、扩散长度和反应条件。化学反应工程解决方案也可以应用，使用专用反应器，催化剂从反应区移动到再生区。已经证明了在两个并行的固定床反应器中交替进行反应和再生循环的周期性操作过程的可行性，用于连续生产丙烯。这种新型催化过程可以经济地应用于特定化学过程中产生的尾气中，其中N2O以高浓度产生。

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O.
2.The various catalysts employed in the N2O-ODHP process include Fe-beta, Fe-silicalite, and FeZSM-5. Among these, FeZSM-5 exhibits the lowest rate of deactivation, making it the most suitable for practical implementation.
3.Catalyst deactivation in the N2O-ODHP process is a complex phenomenon that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of the active sites, or a decrease in the accessibility of the pore space. This deactivation is strongly influenced by the zeolite host and the reaction temperature.
4.Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process include tailoring catalyst properties such as the active phase, texture, diffusion length, and reaction conditions. One potential approach is the addition of O2 in the feed, which may minimize or even suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits in the reaction of ethylene (C2H4) and N2O over FeZSM-5.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被证明是丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中比其他氧化剂如氧气(O2)更优越的氧化剂。蒸汽活化铁沸石(Fe-沸石)在773至798 K的温度下实现了24%的初始丙烯产量,这与使用O2的钒(V)和钼(Mo)基催化剂报告的最高产量相当。N2O在这一过程中的基本作用通过以下事实突出显示:当丙烷与铁沸石在没有N2O的情况下相互作用时,不会产生丙烯。
2.在N2O-ODHP过程中使用的各种催化剂包括Fe-beta、Fe-silicalite和FeZSM-5。在这些催化剂中,FeZSM-5表现出最低的失活率,使其成为实际应用中最合适的选择。
3.N2O-ODHP过程中的催化剂失活是一个复杂的现象,可能是由活性位点数量的减少、活性位点质量的降低或孔隙空间可及性的降低引起的。这种失活受到沸石宿主和反应温度的强烈影响。
4.解决N2O-ODHP过程中催化剂失活和稳定性限制的策略包括调整催化剂性质,如活性相、纹理、扩散长度和反应条件。一种潜在的方法是在进料中添加O2,这可能最小化或甚至抑制FeZSM-5上乙烯(C2H4)和N2O反应中碳质沉积物的形成。

1.N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation over steam-activated Fe-zeolites has shown superior performance, achieving initial propene yields of 24% at 773-798 K, comparable to the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2. The essential role of N2O as an oxygen donor for propane dehydrogenation is evident, as no propene production occurs in the absence of N2O. However, catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is a critical challenge, with the rate of deactivation varying among different Fe-zeolites. FeZSM-5 exhibits a slower deactivation rate compared to Fe-beta and Fe-silicalite, possibly due to the presence of active iron sites with varying sensitivity to coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space. Strategies to address these limitations include tailoring catalyst properties such as active phase, texture, diffusion length, and reaction conditions. The addition of O2 in the feed may minimize or even suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits, as demonstrated in the reaction of C2H4 and N2O over FeZSM-5.

1.N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢在蒸汽活化Fe-沸石上的表现优于其他催化剂，初始丙烯产量在773-798 K时达到24%，与V和Mo基催化剂在O2下的最高报道值相当。N2O作为丙烷脱氢的氧供体的必要性是显而易见的，因为没有N2O的情况下不会产生丙烯。然而，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活是一个关键的挑战，不同Fe-沸石的失活速率存在差异。FeZSM-5的失活速率比Fe-beta和Fe-silicalite慢，这可能是由于存在对焦炭失活具有不同敏感性的活性铁位点。催化剂失活可能是由于活性位点数量的减少、活性位点质量的降低或孔隙空间可及性的降低造成的。解决这些限制的策略包括调整催化剂属性，如活性相、纹理、扩散长度和反应条件。在进料中添加O2可能可以最小化甚至抑制碳沉积物的形成，正如在FeZSM-5上C2H4和N2O的反应中所展示的那样。

2.Fe-沸石在N2O-ODHP中的主要缺点是焦炭导致的失活，这会导致丙烯产量的快速下降。然而，经过在773 K下纯氧中30分钟的再生，原始催化活性可以完全恢复。不同沸石的失活速率存在显著差异，按以下顺序递减：Fe-beta > Fe-硅沸石 > FeZSM-5。
3.各种铁沸石的不同失活行为目前还无法充分解释。FeZSM-5的行为表明存在对焦炭失活具有不同敏感性的活性铁位点。研究了反应温度对FeZSM-5催化性能和失活时间尺度的影响。在673 K时，初始N2O转化率从76%增加到723 K时的100%，而C3H8转化率的增加则不那么明显（从40%增加到50%），在773 K时没有进一步增加。在773 K时，较低的失活速率与N2O的高转化度有关，与723和673 K时的25%和15%相比，残留转化度为75%。N2O分解后，吸附的原子氧或解吸的O2至少部分参与了通过氧化焦炭对沸石表面的再生。
4.催化剂失活是一个复杂的过程，可能由一系列各种现象引起。FeZSM-5的初始和残留丙烯产量水平非常相似，表明反应开始和稳态条件下的活性位点数量在再生样品中没有减少。然而，失活动力学的不同可能与对失活更敏感或由于可及性降低而不参与反应的活性物种的一部分有关。
5.降低焦炭失活速率的最佳行动是调整催化剂性质，如活性相、纹理、扩散长度和反应条件。或者，可以应用化学反应工程解决方案来恢复催化剂活性，使用专用反应器，催化剂从反应区移动到再生区。

2.Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include tailoring catalyst properties such as active phase, texture, diffusion length, and reaction conditions. The addition of a low amount of oxygen to the reaction mixture can minimize or suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits. Chemical reaction engineering solutions, such as using dedicated reactors with catalyst moving from a reaction zone to a regeneration zone, can also be applied. A cyclically-operated process with parallel fixed-bed reactors has been demonstrated to maintain propene yields above 20% for extended periods by alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles. Further research is needed to understand the mechanism, nature, and location of coke formation to design measures to maintain the stability of the catalyst.
