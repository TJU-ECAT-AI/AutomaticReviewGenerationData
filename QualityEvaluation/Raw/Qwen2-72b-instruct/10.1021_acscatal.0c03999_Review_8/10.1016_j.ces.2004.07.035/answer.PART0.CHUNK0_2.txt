[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
[2] "The interaction of C3H8 with the iron zeolites in the absence of N2O did not lead to propene production, indicating the essential role of the oxygen species from N2O for propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
[4] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."
[5] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."
[6] "The best action to decrease the rate of coke deactivation is to tailor catalyst properties such as active phase, the tex- ture, the diffusion length, and reaction conditions (Moulijn et al., 2001). Following the results of Chaki et al. (2003),addition of O2 in the feed may minimize or even suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits in the reaction of C2H4 and N2O over FeZSM-5."

1.N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation over steam-activated Fe-zeolites has shown superior performance, achieving initial propene yields of 24% at 773-798 K, comparable to the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2. The essential role of N2O as an oxygen donor for propane dehydrogenation is evident, as no propene production occurs in the absence of N2O. However, catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is a critical challenge, with the rate of deactivation varying among different Fe-zeolites. FeZSM-5 exhibits a slower deactivation rate compared to Fe-beta and Fe-silicalite, possibly due to the presence of active iron sites with varying sensitivity to coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space. Strategies to address these limitations include tailoring catalyst properties such as active phase, texture, diffusion length, and reaction conditions. The addition of O2 in the feed may minimize or even suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits, as demonstrated in the reaction of C2H4 and N2O over FeZSM-5.

1.N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢在蒸汽活化Fe-沸石上的表现优于其他催化剂，初始丙烯产量在773-798 K时达到24%，与V和Mo基催化剂在O2下的最高报道值相当。N2O作为丙烷脱氢的氧供体的必要性是显而易见的，因为没有N2O的情况下不会产生丙烯。然而，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活是一个关键的挑战，不同Fe-沸石的失活速率存在差异。FeZSM-5的失活速率比Fe-beta和Fe-silicalite慢，这可能是由于存在对焦炭失活具有不同敏感性的活性铁位点。催化剂失活可能是由于活性位点数量的减少、活性位点质量的降低或孔隙空间可及性的降低造成的。解决这些限制的策略包括调整催化剂属性，如活性相、纹理、扩散长度和反应条件。在进料中添加O2可能可以最小化甚至抑制碳沉积物的形成，正如在FeZSM-5上C2H4和N2O的反应中所展示的那样。
