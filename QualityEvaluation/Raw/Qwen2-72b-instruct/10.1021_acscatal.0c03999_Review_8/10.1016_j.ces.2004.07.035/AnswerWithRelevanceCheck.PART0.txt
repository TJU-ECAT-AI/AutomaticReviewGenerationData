          [1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"
          [3] "A major draw- back of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, al- though the original catalytic activity was completely recov- ered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003)."
          [4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
          [5] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."
          [6] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva- tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac- tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

          Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation varies among the zeolites studied, with Fe-beta deactivating the fastest, followed by Fe-silicalite and FeZSM-5. The deactivation behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space.

          一氧化二氮(N2O)已被证明是丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中比其他氧化剂如氧气(O2)更优越的氧化剂。蒸汽活化铁沸石(Fe-沸石)在773至798 K的温度下实现了24%的初始丙烯产量,这与使用O2的钒(V)和钼(Mo)基催化剂报告的最高产量相当。N2O在这一过程中的基本作用通过以下事实突出显示:当丙烷与铁沸石在没有N2O的情况下相互作用时,不会产生丙烯。Fe-沸石的显著性能归因于N2O作为单氧供体的特异性和沸石中铁形式协调反应性原子氧物种以有效脱氢丙烷的能力。然而,一个主要的缺点是由于焦炭导致的失活,导致丙烯产率的快速下降。失活速率在研究的沸石中差异很大,Fe-beta失活最快,其次是Fe-silicalite和FeZSM-5。FeZSM-5的失活行为表明存在对焦炭失活具有不同敏感性的活性铁位点。催化剂失活是一个复杂的过程,可能由一系列各种现象引起。最简单的情况下,根据Moulijn等人(2001)的说法,催化剂失活可能是由活性位点数量的减少、活性位点质量的降低或孔隙空间可及性的降低引起的。

          [5] "The best action to decrease the rate of coke deactivation is to tailor catalyst properties such as active phase, the tex- ture, the diffusion length, and reaction conditions (Moulijn et al., 2001). Following the results of Chaki et al. (2003),addition of O2 in the feed may minimize or even suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits in the reaction of C2H4 and N2O over FeZSM-5."

          Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include tailoring catalyst properties such as active phase, texture, diffusion length, and reaction conditions. The addition of a low amount of oxygen to the reaction mixture can minimize or suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits. Chemical reaction engineering solutions, such as using dedicated reactors with catalyst moving from a reaction zone to a regeneration zone, can also be applied. A cyclically-operated process with parallel fixed-bed reactors has been demonstrated to maintain propene yields above 20% for extended periods by alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles. Further research is needed to understand the mechanism, nature, and location of coke formation to design measures to maintain the stability of the catalyst.

          解决N2O-ODHP中催化剂失活和稳定性限制的策略包括调整催化剂性质,如活性相、纹理、扩散长度和反应条件。在反应混合物中添加少量氧气可以最小化或抑制碳质沉积物的形成。化学反应工程解决方案,如使用催化剂从反应区移动到再生区的专用反应器,也可以应用。已经证明,通过交替反应和再生周期,使用并行固定床反应器的循环操作过程可以维持超过20%的丙烯产率。需要进一步的研究来理解焦炭形成机制、性质和位置,以设计措施来维持催化剂的稳定性。
