[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
[2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
[3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
[4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."

1.N2O has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to O2, with the most significant improvements observed for catalysts containing bulk-like V2O5 species. This is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species, resulting in a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O also reduces the importance of direct propane oxidation to COx, mainly CO2, compared to O2. Higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all studied vanadium oxides. The difference in catalytic performance between O2 and N2O may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2.
2.The various catalysts employed in the ODHP process include VOx/g-Al2O3 and VOx/MCM-41 materials, with the most significant improvements in propene selectivity observed for catalysts containing bulk-like V2O5 species.
3.Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges associated with the use of N2O in the ODHP process. The lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species, which is advantageous for propene selectivity, also leads to a higher degree of catalyst reduction and potential deactivation. Strategies to address these limitations could include the development of more stable catalysts, such as those with higher thermal stability or the use of promoters to enhance catalyst regeneration. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of catalyst deactivation and developing methods to mitigate these effects, such as optimizing reaction conditions or developing new catalyst formulations.

1.N2O已被证明在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中比O2提高了丙烯选择性，特别是对于含有类似V2O5的催化剂，这是由于N2O重新氧化还原VOx物种的能力较低，导致催化剂还原程度更高。N2O的使用也减少了与O2相比直接丙烷氧化为COx(主要是CO2)的重要性。与O2相比，所有研究的钒氧化物在使用N2O时都能获得更高的初始丙烯选择性。O2和N2O在钒氧化物催化性能上的差异可能部分与来自O2的活性氧物种的性质有关。
2.在ODHP过程中使用的各种催化剂包括VOx/g-Al2O3和VOx/MCM-41材料，其中含有类似V2O5的催化剂观察到丙烯选择性的最大改善。
3.催化剂失活和稳定性是N2O在ODHP过程中使用的关键挑战。N2O重新氧化还原VOx物种的能力较低，虽然有利于丙烯选择性，但也可能导致催化剂还原程度更高和潜在失活。解决这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂，如热稳定性更高的催化剂，或使用促进剂来增强催化剂再生。研究方向可以集中在理解催化剂失活的机制和开发方法来缓解这些影响，如优化反应条件或开发新的催化剂配方。
