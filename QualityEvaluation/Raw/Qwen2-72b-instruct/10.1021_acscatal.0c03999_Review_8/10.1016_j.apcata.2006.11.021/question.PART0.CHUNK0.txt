Influence of reaction conditions on catalyst composition and selective/non-selective reaction pathways of the ODP reaction over V2O3, VO2 and V2O5 with O2 and N2O Evgenii V.

Steady-state product selectivities over these oxides are not determined by their initial (fresh) composition but a new catalyst composition created under the reaction conditions. At similar degrees of propane conversion, this steady-state composition depends on the oxidizing agent (O2 or N2O). For an oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) containing mixture (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are stabilized in penta- and tetravalent oxidation states, with the former being the main one. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). It is suggested that the difference in the oxidation state of vanadium with O2 and N2O is related to the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species as compared to O2. Moreover, individual vanadium oxides poorly performing with O2 become selective in the ODP reaction using
N2O. This improving effect of N2O on the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction
conditions and to the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O.

1. Introduction
Oxidative selective catalytic utilisation of low alkanes (ethane and propane) continues to be an actual topic of research studies due to increased demands for olefins and oxygenates.
The relevant results have been recently reviewed [14]. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (ODP),vanadium- and molybdenum-based oxide catalysts belong to the best-performing catalytic materials using O2 as oxidizing agent. Unfortunately, the present-day catalytic materials suffer from low propene selectivities at high degrees of propane conversion due to higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane. In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2.
The importance of different oxidation states of vanadium has been mentioned for various catalytic oxidation reactions [713]. In a recent study of Schlo gl and co-workers [14], it was shown that morphological and electronic changes of VxOy nanoparticles under conditions of partial oxidation of n-butane played an important role in the catalytic reaction.
Moreover, for catalytic tests in continuous flow fixed-bed reactors, concentration gradients of feed components and reaction products are observed in the catalyst bed.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.apcata.2006.11.021 in a variation of the catalyst composition in different parts of the reactor. Barbero et al. [11] identified three different catalyst compositions along the catalyst bed after performing the ODP reaction with O2 over V2O5 at 823 K. At the reactor inlet, where O2 and C3H8 were present at the ratio of 1, V2O5 was stabilized.
Upon passing the reaction feed and products down-stream over the catalyst, the catalyst composition changed from V2O5 to VO2 and finally to V2O3. The changes were explained by the fact that the ratio of C3H8/O2 increased along the catalyst bed due to enhanced consumption of O2 as compared to C3H8. Since the reaction atmosphere becomes more reduced down-stream of the catalyst, V2O5 is reduced to lower valence vanadium oxides. However, these authors [11] did not report any catalytic data.
In order to adequately establish structurereactivity/selec- tivity relationships in the ODP reaction, catalyst characteriza- tion and catalytic tests should be performed under controlled reaction conditions, i.e. minimized concentration gradients of feed components in the catalyst bed. To the best of the authors knowledge, there are no comprehensive studies of a structure- selectivity relationship for individual vanadium oxides (V2O5, VO2 and V2O3) in the ODP reaction with O2 and N2O. These systems are considered to be models for elucidating the role of differently oxidized vanadium species in selective and non- selective ODP reaction pathways.
The present study is focused on the effect of different oxidizing agents (O2 and N2O) on ODP catalytic performance of individual vanadium oxides. Particular attention is paid to the role of reaction-induced surface and bulk changes of V2O3, VO2 and V2O5. To this end, steady-state ODP performance of V2O3, VO2 and V2O5 with O2 and N2O was determined and compared with the results of characterization studies by means of in situ UVvis, in situ XRD and ex situ
XPS. Mechanistic insights into the role of O2 in CO2
formation in the ODP reaction were derived from SSITKA (steady-state-isotopic-transient-kinetic-analysis) tests.
The obtained knowledge may be eventual helpful to design improved catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts and their characterization
Nitrogen physisorption was employed to obtain specific surface areas in a single point BET analyzer (Gemini III 2375, Micromeritics) by using N2 physisorption at 77 K. The BET values of fresh V2O5 (99.6%, Aldrich), VO2 (99.5%, ChemPur) and V2O3 (99.9%, ChemPur) are 9.7, 11.6 and 7.3 m2/g,respectively.
The crystalline bulk composition of vanadium oxides during the ODP reaction was determined by means of in situ XRD using a theta theta powder diffractometer (Seifert) with multilayer mirror and Cu Ka1 radiation. Undiluted catalyst samples (ca. 50 mg) were placed on the PtRh sample holder of the in situ XRD cell (Bu hler HDKS1). The holder was coated with Au prior to experiments, in order to suppress blank activity of PtRh for the ODP reaction at 773 K. The degree of propane conversion over the coated holder at 773 K did not exceed
0.1%. The catalytic samples were studied using either C3H8/O2/
Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction feeds at 1 bar and 773 K for 4 h (total flow of 60 ml(STP)/min). A fresh sample was used for each experiment. The in situ XRD patterns were recorded every ca. 15 min.
In order to determine near-to-surface composition of used catalytic materials by XPS, an ESCALAB 220i-XL spectro- meter (Fisons Instruments) with Mg Ka radiation (1253.3 eV) was applied. The ex situ XPS study was performed in the following way. The samples (2050 mg) diluted with quartz particles were treated in oxygen (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40) or N2O (C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) containing reaction feeds at 1 bar and 773 K for 4 h. The degrees of propane and oxidant conversion did not exceed 5 and 10%, respectively. After the catalytic reaction, the samples were cooled down to 300 K in the same gas flow, and transferred in air to the sample holder for XPS measurements.
In situ UVvis experiments were performed to follow the changes in reduction state of individual vanadium oxides under reaction conditions with different oxidants (O2 and N2O). In situ UVvis spectra were recorded under reaction conditions while passing different reaction mixtures (C3H8/ O2/N2 = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) through the catalyst bed at 773 K. The total gas flow was kept at 40 ml(STP)/min. In order to have a sufficient catalyst bed length (23 mm) for spectroscopic studies and to keep the propane conversion under 5%, the catalyst was slightly diluted with quartz particles. A thermocouple inside the catalyst bed was used to control the reaction temperature. The in situ UV vis analysis was performed using an AVASPEC fiber optical spectrometer (Avantes) equipped with a DH-2000 deuterium- halogen light source and a CCD array detector. A high- temperature reflection probe consisting of six radiating and one reading optical fibers was located inside the furnace perpendicular to the reactor. The sensor was connected to the spectrometer and the light source by fiber optical cables (length 2 m) consisting of a core of pure silica (diameter
0.4 mm) coated with polyimide. The spectra were converted
into the KubelkaMunk function F(R).
2.2. Catalytic tests
A U-shaped fixed-bed quartz reactor (i.d. 5 mm) was employed for the catalytic tests. The quartz reactor was immersed into a fluidized bed of sand serving as a source of heat or its removal. The temperature within the fixed-bed of catalyst particles was measured by an axially movable thermocouple located inside a quartz capillary. Catalyst was diluted with quartz particles to assure temperature control. The oxidative conversion of propane was investigated using C3H8/N2O/ Ne = 40/40/20, C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40,and
C3H8/O2/
Ne = 40/10/50 feeds at 1 bar and 773 K. Neon was used to control the formation of N2 and O2 in case of N2O decomposition. In order to achieve different degrees of propane conversion, the total flow rates and catalyst amounts were varied between 30 and 240 ml(STP) min1 and between 5 and
E.V. Kondratenko et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 319 (2007) 98110
99 200 mg, respectively. The feed components and products were analyzed using an online GC (HP 5890) equipped with Porapak Q and Molecular sieve-5 columns.
The steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) experiments were performed in a tubular quartz reactor at 1 bar and 773 K. Catalyst amount and gas flows were fixed to 85 mg and 40 ml(STP) min1, respectively. The following reaction feeds were used: 16O2/Ne/Ar = 2/2/96, 18O2/ Ne/Ar = 2/2/96, C3H8/16O2/Ne/Ar = 4/2/2/92, and C3H8/18O2/ Ne/Ar = 4/2/2/92. Oxygen tracing experiments were performed by switching from non-labeled to labeled reaction feeds after a pseudo steady-state operation. The gas composition at the reactor outlet was monitored by on-line mass spectrometry (Balzer Omnistar). The following atomic mass units (AMUs) were analyzed: 48 (C18O2), 46 (C18O16O), 44 (C16O2, C3H8),42 (C3H6, C3H8), 40 (Ar), 36 (18O2), 34 (16O18O), 32 (O2), 30 (C18O, C3H8), 29 (C3H8), 28 (C16O, C16O2, C3H8, C3H6), 20 (Ne, H2 18O), and 18 (H2 16O). The concentration of feed components and products was determined from the respective AMUs using fragmentation patterns and sensitivity factors,which arise from the different ionization probabilities of individual compounds. The relative sensitivities were deter- mined as a ratio of the intensity of the mass spectrometry signal of each compound related to that of Ar (inert standard). The respective intensities were corrected according to the con- tribution of fragmentation pattern of other compounds to the measured AMU signal. The fragmentation patterns and respective sensitivities of feed components and reaction products were determined from separate calibration experi- ments, where a mixture of reference gas and inert standard was introduced into the reactor filled with SiO2 particles. It was assumed that there is no difference in the calibration values between the non-isotopically and isotopically labeled com- pounds.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performance of V2O5, VO2 and V2O3 with O2
and N2O Catalytic performance of V2O3, VO2 and V2O5 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) was determined at 773 K for various contact times using O2 and N2O as oxidants.
For both oxidizing agents, C3H6, CO and CO2 were the main carbon-containing reaction products. Small amounts of ethylene,methane and oxygenates (acroleine,acetaldehyde) were observed at high degrees of propane conversion. Insights into the catalytic activity of different vanadium oxides in the ODP reaction can be derived from conversion-contact time plots in Fig. 1. It should be particularly stressed that the experimental data in this figure were obtained after at least 2 h on stream. This time was sufficient to achieve a pseudo steady-state operation.
From the results in Fig. 1 for an O2-containing reaction feed, it is expected that the activity of V2O5 for propane conversion is lower than that of V2O3 and VO2. When O2 is replaced by N2O, V2O3 shows the lowest activity, while that of V2O5 and VO2 are similar. At this stage it is important to note that the individual vanadium oxides were strongly restructured under reaction conditions (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). This means that their specific surface areas may be changed. It is well accepted that for correct comparison of activity of different materials in heterogen-catalyzed reactions, the catalytic activity should be related either to the number of active sites or to specific surface.
However, we were not able to determine one of these parameters after the catalytic reaction due to very low catalyst amounts used.
Therefore, the data on catalytic activity of different vanadium oxides in Fig. 1 should be treated with care keeping in the mind strong catalyst restructuring under reaction conditions. In contrast to the catalytic activity, it is not important to know the number of active catalyst sites or specific surface area for calculating product selectivities. Therefore, we discuss below selectivityconversion relationships of individual vanadium oxides in the ODP reaction using O2 and N2O. The respective results are presented in Fig. 2.
One of the most important observations from this figure is the fact, that the selectivityconversion plot is not influenced by the initial catalyst composition (V2O3, VO2 and V2O5), but by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 or N2O). At comparable Fig. 1. Propane conversion vs. contact time (W/F) over V2O5 (&, &), VO2 (,) and V2O3 (*, *) (T = 773 K, C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 or C3H8/N2O/ Ne = 40/40/20).

100 degrees of propane conversion, propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2. This coincides with our previous analysis of the ODP reaction over differently loaded VOx/ MCM-41 [6] and VOx/g-Al2O3 [5] catalytic materials. A possible explanation for the observed phenomena is given in Section 3.3.
For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%.
These findings evidence that consecutive propene oxidation to COx is suppressed upon replacing O2 with N2O.
The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent.
The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides. In order to identify possible reasons for the observed phenomena, a detailed catalyst characterization study was performed. The results are presented and discussed below.
3.2. Influence of reaction conditions on catalyst

101 and in situ XRD. The advantages of the applied in situ UVvis and in situ XRD methods are that they were performed under real and controlled reaction conditions,i.e.
T = 773 K,
Ptotal = 1 bar and the degree of C3H8 and O2 (N2O) conversion below 5 and 10%, respectively. This experimental restriction is important, in order to ensure a near to uniform composition of the studied catalysts along the catalyst bed. The applied in situ UVvis and in situ XRD techniques provide information on reaction-induced changes of bulk composition in the depth range of few micro-, and millimeters, respectively. The more surface sensitive XPS measurements were conducted ex situ,since in situ XPS requires low pressures, i.e. very different from the reaction conditions. In the following two sections, reaction- induced changes in the bulk and near surface composition of V2O5, VO2, and V2O3 are discussed.
3.2.1. Bulk composition and structure
Fig. 3 summarises in situ XRD patterns of fresh vanadium oxides and after 4 h on stream in C3H8O2 and C3H8N2O reaction mixtures at 773 K. The detected phases and their relative ratios are presented in Table 1. From Fig. 3 it is clear that the bulk state of V2O5 is not significantly changed during propane oxidation with O2. This observation disagrees with previously reported results of 1-penten oxidation over V2O5 [9].
However, these authors [9] did not report the degrees of 1- penten and oxygen consumption. They mentioned only that oxygen was not completely consumed. If the ratio of 1-pentane/ oxygen at the reactor outlet deviated strongly from that at the reactor inlet, significant catalyst restructuring in the down stream position of the catalyst would be expected, which would explain the deviation from our results. In contrast to V2O5, VO2 and V2O3 are restructured under the conditions of the ODP reaction with O2 towards a more oxidized state (Fig. 3).
Crystalline V2O5 and V3O7 were identified in the two latter samples, with the former being the main phase (Table 1).
When the ODP reaction was performed with N2O,significant bulk restructuring was observed in all individual vanadium oxides. As shown in Fig. 3 and in Table 1, V2O3 is transformed to VO2 and V3O7. The relative ratio of these phases was calculated to be 20. The same dominating phase was also identified in VO2 after the catalytic reaction with N2O. Fig. 3 nicely demonstrates that V2O5 undergoes a reductive trans- formation to VO2, V3O7 and V3O5 during the ODP reaction at 773 K with N2O. Thus, it is obvious that the bulk composition of V2O3, VO2 and V2O5 is strongly changed under conditions of the ODP reaction (Table 1); at low degrees of propane conversion (<5%) the steady-state bulk composition of the studied vanadium oxides is determined by the nature of oxidizing agent (O2 or N2O).Further insights into the above-described phase transforma- tions were derived from the temporal changes in the XRD patters during the ODP reaction with various oxidizing agents.Selected results for V2O3, VO2 and V2O5 are presented in Fig. 4. The respective crystalline phase compositions are shown in Table 2. For V2O5 in a C3H8N2O flow at 773 K, the main phase changes occur already during the first 15 min on stream.Fig. 3.

102 V2O3 in a C3H8O2 flow at 773 K transforms initially to VO2,which is further converted to V3O7 and V2O5. This proceeds during ca. 1 h on stream. In comparison to V2O3, VO2 transforms slower to V3O7 and V2O5 in a C3H8O2 flow at
773 K.
In situ UVvis analysis, which provides information on the oxidation state of vanadium species within few micro-meters in the catalyst bulk, confirms a higher reduction degree of near surface vanadium under C3H8N2O conditions as compared to C3H8O2 conditions. Fig. 5 exemplifies in situ UVvis spectra of V2O5 at 773 K under different reaction conditions: (a) in an O2 flow (O2/Ne = 20/80), (b) in a C3H8O2 flow (C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/20/40) for 60 min and (c) in a C3H8N2O flow (C3H8/ N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) for 10 min and (d) in C3H8N2O flow (C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) for 90 min. It is important to stress,that during these experiments the position on the UVvis fiber,total flow, reaction temperature and pressure were not changed.
Therefore, the discussed changes in the UVvis spectra relate exclusively to the change of the catalyst under different reaction conditions. To keep the propane conversion under 5%, we had to use only 10 mg of V2O5 (fraction 0.20.3 mm) and mixed it with quartz of the same particle size, slightly degrading the quality of the UVvis spectra. Fig. 5 shows the KubelkaMunk function of V2O5 under O2 and C3H8O2 flows. The Kubelka Munk function in the range of 600800 nm in spectra (a) and (b) is lower than in a C3H8N2O flow (spectra (c) and (d)). From spectra (c) and (d) in Fig. 5, we can conclude that there is no significant difference between spectra of V2O5 after 10 and 90 min on stream under C3H8N2O conditions. If coke deposits would be responsible for the absorbance between 600 and 800 nm, an increase in the absorbance is expected with time on stream.

103 very similar. Moreover, the ex situ XPS study does not reveal any difference in coke deposits between samples after C3H8O2 and C3H8N2O interactions at 773 K. Based on these facts we suggest that the difference between the UVvis spectra in C3H8O2 and C3H8N2O flows indicates different reduction degrees of vanadium under the various reaction conditions, with a stronger reduced one observed for the C3H8N2O mixture.
Moreover, since the UVvis spectra of V2O5 after 10 and 90 min on stream in an C3H8N2O flow at 773 K are very similar to each other, but different from one in O2 flow we can conclude that reduction of near surface layers of V2O5 is a rapid process. This result nicely agrees with our time-resolved XRD results in Fig. 4, and Table 2, where the reduction of V2O5 to V3O7 and V3O5 occurred within less than 15 min.
On this stage it is important to note that the above discussion was related to the bulk properties of vanadium oxides.
However, the catalytic processes occur on the catalyst surface.
Therefore, it is also essential to elucidate how the near surface composition of V2O3, VO2 and V2O5 is influenced by the oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O) during the ODP reaction. To this end we applied ex-situ XPS. The obtained results are presented and discussed in the next section.
3.2.2. Oxidation state of near surface vanadium
The XP spectra of the V 2p and O 1s regions of fresh individual vanadium oxides and after performing the ODP reaction with O2 or N2O at 773 K are compared in Fig. 6. All spectra were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. During the XPS measurements no further reduction of V species was observed under the chosen conditions (Iem = 10 mA; U = 10 kV).Correspondingtothe reaction-inducedbulkchanges of individual vanadium oxides (Fig. 3), also the near surface oxidation state of vanadium changed during the ODP reaction (Fig. 6, Table 3). The near surface changes are determined by the nature of the applied oxidizing agent (O2 or N2O). In order to quantify the influence of the oxidizing agent on the oxidation state of vanadium under the ODP conditions, the valence state of vanadium was determined taking the V 2p3/2 peak into account.
To this end, the V 2p3/2 peaks were fitted with Gaussian Lorentzian curves after Shirley background subtraction. V5+, V4+, and V3+ oxidation states were identified at V 2p3/2 electron binding energies of 517.2, 516.0, and 514.0 eV, respectively. The presently assigned binding energies for V5+ and V4+ of 517.2 and
516.0 eV are in agreement with previously published values for
V2O5 and VO2 [1518]. The electron binding energy of the state correlated with V3+ in the present work is ca. 1 eV lower than the values known from the literature for V2O3 [17,19]. However, it should be stressed that the literaturevalues were obtained for thin V2O3 films on metallic substrate and V2O3 created via reduction of V5+ or V4+ by electron bombardment. The latter samples were free of water or hydroxyls, which can influence the binding energy of V3+. These adsorbates, however, do really exist in our sample used for the ODP reaction at 773 K. This might be a reason for the deviation of the presently determined binging energy for V3+ from that previously reported for ideal systems [17,19]. The relative concentrations of V5+, V4+, and V3+ are compared in Table 3 for fresh (non-used for the ODP reaction) vanadium oxidesandsamplesusedfortheODPreactionat773 K with O2 and N2O. For all the fresh vanadium oxides, V5+ is the main vanadium state. The presence of V5+ in the fresh VO2 and V2O3 may be related to the oxidation of near surface layers with Fig. 6.

104 air. Small amounts of V4+ were observed in fresh VO2 and V2O3.
V3+ was not identified in the fresh samples, even in V2O3.
However, at least 8% near surface vanadium cations are stabilized in trivalent oxidation state (V3+), when vanadium oxides were used for the ODP reaction at 773 K using N2O as oxidant. Additionally, ca. 3040% of total near surface vanadium species have a valence state of +4. When O2 was used for the ODP reaction, no vanadium in trivalent or tetravalent oxidation states was observed. This statement is independent of the initial oxidation state of the samples, i.e. for V2O5, VO2, and V2O3.
Based on the XPS results in Table 3, average oxidation states of near surface vanadium under the ODP conditions with O2 and N2O were estimated and compared in Fig. 7 to respective values obtained by XRD. This figure clearly illustrates that the average oxidation states of near surface vanadium species under the ODP conditions with O2 and N2O are ca. 5 and 4.4,respectively. The respective values for bulk vanadium species are 5 and 3.9 (Fig. 7). The slightly higher average oxidation state of near surface vanadium species as compared to bulk vanadium species (4.4 versus 3.9) after the ODP with N2O may be due to the fact that for ex situ XPS tests, the samples contacted to air at room temperature and, therefore, are slightly oxidized. Summarizing, it is obvious that both near surface and bulk vanadium species are more oxidized in the presence of O2 than with N2O.
3.3. Influence of oxidizing agent on catalytic performance
and catalyst composition The section evaluates the role of reaction-induced changes of vanadium oxides and the nature of oxygen species (lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen) in tuning propene selectivity in the ODP reaction. In the beginning, the results of steady-state ODP studies over individual vanadium oxides with O2 and N2O as well as of detailed catalyst characterization by ex situ XPS,in situ UVvis, and in situ XRD are discussed together, in order to elaborate the influence of reaction conditions on catalyst composition (surface and bulk) and respective changes in catalytic performance. Hereafter, the results of isotopically labeled experiments are presented and discussed with the aim to identify selective and non-selective reaction pathways.
3.3.1. Reduction degree and catalytic performance
The XRD and XPS results in Fig. 3, and Fig. 6 as well as in Table 1, and Table 3 evidence that irrespective of the initial state of the vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2 or V2O5), the oxidation state of vanadium (near surface and bulk) is close to +5 after ODP using O2. The observed structural changes of the individual vanadium oxides under the ODP conditions are Table 3 Near surface composition derived from ex situ XPS analysis of different vanadium oxides in fresh state as well as after ODP with O2 and N2O at T = 773 K (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(O2) < 10%, X(N2O) < 10%) Catalysts Near surface vanadium concentration from ex situ XPS Fresh After ODP with O2 After ODP with N2O C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/10/50 C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20

105 explained as follows. According to the well-accepted Mars-van Krevelen sequence of the ODP reaction over vanadia-based catalysts [5,2025], C3H8 removes lattice oxygen from vanadium oxides yielding C3H6, H2O and a reduced vanadium center (Eq. (1)). Subsequently, the lattice oxygen is replenished by gas-phase oxygen in a re-oxidation step (Eq. (2)). Since the average oxidation state of near surface and bulk vanadium species is close to +5 for all the individual vanadium oxides having been applied for the ODP reaction with O2 at 773 K (Fig. 7), it is concluded that the reaction pathway in Eq. (2) is faster than in Eq. (1), i.e. oxidation of reduced vanadium by O2 is faster than reduction of oxidized vanadium by C3H8:
C3H8  O
! kC3H8C3H6  H2O (1)
O2  2
! kO2 2O (2)
N2O
! kN2OO  N2 (3) where [O] stands for lattice oxygen of vanadium oxide and [ ] corresponds to an anion vacancy after removing of lattice oxygen from the oxide.
Upon replacing of O2 by N2O, the average oxidation state of bulk and near surface vanadium after the ODP reaction decreases to between +3.9 and +4.4 (Fig. 7). At this stage it is important to stress that the amount of oxygen atoms in the C3H8O2 and C3H8N2O feed mixtures was the same (see Section 2.2). Taking into account this experimental condition,the lower oxidation state of bulk and near surface vanadium in the presence of N2O as compared to O2 is related to the lower oxidizing ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced vanadium oxides (Eq. (3)). This conclusion is in agreement with our previous results for VOx/MCM-41 [6] and VOx/g-Al2O3 [5] catalytic materials, where lower rates of propane consumption were found with N2O than with O2.
The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]. In order to derive further insights into the role of O2 in COx formation, catalytic tests were performed using a C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/10/50 reaction feed, i.e. oxygen concentration was reduced as compared to the standard reaction feed (C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40). These experiments are also crucial for elucidating the effect of the degree of reduction of vanadium species on the ODP performance. As shown in Table 3 the relative concentration of V5+ decreases from 100 to 66%, while that of V4+ and V3+ increases from 0 to 26% and from 0 to 8%, respectively, when the ODP reaction is performed with a partial oxygen pressure of 10 kPa instead of 20 kPa.
Similar relative concentrations of near surface vanadium were found after performing the ODP reaction over V2O5 with N2O (Table 3). Hence, the reduction degree of near surface vanadium in V2O5 was similar in C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/10/50 reaction feeds.
The selectivityconversion plots over V2O5 and V2O3 with the two feeds containing 10 and 20 vol.% of oxygen are shown in Fig. 9. The respective data for an N2O-containg feed are also Fig. 8. Suggested reaction scheme of propane oxidation with O2 and N2O. Solid lines represent major reaction pathways, while dotted lines indicate minor reaction pathways.

106 presented for comparison. It is clearly seen that the CO selectivity is not significantly influenced by oxygen partial pressures (Fig. 9(b)). However, there is a significant difference in CO2 selectivity between the O2- and N2O-containing feeds.
In contrast to the CO selectivity, the CO2 selectivity at a zero degree of propane conversion decreases strongly when the oxygen partial pressure is reduced (Fig. 9(a)). This result indicates that the relevance of a direct route (not via consecutive propene oxidation) of propane oxidation to CO2 is a function of the oxygen partial pressure: the higher the pressure, the higher the contribution of the direct propane oxidation to total CO2 production, and the lower the consecutive propene oxidation to
CO2. In agreement with this statement, the CO2 selectivity
increases with an increased propane conversion stronger for reaction with the C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/10/50 reaction feed (Fig. 9(a)) as compared to the C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feed. Again as for the CO selectivity, the CO2 selectivity is lower with N2O than with O2. The above results clearly show that oxygen partial pressure plays an important role for deriving low COx selectivity. However, the nature of oxidizing agent (O2 versus N2O) has a stronger influence on COx selectivity than the variation of the partial pressure of O2.In order to quantify the effect of oxidizing agent (N2O and O2) and the oxygen partial pressure on the initial (at zero degree of propane conversion) propene selectivity and on the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation, the respective selectivityconversion plots (e.g. Fig. 2(a)) were treated according to the following procedure. In the range of propane conversion from 0 to 7%, propene selectivity was approximated by a linear function of propane conversion (Eq. (4)): SC3H6  SC3H6initial  A  XC3H8 (4) where S(C3H6)initial is the initial propene selectivity and A corresponds to the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation.
The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds. When the oxygen partial pressure decreases from 20 to 10 kPa, the initial propene selectivity increases and is close to that with 40 kPa of N2O.
However, the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation is not influenced by the oxygen partial pressures. Consecutive propene oxidation is significantly lower when O2 is replaced by
N2O. Thus, the following important effects of oxidizing agent
on the ODP reaction were established:(i) direct C3H8 combustion to CO2 is strongly inhibited in the presence of N2O and by reducing oxygen partial pressure;(ii) initial C3H6 selectivity is improved by using N2O instead of O2, or by reducing O2 partial pressure;(iii) the decrease in C3H6 selectivity with increasing degree of C3H8 conversion is less marked with N2O than with O2- containing feeds.
Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below.
3.3.2. Oxygen species in the ODP reaction
The transients of oxygen isotopic traces upon switching from 16O2/Ar/Ne = 2/96/2 to 18O2/Ar/Ne = 2/96/2 over V2O5 are shown in Fig. 10(a). The concentration of non-labeled oxygen (16O2) decreases, while the concentration of labeled oxygen (18O2) increases. No 18O16O was detected over V2O5.
The absence of 18O16O and the presence of 16O2 in the 18O2- containing feed indicate irreversible dissociative oxygen adsorption [21]. However, traces of 18O16O were observed,when oxygen isotopic exchange was studied in the presence of
C3H8. In this experiment, isotopic transients were monitored
upon switching from a C3H8/16O2/Ar/Ne = 4/2/92/2 mixture to a C3H8/18O2/Ar/Ne = 4/2/92/2. The respective results are presented in Fig. 10(b). The presence of 18O16O implies that oxygen interaction with V2O5 in the presence of C3H8 occurs dissociatively and reversible. The difference in oxygen distribution in the absence and presence of C3H8 may be Table 4 Initial C3H6 selectivity (S(C3H6)initial) and catalytic ability (A) for consecutive C3H6 oxidation (T = 773 K, C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40, C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/10/50, C3H8/ N2O/Ne = 40/40/20) according to Eq.

107 related to the fact that anion vacancies are created in the presence of C3H8. These reduced vanadium are active for O2 adsorption, which may occur differently as compared to the interaction with oxidized V2O5.
For analyzing the possible role of lattice and adsorbed oxygen species in CO2 formation, two different isotopic experiments were performed over V2O3: a) V2 16O3 was heated in a Ne flow up to 773 K followed by feeding a C3H8/18O2/Ar/ Ne = 4/2/92/2 mixture for 15 min (Fig. 11(a)) and b) hereafter a C3H8/16O2/Ar/Ne = 4/2/92/2 mixture was fed over the catalyst at the same temperature for ca. 2 h followed by switching to the reaction feed with isotopically labeled oxygen (C3H8/18O2/Ar/ Ne = 4/2/92/2) (Fig. 11(b)). Experiment b was also performed over V2O5 (Fig. 11(c)).
The discussion of transient responses in Fig. 11 starts with the description of the results of C3H818O2 interactions with fresh V2O3 containing 16O (experiment (a), Fig. 11(a)). Three differently labeled carbon dioxides were observed: C16O2, C16O18O, and C18O2. It has to be highlighted that in all the experiments, concentrations of isotopically labeled carbon dioxides were normalized with respect to steady-state concentration of C16O2 after 2 h on stream in a C3H8/16O2/ Ar/Ne = 4/2/92/2 flow.
Since catalyst deactivation was observed during 2 h on stream, the total concentration of C18O2, C18O16O and C16O2 during first 15 min on stream in Fig. 11(a) is higher than one. C16O2 has the lowest concentration among all isotopically labeled carbon dioxides.
The concentrations of C16O18O, and C18O2 are similar.
Moreover, the transient response of C16O2 decreases and approaches zero after 10 min on stream in the C3H8/18O2/Ar/ Ne = 4/2/92/2 mixture (Fig. 11(a)). The transients of C18O16O and 18CO2 fall slightly with time on stream, too. However, their concentrations are still high after 15 min on stream in the Fig. 10. Oxygen transients over V2O5 at 773 K upon switching: from 16O2/Ar/ Ne = 2/94/2 to 18O2/Ar/Ne = 2/94/2 (a) or from C3H8/16O2/Ar/Ne = 4/2/92/2 to C3H8/18O2/Ar/Ne = 4/2/92/2 (b).

108 C3H8/18O2/Ar/Ne = 4/2/92/2 flow. This result indicates that there are different reaction pathways leading to carbon dioxide.
In isotope experiments over V2O3 and V2O5 after 2 h on stream in a C3H8/16O2/Ar/Ne = 4/2/92/2 mixture (Fig. 11(b) and (c)), C18O16O and 18CO2 start to be formed immediately after switching from C3H8/16O2/Ar/Ne = 4/2/92/2 to C3H8/18O2/Ar/Ne = 4/2/92/2 mixture. The presence of 16O in C16O2, and C16O18O upon feeding C3H8/18O2/Ar/Ne flow indicates the participation of lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides in carbon dioxide formation. The transient response of C18O16O increases strongly with time approaching a maximum after ca. 5 min on stream followed by a slow decay, while the transient response of C18O2 increases considerably slower but con- tinuously. The permanent increase of C18O2 production and the decrease in C16O2 formation are attributed to replacing of non- labeled (16O) lattice oxygen in VOx species by labeled (18O) ones. However, the lattice oxygen is not the only species participating in carbon dioxide formation. It is suggested that adsorbed oxygen species contribute to carbon dioxide formation, too. This assumption is based on the following discussion.
Fig. 11(a) shows that the concentration of C18O2 and C16O18O is always higher than that of C16O2 even immediately (t  0) upon feeding the C3H8/18O2/Ar/Ne = 4/2/92/2 flow over V2O3 containing non-labeled (16O) oxygen. This means that either oxygen species formed from gas-phase 18O2 are more active for carbon dioxide formation than lattice oxygen (16O) of V2O3 or their concentration is higher. Another important observation is the difference in the temporal profiles of C16O2 and C16O18O in Fig. 11 for all experiments. These two isotopically labeled carbon dioxides contain 16O, which originates from the lattice of vanadium oxides. While the concentration of C16O2 drops to zero within first 1015 min on stream in the C3H8/18O2/Ar/Ne = 4/2/92/2 flow, the concen- trations of both C16O18O and C18O2 are much higher and similar to each other. Therefore, similar surface concentration of lattice 16O and 18O oxygen should be expected after 15 min on stream in the C3H8/18O2/Ar/Ne = 4/2/92/2 flow, if lattice oxygen would be the only species participating in carbon dioxide formation. In this case, C16O2 should be also observed over the same period of time as C16O18O, which is in contradiction to the results in Fig. 11. Thus, it is suggested that in addition to lattice oxygen adsorbed oxygen species should participate in carbon dioxide formation. This statement is supported by the catalytic results in Figs. 2 and 9. These figures clearly demonstrate that CO2 formation is considerably decreased upon replacing O2 by N2O or by decreasing O2 partial pressure. It is suggested that the decreased CO2 production upon reducing oxygen partial pressure in Fig. 9 is due to a decrease in concentration of adsorbed (non-selective) oxygen species. The effect of N2O on reduced CO2 production in Fig. 2 can be understood taking the below discussion into account.
According to Bielanski and Haber [8] O2 activation over reducible metal oxides occurs via a complex sequence of redox processes until O2 (lattice oxygen) is formed. This species actively participates in the ODP reaction over vanadium-based catalysts [5,8,20,22,27,28]. However, O2 is not the only species formed from O2. Adsorbed oxygen species were suggested as non-selective species for the ODP reaction over VMgO [29,30] and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 [25] catalytic materials. Density function theory calculations predict that gas-phase oxygen adsorbs molecularly over anion vacancy of reduced V2O5 [31,32]. This molecular adsorbed oxygen dissociates further yielding lattice oxygen species. In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O or O2. Hence,the stronger tendency towards COx formation in the presence of O2, as compared to N2O, is possibly related to the formation of adsorbed molecular oxygen on reduced VOx surface from gas- phase oxygen. However, in order to draw a definitive conclusion on the nature of selective and non-selective oxygen species in the ODP reaction, a deeper mechanistic analysis is required and is presently worked on.
4. Conclusions
Our mechanistic investigation of the ODP reaction with O2,18O2 and N2O over V2O3, VO2 and V2O5 by means of steady- state catalytic tests as well as in situ UVvis, in situ XRD and ex situ XPS analysis elucidated the importance of reaction- induced changes of the vanadium oxides for their catalytic performance. The obtained conclusions provided deeper insights into the vanadium oxides catalyzed ODP reaction.
The main conclusions are: In order to adequately establish structurereactivity relation- ships in the ODP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidisable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion;concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed are to be minimized.
Steady-state ODP product selectivities over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined by the nature of fresh vanadium oxide. This is governed by reaction- induced changes of the bulk and surface states of the oxides under the ODP conditions.
Bulk and near surface composition of V2O3, VO2 and V2O5 under the ODP conditions is controlled by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 or N2O). For an oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) containing mixture, vanadium species are stabilized in penta- and tetravalent oxidation states, with the former being the main one. The oxidation state of vanadium reduces in the presence of N2O.
The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation.
