[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
[2] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
[3] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
[4] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
[5] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
[6] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
[7] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
[8] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to N2O's lower ability to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The most significant enhancements in propylene selectivity were observed with catalysts containing bulk-like V2O5 species, with selectivity increasing up to three times. N2O's ability to maintain higher propylene selectivity over a wider range of propane conversion rates, compared to O2, is a significant advantage.
2.Various catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process with N2O as the oxidant, including VOx supported on gamma-alumina (VOx/g-Al2O3) and VOx supported on MCM-41 (VOx/MCM-41). These catalysts have demonstrated improved performance in terms of propylene selectivity when using N2O instead of O2.
3.Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process using N2O. The higher degree of catalyst reduction achieved with N2O can lead to structural changes in the catalyst, affecting its stability and activity over time. Strategies to address these limitations include optimizing the catalyst composition and structure to enhance stability under reducing conditions, developing methods to regenerate the catalyst, and exploring alternative catalysts that maintain high selectivity while being more resistant to deactivation.
4.Research directions to make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include:
   a. Developing new catalysts with improved stability and selectivity under N2O conditions.
   b. Investigating the role of oxygen species in the ODHP reaction and optimizing the catalyst to favor selective species.
   c. Studying the effect of reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, on catalyst performance and stability.
   d. Investigating the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants or in a cyclic process to improve overall efficiency and reduce N2O consumption.
   e. Developing methods to regenerate or recycle the catalyst to maintain its activity over extended periods.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被证明在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中比其他氧化剂如氧气(O2)提高了丙烯选择性。这种改进归因于N2O降低重新氧化还原的钒氧化物(VOx)物种的能力，导致更高的催化剂还原度。在含有类似V2O5物种的催化剂中观察到最显著的丙烯选择性增强，选择性增加高达三倍。与O2相比，N2O在更宽的丙烷转化率范围内保持更高的丙烯选择性，这是一个显著的优势。
2.在使用N2O作为氧化剂的ODHP过程中，已经使用了各种催化剂，包括支持在γ-氧化铝上的VOx(VOx/g-Al2O3)和MCM-41上的VOx(VOx/MCM-41)。当使用N2O代替O2时，这些催化剂在丙烯选择性方面表现出改进的性能。
3.催化剂失活和稳定性是使用N2O的ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O实现的更高催化剂还原度可能导致催化剂结构变化，影响其随时间的稳定性和活性。解决这些限制的策略包括优化催化剂组成和结构，以在还原条件下增强稳定性，开发催化剂再生方法，以及探索在保持高选择性的同时对失活更具抵抗力的替代催化剂。
4.使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用实施选项的研究方向包括：
   a.开发在N2O条件下具有改进稳定性和选择性的新催化剂。
