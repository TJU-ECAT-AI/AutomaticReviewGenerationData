[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
[2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
[3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
[4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."
[5] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

1.N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been shown to increase propene selectivity compared to O2. This is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species, resulting in a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The improved performance of N2O was most significant for catalysts with bulk-like V2O5 species, achieving up to three times higher propene selectivity.
2.Studies suggest a complex reaction scheme for the ODHP using either O2 or N2O, with direct propane oxidation to COx (mainly CO2) being more significant in the presence of O2 than N2O.
3.Higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all studied vanadium oxides.
4.The difference in catalytic performance between O2 and N2O may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2.
5.N2O tunes the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides, reducing direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2, as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx, compared to O2. The improved initial C3H6 selectivity is related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites, with higher reduction leading to higher selectivity. The nature of oxygen species from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation.

1.在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中,使用N2O作为氧化剂与O2相比,可以提高丙烯选择性。这归因于N2O较低的重新氧化还原VOx物种的能力,导致催化剂还原度更高。对于具有类似V2O5结构的催化剂,N2O的性能改善最为显著,丙烯选择性提高了三倍。
2.研究表明,使用O2或N2O进行ODHP反应具有复杂的反应方案,在O2存在下,直接丙烷氧化为COx(主要是CO2)比N2O更为显著。
3.对于所有研究的钒氧化物,N2O比O2实现了更高的初始丙烯选择性。
4.O2和N2O在催化性能上的差异可能部分与源自O2的活性氧物种的性质有关。
5.N2O调节了钒氧化物的催化性能,与O2相比,减少了直接C3H8氧化为CO和CO2,以及连续C3H6氧化为COx。提高的初始C3H6选择性与钒位点的还原度有关,还原度越高,选择性越高。源自O2和N2O的氧物种的性质不同,在连续C3H6和直接C3H8氧化中起作用。
