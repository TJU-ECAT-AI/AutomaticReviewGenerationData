[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
[2] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
[3] "The results in Table 4 indicate that a higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/ O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds."
[4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."

1.N2O has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to O2, with the most significant improvements observed for catalysts containing bulk-like V2O5 species. This is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species, resulting in a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O also reduces the importance of direct propane oxidation to COx, mainly CO2, compared to O2. Higher initial propene selectivity is achieved with N2O than with O2 for all studied vanadium oxides. The difference in catalytic performance between O2 and N2O may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2.
2.The various catalysts employed in the ODHP process include VOx/g-Al2O3 and VOx/MCM-41 materials, with the most significant improvements in propene selectivity observed for catalysts containing bulk-like V2O5 species.
3.Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges associated with the use of N2O in the ODHP process. The lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species, which is advantageous for propene selectivity, also leads to a higher degree of catalyst reduction and potential deactivation. Strategies to address these limitations could include the development of more stable catalysts, such as those with higher thermal stability or the use of promoters to enhance catalyst regeneration. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of catalyst deactivation and developing methods to mitigate these effects, such as optimizing reaction conditions or developing new catalyst formulations.

1.N2O已被证明在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中比O2提高了丙烯选择性，特别是对于含有类似V2O5的催化剂，这是由于N2O重新氧化还原VOx物种的能力较低，导致催化剂还原程度更高。N2O的使用也减少了与O2相比直接丙烷氧化为COx(主要是CO2)的重要性。与O2相比，所有研究的钒氧化物在使用N2O时都能获得更高的初始丙烯选择性。O2和N2O在钒氧化物催化性能上的差异可能部分与来自O2的活性氧物种的性质有关。
2.在ODHP过程中使用的各种催化剂包括VOx/g-Al2O3和VOx/MCM-41材料，其中含有类似V2O5的催化剂观察到丙烯选择性的最大改善。
3.催化剂失活和稳定性是N2O在ODHP过程中使用的关键挑战。N2O重新氧化还原VOx物种的能力较低，虽然有利于丙烯选择性，但也可能导致催化剂还原程度更高和潜在失活。解决这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂，如热稳定性更高的催化剂，或使用促进剂来增强催化剂再生。研究方向可以集中在理解催化剂失活的机制和开发方法来缓解这些影响，如优化反应条件或开发新的催化剂配方。

1.在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中,使用N2O作为氧化剂与O2相比,可以提高丙烯选择性。这归因于N2O较低的重新氧化还原VOx物种的能力,导致催化剂还原度更高。对于具有类似V2O5结构的催化剂,N2O的性能改善最为显著,丙烯选择性提高了三倍。
2.研究表明,使用O2或N2O进行ODHP反应具有复杂的反应方案,在O2存在下,直接丙烷氧化为COx(主要是CO2)比N2O更为显著。
3.对于所有研究的钒氧化物,N2O比O2实现了更高的初始丙烯选择性。
4.O2和N2O在催化性能上的差异可能部分与源自O2的活性氧物种的性质有关。
5.N2O调节了钒氧化物的催化性能,与O2相比,减少了直接C3H8氧化为CO和CO2,以及连续C3H6氧化为COx。提高的初始C3H6选择性与钒位点的还原度有关,还原度越高,选择性越高。源自O2和N2O的氧物种的性质不同,在连续C3H6和直接C3H8氧化中起作用。

1.N2O作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的氧化剂，与O2相比，可以提高丙烯的选择性。这是由于N2O对还原VOx物种的再氧化能力较低，导致催化剂还原度更高。N2O下ODHP性能的改善在具有类似V2O5结构的样品中最为显著，丙烯选择性可提高至三倍。使用N2O的ODHP反应方案复杂，涉及并行和连续步骤，直接丙烷氧化为COx(主要为CO2)的重要性低于O2。氧气分压在获得低COx选择性方面起着重要作用，但氧化剂的性质(O2与N2O)对COx选择性的影响大于氧气分压的变化。O2和N2O含ODHP进料在催化性能上的差异可能部分与源自O2的活性氧物种的性质有关。

[2] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
[3] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
[4] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
[5] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
[6] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
[7] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
[8] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O.

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to N2O's lower ability to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The most significant enhancements in propylene selectivity were observed with catalysts containing bulk-like V2O5 species, with selectivity increasing up to three times. N2O's ability to maintain higher propylene selectivity over a wider range of propane conversion rates, compared to O2, is a significant advantage.
2.Various catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process with N2O as the oxidant, including VOx supported on gamma-alumina (VOx/g-Al2O3) and VOx supported on MCM-41 (VOx/MCM-41). These catalysts have demonstrated improved performance in terms of propylene selectivity when using N2O instead of O2.
3.Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process using N2O. The higher degree of catalyst reduction achieved with N2O can lead to structural changes in the catalyst, affecting its stability and activity over time. Strategies to address these limitations include optimizing the catalyst composition and structure to enhance stability under reducing conditions, developing methods to regenerate the catalyst, and exploring alternative catalysts that maintain high selectivity while being more resistant to deactivation.
4.Research directions to make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include:
   a. Developing new catalysts with improved stability and selectivity under N2O conditions.
   b. Investigating the role of oxygen species in the ODHP reaction and optimizing the catalyst to favor selective species.
   c. Studying the effect of reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, on catalyst performance and stability.
   d. Investigating the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants or in a cyclic process to improve overall efficiency and reduce N2O consumption.
   e. Developing methods to regenerate or recycle the catalyst to maintain its activity over extended periods.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被证明在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中比其他氧化剂如氧气(O2)提高了丙烯选择性。这种改进归因于N2O降低重新氧化还原的钒氧化物(VOx)物种的能力，导致更高的催化剂还原度。在含有类似V2O5物种的催化剂中观察到最显著的丙烯选择性增强，选择性增加高达三倍。与O2相比，N2O在更宽的丙烷转化率范围内保持更高的丙烯选择性，这是一个显著的优势。
2.在使用N2O作为氧化剂的ODHP过程中，已经使用了各种催化剂，包括支持在γ-氧化铝上的VOx(VOx/g-Al2O3)和MCM-41上的VOx(VOx/MCM-41)。当使用N2O代替O2时，这些催化剂在丙烯选择性方面表现出改进的性能。
3.催化剂失活和稳定性是使用N2O的ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O实现的更高催化剂还原度可能导致催化剂结构变化，影响其随时间的稳定性和活性。解决这些限制的策略包括优化催化剂组成和结构，以在还原条件下增强稳定性，开发催化剂再生方法，以及探索在保持高选择性的同时对失活更具抵抗力的替代催化剂。
4.使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用实施选项的研究方向包括：
   a.开发在N2O条件下具有改进稳定性和选择性的新催化剂。
   b.研究氧气物种在ODHP反应中的作用，并优化催化剂以支持选择性物种。
   c.研究温度和压力等反应条件对催化剂性能和稳定性的影响。
   d.研究N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用或在循环过程中使用，以提高整体效率并减少N2O消耗。
   e.开发方法以再生或回收催化剂，以在延长的时间内保持其活性。

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to improve propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O can result in up to three times higher propylene selectivity compared to O2, especially when the catalyst contains bulk-like V2O5 species. N2O reduces the tendency for direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, leading to improved initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O also plays a role in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.
2.Various catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process with N2O as the oxidant, including vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) and vanadia-based materials supported on gamma-alumina (VOx/g-Al2O3) and MCM-41 (VOx/MCM-41). These catalysts show improved propylene selectivity when N2O is used instead of O2. The bulk and surface composition of the catalysts are influenced by the oxidant, with a higher degree of reduction observed in the presence of N2O.
3.Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process with N2O as the oxidant. The higher degree of reduction of vanadium species in the presence of N2O can lead to changes in the catalyst structure and composition, which may affect its stability and activity over time. Strategies to address these limitations include optimizing the catalyst formulation, improving the catalyst regeneration process, and developing more stable and active catalysts. Research directions could focus on understanding the role of different vanadium species in the ODHP reaction and developing catalysts with controlled reduction states to enhance propylene selectivity and stability.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被证明在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中提高丙烯选择性,与氧气(O2)等其他氧化剂相比。这种改进归因于N2O降低还原钒氧化物(VOx)物种的能力,导致催化剂还原度更高。使用N2O可以产生高达三倍的丙烯选择性,特别是当催化剂含有类似块状的V2O5物种时。N2O减少了直接丙烷燃烧和连续丙烯氧化为COx的倾向,从而提高了初始丙烯选择性。源自O2和N2O的氧物种的性质也在选择性和催化剂活性中发挥作用。
2.在ODHP过程中使用N2O作为氧化剂,已经使用了各种催化剂,包括钒氧化物(V2O3,VO2和V2O5)和基于钒的材料,如γ-氧化铝(VOx/g-Al2O3)和MCM-41(VOx/MCM-41)。当使用N2O代替O2时,这些催化剂显示出提高的丙烯选择性。催化剂的体相和表面组成受氧化剂的影响,在N2O存在下观察到更高的还原度。
3.催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中使用N2O作为氧化剂的关键挑战。在N2O存在下,钒物种的还原度更高,这可能导致催化剂结构和组成的改变,从而影响其随时间的稳定性和活性。解决这些限制的策略包括优化催化剂配方,改进催化剂再生过程,以及开发更稳定和更活跃的催化剂。研究方向可以集中在理解不同钒物种在ODHP反应中的作用,以及开发具有受控还原状态的催化剂,以增强丙烯选择性和稳定性。
