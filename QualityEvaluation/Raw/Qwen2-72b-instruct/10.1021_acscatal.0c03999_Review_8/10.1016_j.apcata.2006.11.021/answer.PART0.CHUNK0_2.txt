[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
[2] "The results in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O."
[3] "The results clearly show that oxygen partial pressure plays an important role for deriving low COx selectivity. However, the nature of oxidizing agent (O2 versus N2O) has a stronger influence on COx selectivity than the variation of the partial pressure of O2."
[4] "The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2."

1.N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity compared to O2. This is due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, resulting in a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The improved ODP performance with N2O was most significant for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species, with propene selectivity increasing up to three times. The reaction scheme for ODHP using N2O is complex, involving parallel and consecutive steps, with direct propane oxidation to COx being less significant than with O2. Oxygen partial pressure plays an important role in deriving low COx selectivity, but the nature of the oxidizing agent (O2 versus N2O) has a stronger influence on COx selectivity. The difference in catalytic performance between O2- and N2O-containing ODHP feeds may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2.

1.N2O作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的氧化剂，与O2相比，可以提高丙烯的选择性。这是由于N2O对还原VOx物种的再氧化能力较低，导致催化剂还原度更高。N2O下ODHP性能的改善在具有类似V2O5结构的样品中最为显著，丙烯选择性可提高至三倍。使用N2O的ODHP反应方案复杂，涉及并行和连续步骤，直接丙烷氧化为COx(主要为CO2)的重要性低于O2。氧气分压在获得低COx选择性方面起着重要作用，但氧化剂的性质(O2与N2O)对COx选择性的影响大于氧气分压的变化。O2和N2O含ODHP进料在催化性能上的差异可能部分与源自O2的活性氧物种的性质有关。
