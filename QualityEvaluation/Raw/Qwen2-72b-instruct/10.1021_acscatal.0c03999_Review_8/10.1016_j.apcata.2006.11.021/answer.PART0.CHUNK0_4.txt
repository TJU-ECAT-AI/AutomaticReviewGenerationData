[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/ g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
[2] "For both oxidizing agents, propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion. This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%."
[3] "The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent."
[4] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%."
[5] "Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides."
[6] "The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26]."
[7] "Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below."
[8] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity. It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to improve propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O can result in up to three times higher propylene selectivity compared to O2, especially when the catalyst contains bulk-like V2O5 species. N2O reduces the tendency for direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, leading to improved initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O also plays a role in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.
2.Various catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process with N2O as the oxidant, including vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) and vanadia-based materials supported on gamma-alumina (VOx/g-Al2O3) and MCM-41 (VOx/MCM-41). These catalysts show improved propylene selectivity when N2O is used instead of O2. The bulk and surface composition of the catalysts are influenced by the oxidant, with a higher degree of reduction observed in the presence of N2O.
3.Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process with N2O as the oxidant. The higher degree of reduction of vanadium species in the presence of N2O can lead to changes in the catalyst structure and composition, which may affect its stability and activity over time. Strategies to address these limitations include optimizing the catalyst formulation, improving the catalyst regeneration process, and developing more stable and active catalysts. Research directions could focus on understanding the role of different vanadium species in the ODHP reaction and developing catalysts with controlled reduction states to enhance propylene selectivity and stability.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被证明在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中提高丙烯选择性,与氧气(O2)等其他氧化剂相比。这种改进归因于N2O降低还原钒氧化物(VOx)物种的能力,导致催化剂还原度更高。使用N2O可以产生高达三倍的丙烯选择性,特别是当催化剂含有类似块状的V2O5物种时。N2O减少了直接丙烷燃烧和连续丙烯氧化为COx的倾向,从而提高了初始丙烯选择性。源自O2和N2O的氧物种的性质也在选择性和催化剂活性中发挥作用。
2.在ODHP过程中使用N2O作为氧化剂,已经使用了各种催化剂,包括钒氧化物(V2O3,VO2和V2O5)和基于钒的材料,如γ-氧化铝(VOx/g-Al2O3)和MCM-41(VOx/MCM-41)。当使用N2O代替O2时,这些催化剂显示出提高的丙烯选择性。催化剂的体相和表面组成受氧化剂的影响,在N2O存在下观察到更高的还原度。
3.催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中使用N2O作为氧化剂的关键挑战。在N2O存在下,钒物种的还原度更高,这可能导致催化剂结构和组成的改变,从而影响其随时间的稳定性和活性。解决这些限制的策略包括优化催化剂配方,改进催化剂再生过程,以及开发更稳定和更活跃的催化剂。研究方向可以集中在理解不同钒物种在ODHP反应中的作用,以及开发具有受控还原状态的催化剂,以增强丙烯选择性和稳定性。
