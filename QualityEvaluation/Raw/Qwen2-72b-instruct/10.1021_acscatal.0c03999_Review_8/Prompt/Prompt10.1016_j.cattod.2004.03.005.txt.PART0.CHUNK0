Catalysis Today 9192 (2004) 2731 Modification of active catalytic sites with N2O and CO2 as gas promoters during oxidation reactions
O. Demoulin, F. Dury, M. Navez, E.M. Gaigneaux, P. Ruiz
Unit de catalyse et de chimie des matriaux diviss, Universit catholique de Louvain, Croix du Sud 2/17, 1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium Available online 30 April 2004 Abstract The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively.
In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes. With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum. CO2 promotes total oxidation of methane. The dissociation of CO2 seems to be responsible for this promotion. The adjustment of the concentration of N2O and CO2 thus clearly appears as a promising tool to improve the selectivity of partial oxidation products and the energetic efficiency in combustion. 2004 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction
Dynamic aspects have to be taken into account in the de- sign of processes, in the modelling of the kinetics and in the design of catalysts [1]. The catalytic sites change in num- ber under the conditions of reaction. Selectivity is correlated with the oxidation state of sites during the catalytic reaction.
It is very difficult to maintain, in a controlled manner, the surface in a desired oxidation state without modifying the operating conditions (ratio of the partial pressures of oxy- gen and hydrocarbon in the gas feed, temperature, catalysts formulations, etc.). A new and promising approach to mas- ter the dynamic phenomena at the surface of oxides at work consists in the addition of gaseous dopes in the reaction gas feed. The efficiency of the reactor operation could be improved by injecting adequate amounts of dopes either in the feed or in different sections along the catalyst bed. This method is very attractive because it can be directly applied under presently operating reactors without any modification in the process. However, fundamental studies published in order to explain the role of these promoters in oxidation re- actions are scarce. A more detailed experimental approach Corresponding author.

In previous papers, investigating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on NiMoO4 cat- alysts in the presence of CO2 and N2O used as dopes, we have shown that CO2 maintains Mo in a higher oxidation state [2,3]. On the contrary, N2O inhibits such oxidation,promoting the reduction to Mo5+. CO2 increases conversion and, thus, favours non selectivity; on the contrary, N2O de- creases conversion and increases selectivity. In both cases,the consumption of oxygen decreases. Contrarily to what is traditionally believed, CO2 is not inert in the oxidation reaction. Oxygen species produced by its dissociation can modify the oxidation state of the atoms on the surface of the catalysts and can directly participate in the oxidation of the hydrocarbon [24].
In this paper, the scope of previous results is extended: (i) study of the role of N2O in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of a different catalyst, namely a complex biphasic catalyst (NiMoO4 mechanically mixed with -Sb2O4) and (ii) investigation of the influence of CO2 in the total combustion of methane. The first system has been considered because it was previously demonstrated that -Sb2O4 controls the number of selective sites (probably via spillover oxygen) of active oxide phases during the ox- idation reaction [1]. The second system is studied because,in catalytic combustion reactions, a high amount of CO2 is 0920-5861/$  see front matter  2004 Elsevier B.V.

produced during the reaction and it has been thus suggested that CO2 would act as an inhibitor of the reaction [5]. Cat- alysts were characterised by BET, XRD and XPS.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
Nickel molybdate was prepared by precipitation of a so- lution containing nickel nitrate and ammonium heptamolyb- date following a procedure described elsewhere [2,3]. Two different batches (Batch A and B) were used. -Sb2O4 was obtained by calcination of Sb2O3 under static air at 773 K overnight. The mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 was ob- tained mixing mechanically 50 wt.% of each oxide in a sus- pension of n-pentane and then dried at 383 K overnight. No calcination was performed with the mixture.
The ceria-zirconia mixed oxides supports were synthe- sised by the citrate method, which is fully detailed in [6].
Compounds such as Ce0.37Zr0.63O2, Ce0.70Zr0.30O2 and Ce0.91Zr0.09O2 were prepared in this way. These supports were then impregnated with a palladium containing solution (Pd(NH3)4Cl2Â·H2O) by the wetness incipient method [7].
2.2. Catalytic test
2.2.1. Test in the presence and absence of N2O
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) was per- formed in a conventional pyrex fixed-bed micro-reactor (i.d. = 8 mm) operated at atmospheric pressure with cata- lyst powder (particles diameter between 200 and 315 m,250, 500 or 1000 mg). Both the concentrations of O2 and propane in the feed were 10 vol.%. Helium was the carrier gas. The total flow rate was set at 30 ml/min. Catalytic ac- tivity was measured in the absence and in the presence of 300 ppm of N2O introduced as gas dope in the feed. The flow of He was balanced so as to ensure that the total gas flow remained unchanged. Temperature was 723 K. Anal- ysis of reactants and products was performed by on-line gas chromatography [3]. The measured performances were accurate within ranges of about 1% (in relative) for the con- versions of propane and oxygen and within ranges of about 8% (in relative) for the yields in propylene and CO2. The range of accuracy on the selectivity was thus about 10% (in relative).

2.2.2. Test in the presence and absence of CO2
Combustion of methane was performed in a conventional fixed-bed micro-reactor (stainless steel: i.d. = 8 mm) oper- ated at atmospheric pressure, into which the catalyst (par- ticles diameter between 100 and 315 m, 320 mg) was in- troduced. The total flow rate of the reactants mixture was 100 ml/min and helium was used as carrier gas. Two kinds of tests were performed: (1) using 1 ml/min of CH4, 10 ml/min of O2, balanced with He (89 ml/min) and (2) test in the presence of 3% of CO2 in the gaseous reactants feed with 1 ml/min of CH4, 10 ml/min of O2 and 3 ml/min of CO2,balanced with He (86 ml/min). The reaction was run be- tween 473 and 723 K. The analysis of reactants and products was performed by on-line gas chromatography. The mea- sured performances were accurate within a range of about 1% (in relative) for the conversions of methane and oxygen and within a range of about 4% (in relative) for the yields in CO2.
3. Results
3.1. Catalytic performances
3.1.1. Addition of N2O in the feed
Pure -Sb2O4 is completely inert. In both tests, the amount of NiMoO4 is the same. Compared to the results observed using pure NiMoO4, it is observed that the addi- tion of -Sb2O4 induces an important modification in the catalytic performances of NiMoO4 (Table 1): (i) a signifi- cant decrease in the conversion of propane (46%), (ii) a decrease in the yield in propylene (21%), (iii) a strong increase in the selectivity of propylene (+45%), (iv) a sig- nificant decrease in the conversion of oxygen (41%), (v) an important decrease in the yield of CO2 (60%) and in the selectivity in CO2 (27%). Clearly, -Sb2O4 inhibits non-selective sites, increasing the selectivity.
Taking into account the precision in the measurements, in- troduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes.
When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged. For pure NiMoO4, addition of 300 ppm

ODP on pure NiMoO4 and on NiMoO4 +-Sb2O4 mixture in the absence and in the presence of 300 ppm of N2O. NiMoO4 is from Batch B. Temperature 723 K. In all cases propane 10%, oxygen 10% and balance helium. X = conversion, Y = yield. S = selectivity. In parenthesis, changes when comparing tests with and without -Sb2O4 and in the presence and absence of N2O. Numbers in parenthesis correspond to the difference of performances compared to the previous line (test).
N2O leads to (Table 2): (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an increase in the selectivity to propylene (+32%), (iii) a decrease in both the conversion of oxygen (19%) and the yield of CO2 (21%).
A lack in the carbon balance was observed. The sum of percentages of selectivity to propylene and CO2 is in general about 80%. However, in some cases, values as low as 50% were observed. The values of selectivity in propylene are in the average of values observed in the literature for the ODP on oxide catalysts with this degree of conversion. A lack in the oxygen balance was also observed. Both results suggest that some propane is probably converted into an oxygenated product. No coke formation was observed. The high consumption of oxygen could confirm this fact. We have not observed CO formation during analysis. In fact, CO is easily oxidised to CO2 on NiMoO4 catalysts. A small Fig. 1.

However the area of this peak was not reproducible enough and very difficult to quantify. Experiments have been performed under low conversion of propane, making the analysis of products more difficult. Other possibilities are the formation of an alcohol, an acid, an aldehyde, etc. As the main aim of our investigation was to study changes in conversion, yield and selectivity of the products due to the introduction of N2O during the catalytic reaction, we have not insisted further in their identification.
3.1.2. Addition of CO2 in the feed
The addition of 3% of CO2 into the gaseous feed leads to an increase of the catalytic activity of the various catalysts tested. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1, the methane conversion 30

was higher for every catalyst in the presence of CO2 at any temperature, except at 773 K for the palladium supported on Ce0.91Zr0.09O2 mixed oxide, where the conversion re- mained unchanged. In terms of T50 values (temperature nec- essary to reach 50% of methane conversion), it appears that the addition of CO2 allows to decrease this value by 10 K in the case of Pd/Ce0.37Zr0.63O2 (808 K versus 818 K) and Pd/Ce0.91Zr0.09O2 (788 K versus 798 K) and even by 35 K for the Pd/Ce0.70Zr0.30O2 catalyst (728 K versus 763 K).
3.2. Characterisation of the catalysts
3.2.1. Addition of N2O in the feed
Principal conclusions of these analyses are: (i) the fresh NiMoO4 sample has a specific area value of 58 m2/g. After the catalytic reactions in the presence or absence of N2O,the specific area of NiMoO4 drops very similarly for all tests to about 39 m2/g. The surface area of -Sb2O4 (1 m2/g) re- mains unchanged after test. XRD patterns are the same, in- dependently of the presence or absence of N2O. The XPS results indicated that the binding energies are (almost) iden- tical for the fresh NiMoO4, -Sb2O4, the mixture and the samples recovered after catalytic test. Ni/Mo XPS atomic ratio = 1.18, indicated an enrichment of the surface in Ni.
The fresh NiMoO4 and the NiMoO4+-Sb2O4 mixture were fully oxidised (no Mo5+ is observed). There is no indication of carbide species of Ni or of Mo formed at the surface of the NiMoO4 catalysts during the test. No significant differ- ences in the atomic ratios were observed between the sam- ples. A significant difference concerns the oxidation state of Mo. Mixtures are reduced after reaction. Indeed, XPS anal- ysis showed that the quantity of Mo6+ decreases and that of Mo5+ increases in the presence of N2O. For the NiMoO4 and the mixture recovered after the addition of 300 ppm of N2O, the amount of Mo5+ was about 0.3% of the total Mo.
This suggests that, in the presence of N2O, molybdenum is slightly reduced. More details can be found in [3].
3.2.2. Addition of CO2 in the feed
XRD analyses are the same for catalysts in the presence and in the absence of CO2. The BET surface area also re- mains unchanged. The XPS analyses of the samples after test, both with and without the addition of 3% of CO2 into the feed, did not show any difference either in the binding energies (BE) of the different elements or in the Pd/(Ce+Zr) Table 3 XPS results of various catalysts after test, both in the absence (CH4/O2/He = 1/10/89, v/v/vv) and in the presence of 3% of CO2 in the reactants mixture (CH4/O2/CO2/He = 1/10/3/86 v/v/v/v) Low BE O 1s/O (%) Low BE O 1s/(Ce + Zr) Without CO2 With 3% of CO2 Without CO2 With 3% of CO2 Pd/Ce0.70Zr0.30O2

However, in- teresting information comes from the analysis of the O 1s peak. Two kinds of oxygen O 1s species could be detected at the surface of the ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts. The first one (low BE) is centred at around 529.5 eV and would be bound to Ce atoms whereas the other one (high BE) is lo- cated above 530.5 eV and is probably linked to other atoms like C or Zr. After reaction in the presence of CO2, the pro- portion of low BE O 1s species seems to increase (between 3 and 17.5%) (Table 3). It is worth noting that this enhance- ment is more important on the most activated system by the presence of CO2, i.e. the Pd/Ce0.70Zr0.30O2 (about 20%).
Similar conclusion is obtained if the amount of these low BE O 1s species is reported to the overall metallic content of the support.
3.3. Interpretation of the catalytic test
3.3.1. Addition of N2O
The results observed with the mixture -Sb2O4+NiMoO4 are similar and confirm those observed with pure NiMoO4.
Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective. We have suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the oxi- dation rate of the catalysts [3,4]. This would account for the decrease in propane conversion, in O2 consumption and in the yield in CO2 observed in the mixture. When -Sb2O4 is added to pure NiMoO4 or when N2O is introduced in the feed with pure NiMoO4 (Tables 1 and 2), it is observed that the selectivity to propylene increases, the conversions of propane and of oxygen decrease and the yield in CO2 decreases. These results could indicate that -Sb2O4 and N2O could probably play the same role, namely, control- ling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction, inhibit- ing non-selective sites. Previous studies [1] demonstrated that, working with pure molybdenum oxide (MoO3), the key to maintain high catalytic performances (high selectivity in partial oxidation, low formation of CO2) is to stabilise the surface of molybdenum oxide in a sub-oxide close to the sto- ichiometry of Mo18O52. This reduced state can be obtained when -Sb2O4 is present in contact with MoO3. Marsvan Krevelen mechanism considers that the hydrocarbon is ox- idised incorporating oxygen from the outermost layer of the oxide, the oxide becoming reduced as a consequence.
O. Demoulin et al. / Catalysis Today 9192 (2004) 2731
31 Molecular oxygen from the reaction gas then reoxidises the catalytic surface. It is well-established that, in general, the reoxidation step of the cycle is slower than the reduction one. Hence, the surface gets globally reduced with succes- sive catalytic cycles. Pure MoO3 undergoes a deep reduction and loss of activity. In the presence of -Sb2O4, selectiv- ity increases. The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products. During reaction MoO3 in mixture with -Sb2O4 is composed of a core of MoO3 and a superficial layer possessing the stoichiometry of weakly reduced Mo (Mo18O52) [1]. Taking these results into ac- count, it could be suggested that the role of N2O could be the same. N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction. These results sup- port the fact that a more reduced oxidation state of atoms at the surface of the catalysts could increase selectivity and that this state could be obtained by adding an oxide phase,which produces spillover oxygen or by adding N2O as gas dope in the feed. The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture.
In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4.
3.3.2. Addition of CO2
The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reac- tion of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium sup- ported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2. XPS results seem to give an attempt of explana- tion for this activation in the presence of CO2. According to the XPS results, there is an enrichment in low BE oxy- gen species of the ceria-zirconia compound when CO2 is present. As a preliminary explanation, it could be suggested that these oxygen species would come from the dissocia- tion of some CO2 molecules at the surface of the catalyst,which furnishes some activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) which, in turn, could either help to oxidise the CH4 molecules or improve the oxidation rate of catalysts by mod- ifying its oxidation state and increasing the overall activity of the catalyst. Indeed, it has recently been shown, using Raman spectroscopy under operando conditions, that, in the case of Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, the most active catalyst is ob- tained when palladium is working in a highly oxidised state [7]. One should notice that the enhancement in low BE oxy- gen species is more important on the most activated system by the presence of CO2 (Pd/Ce0.70Zr0.30O2). This last ob- servation seems to support our interpretation. However this observation has to be verified further. The observed effect of CO2 could be in contradiction with previous results pre- sented in the literature [5,8] which showed that CO2 does not modify the catalytic performances of Pd/-Al2O3 cata- lysts. The explanation of this apparent contradiction is that the role of CO2 depends on the nature of the catalysts (more precisely on the nature of the support), as is discussed else- where [9]. The important point to underline is that CO2 could be used to improve the efficiency of catalytic combus- tion and, thus, the energetic efficiency. This is a very new result, not yet published up to now.
4. Conclusions
The oxidation state of the catalysts can be tuned by adding small amounts of gas dopes in the reaction feed. The ad- justment of the concentrations of N2O and CO2 thus clearly appears as a promising tool to modify the number of selec- tive sites, to improve selectivity of partial oxidation products and to improve combustion of methane.
