The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are noted for their high yield of propylene in N2O-ODHP, but other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored. However, a critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This deactivation makes N2O less feasible as an oxidant compared to other soft oxidants like CO2. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation, research efforts should focus on improving catalyst stability and gaining a deeper understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Strategies could include the development of more robust catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the exploration of alternative supports or promoters that enhance catalyst longevity.

使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用具有若干优势，尤其是在与其它氧化剂相比的丙烯选择性方面。N2O作为一种强温室气体，可以在这一过程中得到有效利用，可能带来环境效益。用N2O代替氧气会导致各种催化剂的丙烯选择性显著提高，包括含铁沸石和基于钒的催化剂。含铁材料，如Fe-ZSM-5，在使用N2O的ODHP中，丙烯产量最高，但其它氧化还原金属催化剂，如钒和钼，也已被研究。然而，N2O-ODHP的一个关键挑战是催化剂的快速失活，主要是由于焦炭的形成。这种失活使得N2O作为氧化剂的可行性低于其它软氧化剂，如CO2。为了克服这些限制，使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用实施选项，研究工作应集中在提高催化剂稳定性和更深入地理解失活机制上。策略可能包括开发更坚固的催化剂配方，优化反应条件以最小化焦炭的形成，以及探索替代载体或促进剂，以增强催化剂的寿命。

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous due to its potential to significantly increase propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is observed across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been found to yield the highest propylene (C3H6) production when N2O is used. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been studied for their effectiveness in this process. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This makes N2O less feasible as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like carbon dioxide (CO2). To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation, further research is needed to improve catalyst stability and gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms.

The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as particularly effective in yielding high propylene (C3H6) in ODHP using N2O. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored for this purpose.

However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue significantly limits the feasibility of N2O as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. The quick deactivation of catalysts under N2O conditions necessitates further research to improve catalyst stability and to gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Addressing these limitations could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation.

Strategies to overcome these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the engineering of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation. Additionally, in-depth studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation could guide the design of more robust catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes.

克服这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂配方，优化反应条件以最小化焦炭的形成，以及设计具有增强抗失活性的催化剂。此外，深入研究以阐明失活的确切机制可以指导设计更坚固的N2O-ODHP过程催化剂。
