The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity for various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as the most effective catalysts for ODHP using N2O, although redox metal catalysts like vanadium and molybdenum have also been explored. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue makes N2O less feasible as an oxidant compared to other soft oxidants like CO2. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation, research efforts should focus on improving catalyst stability and gaining a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. This could involve the development of new catalyst formulations that are more resistant to coke formation, as well as the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize catalyst deactivation.

使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用具有若干优势，尤其是在与其它氧化剂相比的丙烯选择性方面。N2O作为一种强温室气体，可以在此过程中得到有效利用，可能带来环境效益。用N2O代替氧气会导致各种催化剂的丙烯选择性显著提高，包括含铁沸石和基于钒的催化剂。含铁材料，如Fe-ZSM-5，已被确定为使用N2O进行ODHP时最有效的催化剂，尽管像钒和钼这样的氧化还原金属催化剂也已被研究。然而，使用N2O进行ODHP的一个关键挑战是催化剂的快速失活，主要是由于焦炭的形成。这一问题使得N2O作为氧化剂相比像CO2这样的软氧化剂来说可行性较低。为了应对这些限制并使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实践实施选项，研究工作应集中在提高催化剂稳定性和更清晰地理解失活机制上。这可能涉及开发对焦炭形成更具抵抗力的新催化剂配方，以及优化反应条件以最小化催化剂失活。
