The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as particularly effective in yielding high propylene (C3H6) in ODHP using N2O. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored for this purpose.

However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue significantly limits the feasibility of N2O as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. The quick deactivation of catalysts under N2O conditions necessitates further research to improve catalyst stability and to gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Addressing these limitations could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation.

Strategies to overcome these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the engineering of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation. Additionally, in-depth studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation could guide the design of more robust catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes.

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中具有若干优势，尤其是在与其它氧化剂相比的丙烯选择性方面。N2O作为一种强温室气体，可以在此过程中得到有效利用，可能带来环境效益。用N2O代替氧气会导致各种催化剂的丙烯选择性显著提高，包括含铁的沸石和基于钒的催化剂。含铁材料，如Fe-ZSM-5，被发现是使用N2O在ODHP中产生高丙烯（C3H6）的特别有效的催化剂。其它还原金属催化剂，如钒和钼，也被用于此目的。

然而，使用N2O在ODHP中的一个关键挑战是催化剂的快速失活，主要是由于焦炭的形成。这个问题极大地限制了N2O作为氧化剂的可行性，与更软的氧化剂如CO2相比。在N2O条件下催化剂的快速失活需要进一步的研究，以提高催化剂的稳定性，并对失活机制有更清晰的理解。解决这些限制可能会使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实践实施选项。

克服这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂配方，优化反应条件以最小化焦炭的形成，以及设计具有增强抗失活性的催化剂。此外，深入研究以阐明失活的确切机制可以指导设计更坚固的N2O-ODHP过程催化剂。
