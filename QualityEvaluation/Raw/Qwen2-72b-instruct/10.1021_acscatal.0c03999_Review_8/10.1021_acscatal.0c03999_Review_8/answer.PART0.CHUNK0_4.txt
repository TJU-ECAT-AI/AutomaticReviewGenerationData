The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being an acidic and potent greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process. When N2O is used instead of oxygen, there is a significant increase in propylene selectivity for various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are noted for their high yield of propylene in N2O-ODHP, but other redox metal catalysts like vanadium and molybdenum have also been explored. However, a critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This makes N2O less feasible as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation, research efforts should focus on improving catalyst stability and gaining a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms.

使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用具有若干优势，尤其是在与其它氧化剂相比的丙烯选择性方面。N2O作为一种酸性和强效温室气体，在这一过程中可以被有效利用。当使用N2O代替氧气时，对于各种催化剂，包括含铁沸石和基于钒的催化剂，丙烯选择性显著增加。铁基材料，如Fe-ZSM-5，在使用N2O的ODHP中，其丙烯产量最高，但其它红氧化金属催化剂，如钒和钼，也已被研究。然而，与N2O-ODHP相关的关键挑战是催化剂的快速失活，主要是由于焦炭的形成。这使得N2O作为氧化剂相比像CO2这样的软氧化剂来说，目前可行性较低。为了克服这些限制，使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实际应用选项，研究工作应集中在提高催化剂稳定性和更清晰地理解失活机制上。
