The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous due to its potential to significantly increase propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is observed across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been found to yield the highest propylene (C3H6) production when N2O is used. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been studied for their effectiveness in this process. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This makes N2O less feasible as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like carbon dioxide (CO2). To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation, further research is needed to improve catalyst stability and gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms.

使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用,由于其与其它氧化剂相比,能够显著提高丙烯选择性,因此具有优势。这一现象在各种催化剂中都有观察到,包括含铁沸石和基于钒的催化剂。含铁材料,如Fe-ZSM-5,在使用N2O时被发现能产生最高的丙烯(C3H6)产量。其它的氧化还原金属催化剂,如钒和钼,也已经被研究用于这一过程的有效性。然而,使用N2O在ODHP中的一个关键挑战是催化剂的快速失活,主要是由于焦炭的形成。这使得N2O作为氧化剂相比像二氧化碳(CO2)这样的软氧化剂来说,可行性较低。为了克服这些限制,使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实践选择,需要进一步的研究来提高催化剂的稳定性,并更清楚地理解失活机制。
