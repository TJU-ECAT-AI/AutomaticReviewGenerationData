1. Introduction
It is known that the interaction of N O with 2 ZSM-5 type zeolites produces an extremely ac- tive surface oxygen species discovered by Ref. w x w x 1 which was called a-oxygen 2 . The a- oxygen is capable of converting ethane to ethy- lene with 9698% selectivity; it reacts with methane at ambient temperatures to give methanol or converts benzene to phenol at mod- erate temperatures. To understand the origin of this extraordinary activity and selectivity, it is necessary to study both the active sites for N O 2

There is some information concerning the nature of N O activation sites and chemical properties of 2 surface oxygen species at ambient temperatures,but there is a lack of data concerning the chem- istry of a-oxygen at temperatures of catalytic processes. The objective of the present paper is to study relative reactivities of different hydro- carbons with respect to surface a-oxygen and subsequent transformations of surface species formed under condition of catalytic reaction.

Another sample with TMS was used for calibra- tion of field by replacement method. For 13C NMR measurements, inverse-gated decoupling was used to suppress nuclear Overhauser en- hancement factors; a relaxation delay of 180 s was set. Signal of solvent CCl was used as 4 internal chemical shift standard with 96.00 ppm relatively TMS. 13C isotope distribution and location of labeled atoms were calculated from the GC-MS, 1H, and 13C NMR data.
3. Results and discussion
Under experimental conditions studied, the selectivity of formation of ethylene from ethane as well as propylene from propane and phenol . from benzene is about 8595% at conversion up to 10% and remains constant with the time though the activity decreases rapidly because of deactivation of the catalyst. Under similar con- ditions CO, CO and coke are the main prod- 2 ucts of CH N OHe feeds and only 20% of 4 2 methane is turned into C C aromatic hydro- 6 8 carbons and ethylene.

Therefore, for CH C H N O feed,4 6 6 2 the main reaction route for Tol and Xy forma- tion is the oxidative methylation of aromatic ring with methane. Benzene appears to intercept the surface species formed from methane and a-oxygen, which are converted to CO in the 2 case of CH N O feed. It is reasonable to 4 2 suggest the similar reaction route for DPhM formation from toluene and benzene. More complex reaction sequence lead to formation of

Substantial number of non-labeled molecules of Ind and Naph and those containing only one 13C atom show the notable contribution of benzene to their formation accompanied with intense scrambling of 13C label. Therefore, condensed hydrocarbons are formed most probably by means of surface hydrocarbons residue trans- formation, but detailed mechanism of the reac- tion needs further studies.
4. Conclusion
The reactivity of hydrocarbons in the oxida- tive conversions on HZSM-5 in the presence of N O has been found to correlate with the 2
strength of C H bond. Under reaction condi- tion, methane is able to alkylate the aromatic ring of benzene giving toluene and xylenes.

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.
