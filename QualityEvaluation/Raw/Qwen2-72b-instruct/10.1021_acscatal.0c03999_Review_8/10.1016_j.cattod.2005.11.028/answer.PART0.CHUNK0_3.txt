[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
[2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
[3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
[4] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
[5] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation results in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, which spatially separates active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over COx formation. C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species. The use of N2O as an oxidizing agent can tune the C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied. The effect of the oxidizing agent on the catalytic performance is related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O. It has been suggested that atomic oxygen species are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species take part in COx formation. However, direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage.

1.一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）的氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面与其它氧化剂相比具有优势。N2O较低的催化剂再氧化能力导致催化剂还原程度的增加，即表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的空间分离。这种分离有利于选择性氧化而不是COx的形成。覆盖整个V/g-Al2O3材料的分散VOx物种可以提高C3H6的选择性。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以调整所有研究材料的C3H6选择性。氧化剂对催化性能的影响也与O2和N2O产生的氧物种的性质有关。尽管目前没有直接的实验证据，但有人提出，原子氧物种负责选择性氧化，而多原子氧物种参与COx的形成。
