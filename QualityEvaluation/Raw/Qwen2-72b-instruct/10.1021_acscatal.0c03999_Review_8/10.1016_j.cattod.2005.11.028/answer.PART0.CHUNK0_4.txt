[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
[2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
[3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
[4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
[5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
[6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to improve propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants. This is attributed to its lower ability to reoxidize the catalyst, leading to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction and spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. N2O's lower reactivity for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites also contributes to its improving effect on propene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant can be advantageous for catalysts supported on materials like g-Al2O3, where covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species improves propylene selectivity. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 must be considered. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products like CO and CO2, while selective propane oxidation to propene requires only one to two lattice oxygen. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and stability could include optimizing the catalyst structure to maximize the dispersion of VOx species and minimizing the formation of polyatomic oxygen species, which are responsible for COx formation. Research directions could focus on developing catalysts with high selectivity and stability under N2O-ODHP conditions, potentially making this process more feasible for practical implementation.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中被发现能提高丙烯选择性,与其它氧化剂相比具有优势。这归因于N2O较低的催化剂再氧化能力,导致催化剂还原程度提高,表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的空间分离。这种分离有利于选择性氧化,而不是COx的形成。N2O对还原VOx位点的再氧化反应性较低,也是其提高丙烯选择性的原因。对于像g-Al2O3这样的支撑材料,使用N2O作为氧化剂可以带来优势,因为完全覆盖支撑材料的分散VOx物种可以提高丙烯选择性。然而,必须考虑到N2O的活性低于O2。活性位点中超过两个晶格氧物种有利于废物产物如CO和CO2的形成,而选择性丙烷氧化为丙烯只需要一个到两个晶格氧。解决催化剂失活和稳定性的策略可能包括优化催化剂结构,以最大化VOx物种的分散,并最小化多原子氧物种的形成,这些物种负责COx的形成。研究方向可能集中在开发在N2O-ODHP条件下具有高选择性和稳定性的催化剂,这可能使该过程更适用于实际应用。
