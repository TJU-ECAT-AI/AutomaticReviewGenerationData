[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
[2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
[3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
[4] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
[5] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of improving propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is due to its lower ability for catalyst reoxidation, which results in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction. This spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species favors selective oxidation over COx formation. The selectivity of propylene over vanadium/alumina (V/g-Al2O3) materials can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The selectivity of propylene over all materials studied can be adjusted by using an alternative oxidizing agent, N2O. The effect of the oxidizing agent on catalytic performance is also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O. Although direct experimental evidence is not yet available, it is suggested that atomic oxygen species are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species participate in COx formation.

1.一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）的氧化剂，与其它氧化剂相比，具有提高丙烯选择性的优势。这是由于其较低的催化剂再氧化能力，导致催化剂还原度的增加。表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的空间分离有利于选择性氧化而不是COx的形成。覆盖整个支撑体的分散良好的VOx物种可以提高V/g-Al2O3材料的丙烯选择性。所有研究材料的丙烯选择性可以通过使用替代氧化剂N2O进行调整。氧化剂对催化性能的影响也与O2和N2O产生的氧物种的性质有关。尽管目前没有直接的实验证据，但有人提出，原子氧物种负责选择性氧化，而多原子氧物种参与COx的形成。
