[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
[2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
[3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
[4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
[5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
[6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's lower ability for catalyst reoxidation leads to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, which spatially separates active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. Propylene selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The selectivity can be further tuned by using N2O as an alternative oxidizing agent. The lower activity of N2O is due to its reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites, which enhances propene selectivity. This effect is attributed to the less favorable reoxidation of the catalyst by N2O compared to O2. The decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation, as only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary for the former reaction. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products like CO and CO2.

在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂,在丙烯选择性方面与其它氧化剂相比具有几个优势。N2O较低的催化剂再氧化能力导致催化剂还原程度的增加,即表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的空间分离。这种分离有利于选择性氧化,而不是COx的形成。通过完全覆盖V/g-Al2O3材料的支撑,可以改善丙烯选择性。通过使用N2O作为替代氧化剂,可以选择性进一步调整。N2O的较低活性是由于其减少还原VOx位点的能力,从而增强了丙烯选择性。这种效应归因于N2O与O2相比,催化剂再氧化的不利影响。VOx物种活性表面晶格氧的稳态浓度的降低,有利于选择性丙烷氧化为丙烯,而不是COx的形成,因为前者反应只需要一个到两个晶格氧。具有超过两个晶格氧的活性位点有利于废物产品,即CO和CO2的形成。
