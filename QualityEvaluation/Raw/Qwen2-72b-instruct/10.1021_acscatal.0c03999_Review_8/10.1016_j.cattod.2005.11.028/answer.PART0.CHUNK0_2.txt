[1] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
[2] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
[3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
[4] "The lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."
[5] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
[6] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,i.e. CO and CO2."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been found to improve propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is attributed to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation, which results in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction. This spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. The selectivity of propylene over vanadia-based catalysts supported on gamma-alumina (V/g-Al2O3) can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The use of N2O as an alternative oxidizing agent can further tune the selectivity of propylene over all studied materials. The lower activity of N2O is explained by its lower ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites. The improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is due to the less favorable catalyst reoxidation by N2O compared to O2. This decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation, as only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products, such as CO and CO2.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process include the need for a stable and active catalyst that can withstand the harsh reaction conditions and maintain high selectivity over long periods. Strategies to address these limitations could include the development of new catalyst formulations that are more resistant to deactivation, such as the use of supports with higher thermal stability and the incorporation of promoters that can enhance the dispersion and stability of the active VOx species. Additionally, research directions could focus on optimizing the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and gas composition, to maximize the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. The use of in situ characterization techniques could also provide insights into the deactivation mechanisms and guide the development of more stable catalysts.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂，与其它氧化剂相比，可以提高丙烯的选择性。这归因于N2O对催化剂再氧化能力的降低，导致催化剂还原程度的增加。即表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的空间分离有利于选择性氧化，而不是COx的形成。在γ-氧化铝（V/g-Al2O3）上支撑的钒基催化剂的丙烯选择性可以通过完全覆盖支撑材料与分散良好的VOx物种来提高。N2O作为替代氧化剂可以进一步调节所有研究材料的丙烯选择性。N2O活性较低的原因是其对还原VOx位点的再氧化能力较低。N2O对丙烯选择性的改善效果归因于N2O对催化剂的再氧化不如O2有利。这导致VOx物种活性表面晶格氧的稳态浓度降低，有利于选择性丙烷氧化为丙烯，而不是COx的形成，因为前者反应在活性位点只需要一个到两个晶格氧。具有超过两个晶格氧物种的活性位点有利于废物产物，即CO和CO2的形成。

N2O-ODHP过程中与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括需要一种能够在恶劣反应条件下保持高选择性的稳定和活性催化剂。解决这些限制的策略可能包括开发新的催化剂配方，使其更能抵抗失活，例如使用热稳定性更高的支撑材料和加入促进剂，以增强活性VOx物种的分散性和稳定性。此外，研究方向可以集中在优化反应条件，如温度、压力和气体组成，以最大限度地提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性。使用原位表征技术也可以提供对失活机制的见解，并指导更稳定催化剂的开发。
