[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
[2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
[3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
[4] "Taking into account the precision in the measurements, introduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes."
[5] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged."
[6] "A lack in the carbon balance was observed. The sum of percentages of selectivity to propylene and CO2 is in general about 80%. However, in some cases, values as low as 50% were observed."
[7] "The high consumption of oxygen could confirm this fact."
[8] "The fresh NiMoO4 and the NiMoO4+-Sb2O4 mixture were fully oxidised (no Mo5+ is observed). There is no indication of carbide species of Ni or of Mo formed at the surface of the NiMoO4 catalysts during the test."
[9] "Mixtures are reduced after reaction. Indeed, XPS anal- ysis showed that the quantity of Mo6+ decreases and that of Mo5+ increases in the presence of N2O."
[10] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
[11] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the oxi- dation rate of the catalysts."
[12] "The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products."
[13] "N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different."
[14] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
[15] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
[16] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to increase the selectivity to propylene compared to other oxidants. The study used a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 as catalysts. The addition of N2O in the feed leads to a significant increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decrease. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which is beneficial for the selectivity of the catalyst. However, the conversion of propane and the yield of CO2 decrease, which may limit the practical application of N2O-ODHP. The challenge of catalyst deactivation and stability is also a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Strategies to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. For example, the use of more stable catalysts or the development of new catalysts with higher activity and selectivity could be explored. Additionally, the optimization of the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, could also help to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被用作氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)的氧化剂,与其它氧化剂相比,它能提高丙烯的选择性。该研究使用了NiMoO4和-Sb2O4的混合物作为催化剂。在进料中添加N2O会导致丙烯的选择性显著提高,而丙烷和氧气的转化率以及CO2的产率下降。N2O促进钼的还原,这对催化剂的选择性有益。然而,丙烷的转化率和CO2的产率下降,这可能限制N2O-ODHP的实际应用。催化剂失活和稳定性的问题也是一个需要解决的关键问题。提高催化剂稳定性和降低失活率的策略可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选择。例如,可以探索使用更稳定的催化剂或开发具有更高活性和选择性的新催化剂。此外,优化反应条件,如温度、压力和进料组成,也有助于提高催化剂的稳定性和降低失活率。
