[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
[2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
[3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
[4] "Taking these results into ac- count, it could be suggested that the role of N2O could be the same. N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
[5] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
[6] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

1.The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 as catalysts. The addition of N2O in the feed leads to an increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. However, the mechanism by which the reduction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxygen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction. When N2O is fed in the mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene, which is coherent with the fact that the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4 in the mixture.

1.在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂的研究中,使用了NiMoO4和-Sb2O4的混合物作为催化剂。在进料中添加N2O导致丙烯的选择性增加,而丙烷和氧气的转化率以及CO2的产率下降。N2O促进了钼的还原,这有助于钼表面的还原。然而,催化剂还原的调整机制似乎不同。可以推测,N2O抑制了NiMoO4上的氧气吸附,从而促进还原。当N2O被喂入NiMoO4和-Sb2O4的混合物中时,丙烯的选择性没有显著增加,这与-Sb2O4在混合物中已经大大调节了选择性相一致。
