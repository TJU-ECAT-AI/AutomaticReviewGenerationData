[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
[2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
[3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
[4] "The adjustment of the concentration of N2O and CO2 thus clearly appears as a promising tool to improve the selectivity of partial oxidation products and the energetic efficiency in combustion."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process, which can increase the selectivity to propylene compared to other oxidants. This process employs a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 as catalysts. The addition of N2O can promote the reduction of molybdenum, which is beneficial for the selectivity of propylene. However, it also decreases the conversion of propane and oxygen, as well as the yield of CO2. The adjustment of N2O concentration is a promising tool to improve the selectivity of partial oxidation products and the energetic efficiency in combustion. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability need to be addressed to make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. Strategies such as optimizing the catalyst formulation, improving the reaction conditions, and developing new catalysts with higher stability and selectivity could potentially address these limitations.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被用作丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)过程中的氧化剂,与其它氧化剂相比,它可以提高丙烯的选择性。该过程使用NiMoO4和-Sb2O4的混合物作为催化剂。添加N2O可以促进钼的还原,这对丙烯的选择性有益。然而,它也会降低丙烷和氧气的转化率,以及CO2的产率。调整N2O浓度是提高部分氧化产物的选择性和燃烧能效的有希望的工具。与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战需要解决,以使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选择。优化催化剂配方、改善反应条件和开发具有更高稳定性和选择性的新催化剂等策略可能解决这些限制。
