[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
[2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
[3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
[4] "Taking into account the precision in the measurements, in- troduction of N2O in the feed produces significant changes."
[5] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces (Table 2): (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%). The yield (3.2%) and the selectivity (+8%) in propylene and the selectivity in CO2 (9%) re- main unchanged."
[6] "For pure NiMoO4, addition of 300 ppm N2O leads to (Table 2): (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an increase in the selectivity to propylene (+32%), (iii) a decrease in both the conversion of oxygen (19%) and the yield of CO2 (21%)."
[7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
[8] "These results could indicate that -Sb2O4 and N2O could probably play the same role, namely, control- ling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction, inhibit- ing non-selective sites."
[9] "The role of -Sb2O4 is to irrigate the surface of MoO3 with spillover oxygen which facilitates the oxida- tion of the surface of MoO3 after incorporation of its oxy- gen atoms in oxidation products."
[10] "N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the re- duction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxy- gen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."
[11] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
[12] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to increase the selectivity to propylene. Compared to other oxidants, N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which leads to a more selective catalyst. The catalysts employed in this process include a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are not explicitly mentioned in the literature, but it can be inferred that the reduction of molybdenum and the inhibition of oxygen adsorption may affect the stability of the catalyst. Strategies or research directions that could address these limitations include the development of more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity under N2O conditions, the optimization of the N2O concentration to balance selectivity and stability, and the investigation of alternative promoters that can enhance propylene selectivity without compromising catalyst stability.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被用作氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)的氧化剂,以提高对丙烯的选择性。与其它氧化剂相比,N2O促进钼的还原,从而产生更选择性的催化剂。该过程中使用的催化剂包括NiMoO4和-Sb2O4的混合物,以及在混合Zr-Ce-O氧化物催化剂上支撑的钯。与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战在文献中没有明确提及,但可以推断,钼的还原和氧气吸附的抑制可能会影响催化剂的稳定性。可以解决这些限制的策略或研究方向包括开发在N2O条件下能保持其活性的更稳定催化剂,优化N2O浓度以平衡选择性和稳定性,以及研究可以增强丙烯选择性而不损害催化剂稳定性的替代促进剂。
