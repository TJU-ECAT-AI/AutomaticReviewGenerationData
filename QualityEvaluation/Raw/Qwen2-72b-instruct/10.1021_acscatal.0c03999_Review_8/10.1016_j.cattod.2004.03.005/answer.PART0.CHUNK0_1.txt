[1] "The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
[2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
[3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
[4] "Taking these results into ac- count, it could be suggested that the role of N2O could be the same. N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum."
[5] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mix- ture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."

1.The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 as catalysts. The addition of N2O in the feed during the ODHP process leads to an increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decrease. This is attributed to the promotion of the reduction of molybdenum by N2O. N2O facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum, which is coherent with the observed increase in selectivity to propylene. However, there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, which is consistent with the role of -Sb2O4 in controlling the selectivity of NiMoO4 during the reaction.

1.在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)过程中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂的研究中,使用了NiMoO4和-Sb2O4的混合物作为催化剂。在ODHP过程中,在进料中添加N2O会导致丙烯的选择性增加,而丙烷和氧气的转化率以及CO2的产率下降。这归因于N2O促进钼的还原。N2O促进了钼表面的还原,这与观察到的丙烯选择性增加是一致的。然而,当N2O在NiMoO4和-Sb2O4的混合物中进料时,丙烯的选择性没有显著增加,这与-Sb2O4在控制NiMoO4在反应中的选择性方面的作用是一致的。
