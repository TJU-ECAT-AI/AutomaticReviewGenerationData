1.N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species, which can efficiently dehydrogenate propane. This specificity of N2O contributes to the remarkable performance of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propylene yield. The tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chromatography (GC) analysis has proved to be a suitable tool for correlating deactivation and mass changes due to coking. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion by monitoring in real time the formation of carbonaceous deposits and eventual changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous material. The reusability of the regenerated catalysts (i.e., to what extent the catalytic performance is recovered on successive reaction and regeneration cycles) has not yet been addressed in detail. Strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include: (1) Developing catalysts with higher resistance to coke formation and deactivation, such as by modifying the zeolite framework or the iron species to reduce the formation of coke precursors. (2) Improving the regeneration efficiency of the catalysts, such as by optimizing the regeneration conditions to remove coke deposits without altering the iron species. (3) Developing in situ techniques for monitoring the deactivation and regeneration processes, such as by combining TEOM and FTIR spectroscopy to gain a better understanding of the deactivation mechanism and the changes in the catalyst structure during regeneration. (4) Investigating the reusability of the regenerated catalysts on successive reaction and regeneration cycles to evaluate the long-term stability and performance of the catalysts.

1.N2O是一种单氧供体，可以协调反应性原子氧物种，这些物种可以有效地脱氢丙烷。N2O的这种特异性促成了铁沸石在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的显著表现。然而，铁沸石在N2O-ODHP中的主要缺点是由于焦炭导致的失活，导致丙烯产量迅速下降。锥形元件振荡微平衡(TEOM)技术与气相色谱(GC)分析相结合，已被证明是关联失活和由于焦化导致的质量变化的合适工具。原位FTIR光谱法适用于通过实时监测碳沉积物的形成和与微孔材料表面酸度和框架相关的振动的任何变化，评估沸石催化剂在碳氢化合物转化中的焦炭失活。再生催化剂的可重复使用性(即，在连续的反应和再生循环中，催化性能恢复的程度)尚未得到详细解决。可以解决这些限制并可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用实施选项的策略或研究方向包括：(1)开发对焦炭形成和失活具有更高抵抗力的催化剂，例如通过修改沸石框架或铁物种以减少焦炭前体的形成。(2)提高催化剂的再生效率，例如通过优化再生条件，在不改变铁物种的情况下去除焦炭沉积物。(3)开发用于监测失活和再生过程的原位技术，例如通过结合TEOM和FTIR光谱法，以更好地理解失活机制和再生过程中催化剂结构的变化。(4)在连续的反应和再生循环中研究再生催化剂的可重复使用性，以评估催化剂的长期稳定性和性能。
