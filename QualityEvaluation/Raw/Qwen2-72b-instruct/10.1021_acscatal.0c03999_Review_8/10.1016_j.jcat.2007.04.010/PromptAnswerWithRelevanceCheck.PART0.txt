1.N2O是一种单氧供体，能够有效地脱氢丙烷，这使得它在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中对丙烯的选择性优于其他氧化剂。铁沸石由于其能够协调反应性原子氧物种的能力，在这一过程中表现出显著的性能。然而，铁沸石的一个主要缺点是由于焦炭形成导致的失活，这会导致丙烯产量的迅速下降。锥形元件振荡微平衡（TEOM）技术与气相色谱（GC）分析相结合，已被用于关联失活和由于焦化导致的质量变化。原位FTIR光谱法也适用于通过监测碳沉积物的形成和与微孔材料表面酸性和框架相关的振动变化来评估沸石催化剂的焦炭失活。为了更好地理解失活机制，需要在反应条件下进行补充的光谱学研究。再生催化剂的可重复使用性（即，在连续的反应和再生循环中催化性能恢复的程度）尚未得到详细探讨。红外结果已被TEOMGC实验在相同条件下的催化剂上补充。基于这些分析和通过X射线衍射（XRD）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）和氮吸附对新鲜、焦化和再生样品的表征，对反应和再生过程中催化剂的可逆性程度进行了评估和讨论。

Strategies or research directions that could address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the development of more stable catalysts, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ spectroscopic techniques to better understand the deactivation mechanism and develop strategies to mitigate it. Potential research directions could include the use of alternative oxidants, the development of new catalysts with improved stability, and the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation.

1.N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane when coordinated with specific iron species in iron zeolites, making it advantageous for propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. However, a major drawback is the deactivation of iron zeolites by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The TEOM technique coupled with GC analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking, providing a level of detail and accuracy not achievable with typical ex situ approaches. However, TEOM does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. In situ FTIR spectroscopy can be used to monitor the formation of carbonaceous deposits and changes in vibrations associated with surface acidity and the framework of the microporous material in real time, which is useful for understanding the ODHP reaction. To the best of our knowledge, in situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. The reusability of regenerated catalysts has not been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed based on these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by XRD, TEM, and nitrogen adsorption.
