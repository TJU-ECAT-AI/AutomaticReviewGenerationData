1.N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane when coordinated with specific iron species in iron zeolites, making it advantageous for propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. However, a major drawback is the deactivation of iron zeolites by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The TEOM technique coupled with GC analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking, providing a level of detail and accuracy not achievable with typical ex situ approaches. However, TEOM does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. In situ FTIR spectroscopy can be used to monitor the formation of carbonaceous deposits and changes in vibrations associated with surface acidity and the framework of the microporous material in real time, which is useful for understanding the ODHP reaction. To the best of our knowledge, in situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. The reusability of regenerated catalysts has not been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed based on these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by XRD, TEM, and nitrogen adsorption.

1.N2O是一种单氧供体，当与铁沸石中特定的铁物种协调时，可以有效地脱氢丙烷，使其在丙烯选择性方面优于其他氧化剂。然而，铁沸石在N2O氧化脱氢丙烷过程中的主要缺点是由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活，这会导致丙烯产量的迅速下降。TEOM技术与GC分析相结合已被用来关联失活和由于焦化导致的质量变化，提供了典型的原位方法无法达到的细节和准确性水平。然而，TEOM并不能提供催化剂表面水平的失活机制信息。原位FTIR光谱可以实时监测碳沉积物的形成和与表面酸性和微孔材料框架相关的振动变化，这对于理解ODHP反应是有用的。据我们所知，关于N2O在铁沸石上选择性氧化烃类的原位研究尚未有报道。再生催化剂的可重复使用性（即在连续的反应和再生循环中催化性能的恢复程度）尚未得到详细探讨。红外结果通过在相同条件下对催化剂进行TEOMGC实验得到补充。基于这些分析和通过X射线衍射（XRD）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）和氮吸附对新鲜、焦化和再生样品的表征，评估和讨论了催化剂在反应和再生过程中的可逆性。
