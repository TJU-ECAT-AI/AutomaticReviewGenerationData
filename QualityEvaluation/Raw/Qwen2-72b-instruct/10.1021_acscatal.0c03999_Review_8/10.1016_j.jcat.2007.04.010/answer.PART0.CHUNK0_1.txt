1.N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane due to its ability to coordinate with reactive atomic oxygen species. This specificity makes N2O an advantageous oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants. Iron zeolites have shown remarkable performance in N2O-mediated ODHP due to their ability to coordinate with reactive atomic oxygen species. However, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chromatography (GC) analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking. In situ investigation of coke formation using TEOM provides a level of detail and accuracy that cannot be accomplished using typical approaches to study deactivation. However, TEOM does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. To gain a better understanding of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air, complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion by monitoring in real time the formation of carbonaceous deposits and eventual changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous material. Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction. In situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. The reusability of the regenerated catalysts (i.e., to what extent the catalytic performance is recovered on successive reaction and regeneration cycles) has not yet been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption. Strategies or research directions that could address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the development of more stable catalysts, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ spectroscopic techniques to better understand the deactivation mechanism and develop strategies to mitigate it. Potential research directions could include the use of alternative oxidants, the development of new catalysts with improved stability, and the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation.

1.N2O是一种单氧供体，由于其能够与活性原子氧物种协调，因此能够有效地脱氢丙烷。这种特异性使N2O成为氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）的有利氧化剂，与其他氧化剂相比。铁沸石在N2O介导的ODHP中表现出显著的性能，因为它们能够与活性原子氧物种协调。然而，铁沸石在N2O-ODHP中的主要缺点是由于焦炭导致的失活，这导致丙烯产量的迅速下降。锥形元素振荡微平衡（TEOM）技术与气相色谱（GC）分析相结合，已被用来关联失活和由于焦炭导致的质量变化。原位焦炭形成调查使用TEOM提供了一种细节和准确性水平，这是使用典型方法研究失活所不能实现的。然而，TEOM并不提供关于催化剂表面水平的失活机制的信息。为了更好地理解铁含沸石在C3H8 + N2O反应中的失活以及随后在空气中的再生，需要在反应条件下进行补充的光谱学研究。原位FTIR光谱学适用于通过实时监测碳沉积物的形成和与微孔材料的表面酸度和框架相关的振动的任何变化，评估沸石催化剂在碳氢化合物转化中的焦炭失活。在真实工艺条件下观察工作催化剂的演变对于改进对ODHP反应的理解是有用的。关于铁含沸石的N2O选择性氧化碳氢化合物的原位调查尚未报告。再生催化剂的可重复使用性（即，在连续的反应和再生循环中，催化性能恢复到什么程度）尚未详细解决。红外结果由在相同条件下对催化剂进行的TEOMGC实验补充。基于这些分析以及通过X射线衍射（XRD）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）和氮吸附对新鲜、焦化和再生样品的表征，评估和讨论了催化剂在反应和再生中的可逆性。解决N2O-ODHP中催化剂失活和稳定性限制的策略或研究方向可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂、优化反应条件以最小化焦炭形成以及使用原位光谱技术更好地理解失活机制并制定策略来缓解它。潜在的研究方向可能包括使用替代氧化剂、开发具有改进稳定性的新催化剂以及优化反应条件以最小化焦炭形成。
