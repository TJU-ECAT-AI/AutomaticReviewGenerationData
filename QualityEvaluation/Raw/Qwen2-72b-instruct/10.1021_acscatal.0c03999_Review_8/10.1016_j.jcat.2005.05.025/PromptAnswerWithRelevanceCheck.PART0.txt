1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a lower catalytic activity due to its weaker ability to re-oxidize the reduced surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species. However, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction in surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. From a stoichiometric point of view, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

2.Catalysts employed in the ODHP process using N2O as an oxidant include vanadium-based catalysts supported on mesoporous materials such as MCM-41. These catalysts exhibit high dispersion of vanadium oxide species, which are crucial for achieving high propene selectivity. However, catalyst deactivation and stability remain critical challenges in the ODHP process. Catalyst deactivation can occur due to the formation of coke or the sintering of vanadium oxide species, leading to a decrease in surface area and catalytic activity. Strategies to address these limitations include the use of promoters or co-catalysts to enhance the stability of vanadium oxide species, the optimization of catalyst preparation methods to improve dispersion and stability, and the development of novel catalyst supports with high thermal stability and hydrophobic properties to minimize coke formation. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the development of more stable and active catalysts, the optimization of reaction conditions to enhance selectivity and yield, and the investigation of alternative oxidants that could offer similar advantages to N2O in terms of selectivity and activity.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被发现作为氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)的氧化剂具有优势,因为它在与氧气(O2)相似的丙烷转化程度下,能够实现更高的丙烯选择性。这归因于N2O较弱的氧化电位,它抑制了丙烷的直接氧化和丙烯连续氧化为一氧化碳和二氧化碳(COx)。使用N2O作为氧化剂导致较低的催化活性,因为N2O较弱的能力重新氧化表面钒氧化物(VOx)的还原形式。然而,当N2O用作氧化剂时,高度分散的表面VOx物种和结晶V2O5纳米粒子之间在丙烯选择性上没有显著差异。相比之下,在O2存在下,结晶V2O5纳米粒子对ODHP反应没有选择性。N2O对丙烯选择性的正面影响与表面VOx物种中活性表面晶格氧的表面密度(空间分离)降低有关,因为N2O与O2相比,是一种较弱的氧化剂,用于还原VOx物种的重新氧化。从ODHP反应的化学计量观点来看,在较低的表面密度下,选择性丙烯形成比燃烧反应更受青睐。

2.在使用N2O作为氧化剂的ODHP过程中使用的催化剂包括基于钒的催化剂,它们被支撑在如MCM-41的介孔材料上。这些催化剂表现出高分散的钒氧化物物种,这对于实现高丙烯选择性至关重要。然而,催化剂失活和稳定性仍然是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。催化剂失活可能由于焦炭的形成或钒氧化物物种的烧结,导致表面积和催化活性的下降。解决这些限制的策略包括使用促进剂或共催化剂来增强钒氧化物物种的稳定性,优化催化剂制备方法以提高分散性和稳定性,以及开发具有高热稳定性和疏水性质的新型催化剂载体,以最小化焦炭的形成。可能使N2O-ODHP成为实际应用更可行选择的研究方向包括开发更稳定和活性的催化剂,优化反应条件以提高选择性和产量,以及研究可提供与N2O在选择性和活性方面类似优势的替代氧化剂。

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which results in lower catalytic activity but inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant also eliminates the significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles. However, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2, unlike the highly dispersed VOx species. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction of surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for the re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. This spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species inhibits the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, favoring selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

2.The various catalysts employed in the ODHP process include supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts, with mesoporous materials such as MCM-41 providing high surface areas for high dispersion of catalytically active surface VOx species. The rate of propene formation appears to vary with the dispersion of these species, and the challenge is to achieve maximum dispersion of surface VOx species. The overall performance of mesoporous supported vanadia catalysts for the ODHP reaction is also influenced by the chosen reaction conditions, such as the addition of small amounts of H2O, CO2, and N2O to the reaction feed.

3.Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges associated with the use of N2O as an oxidant in the ODHP process. The lower catalytic activity in the presence of N2O compared to O2 is due to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODHP reaction. This can lead to a decrease in the rate of propene formation and a potential decrease in catalyst stability over time. Strategies to address these limitations could include the development of more stable and active catalysts, such as those with higher dispersion of surface VOx species, and the optimization of reaction conditions to enhance the re-oxidation of reduced VOx sites. Research directions could focus on the synthesis of new catalysts with improved stability and activity, as well as the investigation of alternative oxidants that could potentially offer better performance than N2O.

2.在ODHP过程中使用的各种催化剂包括支撑的钒氧化物（VOx）催化剂，其中MCM-41等介孔材料提供了高表面积，用于高度分散的催化活性表面VOx物种。丙烯形成速率似乎随这些物种的分散而变化，挑战在于实现表面VOx物种的最大分散。介孔支撑的钒催化剂在ODHP反应中的整体性能也受到所选反应条件的影响，例如向反应进料中添加少量H2O、CO2和N2O。

3.催化剂失活和稳定性是使用N2O作为ODHP过程氧化剂的关键挑战。在N2O存在下，与O2相比，催化活性较低，这是由于N2O在ODHP反应中还原表面VOx位点的再氧化中较弱的氧化电位所致。这可能导致丙烯形成速率的降低和催化剂稳定性随时间的潜在降低。解决这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定和活性的催化剂，例如具有更高表面VOx物种分散度的催化剂，以及优化反应条件以增强还原VOx位点的再氧化。研究方向可能集中在合成具有改进稳定性和活性的新催化剂，以及对可能提供比N2O更好性能的替代氧化剂的调查。

This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx).

Highly dispersed VOx species on the surface of MCM-41 mesoporous silica show improved selectivity with N2O, whereas crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the lower catalytic activity due to the slower re-oxidation of reduced VOx sites by N2O compared to O2. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of more stable and active catalysts with optimized VOx species distribution and enhanced re-oxidation kinetics, as well as the exploration of alternative oxidants or process conditions that maintain high propene selectivity while improving catalyst stability and activity.

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of achieving higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is due to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which results in lower catalytic activity but inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant spatially separates active surface lattice oxygen in vanadium oxide (VOx) species, favoring selective propene formation over combustion reactions. Both highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles exhibit similar propene selectivity when N2O is used as an oxidant. However, in the presence of O2, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction. The critical challenge associated with catalyst deactivation and stability is that N2O re-oxidizes reduced VOx sites more slowly than O2, leading to a lower concentration of active lattice oxygen. Strategies to address this limitation could include developing catalysts with higher dispersion of reducible metal oxides on inert supports, which are easily reduced by hydrocarbons rather than re-oxidized by the oxidant. This would spatially isolate active lattice oxygen species, favoring selective oxidation over combustion reactions. Additionally, research could focus on improving the stability and re-oxidation kinetics of VOx species in the presence of N2O to enhance catalyst performance.
