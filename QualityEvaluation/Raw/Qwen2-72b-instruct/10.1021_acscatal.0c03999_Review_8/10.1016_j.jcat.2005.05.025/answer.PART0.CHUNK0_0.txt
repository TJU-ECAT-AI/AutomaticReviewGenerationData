1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a lower catalytic activity due to its weaker ability to re-oxidize the reduced surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species. However, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction in surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. From a stoichiometric point of view, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

2.Catalysts employed in the ODHP process using N2O as an oxidant include vanadium-based catalysts supported on mesoporous materials such as MCM-41. These catalysts exhibit high dispersion of vanadium oxide species, which are crucial for achieving high propene selectivity. However, catalyst deactivation and stability remain critical challenges in the ODHP process. Catalyst deactivation can occur due to the formation of coke or the sintering of vanadium oxide species, leading to a decrease in surface area and catalytic activity. Strategies to address these limitations include the use of promoters or co-catalysts to enhance the stability of vanadium oxide species, the optimization of catalyst preparation methods to improve dispersion and stability, and the development of novel catalyst supports with high thermal stability and hydrophobic properties to minimize coke formation. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the development of more stable and active catalysts, the optimization of reaction conditions to enhance selectivity and yield, and the investigation of alternative oxidants that could offer similar advantages to N2O in terms of selectivity and activity.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被发现作为氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)的氧化剂具有优势,因为它在与氧气(O2)相似的丙烷转化程度下,能够实现更高的丙烯选择性。这归因于N2O较弱的氧化电位,它抑制了丙烷的直接氧化和丙烯连续氧化为一氧化碳和二氧化碳(COx)。使用N2O作为氧化剂导致较低的催化活性,因为N2O较弱的能力重新氧化表面钒氧化物(VOx)的还原形式。然而,当N2O用作氧化剂时,高度分散的表面VOx物种和结晶V2O5纳米粒子之间在丙烯选择性上没有显著差异。相比之下,在O2存在下,结晶V2O5纳米粒子对ODHP反应没有选择性。N2O对丙烯选择性的正面影响与表面VOx物种中活性表面晶格氧的表面密度(空间分离)降低有关,因为N2O与O2相比,是一种较弱的氧化剂,用于还原VOx物种的重新氧化。从ODHP反应的化学计量观点来看,在较低的表面密度下,选择性丙烯形成比燃烧反应更受青睐。

2.在使用N2O作为氧化剂的ODHP过程中使用的催化剂包括基于钒的催化剂,它们被支撑在如MCM-41的介孔材料上。这些催化剂表现出高分散的钒氧化物物种,这对于实现高丙烯选择性至关重要。然而,催化剂失活和稳定性仍然是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。催化剂失活可能由于焦炭的形成或钒氧化物物种的烧结,导致表面积和催化活性的下降。解决这些限制的策略包括使用促进剂或共催化剂来增强钒氧化物物种的稳定性,优化催化剂制备方法以提高分散性和稳定性,以及开发具有高热稳定性和疏水性质的新型催化剂载体,以最小化焦炭的形成。可能使N2O-ODHP成为实际应用更可行选择的研究方向包括开发更稳定和活性的催化剂,优化反应条件以提高选择性和产量,以及研究可提供与N2O在选择性和活性方面类似优势的替代氧化剂。
