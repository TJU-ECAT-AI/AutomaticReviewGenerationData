[1] "For all V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion."
[2] "The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as com- pared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction."
[3] "There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant."
[4] "In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2."
[5] "The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx."
[6] "The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which results in lower catalytic activity but inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant also eliminates the significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles. However, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2, unlike the highly dispersed VOx species. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction of surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for the re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. This spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species inhibits the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, favoring selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

2.The various catalysts employed in the ODHP process include supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts, with mesoporous materials such as MCM-41 providing high surface areas for high dispersion of catalytically active surface VOx species. The rate of propene formation appears to vary with the dispersion of these species, and the challenge is to achieve maximum dispersion of surface VOx species. The overall performance of mesoporous supported vanadia catalysts for the ODHP reaction is also influenced by the chosen reaction conditions, such as the addition of small amounts of H2O, CO2, and N2O to the reaction feed.

3.Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges associated with the use of N2O as an oxidant in the ODHP process. The lower catalytic activity in the presence of N2O compared to O2 is due to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODHP reaction. This can lead to a decrease in the rate of propene formation and a potential decrease in catalyst stability over time. Strategies to address these limitations could include the development of more stable and active catalysts, such as those with higher dispersion of surface VOx species, and the optimization of reaction conditions to enhance the re-oxidation of reduced VOx sites. Research directions could focus on the synthesis of new catalysts with improved stability and activity, as well as the investigation of alternative oxidants that could potentially offer better performance than N2O.

1.一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，与氧气（O2）相比具有优势，因为它能够在相似的丙烷转化程度下实现更高的丙烯选择性。这归因于N2O较弱的氧化电位，导致较低的催化活性，但抑制了丙烷的直接氧化和丙烯连续氧化为一氧化碳（COx）。使用N2O作为氧化剂时，高度分散的表面钒氧化物（VOx）物种和结晶V2O5纳米颗粒之间的丙烯选择性没有显著差异。然而，在O2存在下，结晶V2O5纳米颗粒对于ODHP反应没有选择性，与高度分散的VOx物种不同。N2O对丙烯选择性的正面影响与表面密度（空间分离）的活性表面晶格氧在VOx物种中的减少有关，因为N2O是比O2弱的氧化剂，用于还原VOx物种的再氧化。这种活性晶格氧物种的空间分离抑制了丙烷的直接深度氧化和丙烯连续氧化为COx，有利于选择性氧化而不是燃烧反应。

2.在ODHP过程中使用的各种催化剂包括支撑的钒氧化物（VOx）催化剂，其中MCM-41等介孔材料提供了高表面积，用于高度分散的催化活性表面VOx物种。丙烯形成速率似乎随这些物种的分散而变化，挑战在于实现表面VOx物种的最大分散。介孔支撑的钒催化剂在ODHP反应中的整体性能也受到所选反应条件的影响，例如向反应进料中添加少量H2O、CO2和N2O。

3.催化剂失活和稳定性是使用N2O作为ODHP过程氧化剂的关键挑战。在N2O存在下，与O2相比，催化活性较低，这是由于N2O在ODHP反应中还原表面VOx位点的再氧化中较弱的氧化电位所致。这可能导致丙烯形成速率的降低和催化剂稳定性随时间的潜在降低。解决这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定和活性的催化剂，例如具有更高表面VOx物种分散度的催化剂，以及优化反应条件以增强还原VOx位点的再氧化。研究方向可能集中在合成具有改进稳定性和活性的新催化剂，以及对可能提供比N2O更好性能的替代氧化剂的调查。
