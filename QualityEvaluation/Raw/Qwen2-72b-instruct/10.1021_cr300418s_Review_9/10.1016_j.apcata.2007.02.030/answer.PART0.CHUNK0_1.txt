[1] "In this work, we report an in-depth structural characterization of pure NiO and NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts (Nb/Ni = 00.25), highly active and selective materials for ethylene production via ethane ODH, using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS)."
[2] "It was found that low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."
[3] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."
[4] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with structural defects due to cationic deficiency. Upon doping with Nb, two distinct structural phases are formed: a NiO phase with Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, which is a precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The reduction of structural defects in NiO via interaction with niobium ions correlates with the high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction. The vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems are not explicitly mentioned in the literature.

1.镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙烷转化为乙烯)的催化性能有重大影响。低温处理纯NiO会导致形成非化学计量氧化相,由于阳离子缺乏而具有特征性的结构缺陷。通过Nb掺杂,形成了两个不同的结构相:一个NiO相,其中Nb阳离子被掺入主体晶格,形成NiNb固溶体,以及一个高度扭曲的Nb富集相,是形成混合NiNb2O6晶体化合物的前体。通过与铌离子的相互作用减少NiO中的结构缺陷与NiNbO催化剂在乙烷ODH反应中对乙烯的极高选择性相关联,因为这些空位会导致形成强氧化性亲电子氧物种,对乙烷的完全氧化为CO2负责。文献中没有明确提及在这些催化系统中理论建模、过程优化以及效率、选择性和安全性平衡的关键挑战。
