The Journal of Physical Chemistry CVol 115/Issue 14Article Cite Share Jump to Expand ARTICLEMarch 10, 2011 Charge Compensation and Ce3+ Formation in Trivalent Doping of the CeO2(110) Surface: The Key Role of Dopant Ionic Radius Michael Nolan* View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract In this paper, we use density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) and hybrid DFT (HSE06 functional) to study the defects formed when the ceria (110) surface is doped with a series of trivalent dopants, namely, Al3+, Sc3+, Y3+, and In3+. Using the hybrid DFT HSE06 exchange-correlation functional as a benchmark, we show that doping the (110) surface with a single trivalent ion leads to formation of a localized MCe/ + OO• (M = the 3+ dopant), O hole state, confirming the description found with DFT+U. We use DFT+U to investigate the energetics of dopant compensation through formation of the 2MCe +VO·· defect, that is, compensation of two dopants with an oxygen vacancy. In conjunction with earlier work on La-doped CeO2, we find that the stability of the compensating anion vacancy depends on the dopant ionic radius. For Al3+, which has the smallest ionic radius, and Sc3+ and In3+, with intermediate ionic radii, formation of a compensating oxygen vacancy is stable. On the other hand, the Y3+ dopant, with an ionic radius close to that of Ce4+, shows a positive anion vacancy formation energy, as does La3+, which is larger than Ce4+ ( J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 2010, 20, 135004). When considering the resulting electronic structure, in Al3+ doping, oxygen hole compensation is found. However, Sc3+, In3+, and Y3+ show the formation of a reduced Ce3+ cation and an uncompensated oxygen hole, similar to La3+. These results suggest that the ionic radius of trivalent dopants strongly influences the final defect formed when doping ceria with 3+ cations. In light of these findings, experimental investigations of these systems will be welcome.

(1-5) It has the ability to store and release oxygen, depending on the reaction conditions, a feature known as the oxygen storage capacity, OSC. Oxygen is released in a reducing atmosphere and taken up in an oxidizing atmosphere. The OSC is facilitated by the ease with which Ce can change its oxidation state from 4+ in CeO2 to 3+ in reduced ceria (with full reduction yielding Ce2O3) through formation of oxygen vacancies. This process results in the transfer of two electrons from oxygen to Ce, with two Ce ions each being reduced to Ce3+, giving partially reduced CeO2. Partially reduced CeO2 can be reoxidized by an oxygen source, for example, the atmosphere or a molecule such as NO2.
A large number of chemical reactions have been studied with ceria as the catalyst, key among these being CO oxidation to CO2. (6-15) This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced. Recent work indicates that healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen (11, 17) or with NO2 (18, 19) is favorable so that the determining step is the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy. The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in bulk CeO2 is ca.4.5 eV. (20-22) Calculations on the low index surfaces of ceria, namely, (111), (110), and (100), show notably smaller oxygen vacancy formation energies. (14, 23-27) However, recent experimental work has shown that the strategy of doping of ceria with other metal cations is one potentially fruitful means of enhancing CO oxidation. (28-34) This work has shown that metal dopants can enhance the oxygen vacancy formation energy and reactivity of ceria. In parallel, there have been a number of modeling studies of metal doping of ceria bulk and surfaces, which also show a smaller oxygen vacancy formation energy upon doping. (11, 12, 34-44) Trivalent dopants, such as La3+ and Eu3+, have been investigated (28, 32) and give an improved rate of conversion of CO to CO2. However, this appears to happen only up to a certain concentration, of around 20%, of the dopant. Beyond this concentration, the reactivity decreases, and this is thought to be due to separation into the individual oxides, CeO2 and M2O3. In a previous study, we presented a first-principles analysis of La3+ doping of the (111) and (110) ceria surfaces (43, 45) and found the following: (i) La doping introduces a polaron hole state due to formation of localized O, (ii) formation of a compensating oxygen vacancy (which is the standard defect for lower valent doped systems) has an energy cost, (iii) when the oxygen vacancy forms the hole accompanying the dopant is not compensated, instead, a Ce3+ ion and an oxygen hole are present, and (iv) La doping of both surfaces makes them more reactive to CO oxidation compared with the undoped surfaces. This is particularly impressive for the (111) surface, which, when undoped, shows no interaction with CO, a finding borne out by experimental work on CO oxidation (8, 9) on ceria nanoparticles and reaction of oxygen with nanoparticles. (46) In that work, density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) was applied to Ce, which is a standard approach (47, 48) that has been applied in many papers, (10-12, 14, 17, 18, 20, 23-26, 35-45, 49, 50) but also to the O 2p states in order to correctly describe the oxygen hole that results upon trivalent doping of CeO2; (43, 45) the use of a +U correction on O 2p states stems from the need to describe localized oxygen polarons that result from substitutional doping of Ce with a lower valent dopant, as previously discussed for La doping of CeO2. This approach has also been used to recover the oxygen polaron in other materials, such as Li-doped MgO (17, 51) and Al-doped SiO2 (52) (see also refs 53 and 54); some further references on this general problem are 5559. As far as we are aware, La is the only trivalent dopant to have been modeled as a dopant in ceria using first-principles simulations. With the unexpected behavior of La-doped CeO2, it is, therefore, beneficial to investigate other trivalent dopants in CeO2 in order to understand more generally the effect of aliovalent doping on the properties of ceria. Although DFT+U is well established in studying ceria, it is not without problems, in particular, the empiricism associated with a choice of U and the dependence of material properties on the value of U used in the calculation. Hybrid DFT in a plane-wave basis set is now available and has been used in a number of papers over the last 2 years to study troublesome defect states in some metal oxides, including in ceria, (-26, 41, 42, 60-62) providing an excellent description of many properties. Hybrid DFT is applied in the form of the screened exchange functional HSE06. (63, 64) Although hybrid DFT also includes parameters that need to be identified, namely, the exchange contribution and the exchange screening distance, these have been determined to be most optimum at values of 25% and 0.2/Å (63, 64)and are taken to be universal parameters. In addition, the cost of the hybrid DFT calculation in a plane-wave basis set limits the size of the system that can be studied. For this paper, it is possible to study one trivalent dopant in the (110) surface with hybrid DFT.
This paper has two major aims: the first is to confirm the DFT+U description of trivalent-doped CeO2 using hybrid DFT, and the second is to use DFT+U to study the charge compensation mechanism in trivalent-doped CeO2 and develop a more general understanding of doping in ceria. The dopants used are Al3+, Sc3+, In3+, and Y3+, which have differing ionic radii, Al3+ being the smallest ion and Y3+ the largest ion. We also make reference to our previous results on La3+ doping where needed. (43, 45) Comparison of the hybrid DFT and DFT+U results confirm the DFT+U description so that for investigation of the anion vacancy compensation mechanism (which requires a larger surface supercell and a larger number of calculations), we can apply DFT+U.
Our results show that each dopant forms a localized oxygen hole on one or two oxygen atoms neighboring the dopant. However, the most stable defect, whether the oxygen hole polaron or the anion vacancy, depends on the ionic radius of the dopant. Al3+ is the smallest dopant, and Y3+ is the closest in radius to Ce. The former results in oxygen vacancy compensation, whereas the latter is similar to La in that oxygen vacancy compensation is not spontaneous and results in a different electronic structure. 2 Methods We use a slab model of the ceria (110) surface and a plane-wave basis set to describe the valence electronic wave functions with the VASP code. (65) The cutoff for the kinetic energy is 396 eV. For the corevalence interaction, we apply Blchls projector augmented wave (PAW) approach. (66) For Ce, we use 12 valence electrons and for O, a [He] core. For the dopants, we use the following cores: Al3+ [Ne] core, Sc3+ [Ar] core, In3+ [Kr] core, and Y3+ [Kr] core. Tables of ionic radii (67) show that Al3+, Sc3+, and In3+ are smaller than Ce4+, with Al3+ having a notably smaller ionic radius, whereas Y3+ has a larger ionic radius than Ce4+. We use the PerdewBurkeErnzerhof (PBE) approximation for the exchange-correlation functional. (68) In common with other studies on ceria, we use density functional theory (DFT) corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U), where UCe4f = 5 eV and is applied to the Ce 4f states and, in addition, for oxygen, UO2p = 7 eV and is applied to the O 2p states. The details of this approach and our choice of U are discussed extensively in refs 23, 24, 43, 45, and 51. For some calculations, the hybrid HSE06 screened exchange functional is used, with a 25% HartreeFock contribution and a screening length of 0.2/Å. k-Point sampling is performed using the MonkhorstPack scheme, with a (2 × 2 × 1) sampling grid.
In the Tasker classification, (69) the (110) surface is a type I surface, with neutral CeO2 planes along the slab. (2 × 2) and (4 × 2) surface cell expansions are used, in which one dopant gives an overall doping level of 1.8% and 3.6% for the larger and smaller surface cell expansions. In the (4 × 2) surface cell, two dopants give a doping concentration of 3.6%. The surface dopant concentration is 25% in the smaller surface supercell and 12.5% in the larger surface supercell. The slab model for both surface expansions is seven CeO2 layers (11.5 Å) thick, with a 12 Å vacuum gap, and the bottom two layers were fixed during the relaxations. All calculations are spin-polarized with no restrictions on the overall spin.
It is well known that substituting an M4+ cation in a metal oxide with a lower valence M3+ cation results in formation of a localized electronic hole (a polaron) on an oxygen atom neighboring the dopant. (50-59) This electronic hole gives rise to issues with the description of the resulting electronic structure using DFT, which we, for example, have discussed in detail for Li-doped MgO and Si-doped Al2O3 (50-52) and in our previous work on La3+ doping of ceria, (43, 45) providing a strong rationale for adopting this approach. Morgan and Watson (70) have also used U on oxygen in TiO2 to describe localized states in defective TiO2. Comparison of the DFT+U results will be made with the hybrid DFT for one dopant in the (2 × 2) surface cell.
The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in doped ceria is given by (1) with the dopant and vacancy concentrations calculated from the subscripts on the dopant, M, and O in eq 1. The energy of O2 is computed using UO2p = 7 eV for those calculations in which UO2p is used on the oxide. Throughout this paper, a negative energy signifies that formation of an oxygen vacancy is favorable. 3 Results
3.1 A Single Trivalent Dopant in the CeO2(110) Surface
We begin by describing the atomic structure of the (110) surface with the introduction of one trivalent dopant. The undoped (110) surface has stoichiometric CeO2 layers along the slab, and in the surface layer, the CeO distances are 2.34 and 2.32 Å to the first subsurface layer.
In Figure 1, we show the top view of the (2 × 4) surface supercell with a dopant in the surface layer and we also show the pertinent dopantO distances in angstroms. For Al3+ doping, the AlO distances are 1.76 and 1.82 Å to surface oxygen and 1.78 and 1.81 Å to subsurface oxygen. There are two elongated AlO distances, 3.09 and 3.26 Å; these are indicated with the dashed line between Al and O. The CeO distances in the surface are generally little changed, apart from those involving the oxygen atoms that move away from Al3+. These oxygen have shorter distances to the nearest Ce ions, and the local structure around the dopant is strongly distorted.
Figure 1 Figure 1. Structure around the dopant site for the trivalent-doped CeO2(110) surface from DFT+U using a (2 × 4) surface supercell: (a) Al3+, (b) Sc3+, (c) In3+, and (d) Y3+. All distances are shown in Å.
With Sc3+ doping, there is one elongated ScO distance of 2.46 Å, with the three remaining surface oxygens showing ScO distances of 2.31 (×2) and 2.05 Å. With In3+ doping, there is one elongated InO distance of 2.36 Å, with three further InO distances of 2.29 (×2) and 2.22 Å. Finally, with Y3+ doping, there is one YO distance of 2.46 Å and the remaining YO distances are 2.40, 2.31, and 2.29 Å. Thus, apart from Al doping, introduction of the dopant into the (110) ceria surface leads to formation of one elongated dopantO distance in the surface. Al doping shows two elongated dopantO distances.
It is interesting to consider the ionic radius of Ce and the dopants in understanding these distortions to the structures around the dopant. The ionic radius of Ce4+ is 0.87 Å, and those of the dopants are the following: Al3+, 0.39 Å; Sc3+, 0.75 Å; In3+, 0.80 Å; and Y3+, 0.96 Å. Examining the dopantO distances, we see that the very small Al3+ cation attempts to shorten as many cationO distances as possible in order to obtain a coordination environment favorable for its ionic radius. This then leaves the remaining AlO distances notably elongated and results in a substantial distortion around the dopant site. As one goes from Sc3+ to In3+ to Y3+, the dopant ionic radius approaches that of Ce4+ and the dopant is better able to be accommodated in the ceria lattice; the dopantO distances and their more uniform distribution reflect the larger dopant ionic radii. For reference, La3+ has an ionic radius of 1.16 Å and distorts the structure around its lattice site, with longer LaO distances compared with the undoped surface; this arises from the larger size of La3+ relative to Ce4+.
In Figure 2, we show, for the example of Al3+ and In3+ as dopants, the DFT+U and HSE06 surface geometry of the doped (110) surface in a (2 × 2) surface supercell expansion. The shortened AlO distances are 1.84, 1.87, 1.88, and 2.21 Å, whereas the elongated AlO distances are 2.39 and 2.40 Å with DFT+U. With HSE06, the same AlO distances are 1.89, 1.89, 1.97, and 2.11 Å for the shorter AlO distances and 2.35 and 2.39 Å for the longer AlO distances.
Figure 2 Figure 2. Structure around the dopant site for the example of the Al3+- and In3+-doped CeO2(110) surface from (a) Al3+ DFT+U, (b) In3+ DFT+U, (c) Al3+ HSE06, and (d) In3+ HSE06 using a (2 × 2) surface supercell. All distances are shown in Å.
For In3+, the DFT+U InO distances are 2.23, 2.24, 2.25, 2.26, 2.27, and 2.29 Å, and with HSE06, the InO distances are 2.20, 2.23, 2.25, 2.25, 2.26, and 2.27 Å. For Y doping, the YO distances with DFT+U are 2.20, 2.20, 2.30, 2.31, 2.36, and 2.44 Å, and with HSE06, they are 2.20, 2.21, 2.33, 2.33, 2.35, and 2.43 Å. Thus, for larger dopants, the difference between DFT+U and HSE atomic structure is quite small, as are the differences between the two surface supercells. For Al in the smaller surface supercell, although the DFT+U and hybrid DFT geometry around the dopant site are reasonably similar, there are quantitative differences that are more noticeable when compared with the larger dopants. Despite this, the geometry data give encouragement in using DFT+U to describe these systems.
Comparing surface supercells, we do see a stronger distortion of the geometry around Al3+ in the larger surface supercell expansion. This may be a consequence of the effect of dopant concentration in each surface model, with the smaller surface supercell expansion putting more of a constraint on the extent of distortion possible upon doping. However, both models do show that Al3+ produces a large structural distortion upon substitution in the CeO2 surface.
The spin densities for selected dopants in (a) the (2 × 2) surface supercell with DFT+U and HSE06 and (b) in the(2 × 4) surface supercell with DFT+U are shown in Figure 3. In the larger surface supercell, Al3+ and Sc3+ doping results in formation of an oxygen hole that is predominantly localized on one oxygen atom, with a spin magnetization of 0.75 (Al3+) and 0.74 (Sc3+) electrons and a spreading onto a second oxygen, which has a spin magnetization of 0.15 electrons in both structures. For In3+, the hole is split over two oxygen atoms, with a spin magnetization of 0.47 and 0.58 electrons (we were unable to find a stable solution with the hole localized on one oxygen atom). Finally, with Y3+, the oxygen hole is localized onto one oxygen atom with a spin magnetization of 0.75 electrons, whereas a second oxygen atom has a spin magnetization of 0.15 electrons. With no +U correction on oxygen, we find the hole completely delocalized over the surface oxygen atoms of the (110) surface.
Figure 3 Figure 3. Spin density of selected trivalent-doped CeO2(110) structures from DFT+U and hybrid DFT: (a) Al DFT+U (2 × 4) surface, (b) Al DFT+U (2 × 2) surface, (c) Al HSE (2 × 2) surface, (d) In DFT+U (2 × 4) surface, (e) In DFT+U (2 × 2) surface, (f) In HSE (2 × 2) surface, (g) Y DFT+U (2 × 4) surface, (h) Y DFT+U (2 × 2) surface, and (i) Y HSE (2 × 2) surface.
Turning now to the smaller surface supercell, we compare the hole localization with DFT+U and HSE06. For Al3+ doping, with both approaches, the oxygen atom nearest Al3+ has a spin magnetization of 0.40 (DFT+U)/0.64 (HSE06) electrons and the other oxygen has a spin density of 0.40 (DFT+U)/0.22 (HSE06) of the electron; HSE06 gives stronger localization onto a single oxygen neighboring the dopant. With In3+ doping, the oxygen atom nearest In3+ has a spin magnetization of 0.40 (DFT+U)/0.62 (HSE06) electrons and the other oxygen having a spin density of 0.40 (DFT+U)/0.27 (HSE06) electrons. For Y3+, on one oxygen has a spin magnetization of 0.73 (DFT+U)/0.70 (HSE06) electrons and a second oxygen atom has a spin magnetization of 0.16 (DFT+U)/0.15 (HSE06) electrons. Thus, both DFT approaches give similar distributions of the oxygen polaron that results from trivalent doping, although Al3+ doping shows the largest differences between DFT+U and HSE06.
When comparing results between surface supercells, that is, dopant concentration, it is interesting that the smaller doping concentration for the small ionic radius dopants leads to a less strong localization of the oxygen hole with DFT+U. Hybrid DFT also shows this effect, but it is not as pronounced so that there may be effects described by hybrid DFT that are not captured by the DFT+U approach.
The electronic density of states projected onto the Ce 4f and O 2p states of doped ceria (PEDOS) are plotted in Figures 4 and 5 for the examples of Al3+ and Y3+ doping, respectively. The PEDOS for the other dopants is similar and is not shown. All dopants show a Ce 4f PEDOS typical for oxidized Ce4+, with no states between the top of the valence band and the empty, narrow Ce 4f band. It is in the position of the gap state that the largest differences between the present DFT+U setup and hybrid DFT are evident. The use of hybrid DFT results in a larger energy gap between the valence band and the unoccupied Ce 4f states(as well as between the valence band and the Ce 5d states); see also refs 71 and 72. The energy gap with DFT+U depends on the value of U applied to the Ce 4f states and the O 2p states; the present values of U are chosen to describe consistently the formation of polaron states in reduced Ce and the O polaron. One could, of course, apply values of U that would recover the correct band gap of the host oxide, but these would then impact negatively on other material properties; for example, for Ce, values of U  7 eV position the Ce 4f states in the valence band. Thus, the choice of U parameters is always a compromise.

Figure 5 Figure 5. Ce and O 2p PEDOS for the Y3+-doped CeO2(110) surface. Top panel: DFT+U. Bottom panel: HSE06. The zero of energy in all plots is the Fermi level.
Turning to the oxygen 2p PEDOS, we see, for both dopants, that DFT+U and hybrid DFT result in formation of a spin-down unoccupied state above the Fermi level (which is set to 0 eV in Figures 4 and 5). This is the oxygen polaron state, arising from formation of a partially filled O 2p shell as a result of lower valent substitutional doping in ceria. (43, 45) With DFT+U, this state lies 1.7 and 1.2 eV above the Fermi level for Al3+ and Y3+, whereas with HSE06, the oxygen polaron state lies 2.5 and 2.1 eV above the Fermi level for Al and Y. The difference with HSE06 in terms of the position of the polaron electronic state is clear, with hybrid DFT giving a notably larger gap between the top of the valence band and the polaron state; a similar result is found for Sc3+ and In3+ doping (not shown). This difference has a simple origin in the energy gap between the valence band and conduction band found with DFT+U and hybrid DFT. The underestimation of this energy gap with DFT+U means that it is not possible to obtain the same position of the O polaron state with DFT+U as found with hybrid DFT. We have found the same issue with trivalent dopants in rutile TiO2, (72) and we make a general point that caution must be taken with the position of defect states in the band gap resulting from DFT+U calculations.
In general, although there are quantitative differences, the DFT+U and HSE06 descriptions of the formation of the oxygen hole polaron in trivalent-doped CeO2 are at least consistent, giving confidence in using DFT+U for subsequent calculations. In terms of dopant concentration, we do see some concentration effects when comparing the two different surface supercells, primarily that with a larger doping concentration for small ionic radius dopants. The distortions around the surface are less strong, and the hole is apparently more equally shared between two oxygen atoms. Nonetheless, the essential features of the oxygen hole polaron are still captured in these calculations.
3.2 Formation of the Charge Compensating Oxygen Vacancy
We study charge compensating oxygen vacancies in the doped (2 × 4) surface supercell of the (110) surface to allow two dopants and an oxygen vacancy to be accommodated at reasonable concentrations; with 184 atoms, the size of this slab model means that hybrid DFT cannot be used here and all results from this point are with DFT+U. Figure 6 shows the atomic structure of the (110) surface with two dopants in their most stable substitutional sites. The geometries are similar to the case of a single dopant in the same surface supercell, as is the formation of the oxygen hole polaron.
Figure 6 Figure 6. Atomic structure of the CeO2(110) surface in a (2 × 4) surface expansion with two substitutional dopants: (a) Al3+, (b) Sc3+, (c) In3+, and (d) Y3+.
In Table 1, we show the oxygen vacancy formation energies for the most stable oxygen vacancy site in each oxygen vacancy compensated structure; the structures themselves are shown in Figure 7. The formation energies of the compensating oxygen vacancy do not always fit with the generally assumed oxygen vacancy compensation model, in which a trivalent dopant is accompanied with spontaneous formation of a charge compensating oxygen vacancy, in contrast to refs 72 and 73, where trivalent doping of TiO2 is accompanied by formation of an oxygen vacancy. For Al3+, Sc3+, and In3+, because the computed formation energies are negative, this does indicate that spontaneous formation of a compensating oxygen vacancy can occur. However, for Y3+ and La3+, (43, 45) the formation energies are positive so that charge compensation via oxygen vacancy formation is not necessarily spontaneous.

Compensating Oxygen Vacancy Formation Energies, EOvac, for the Dopants Studied in This Work in eVa dopant Al Sc In Y Lab dopant ionic radius (Å) 0.39 0.75 0.80 0.96 1.16 EOvac 0.13 0.00 0.18 +0.47 +0.65 aA negative energy signifies that the oxygen vacancy will form spontaneously. The dopant ionic radii are given from ref 75, with that of Ce4+ being 0.87 Å. bThe results for La3+ doping are from ref 45 and are included for comparison.
Figure 7 Figure 7. Atomic structures of the most stable compensating oxygen vacancy sites in the CeO2(110) surface: (a) Al3+, (b) Sc3+, (c) In3+, and (d) Y3+. The vacancy site is indicated with a V.
However, these are 0 K calculations, and if one considers the effects of temperature and a real experimental environment, for example, in water gas shift conditions, then formation of an oxygen vacancy will be more favorable so that, for each dopant, one would expect formation of the compensating oxygen vacancy. Despite this, the trends found when comparing dopants should remain.
In addition, one must consider the possible errors in the DFT+U formation energies, which should be compared with hybrid DFT results; however, as discussed above, hybrid DFT simulations on the necessary structures are presently not feasible. Comparing with other oxides, we have shown that, for trivalent-doped TiO2, (72) the formation energies of the charge compensating oxygen vacancy with hybrid DFT are notably lower than the DFT+U formation energies, enhancing the stability of the oxygen vacancy compensated structures, although the qualitative trends in the energies were the same with both approaches. We have also found for divalent dopants in ceria (111) and (110) surfaces (74) that the hybrid DFT oxygen vacancy formation energies are lower (more negative) than the DFT+U formation energies. This leads us to suggest that, for the present systems, a hybrid DFT calculation of the formation energy of the compensating oxygen vacancy will be more negative than the DFT+U formation energy, although the trends in stability with the dopant ionic radius should be maintained.
Taking these dopants together, there is a trend, as follows. The dopants with an ionic radius smaller than Ce4+ have a preference to form the compensating oxygen vacancy, although the stabilization of the oxygen vacancy structure is not large. The dopants with larger ionic radii than Ce4+ prefer not to form the oxygen vacancy compensated structure, showing an energy cost for formation of the oxygen vacancy, although this cost is not very high.
Let us now examine the electronic structure of the oxygen vacancy compensated structures, with the spin density inFigure 8. It is expected that, when the dopant is compensated with an oxygen vacancy, there will be no oxygen polaron states present. In Figure 8a, Al3+ shows compensation of the oxygen polaron, as indicated by no spin density, and the PEDOS in Figure 9a shows no defect states.

Figure 9 Figure 9. Ce 4f and O 2p PEDOS for two substituted 3+ dopants with a compensating oxygen vacancy: (a) Al3+, (b) In3+, and (c) Y3+. The zero of energy is the Fermi level.
For the other dopants, the situation is different. Figure 8bd shows spin density plots for Sc3+, In3+, and Y3+ doping with the compensating oxygen vacancy. In these plots, we see spin density isosurfaces consistent with an oxygen hole polaron and reduced Ce3+, which are confirmed by the PEDOS plots in Figure 9 and the computed spin magnetizations. The PEDOS plots show states in the band gap due to the oxygen hole polaron and Ce3+. The spin magnetizations on the Ce3+ ion are 0.95 (Sc3+), 0.97 (In3+), and 0.97 electrons (Y3+), whereas the spin magnetizations on the polaron oxygen are 0.80 (Sc3+), 0.74 (In3+), and 0.72 electrons (Y3+). We have also found this defect state to be the most stable for La-doped (111) and (110) surfaces. (43, 45) It may be surprising that oxygen vacancy compensation on some trivalent-doped ceria surfaces results in formation of Ce3+ and an oxygen hole, because it is generally accepted that the formation of an oxygen vacancy defect compensates an aliovalent dopant with a lower oxidation state; for example, in Li-doped MgO (even with U = 7 eV on O 2p states), oxygen vacancy formation always compensates the two electronic holes. (17) For TiO2, it is known that an Al dopant is compensated with an oxygen vacancy. (59, 72, 73) A well-known example is trivalent-doped zirconia in refs 76 and 77, where oxygen vacancies are found to compensate the oxygen hole introduced by the dopant. In these examples, we see that hole compensation is favored over cation reduction, because Mg and Zr are not reducible, although TiO2 is considered a reducible oxide.
In our previous work, (43, 45) we suggested that the results for La-doped CeO2 can be best understood by considering the nature of the host oxide: cerium is more easily reduced compared with the cations above, and formation of an oxygen vacancy resulting in formation of reduced Ce3+ is quite favorable. In general, we propose that energetics of cerium reduction mean that, upon oxygen vacancy formation, it is favorable to reduce one Ce4+ ion to Ce3+ and compensate one oxygen hole, rather than compensate both electronic holes as in other oxides so that a key role in determining the defects formed upon trivalent doping of ceria is played by the cerium cation. In contrast, TiO2 shows only compensation of the oxygen hole upon oxygen vacancy formation.
However, Al3+ as a trivalent dopant in CeO2 appears to be an exception in that its defect chemistry leads to spontaneous compensation of the oxygen holes. We attribute this to the smaller ionic radius of Al3+ compared with that of Ce4+ (and the other cation dopants considered), which leads to the strongest distortions around the dopant site. It is most likely that these distortions favor the compensation of the oxygen hole over formation of Ce3+. This finding highlights the complexity in determining the impact of the dopant on the stable defect state in doped ceria. It is not simply enough to consider the different oxidation states of the dopant and the host cation. One must also consider the local coordination environment and dopant ionic radius and examine the effect of the dopant on the defects that are formed. In any case, experimental investigations of these systems to establish their stable defects are suggested. 4 Conclusions When the (110) surface of ceria is doped with trivalent cations, the most stable defect depends on the ionic radius of the dopant. For small ionic radius dopants, with a large mismatch to the host oxide, the structure is strongly distorted. For Al, Sc, and In, the most stable defect is the oxygen vacancy compensating two dopants. For Y and La, the most stable defect is MCe/ + OO• with one dopant and an oxygen hole. It is also very interesting that, for Al, the electronic structure is typical of the classical oxygen vacancy compensating defect mechanism; but in this structure, the other dopants all show formation of a reduced Ce3+ ion and an uncompensated oxygen hole. We attribute this to the ease of reducibility of Ce and urge experiments on these systems to eslish the nature of the defect in trivalent-doped ceria.
