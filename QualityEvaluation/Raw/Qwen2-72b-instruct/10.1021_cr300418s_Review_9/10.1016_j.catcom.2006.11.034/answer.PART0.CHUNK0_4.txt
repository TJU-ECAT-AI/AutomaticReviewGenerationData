1.The document does not provide information on the preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts, nor does it discuss their influence on electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2. It does not address the challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in nickel oxide-based catalytic systems.
