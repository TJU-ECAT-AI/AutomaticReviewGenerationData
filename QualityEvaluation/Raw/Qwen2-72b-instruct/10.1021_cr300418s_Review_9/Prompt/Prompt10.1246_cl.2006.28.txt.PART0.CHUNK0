Correlation between catalytic performance and surface acidity has been found.
Catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2-EBDH) has recently been attempted to explore a new technology for producing styrene selectively be- cause it could provide us with an energy-saving and environ- mentally friendly process to utilize CO2, a greenhouse gas, as a mild oxidant.13 Several families of the catalysts, mainly based on supported or mixed oxides of Fe, V, or Cr were found to be active and selective in the CO2-EBDH.214 However, most of the catalysts have usually shown strong deactivation for this re- action during even a few hours on stream. As a typical example,over MgAlV mixed oxides, the initial styrene yield, 64% after 1 h on stream, decreased to 40% after 7 h.7 The similar deactiva- tion rate was observed also for VOx/MgO catalyst.3 We have proposed a very active and selective catalyst, V0:43Sb0:57Ox/ Al2O3 (VSb/Al), but its deactivation was also significant mainly owing to coke formation although the deactivation rate was less than other reported catalysts.12,13 Since the coke precursors are easily formed through the oligomerization of olefins, facilitation of olefins desorption from a catalyst surface could minimize the carbon accumulation.
Taking into consideration a basic character of electron-rich olefins including styrene, lower surface acidity of the catalyst appears to induce easier desorption of olefins from the catalyst surface. VOx catalysts loaded on MgAl oxide support exhibited a decreased adsorption and rapid desorption of propylene as compared with those on alumina.14,15 Based on these considera- tions, an attempt has been made to stabilize the activity of VSb/ Al catalyst in the CO2-EBDH by the modification of the alumina support with a basic MgO component.
MgO-modified alumina (MgnAl) supports were obtained by impregnation of an activated alumina with aqueous solutions containing a certain amount of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O (MgnAl; n is an atomic ratio of Mg/Al  0:1, 0.3, or 0.5) followed by calci- nation at 670 C. Alumina (Al)- or MgnAl-supported vanadium antimony oxide catalysts were prepared by impregnation with the solutions of NH4VO3 and SbCl3 followed by calcination at 650 C. The loading of the supported V0:43Sb0:57Ox component (20 wt %) was the same for all samples. The catalyst supports and supported catalysts were characterized by BET specific sur- face area (SBET) measurements (Micrometrics model ASAP 2400), X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku D/MAX-3B diffrac- tometer) and the NH3-temperature-programmed-desorption method (NH3-TPD) (Micrometrics, TPD/TPR 027 Option).
The catalytic tests were performed with 1 g of catalyst at 595 C under atmospheric pressure in an isothermal fixed bed flow reactor of the continuous micro-activity test unit. The ethyl- benzene feed rate was 8.2 mmol/h, molar ratio CO2/EB  5, to- tal flow rate of the gas mixture of CO2 and N2 was 45 mL/min.
The components of reaction mixtures were analyzed by on-line gas chromatograph.
VSb/Al and VSb/MgnAl catalysts are highly selective with respect to styrene (>95%). The VSb/Al and VSb/Mg0:1Al sam- ple showed similar initial styrene yield, YST  75 mol % after 1 h on-stream. However, considering the difference in their SBET values (87 and 67 m2/g, respectively), the VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst can be regarded as a little more active one due to its higher specific yield based on the SBET value (YST/SBET),
1.1%/m2 against 0.9%/m2 for the VSb/Al. The VSb/Mg0:3Al
and VSb/Mg0:5Al catalysts displayed substantially lower sty- rene yield (45 and 30%, respectively) due to their reduced spe- cific surface areas (48 and 38 m2/g, respectively) but their YST/ SBET values (0.90.8%/m2) are very close to that for the VSb/Al catalyst. Thus, the specific surface areas of the catalysts decrease with an increase of MgO-content, affecting only slightly their specific activities. The activities of the supported VSb oxide catalysts in the CO2-EBDH are mainly determined by the sup- 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 0 20 40 60 80 100 Styrene Yield / % Time-on-stream / h Figure 1.

When we checked the content of carbon formation on each catalyst after 12 h on stream, we observed that Mg-modified catalysts reveal less carbon formation (4.4
6.0 wt %) as compared with VSb/Al (13.1 wt %), indicating
that modification of alumina support with magnesia leads to the stable activity, at least partly, due to strong resistance against carbon formation.
As illustrated in NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 2), the VSb/ MgnAl catalysts contain smaller amounts of surface acid sites compared with the un-modified VSb/Al catalyst. Thus,the higher Mg-content leads to the lower acidity. Therefore,the better stability of the MgO-containing catalysts is ascribed to their reduced surface acidities.
According to XRD patterns (Figure 3), both Mg0:1Al sup- port and VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst do not contain a free crystalline MgO phase. Instead they showed a fully incorporated into spinel-like binary oxide phase, MgAl6O10. However, a crystal- line MgO is distinctively observed in the Mg0:3Al and Mg0:5Al whose major phase is MgAl2O4. Trace of free MgO particles is also detectable when the VSb oxide is loaded on these sup- port materials. However, taking into account no detectable phase of vanadium oxide in XRD, a catalytically active V-component appears to be well dispersed on the support materials. It was found that XRD peaks of VSbO4like phases, which are well de- tectable in the VSb/Al12,13 and VSb/Mg0:1Al catalysts, are very weak in the VSb/Mg0:3Al and, moreover, they fully disappear in the VSb/Mg0:5Al catalyst. This result implies the stronger inter- action between acidic VSb oxide and MgnAl support materials while using a large content of basic MgO in catalyst preparation.
The increased acidbase interaction might lead to the formation of magnesium vanadate(s) with the lower specific surface area,which is probably two-dimensional and un-detectable phase in
XRD. It is reasonably assumed that a decrease in an amount of
active V-species exposed at the catalyst surface diminishes the EB-conversions compared with those over VSb/Al and VSb/ Mg0:1Al samples.
In summary, this work demonstrates that a favorable balance between the decreased acidity of the VSb oxide catalyst sup- ported on MgO-modified alumina and an amount of VSb oxide species is needed for the stable and active catalytic performance in the CO2-EBDH. As a result, modification of alumina support with an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al  0:1) leads to the stable activity of the VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst for the reaction.
