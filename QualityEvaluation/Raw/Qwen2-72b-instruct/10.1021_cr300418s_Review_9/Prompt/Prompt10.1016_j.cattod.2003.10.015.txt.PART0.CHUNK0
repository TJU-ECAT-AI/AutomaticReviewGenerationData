1. Introduction
Styrene, an important monomer for synthetic poly- mers, is commercially produced by the vapor phase catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EBDH).
This process is carried out at high-temperature (550650 C) with large excess of superheated steam.
However, it is thermodynamically limited and energy consuming. Use of traditional oxidantoxygen allows to overcome the thermodynamic limitation,and, consequently, to operate at lower temperatures with an exothermic reaction.

Park). a co-product and thus to displace the dehydrogena- tion equilibrium has been commercialized [1], but a process with direct use of oxygen for oxidative de- hydrogenation has not been realized yet because of a significant loss of styrene selectivity by the produc- tion of carbon oxides and oxygenates [2]. Therefore,another desirable oxidant has sought for a long time.
Recently, several attempts were carried out to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for EBDH and at the same time to utilize effectively CO2, the global warm- ing gas [326]. It has been reported that carbon diox- ide could play a role as the soft oxidant as well as the diluent in the EBDH reaction with CO2 (CO2-EBDH),different from steam and oxygen employing as the diluent and the oxidant, respectively, in the non-oxidative and O2-oxidative dehydrogenation [25].

known as an active component of industrial catalysts for non-oxidative EBDH process, were mainly used.
Meanwhile, it is known that various V-containing ox- ide systems, such as VMg, VCr, VP, VMo, VSb,etc. are active and selective in the relative reactions of selective oxidation, oxidative dehydrogenation and ammoxidation of lower paraffins and alkylaromatics [2735], including the oxidative EBDH with oxy- gen [3235]. However, V-containing catalysts for the CO2-EBDH reaction have been reported only by few groups [1316,2326]. Suzuki and co-workers [1315] reported that active carbon-supported vana- dium catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity in EBDH to give styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide.
However, it suffered from severe catalyst deactiva- tion due to coke deposition. We also recently re- ported high selectivity (>95%) and catalytic activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide (V/Al) in the CO2-EBDH along with some arguments in favor of the carbon dioxide action as the soft oxidant [2326].
Among a series of tested additives to VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, antimony oxide was found to be the best sec- ond additional component improving the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst activity and stability [26]. The objective of this work is to study the nature of promotional effect and role of antimony on the improved VSbOx/Al2O3 catalyst in the CO2-EBDH reaction.
2. Experimental
V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts were prepared by im- pregnation of activated alumina (Aldrich 19,996-6, SBET = 121 m2/g) with aqueous solutions of am- monium metavanadate and antimony (III) chloride (Aldrich) along with tartaric acid. Subscript numbers of V and Sb in the formulae of VSbOx/Al2O3 indicate the atomic percentages of the element in the supported binary system. The impregnated samples were dried at 120 C and then calcined in air at 600 C for 4 h.
The total amount of the supported oxide component was 20 wt.%.
The calcined samples were characterized by means of BET specific surface area (SSA) measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spec- troscopy (XPS), hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and CO2 pulse method. SSA data were calculated from N2 adsorption isotherms using a Micrometrics model ASAP 2400. XRD pat- terns were recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX-3B diffrac- tometer using monochromatic Cu K radiation. The X-ray photoelectron spectra were obtained using an ESCALAB MK II spectrometer provided with a hemispherical electron analyzer and Al anode X-ray exciting source (Al K = 1487.6 eV). The binding energies (BE) were referred to the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. For the Sb 3d core level spectra,the less intense Sb 3d3/2 peak of the Sb 3d doublet was taken for calculation based on the overlapping of the principal Sb 3d5/2 peak with the much more intense O1s peak. V 2p3/2 peak fitting was performed using symmetrical GaussianLorenzian (80/20) lines with the following constraints for all oxidation states:non-linear Shirley background subtraction, an in- tensity ratio of V 2p3/2 to V 2p1/2 of 2.19, and a doublet separation (V 2p1/2V 2p3/2) of 7.37.6 eV.
Temperature-programmed reduction of the catalysts with hydrogen (5 vol.% H2 in helium) was performed from 100 to 900 C with heating rate of 10 C/min in a conventional flow system equipped with a TCD detector for monitoring of the H2 consumption. The samples (100 mg) were previously calcined in a flow of air at 600 C for 1 h and then cooled down to 100 C. In order to estimate the re-oxidizability with carbon dioxide of the pre-reduced catalysts, CO2 pulse experiments were conducted at 600 C in the quartz reactor with 200 mg of the catalyst. Prior to these experiments, the catalysts were partially reduced at 600 C for 30 min in 5 vol.% H2 in He flow. Pulses of carbon dioxide (250 l CO2) were injected into inert helium flow (30 cm3/min) using gas sampling valve installed between the sample inlet and GC column.
The catalytic tests in the CO2-EBDH reaction were carried out in a micro-activity test unit (Zeton, MAT 2000) with a fixed bed isothermal reactor under atmo- spheric pressure. A catalyst sample of 1 g was placed into reactor on a quartz wool support. Ethylben- zene was introduced by a syringe pump with a feed
8.2 mmol/h and supplied into the reactor with a carrier
gas mixture CO2 and N2 (total flow rate: 45 cm3/min).
Nitrogen was used as inert diluent component as well as the internal standard for gas analysis. Gas com- ponents of the reaction mixture (H2, N2, CO, CH4, CO2) were analyzed by the TCD of the on-line gas chromatograph. Liquid products (benzene, toluene,ethylbenzene, styrene) were collected each 30 min

207 and analyzed by FID of the GC. Catalyst behavior was characterized by EB conversion degree, X(EB), initial yield of styrene after 1 h on-stream, Y1, selectivity to styrene, S(ST), and relative loss of styrene yield after 4 h time-on-stream, RLSY(4) = Y1 Y4/Y1.
3. Results
Table 1 summarizes the catalytic behaviors of alumina-supported vanadium oxide and VSb ox- ide catalysts in the CO2-EBDH reaction at 595 C.
For this reaction, styrene is a main product. Only small amounts of benzene and toluene are obtained as by-products in the condensate along with traces of methane in gaseous products. All catalysts stud- ied demonstrate high selectivity to styrene (>95%).
The V/Al catalyst exhibits initially high styrene yield (Y1 71%). As the reaction proceeds, catalytic activity decreases significantly. This was mainly due to coke formation, as evidenced by intense COx-evolution to give the recovered activity during the reoxidation of the used catalyst in an air stream at more than 550 C; over-reduction of vanadium oxidation state also takes place. The addition of antimony oxide, which is almost inactive by itself [26], into V/Al increases not only the initial styrene yield (up to Y1 = 76%), but also provides stable cat- alytic performance. Among the VSb/Al systems, the
V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst is found to be the best one.
The XRD patterns of fresh and used V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. Besides the weak diffraction lines of Al2O3, the distinct reflec- tions of the V2O5-phase, shcherbinaite (411426 file in the JCPDS database), are observed in the fresh V/Al. After catalytic testing, V2O5-type phase trans- forms into V2O3, karelianite (340187).

This phase remains in the used catalyst.

The BEs of V 2p3/2 (517.2517.6 eV) for the fresh V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts are corresponded to V5+ species [36,37]; the incorporation of antimony into V/Al increases the BE (and the oxidation state) of surface vanadium species. All VSb/Al catalysts show almost the same BEs for Sb 3d3/2, identifying as the 208

Sb5+ species [36]. Parameters of the Sb 3d peaks for these samples remain unchanged after catalytic runs.
BEs of V 2p3/2 peaks for the VSb/Al catalysts remain almost unchanged after catalytic measurement, but full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the V 2p3/2 for the used V/Al catalyst is significantly increased relative to the fresh one, i.e., from 1.90 to 3.16 eV,revealing the notable reduction of surface vanadium species during the reaction. To interpret the change of FWHM of the V 2p3/2 peaks after reaction, they were fitted for V5+, V4+ and V3+ components using the same method performed by the previous work [30].
The results of deconvolution point out that the incor- poration of antimony into the V/Al catalyst increases the content of V5+ species very much as compared Fig. 2. H2-TPR profiles of (a) V/Al and (b) V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalysts. to that of the V/Al catalyst and, moreover, the used
V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst practically does not contain
V3+ species as the deeply reduced oxidation state.
H2-TPR profiles of the V/Al and V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalysts are presented in Fig. 2. The reduction pat- tern of V/Al sample comprises three peaks, i.e., two intense and sharp high-temperature peaks centered at 663 and 783 C and a low-temperature peak centered at 500 C. The high-temperature peaks are similar to those detected in the literature [3840], which are attributed to the reduction of bulk vanadium pentox- ide to V6O13 at 663 C and to V2O4 at 783 C. The low-temperature peak is analogous to the one that was assigned to the reduction of supported V2O5-phase in the VOx/-Al2O3 system [41]. Judging from the

209 Fig. 3. Amounts of CO formed under pulse injections of CO2 on pre-reduced (a) V/Al and (b) V0.43Sb0.57/Al oxide catalysts at 600 C (see text for test conditions). result, it is reasonable that the high-temperature peaks correspond to the reduction of three-dimensional V2O5, whereas the low-temperature peak corresponds to the surface vanadium oxide dispersed on the sup- port. For the H2-TPR profile of the V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst, the highest-temperature peak at 783 C dis- appears completely and the intensity of the second one centered at 655 C decreases greatly. Instead,the low-temperature peak becomes the dominant one.
The broadening of this peak implies a higher hetero- geneity and reducibility of vanadium species. These H2-TPR data clearly reveal that incorporation of the antimony promoter into V/Al increases the reducibil- ity of surface vanadium oxide and the amount of mobile oxygen species.
The amounts of CO produced according to se- quential injections of CO2 pulses at 600 C onto the pre-reduced catalysts are plotted in Fig. 3. The re- activity of the catalysts for the CO2 pulse reaction reflects the re-oxidizability of the reduced surfaces.
The formation of CO over the V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst is notably large during the first several CO2 pulses compared with that over the V/Al catalyst, implying that the partially reduced V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst is much easily interacted with CO2 compared with the partially reduced V/Al catalyst. Moreover, when the total amount of CO produced up to 45 CO2 pulses is estimated on the basis of the content of V2O5 in the catalysts, the data clearly point out the much high re-oxidizability of the V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst,i.e., 0.268 mol CO/mol V2O5 for V0.43Sb0.57/Al vs.
0.041 mol CO/mol V2O5 for V/Al.
4. Discussion
Catalytic results of Table 1 reveal that the catalytic activity is mainly determined by supported vanadium oxide species while the catalyst stability is controlled by antimony oxide. Although the initial styrene yields over Al2O3-supported VSb oxide catalysts contain- ing a medium level of Sb-content are slightly higher,their activities do not differ substantially when they are compared among themselves and with VOx/Al2O3.
However, the catalyst stability is much improved by the addition of the antimony promoter and its stabil- ity is much dependent on the V/Sb ratio in the cat- alysts. Among the supported VSb oxide catalysts,
V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3 is the most active and stable one.
XRD data shows the difference between the dis- persion of the supported VOx-component in the V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts. The fresh V/Al sample contains crystalline V2O5-phase, but this phase is transformed into V2O3 phase during the reaction. However, active 210

VOx-component in the fresh and used VSb/Al cata- lysts is amorphous. The VOx species was consistently observed only in a V0.9Sb0.1Ox/Al2O3 system with high V-concentration by means of laser Raman spec- troscopy [42], which is very sensitive to the presence of VOx species [43]. Raman spectra (not presented here) of the fresh sample showed a high background and only the bands corresponding to V2O5-phase with very low intensity [42]. However, after the catalytic test, no such a band was detected in the spectrum of the used sample, implying that the VOx-phase looses its crystallinity and the oxide becomes spread on the surface as amorphous vanadium oxides. Therefore, it is concluded that VOx active component of the VSb/Al catalysts is well dispersed on the support surface dif- ferent from the V/Al catalyst.
Catalytic behavior for selective oxidation on vana- dium oxide-based catalysts is related with the redox properties of vanadium species [28,29,4446]. It is generally accepted that active sites for these systems are to be the surface vanadium cations operating ac- cording to a Marsvan-Krevelen redox mechanism.
It can consequently be suggested that the easier re- dox cycle is an important factor to design the more effective catalyst [35]. The results of the study of oxidative dehydrogenation of lower paraffins over VOx/Al2O3 and V0.9Sb0.1Ox/Al2O3 catalysts by dif- ferential scanning calorimetry show that reaction occurs via a stepwise redox mechanism with the par- ticipation of lattice oxygen from the catalyst [47].
When the supported VOx-component is modified with antimony, the amount of reactive oxygen is increased and reductionreoxidation cycles of vanadium ion proceed more efficiently. At the same time, the addi- tion of antimony decreases the rate of coke formation [30,47,48], which explains the observed improvement in catalytic stability.
There is no doubt about redox nature of catalytic action of our V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts in the CO2-EBDH reaction. The surface and even the bulk of unstable V/Al catalyst are reduced strongly under reaction conditions: V2O5-type phase transforms into V2O3, and the latter is able to be reoxidized to V2O5 in a flow of air restoring its yellow color and initial activity. It is worthwhile to note that V2O3 was the only vanadium species observed in XRD patterns of both fresh and used samples of vanadium oxide/active carbon catalyst, which showed very low stability in the CO2-EBDH [13]. Deep vanadium reduction ex- tent from V5+ to V3+ also seems to be one of the main reasons of the deactivation of our V/Al catalyst because the reoxidation of these strongly reduced active sites can become the rate-limiting step. This was confirmed by pulse and DSC techniques for the V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst for oxydehydrogenation of ethane [49]. In propane ammoxidation on VSb oxide catalysts, Centi et al. [50,51] also reported the rela- tively low re-oxidizability of the reduced supra-surface vanadium oxide species which is responsible for the unselective conversion of propane to carbon oxides,forming usually from strongly adsorbed organic in- termediates similar to coke precursors. Datka et al.
[52] suggested that carboxylate species are formed as coke precursor in carbon oxides atmosphere on alumina surface. Taking into account the fact that EB is much stronger reductant than ethane or propane [45], adsorption of EB on the non-properly regener- ated active sites could hamper the redox cycle and become the reason of decreasing of activity of the V/Al catalyst. The observed enhancement of the cat- alytic behavior as a result of the addition of antimony oxide seems to be related with the improved catalyst reducibility (H2-TPR of Fig. 2) and re-oxidizability by CO2 (Fig. 3).
The role of antimony in the Sb-poor VSbOx/Al2O3 catalysts could be interpreted as a spillover oxygen donor in the frame of the remote control mechanism theory elaborated by Delmon [53]. A key to maximize catalytic performance of active reducible oxides, such as MoO3 [54,55] or V2O5 on alumina in the present work is to stabilize oxide surfaces at high or only slightly reduced suboxide oxidation state allowing the reductionoxidation cycles of catalytic surfaces to proceed rapidly and smoothly. Addition of spillover oxygen donor phases, like antimony oxide, to the reducible oxides (spillover oxygen acceptor) con- tributes to inhibition of their deep reduction, which may be attributable to the capability of spillover oxy- gen species to reoxidize the reduced active sites with high efficiency [54,55]. And it could suppress the formation of polymeric residues, which are hard to remove and often become precursors to complete oxi- dation products [55] and coke [47,48]. The formation of active oxygen species with the similar nature could occur during the dissociative adsorption of CO2 [56].
The better dispersion of vanadium oxide component
M.-S. Park et al. / Catalysis Today 87 (2003) 205212
211 on the support surface also contributed to the better stability of the VSb/Al catalysts providing easier re- ducible spread active VOx-component with increased amounts of mobile lattice oxygen. The most sta- ble V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst with the XRD-detectable
V1.1Sb0.9O4 phase practically does not contain after
catalytic test (XPS data) deeply reduced vanadium ion, V3+. This is consistent with the fast reoxidation of the similar reduced vanadium antimonate phase [51].
5. Conclusions
Antimony oxide was found to be an effective co-component of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts for the CO2-EBDH reaction improving its activity and especially on-stream stability. Incorpora- tion of antimony into VOx/Al2O3 increases dispersion of the active VOx-component, enhances redox prop- erties of the systems and forms a new mixed VSb oxide phase V1.1Sb0.9O4 in the most efficient binary
V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3 catalyst.
