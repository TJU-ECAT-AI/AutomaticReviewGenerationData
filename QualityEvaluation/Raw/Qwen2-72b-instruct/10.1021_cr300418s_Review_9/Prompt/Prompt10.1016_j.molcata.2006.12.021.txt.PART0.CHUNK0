Similarly, TiO2 and ZrO2 isolated oxides were also prepared for the purpose of comparison. 60 mol% TiO2 + 40 mol% ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst (here after simply termed as TiO2-ZrO2) was impregnated with different amounts of potassium oxide (K2O). These catalysts were characterized by BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature programmed desorption of NH3.
K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high performance towards the selective conversion of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of CO2, wherein K2O improved the conversion of ethylbenzene and selectivity of styrene acting as a basic promoter, similarly CO2 enhanced both conversion and selectivity acting as an oxidant as well as a diluent. The unified promotional effects of K2O and CO2 improved the conversion of ethylbenzene up to 6065% at 9599% selectivity levels of styrene. 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Currently, more than 80% of styrene is produced based on the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at high temperatures (>600 C) with promoted iron oxide catalysts in the presence of large excess of superheated steam. The major disadvantage of this process is its reversible reaction, which imposing a ther- modynamic limitation [1]. Low conversion of ethylbenzene, low selectivity of styrene and high energy consumption of the present process has been the driving force for the exploration of alterna- tive technologies [1]. Developments are going on to increase the conversion and selectivity by the removal of the reaction product hydrogen and thereby shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium towards products direction. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene has been proposed to be free from thermodynamic limitations regarding conversion and operating at lower temper- atures with an exothermic reaction, but the low selectivity of styrene is the major drawback of this process [2].

Alternatively, it has been realized that the carbon dioxide (CO2) utilization as a diluent as well as a mild oxidant will be the technologically important advancement. Because, CO2 utilization offers several advantages, like acceleration of the reaction rate, enhancement in the product selectivity,diminishing of thermodynamic limitations, suppression of total oxidation, prolonging of catalyst life, prevention of hotspots and so on. Hence, several research groups including us have been exploring the possibility of CO2 utilization in the dehy- drogenation of ethylbenzene over different catalysts such as F2O3, V2O5, Sb2O5, Cr2O3, CuO, CeO2, ZrO2, La2O3, alkali metals, etc., on different supports [310]. Among these reports, Sakurai et al. [3] found that the conversion of ethylbenzene in the presence of CO2 is 14% higher than in the presence of argon over carbon supported V2O5 catalysts. Sugino et al. [6] reported that the active carbon supported and alkali metal oxide promoted iron catalysts showed better activity in the presence of CO2. Mimura et al. [7] realized that 10% Fe2O3/Al2O2 with proper amount of CaO is highly effective in the presence of
CO2. Sun et al. [11] demonstrated that the selectivity of styrene
can be improved to 9599% at the conversion levels of 50% over chromium promoted and alumina supported vanadium catalysts 1381-1169/$  see front matter  2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.molcata.2006.12.021

59 in the presence of CO2. We investigated the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over a ZSM-5 supported iron oxide cat- alyst and found that ethylbenzene was predominantly converted into styrene via an oxidative manner, wherein CO2 played the role of an oxidant in order to improve catalytic activity as well as coke resistance of the catalyst remarkably [9,10]. The role of CO2 has thoroughly been investigated over alumina supported vanadium catalysts with a vide varieties of promoters [1215].
Recently, in one of our recent reports the enhanced activity of ZrO2 in the presence of CO2 has been described [16]. In another report, we illustrated the significant enhancement in the catalytic activity of ZrO2 when it is mixed with MnO2 [17].
Apart from MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst system, we found that CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst supported on SBA-15 showed remarkable catalytic activity in the presence CO2 [18].
These two series of mixed oxide catalysts showed superior activity to their individual oxides (ZrO2, TiO2 and CeO2).
Based on these results TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts has been investigated. Furthermore, we found that these TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts can be further improved up to the stage of complete suppression of by-products by neutralizing the strong acidic sites by K2O addition. TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst system with K2O promoter has not yet been reported for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of CO2.
Hence, in the present report, the preparation, characterization and catalytic performance of K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts for the selective dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene emphasizing the synergistic influence of K2O and CO2 have been delineated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the catalysts
Various loadings of TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation method. In a typical experiment,by taking the requisite amounts of zirconyl(IV) nitrate hydrate (Acros Organics, USA, 99.5%) and titanium(IV) chloride (Yakuri Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd., Japan), homogeneous 0.1 M aqueous mixed salt solution was made under mechanical stirring. To this homogeneous salt solution requisite amount of ammonium hydroxide (DC Chemicals Co. Ltd., Korea, Assay
25.028.0%) was added until the pH of the solution reached
to 8 under constant mechanical stirring at room temperature.
The resultant white precipitate was separated by filtration under reduced pressures and washed with de-ionized water several times until the complete removal of chloride ions,followed by drying at 120 C for 12 h and calcination at 600 C for 6 h in a muffle furnace. TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide was impregnated with 1, 2, 3 and 4 wt.% K2O wherein, potassium carbonate (Aldrich, USA) was used as a precursor for K2O promoter. After the impregnation, all these samples were dried at 120 C for 12 h, and calcined at 600 C for 6 h in static air atmosphere.
2.2. Catalytic activity test
The catalytic activity studies were performed in a fixed bed down flow stainless steel reactor (i.d. 4.5 mm and length 300 mm) under atmospheric pressure. In a typical experiment,approximately 1.0 g of the catalyst sample was loaded with the support of quartz wool and subjected to the catalyst pretreat- ment at 600 C for 0.5 h in the flow of N2 (20 ml/min). After the completion of the pretreatment, the reaction was conducted at different temperatures either in the flow of N2 or CO2. Ethyl- benzene was introduced by a peristaltic pump with a feed rate of 9.8 mmol/h along with either CO2 or N2. Products were ana- lyzed by a gas chromatogram (Younglin Instrument, Acme 6000 series, Korea) equipped with TCD and FID.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
BET surface areas of the catalysts were determined using Chemisorp 2705 unit (Micromeritics Instrument Co., USA). All the samples were pretreated at 200 C for 4 h before measure- ment. N2 was used as an adsorbate gas and the measurements were performed at 77 K.
X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded using a Rigaku, Miniflex, diffractometer with a nickel filtered Cu K radiation of wave length 1.5418 A at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 100 mA up to 80of 2θ range for the verification of struc- tural aspects of TiO2, ZrO2, TiO2-ZrO2 and K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts.
Acidity measurements were performed by temperature pro- grammed desorption of NH3 using Chemisorp 2705 unit (Micromeritics Instrument Co.) equipped with thermal con- ductivity detector (TCD). Typically, ca. 50 mg of catalyst was pretreated in flowing helium at 500 C for 1 h, cooled to 100 C and allowed to expose 5% NH3 in helium gas mixture with a flow rate of 20 ml/min for 30 min and subsequently the adsorbed NH3 was purged with helium gas at the same temperature for 1 h to remove the physisorbed NH3. The chemisorbed NH3 was mea- sured in flowing helium gas with the flow rate of 20 ml/min from 100 to 800 C with the heating rate of 10 C/min.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physico-chemical properties of the catalysts
The TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst exhibited high surface area, amorphous phase and profound acidbase bi-functional properties. Similar observation was reported by several authors at various ratios of TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts [1921].
The BET surface areas and the crystalline phases are depicted in Table 1. The estimated BET surface area of TiO2-ZrO2 is 135 m2/g.
By the addition of 1, 2, 3 and 4 wt.% of K2O to TiO2-ZrO2 the BET surface areas have been decreased to 118, 108, 96 and 89 m2/g, respectively, which are shown in Table 1. The dimin- ishing trend in the BET surface areas with the increased amount of K2O might be due to the blockage of certain pores. Mao et al. [21] reported that the surface area of TiO2-ZrO2 was dra- 60

This behavior was explained on the basis of the blockage of micropores that are present in the TiO2- ZrO2 mixed oxide. The XRD data depicted in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 1 have clearly been indicating the monoclinic phase of ZrO2, rutile phase of TiO2 and amorphous phase of TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst.
The change of phases from crystalline to amorphous has been reported by several authors during the stages of TiO2- ZrO2 mixed oxide preparation [22,23]. Although the TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide is in the amorphous phase, its K2O promoted coun- terparts exhibited crystalline behavior with the anatase phase of TiO2 as shown in Fig. 2. Due to the K2O addition, anatase TiO2 phase separation has been observed. Neither ZrO2 crystalline phases nor TiO2 rutile phase has been observed from the XRD results.

3.1.1. Acidic properties of the catalysts
The acidic properties have been determined by the well-known TPD technique for the best catalyst (3% K2O/TiO2- ZrO2) and also for the purpose of comparison the NH3 TPD patterns were also generated forTiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide, TiO2 and ZrO2. As shown in Fig. 3, the NH3 TPD patterns have been indicating that the wide distribution of acidic sites from weak to strong in isolated oxides (TiO2 and ZrO2) and TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide. The acidic sites in TiO2 are much less in number, but are distributed uniformly from weak acidic sites to strong acidic sites. In ZrO2 weak to moderate acidic sites are more or less equal in number, whereas the strong acidic sites are compara- tively higher. In the case of TiO2-ZrO2 and 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts the acid site distribution and their number are entirely different from TiO2 and ZrO2. The number of weak to moder- ate acidic sites in TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide is very high, but the strong acidic sites are comparable to TiO2 and ZrO2. In the case of 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst only weak to moderated acidic sites are present. Almost all strong acidic sites and some weak to moderate acidic sites present in TiO2-ZrO2 have been neu- tralized by K2O. Fung and Wang studied the changes in the acid base properties of TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides after K2O addition and reported that at minimum loading of K2O strong acids get poisoned, with the increase in K2O loading simultaneously both moderate and weak acidic sites were neutralized [24,25].
3.2. Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
3.2.1. Influence of TiO2 loading
The influence of TiO2 content in TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts including TiO2 and ZrO2 for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene have been shown in Fig. 4. The catalytic performance of ZrO2 and TiO2 is inferior to all the TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts. The enhancement in cat- alytic activity of TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts might be due to huge hike in weak to moderate acidic sites compared to either TiO2 or ZrO2 and other changes in the physico- chemical properties such as BET surface area and crystalline properties. Among the various mixed oxide catalysts TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst showed highest activity towards the con- version of ethylbenzene. Based on the high performance of

TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst; it has been utilized for further studies.
3.2.2. Influence of K2O on TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst
Physico-chemical and catalytic properties have been changed significantly due to K2O addition to TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst. From Fig. 5 it is clear that the K2O promoter has a substantial positive influence in converting ethylbenzene over TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2. The catalytic activ- ity of unpromoted TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst is higher in the first 2 h of time on stream, but latter on its activity has shown a marginal diminishing trend due to coke deposition. Contrarily,the activity of K2O promoted TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts has continu- ously been increasing with the increase in reaction time up to 7 h of time on stream. The maximum conversion on 3% K2O/TiO2- ZrO2 is 57.39%, but on TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst it is only 46.97%.
The difference in the maximum conversion of ethylbenzene over K2O promoted and unpromoted TiO2-ZrO2 is 10.42%. In other words, the hike in the conversion of ethylbenzene is 10.42% due to usage of K2O promoter under the specified reaction condi- tions. The catalytic activities of K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts in the first 2 h of time on stream are much lower than that of TiO2-ZrO2 Fig. 5. Conversion of ethylbenzene with respect to time on stream (K2O loading is in wt.%). Reaction conditions: weight of the catalyst, 1.0 g; ethylbenzene flow rate, 1 ml/h; CO2/EB, 5.1 (molar ratio); pressure, 1 atm; temperature, 550 C. mixed oxide catalyst, but after third hour of time on stream the catalytic activity has been increased significantly. The initial low activities of K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts are unclear. However, it has been reported that the initial low activity of certain catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in presence of
CO2 [26].
The catalytic activity comparison of various loadings of K2O promoter on TiO2-ZrO2 can be seen from Fig. 5, wherein, the increase of ethylbenzene conversion with increase in K2O load- ing from 1 to 3% has been noticed. But the activity of 4% K2O loaded catalyst is inferior to 3% K2O loaded TiO2-ZrO2 cata- lyst. Based on these results, 3% K2O loading can be considered as the optimum loading on TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst for the higher conversion of ethylbenzene. In the present context the role of K2O promoter is not yet fully understood.
However,itcanbeassumedthatK2Oactsasanelectronicpro- moter. Other possibility is that the crystallites of TiO2 anatase phase that is separated from the mixed oxide phase might be contributing for the enhancement in the conversion of ethylben- zene. Alternatively, acidbase active site compatibility might have taken place due to neutralization of strong acidic sites that are present in the TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst as observed from the TPD results (Fig. 3) and also the other possibility is that K2O promoter as a basic oxide might be facilitating the acti- vation of CO2. However, it is difficult to draw any conclusion at the present moment regarding the enhancement in activity with the K2O promoter.
3.2.3. Combined influence of K2O and CO2 on the
dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst To examine the combined influence of K2O and CO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene four separate experiments were conducted under similar reaction conditions by changing the reaction environment with and without CO2 over TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst and 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst, respec- tively, and the results are displayed in Fig. 6. The conversion of ethyl benzene over TiO2-ZrO2 in the nitrogen atmosphere is 52.19%, which has been significantly increased to 60.59% Fig. 6.

in the presence CO2 and furthermore, the selectivity of styrene is also increased to 97.09% from 94.6%. Similarly, the conver- sion and the selectivity have been substantially increased even in the presence of nitrogen over 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst,which is due to the effect of K2O promoter. The catalytic activ- ity of 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst has dramatically increased in the presence of CO2, which is due to the combined pro- motional effects of both K2O promoter and CO2. In order to explain the combined promotional effects, the data obtained over TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst in the presence of nitrogen has been compared with the data obtained on 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 cat- alyst in the presence of CO2. The conversion of ethylbenzene over TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst in the presence of nitrogen is 52.19%,which has been increased to 71.95% over 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2. Indeed, the hike in the conver- sion is 19.76%, which is exceptionally high improvement and in addition selectivity has almost reached to 100% (99.63%).
Still, the conversion is much lower than the equilibrium con- versions of ethylbenzene in the presence of CO2 as reported by Qin et al. [27], wherein, it is reported that the 25.2% of ethylbenzene conversion in the simple dehydrogenation can be elevated to 82.4% at 550 C when the ethylbenzene dehydro- genation reaction coupled with reverse water gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O). However, the data obtained over 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst is worth noting, particularly in the selectivity point of view. There are certain reports concerning the higher selectivities such as 99100%, but at the lower conver- sionlevelsofethylbenzene[11].Thehigherselectivityofstyrene over 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst can be explained mainly based on two reasons. The first one is the suppression of dealkylation products by neutralizing the strong acidic sites of TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst by optimal amount of K2O addition as evidenced from the NH3 TPD results that shown in Fig. 3. The second reason is that the hydrogen produced in the simple dehydrogenation is converting into water by the coupling of reverse water gas shift reaction. Hence, there is less scope for the hydrogenol- ysis and its subsequent reactions, consequently selectivity of styrene increased remarkably. As reported by Dulamita et al.
[28], if the surface basic sites are strong enough to abstract -hydrogen from ethylbenzene, the break of the lateral CC bond is promoted and, therefore, the selectivity to toluene will increase. If the catalyst surface acidity is larger, -hydrogen can be abstracted from ethylbenzene and the break of the phenylC bond become more probably, therefore, a higher selectivity to benzene will be obtained. The data are suggesting that the basic sites are not strong enough to convert ethylbenzene into toluene.
The high activity of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface to produce active oxygen species. This oxygen species oxidizes H2 that produced in the simple ethylbenzene dehydrogenation process intoH2Obyreversewatergasshiftreactionandtherebyreleases the limitation of thermodynamic equilibrium. As it is evidenced from the literature, the energy required for the production of one ton styrene when coupled with reverse water gas shift reaction is CO2 is 6.3 × 108, whereas, in the simple dehydrogenation is 1.5 × 109 cal [26]. Due to facile conversion of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of CO2, the selectivity of styrene increased dramatically as shown in Fig. 6.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst is promising for the selective dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence excess of CO2. As evidenced from the TPD of NH3 weak to moderate acidic sites are essential for the selective production of styrene, whereas the strong acidic sites lead to the formation of by-products. 3 wt% K2O addition to TiO2- ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst neutralized the strong acidic sites that are responsible for coke deposition and the formation of unwanted by-products. CO2 enhanced the conversion of ethyl- benzene and styrene selectivity acting as oxidant and diluent.
Hence, the unified effects of K2O and CO2 enhanced both the conversion of ethylbenzene and the selectivity of styrene significantly.
