OXIDATION REACTIONS CATALYZED BY DOPED NICmL
OXIDE
BY M. E. DRY
AND F. S. STONE
Dept. of Physical and Inorganic Chemistry, The University, Bristol Received 15th May, 1959 The oxidation of carbon monoxide over nickel oxide catalysts containing lithium or chromium in solid solution has been studied in the temperature range from 300-450C.
The results of Schwab and Block have been confirmed and extended. The apparent activation energy of the reaction is 14 kcal mole-1 for pure NiO, rising to 17.6 kcal mole-1 for NiO containing 5 % of chromium ions and falling to 11.5 kcal mole-1 for NiO with
2.8 % of lithium ions. Due to compensating changes in the frequency factor, however,
the specific activities of all the catalysts lie within an order of magnitude, the lithium- doped being slightly more active than the pure or the chromium-doped oxides. The oxidation of hydrogen has been similarly studied between 400" and 500C. A close correlation with the kinetics of CO oxidation is found. Activation energies range from
22.2 kcal mole-1 for NiO + 5 % Cr to 17.0 kcalmole-1 for NiO +
2.8 % Li, and
NiO + 2-8 % Li again has the greatest specific activity. An electronic mechanism is proposed for both reactions and the rate-determining steps are considered to be the re- spective chemisorptions of CO+ and Hi, leading to a depletion of positive holes in the oxide. The kinetics of the oxidation of ethylene to C02 and water have been studied between 400" and 515C over the same catalysts, but no analogous correlation with dopent type has been found in this case.
The chemical studies on nickel oxide stimulated by the conductivity work of Verwey and his colleagues 1 and by Hauffe and Block 2 have followed two main lines. First, attention has been given to the solid state reactions in which nickel oxide participates, and the influence of altervalent ions in solid solution has been shown to be significant in reduction,3* 4 oxidation,s and complex-oxide formation.6 The second group of studies have been concerned with the catalytic properties of doped nickel oxide. Here, by contrast, the ionic factors are suppressed and the observed effects are primarily due to the variations in hole concentration and mobility which doping induces. Attention has so far been confined almost ex- clusively to two reactions, the oxidation of carbon monoxide 7-10 and the decom- position of nitrous oxide.llB 12 The catalytic work on carbon monoxide oxidation is of special interest.
Parravano 7 showed that the incorporation of univalent cations in nickel oxide (which increases the positive-hole concentration n+) led to an increase in the activation energy, whilst the substitution of ions such as Cr3+ which decrease n+ leduced the activation energy. In apparent antithesis to these results, however,are those of Schwab and Block,s where activation energies for chromium-doped oxide were found to lie above those for lithium-doped oxide. The temperature ranges studied by Parravano (20-250C) and by Schwab and Block (250-400C) did not overlap, and several authors have since speculated on the discrepancy with this distinction in mind.13-15 The greater need, however, has been for more precise data, since the work of both Parravano, and Schwab and Block, leaves room for improvement in several respects. The first cause for anxiety is the employ- ment of a rather low firing temperature (640" and 850C respectively) during catalyst preparation, and a second disquieting feature is the lack of steady activity which both authors reported. Thirdly, activities were not referred to unit surface 192 Published on 01 January 1959. Downloaded by Syracuse University on 24/11/2013 07:29:14.

193 area and the extent to which the reported changes in apparent activation energy reflect variations in specific rates cannot therefore be assessed. Fortunately, a contemporary study by Keier, Roginskii and Sazonovag has now gone most of the way to relieve doubts about the data for low-temperature oxidation.
It emerges that lithium-doped catalysts are definitely less active than pure nickel oxide; a raised activation energy with lithium is accompanied by a raised frequency factor, but the compensation is far from complete. A chromium addition, however, also raised the activation energy (Parravano 7 reported a decrease) and again lowered the specific activity. Parravano's trend for lithium- doped NiO below 250C has also been recently confirmed by C h i n a  Molinari and Romeo.10 In this paper we report, first, on a reinvestigation of CO oxidation in the high- temperature range. We have referred our activities to unit surface and we have also investigated several factors which may have led to the varying activities of the earlier studies. The work has then been extended to the oxidation of hydrogen.The influence of altervalent additives on this reaction has not so far been examined,but it is known 16 that both carbon monoxide and hydrogen behave as electron donors when chemisorbed on nickel oxide. If this chemisorption is rate- determining for catalytic oxidation, we may expect correlations with doping to appear aIso in this case. The third oxidation reaction which we have studied,the oxidation of ethylene to carbon dioxide and water, has not previously been investigated on nickel oxide catalysts.
EXPERIMENTAL
PREPARATION OF CATALYSTS
Solutions of nickel nitrate (Johnson and Matthey Specpure) to which had been added solutions containing known quantities of lithium carbonate (dissolved in acetic acid) or ammonium chromate were evaporated to dryness. The mixtures were ground and de- composed to the oxides by slowly raising the temperature to 600C over a period of 5 h,followed by a further 5 h at 600C. The samples, contained in mullite boats, were then fired in air at 1000C for 3 h. The following doped oxides were prepared: NiO with 0.01 %, 0-1 %, 1 % and 5 % (atom %) chromium, and NiO with initially 0.1 %, 1 % and 5 % (atom %) lithium. The last two specimens were analyzed for lithium, after firing,by flame photometry; their concentrations had fallen to 0 . 8 and 2.8 atom % lithium respectively. Two independent preparations of pure oxide were also made (NiO I and NiO 11) by analogous treatment of the pure nickel nitrate solution.
Surface areas were obtained from B.E.T. plots of krypton isotherms at -
195C.
Magnetic susceptibilities were determined by the Gouy method in a vacuum-mounted magnetic balance.
THE REACTION SYSTEM
Gas was circulated over the catalyst specimen by a circulating pump. Reaction products (C02, H20) were removed continuously by liquid-air traps during CO and hydrogen oxidations, and by traps cooled to - 130" and a soda-asbestos column during ethylene oxidation. Liquid-air traps on both sides of the all-glass reaction vessel pre- vented contamination of the catalyst by mercury and stopcock grease. Preliminary experiments (see below) showed that these precautions were essential. The catalysts were laid down as a thin film, between 50 and 80 mg in weight, in a shallow glass bucket which rested on the flattened bottom of the reaction vessel. The gases were obtained from cylinders connected through purification trains to large bulbs in which the required mixtures were made. Nitrogen was normally added as a diluent to aid in heat dissipation,but in the ethylene studies the large excess of oxygen rendered this unnecessary. Prior to circulation over the catalyst, gases were thoroughly mixed with the circulating pump.
Total pressures of 10-20 cm were used and oxidations were followed to approximately 50 % completion, the pressure being measured by a mercury manometer. Blank runs up to 520C established that no oxidation of CO, H2 or C2H4 was detectable in the absence of catalyst.

CATALYSIS BY DOPED NICKEL OXIDE
RESULTS
CHARACTERIZATION OF THE
CATALYSTS
All the chromium-containing specimens were green, though the 0.01 % specimen was a very paIe green, barely distinguishable from the pure nickel oxide. The lithium- containing specimens (0.1 %, 0-8 % and 2.8 %) were grey, dark grey and black respec- tively. Prolonged washing of a quantity of the 2.8 % specimen with water produced no visible change in the colour in accord with the view generally held that lithium readily enters the nickel-oxide lattice at 1000C. The results of the surface area measurements are shown in fig. 1. The general shape of this curve is discussed later and we need only note here the similar values of 0.96 m2 g-1 and 0.94 m2 g-1 for 1 and 5 atom % chromium respectively. The limiting solubility of Cr203 in NiO is about 1 mole %.

We have been concerned by a recent report 17 that nickel can be nucleated in nickel oxide merely by heating i n vacuo at 210C. Doubts have therefore been cast on expcxi- ments 18 in which, as in the present work, nickel oxide outgassed at high temperatures has been employed. The magnetism of a specimen of our undoped NiO was therefore studied in a vacuum-mounted magnetic balance. The mass susceptibility at 20C was found to be 12 x 10-6. After heating the specimen at 520C for 50 h at 10-6 mm and cooling i n vacuo, no ferromagnetism could be observed in nickel oxide protected fro:;n grease vapours. This confirms the view expressed elsewhere 19 that the dissociation phenomena found by Teichner and Morrison 17 do not apply to sintered nickel oxide.
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS
Initial experiments on CO oxidation over NiO I showed that satisfactory results could not be obtained unless grease vapours were eliminated from the reaction vessel. If a greased joint was used at the top of the reaction vessel or if the protecting cold traps were omitted, reactions were not reproducible, an induction period was present and outgassing at 400C for 1-2 h produced a darkening in the green catalyst. The green colour could be regained by heating in oxygen. Analogous blackening was found in the magnetic studies in the presence of grease vapours and here it was accompanied by a rise in sus- ceptibility, showing that grease vapours were capable of reducing the catalyst. With a greased joint eliminated and the protecting traps permanently cooled, no darkening was Published on 01 January 1959. Downloaded by Syracuse University on 24/11/2013 07:29:14.

195 detected during outgassing at 500C for 10 h.* The self-heating problem was also investigated. With 2 g  of catalyst supported on a sintered-glass disc self-heating of as much as 100" was observed in 2 CO/O2 mixtures being catalyzed at 350C. The weight of catalyst was accordingly kept below 100mg in all our later experiments and nitrogen was added as an extra precaution. The third modification introduced as a result of the preliminary experiments was the adoption of a rigorous outgassing treatment at a high temperature (500C for 1 h) before and after each individual experiment. With these precautions reproducible results were obtained and the induction period was eliminated.
OXIDATION OF CARBON MONOXIDE
The reaction was first order with respect to carbon monoxide and independent of the oxygen pressure, thus confirming the kinetics found by Schwab and Block.8 A series of eight experiments on one of the catalysts (NiO, 5 % Cr) where the initial CO/Oz ratios were varied between 2/1 and 1/1 is shown in fig. 2. Values of ApjAt were taken from the rate curves corresponding to points where poZ =
3.0 cm and pco = 3-0
cm respectively.

For the study of the temperature dependence, the oxidation rate was measured for each of seven catalysts at eight temperatures between 300" and 450" C using CO + $ 0 2 mixtures diluted with nitrogen. The ratio N;?/(CO + 402) was approximately 4/3.
Velocity constants k ' (= k/2.303) were given directly from the slopes of the straight line plots of log p(c0 + &02) against time and the apparent activation energies E were derived from conventional plots of log k' against 1/T. The Arrhenius equation was well obeyed over the whole range of temperature studied. The results for E in fig. 3 show that the trend of Schwab and Block 8 is fully confirmed. Comparison of the actual values, plotted as atom % dopent in fig. 3, shows general agreement on the lithium side, but not on the * It may be recalled that Schwab and Block,g who experienced some difficulties with lack of reproducibility and who were unable to report any satisfactory results for undoped NiO, did not eliminate grease or mercury vapours.Published on 01 January 1959.

chromium side. Lithium enters into solid solution more easily than chromium: the divergence could be due to their much lower firing temperature having led to a less homo- geneous distribution of chromium.
Table 1 shows the variation of the pre-exponential factor ko in the Arrhenius equation k = ko exp (- E/RT). Values of ko reduced to unit surface area of 1 m2 were obtained from the relation log ko = log (2.303 k'/A) + E/(2.303 RT), where k' was the value of the velocity constant interpolated from the log k' against l/Tplots at a chosen temperature (actually 625"K), A the area of catalyst used (in m2) and E the measured activation energy. 2 0

A plot of log ko against E from the data in table 1 gives a good straight line showing that the " theta rule" is being well obeyed. It is interesting to note from the values of k in table 1 that the compensation effect is nearly complete. There is barely a five-fold increase in absolute activity at 350C between the two ends of the scale. We may conclude,therefore, that an increase in the concentration of positive holes favours the CO oxidation,but the effect is very much less than activation energy figures indicate. catalyst

OXIDATION OF HYDROGEN
The reaction order was investigated as for carbon monoxide oxidation, and analogous kinetics of first order in hydrogen and zero order in oxygen were observed. The rate constants, however, were much lower. Fig. 4 shows results for NiO + 5 % Cr at 455"C,exemplifying these points.

0.8 % Li are surprisingly low, but in other respects the
conclusions are the same as those for CO oxidation. The compensation between log ko and E is again very marked, though also not complete. It is significant that the greater resistance to catalysis in the hydrogen case is reflected entirely in the increased activation energies (which are about 5 kcal mole-1 greater than for the corresponding oxide in CO oxidation) and not in the ko parameter of the Arrhenius equation.

OXIDATION OF ETHYLENE
Some work carried out a few years ago in our laboratory 20 in which oxygen containing 3 % ethylene was flowed over doped nickel oxides at 1 atm pressure had shown that 20 % conversion to C02 and water could be achieved at 450C with flow rates of 300 mi niin -1.
Pure nickel oxide was rather less active than either lithium or chromium-containing oxide.
We have extended these observations in the present work by studying the ethylene oxida- tion over three of our catalysts (NiO, NiO + 5 % Cr and NiO + 2-8 % Li) in the tem- perature range between 400" and 515C at total initial pressures of approximately 10 cm.
By following several reactions to completion, it was confirmed that the stoichiometry of the reaction was c2H4 + 3 0 2 --f 2C02 + 2H20. Variations in the O2/C2H4 ratio from approximately 15/1 to 5/1 showed that the rate was again independent of oxygen pressure, but the order with respect to ethylene was close to 0.5. Velocity constants were evaluated on the basis of these kinetics at five temperatures using O2/C2H4 mixtures in the ratio 15/1 and the values of the apparent activation energies for the three catalysts studied are given in table 3, together with the specific activities. In agreement with the catalyst

work at 1 atm pressure, pure nickel oxide is seen to be less active than either lithium- containing or chromium-containing oxide. Thus, in contrast to the CO and hydrogen oxidations, there is no correlation in this case between the activation energy or the specific activity and the type of altervalent additive. The change in the pre-exponential factor again partially compensates for the change in E.
DISCUSSION
The surface area results in fig. 1 reflect differences in sintering rates for the various solid solutions.
For their interpretation one must consider the variations in vacancy concentratian which accompany doping. Thus the rapid fall by nearly 50 % on the chromium side is attributable to the increase in cation vacancy concentration which chromium substitution produces.
On the lithium side, the first small quantities fill the cation vacancies of the inherently non-stoichiometric NiO and a resistance to sintering should emerge. The maximum at 0.1 % lithium may therefore be significant, for it is also consistent with similar anomalies in lattice parameter 21 and thermo-electric power 22 at low lithium contents, Once these vacancies are filled, Liz0 enters into solid solution with the simultaneous formation of anion vacancies. Although their existence is ephemeral when the Published on 01 January 1959. Downloaded by Syracuse University on 24/11/2013 07:29:14.

199 solid is being fired in air, there will be a period during sintering at 1000C when,at least in internal pores, the balance between the rate of entry of lithium and the filling of the anion vacancies with oxygen will not be maintained. Sintering will therefore be enhanced and we believe the gradual fall on the lithium side may be explained qualitativdy in this way.
The study of CO oxidation shows that an increase in the positive hole con- centration is accompanied by a systematic increase in the specific activity above
300C,
thus confirming the conclusion invoked by Schwab and Block 8913 on the basis of their activation energy studies. The increase in activity, however, i s
extremely small, due to a marked compensation effect between ko and E. The heat of oxygen chemisorption on different p-type oxides (e.g. Cu20, COO and NiO) is uniformly high and the gas is in each case readily adsorbed to high coverage.19 Small variations in the position of the Fermi level caused by additives in a given oxide such as NiO are unlikely to alter this picture appreciably, so the zero-order kinetics for oxygen are readily understood.
The first-order kinetics for carbon monoxide imply that CO chemisorption at low coverages is rate-determining, as pointed out by Schwab and Block.8 This also can be easily justified. Carbon monoxide forms a weak bond on chemisorption, so coverages are low : secondly,the donor character of its chemisorption 16 is in line with the observed dependence on hole properties. The reason for the compensation effect is a notoriously difficult problem in catalysis. As far as this reaction is concerned, the rate of chemi- sorption of carbon monoxide will be governed, inter alia, by the concentration of holes, by their mobility and by the shape of the potential barrier which is pre- sented at the surface. Whilst it is true that the Arrhenius equation is well obeyed in our studies, it becomes questionable whether it is appropriate to analyze the overall rate in terms of a conventional kinetic scheme, r = kOp:pr exp (- E/RT),when the presence of a critical electron transfer process is mixing the classical significance of ko and E. Thus, although we do observe a systematic increase in activity when the concentration of holes increases, confirming that the mechanism of the oxidation is underlaid by an electronic factor, we note that ko does not increase. The coupled decrease in apparent activation energy is the overriding consideration. Parravanos observation 22 that lithium doping also increases the mobility of holes in NiO emphasizes that there is a complex interplay between several temperature-dependent quantities. Finally, we consider the possible consequences of changes in the heat of chemisorption due to additives. Our variations in activity are so small that it would be surprising if this were an im- portant factor in our case. But this may be the way to seek a reconciliation with the low-temperature studies. A cardinal distinction which we can now emphasize is that the activity variations found by Keier, Roginskii and Sazonova 9 are, by our standards, extremely large. As the temperature is lowered, variations in the bond strengths of adsorbed reactants or products induced by dopents could begin to lead to wide variations in catalytic activity. Carbon dioxide chemisorption,for example, strongly inhibits the CO oxidation at room temperature.**,23 The close correlation between the kinetics, the activity dependencies and the ko values for the respective oxidations of CO and of hydrogen show that the two reactions are mechanistically identical. We therefore propose that oxygen is present at high coverage and that H 2 --f H2+ + e is the rate-determining step (cf.
Parravano and Domenicali 16).
The lower rates with hydrogen are consistent with the general experience that the interaction of CO with oxides, whether in simple chemisorption or reduction, occurs at a lower threshold temperature.
By contrast, the transfer of electrons between adsorbate and adsorbent evidently has little consequence for the kinetics of ethylene oxidation. Its total oxidation to C02 cannot, of course, compare in simplicity with CO or hydrogen oxidation,but if oxidation to ethylene oxide is rate-determining, as Todes and Adrianova 24 have suggested for spinel catalysts, the analogy with CO oxidation is quite close and systematic correlations of activity with dopent might have been expected.

These correlations, however, are only likely to be clearly defined when a single chemisorption or desorption step dominates the catalytic reaction. The success of the doped oxide work in CO oxidation, N20 decomposition and, as we have now shown, in hydrogen oxidation stems primarily from this cause.
