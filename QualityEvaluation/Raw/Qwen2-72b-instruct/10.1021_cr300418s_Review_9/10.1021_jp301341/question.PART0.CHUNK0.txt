(1) The presence of a Lewis acid on an oxide surface increases substantially the binding energy of a Lewis base. (2) If an oxide has certain properties because it is a Lewis base, these properties can be suppressed by adsorbing a Lewis acid on the surface. (3) The presence of a Lewis base on an oxide surface diminishes the binding energy of another base, as compared to the binding energy on the same surface with no base on it. These rules also hold if the words acid and base are exchanged. We show that these rules apply to a large number of systems which seem to have no relationship to each other and which are important for catalysis by oxides.

In this article, we show that the results of many such calculations can be derived from a few rules involving Lewis acidbase pairs. These rules appear to be general and to have predictive power. Moreover, they apply to chemical systems that seem to have no connection to each other.
Since there are numerous definitions of a Lewis acid or base, we specify the definition used here. A molecule whose electron charge increases during a reaction is a Lewis acid; the one that loses electrons is a Lewis base. Whether a molecule is an acid or a base depends on its reaction partner; a molecule can act as an acid with one partner and as a base with another partner. Nevertheless, some molecules have such a strong propensity to be an acid that it is safe to assume that they are acid in their interaction with most partners; the same goes for some molecules that have a strong tendency to be bases.
When it was proposed, (1) this definition was hard to use since it was not possible to determine the electronic charge redistribution during a reaction. Quantum chemistry now provides a variety of methods for determining such charge rearrangements. Among them we favor the one proposed by Bader, (2-4) and we use it throughout this article. In a reaction, the Lewis acid gains Bader charge, and the Lewis base loses it.
In a few instances, we say that A is a Lewis base and B is a Lewis acid if the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of A is larger than that of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of B. The basicity of a molecule seems to be particularly strong when it has a singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO); such orbitals tend to have higher energy because they do not benefit from the effect of electron pairing.
In the rest of this article, we show that the results of a large number of calculations, on a great variety of systems, can be predicted by the following propensity rules.
1.
(a) The coadsorption of a Lewis acid A with a Lewis base B, on an oxide surface S that is neither a Lewis acid nor a Lewis base, results in a very large attractive interaction energy between A and B. By this we mean that the energy of coadsorbing A and B is much larger than the adsorption energy of A alone plus the adsorption energy of B alone. Another way to phrase this is to say that the presence of a Lewis acid on a surface enhances substantially the binding energy of a Lewis base (compared to the binding energy when the acid is absent). (b) This rule also applies to the adsorption of a molecule AB which dissociates to form adsorbed A and B. The energy of the dissociative adsorption is largest when the binding sites of A and B are such that A is a Lewis base and B is a Lewis acid. (c) If A is a Lewis base and the adsorbed molecule B has several isomers, then the presence of A will induce B to form (when it binds to the surface) the isomer that is a Lewis acid.
All these statements remain true if one interchanges the words acid and base.
2. If a surface has certain chemical properties because it is a Lewis acid, these properties are modified substantially by adsorbing a Lewis base on the surface, as if the base neutralizes the acid. The same thing happens if the surface is a base and the adsorbate is an acid.
3. The interaction energy between a Lewis acid and a Lewis base, coadsorbed on an oxide surface that is neither an acid nor a base, depends on the strength of the base and of the acid.
4. If an oxide surface is modified to be a Lewis acid, then a molecule that is a Lewis acid adsorbs more weakly on the modified oxide than on the unmodified one. A similar rule is true for bases.
These rules are different manifestations of a strong interaction between a Lewis acidbase pair adsorbed on an oxide surface. Some chemists may not be surprised by this. However, we show here that in the case of oxide surfaces this interaction: (a) is surprisingly strong (of the order of 1 eV or more); (b) takes place through the oxide, as opposed to a bond formation between the acid and the base; (c) is universal (we found no exception); and (d) explains a large number of computational results for systems that seem to have no relationship with each other.
These qualitative rules generalize results of many calculations of the chemical properties of adsorbates on oxide surfaces, by correlating them with the Lewis acidbase properties of the participants. When we say that they are general we mean that calculations show that they work for many different systems, and we see no reason why they should not work for systems that have not been studied yet by DFT. It is however possible that as more examples are examined the rules will have to be amended, qualified, or extended.
Many of the examples of Lewis acidbase pair interactions given here interpret results of calculations already published in the literature or of new calculations performed in our group. The presentation in this article reverses the path used in the discovery of the rules: we postulate the rules and use them to predict the results of the calculations. We use this pedagogical device to emphasize our belief that the rules have predictive power. 2 Computational Aspects We compare here results of many calculations: some are old, and some have not been published before. Some of the older calculations used GGA, which is known to give some artifacts in the electronic structure of the oxides of transition metals or rare-earth metals. The more recent calculations either used (5) GGA+U or showed that, for some oxides (e.g., La2O3), using the Hubbard U correction makes a minor difference in the results. When we use results obtained with GGA, we are careful not to include in the present discussion those aspects that are suspected of being artifacts of the method. For calculations that used GGA+U, we have used only results that are not changed qualitatively by changing the value of U. Recently, Nolan (6-10) and Watson (11, 12) and Sanz (13) have advocated the use of a Hubbard correction for oxygen. Having two adjustable parameters, this method seems to improve the description of doped or reduced oxides. We found, however, that using two Hubbard parameters does not affect the qualitative conclusions reached by using the other DFT methods.
All calculations examined here have been performed on slabs that mimic large surfaces. They used the accepted standards of the field regarding the magnitude of the energy cut off, the thickness of the slabs, and the convergence criteria for geometry and energy optimization. Most calculations used spin-polarized DFT to find the lowest energy spin state.
In this article, we present qualitative rules that predict large energy changes. The magnitude of the energies cited here will depend on the functional used in the DFT calculations and on the value of the U parameter. However, the qualitative rules that we propose are likely to be valid for all functionals because they are based on large energy differences. We assume that, when the functional is changed, large energies will remain large, and the small ones will stay small. 3 Presence of a Lewis Base on a Surface Increases Substantially the Binding Energy of a Lewis Acid We start by examining the results of calculations in which a Lewis acid is adsorbed on the surface of TiO2(110) on which a Lewis base has been preadsorbed. The bases examined so far are a H atom adsorbed to make a hydroxyl on the bridging oxygen row, (14, 15) an adsorbed alkali atom (Li, or Na, or K), or the Au clusters Au3, Au5, and Au7. (15) Calculations of Bader charges have shown that all these compounds donate electrons when they adsorb on rutile. (16-19) Therefore, they are Lewis bases with respect to the rutile surface. Our rules predict that the presence of any one of these bases will increase the binding energy of a Lewis acid (as compared to the case when no base is present on the surface). The Lewis acids we examine here are a Au atom and an O2 molecule.
The calculated binding energy of a Au atom to a clean, stoichiometric (i.e., no oxygen vacancies) rutile surface is 0.45 eV, and the Bader charge on the adsorbed Au atom is +0.05 electron. (16) When a base is present on the surface, the binding energy of Au to the surface changes (from 0.45 eV on clean TiO2) to a value between 1.2 and 1.37 eV (depending on the base); the charge on the adsorbed Au atom (15) is between 0.35 and 0.47 electron (depending on the base). Note that these are changes in the binding energy of Au to the TiO2 surface (not to the base).
The binding energy of the Au atom to the rutile surface and the Bader charge on it are about the same regardless of which of the above bases is present on the surface. This suggests that it is the electron donation by the base, not its specific chemical nature, that causes this increase in the binding energy. This assumption was tested by performing calculations in which a Au atom is adsorbed on a rutile slab that contains an extra electron but no adsorbed Lewis base. (15) The presence of an additional electron turns the rutile slab into a Lewis base, and according to the rules advocated here this base should bind more strongly the Au atom (a Lewis acid) than the slab with no additional electron. The calculations show that indeed it does. The binding energy of Au on this charged rutile surface is 1.21 eV, and the charge on the adsorbed Au atom is 0.40 electron. These numbers are remarkably close to those obtained when the slab is electrically neutral (i.e., no additional electron in the slab) but has a Lewis base adsorbed on it. To a good approximation, it is the basicity that matters, not the specific chemical.
The Au clusters Au3, Au5, and Au7 have an odd number of electrons, and the presence of an unpaired electron in the SOMO tends to make them Lewis bases with respect to TiO2(110). Calculations show that they donate electrons when they bind to the surface. (16, 17, 20) According to our rules, their presence on the surface should enhance the binding energy of a Au atom to the oxide (not to the Au clusters), and they do. On the other hand, the Au2, Au4, and Au6 clusters are not Lewis bases or acids when they are adsorbed on rutile (16, 17) (they do not exchange electrons with the surface). If the rules we propose here are correct, the presence of these clusters on the surface should have no effect on the adsorption energy of the Au atom to the oxide (not to the Au clusters). Calculations (15) show that indeed this is the case. The effect of the Au clusters with an odd number of electrons on the adsorption energy of a Au atom has nothing to do with the fact that the clusters contain gold; the important feature is that the clusters which affect the binding of the Au atom are Lewis bases, and the ones that have no effect are not.
In the examples discussed above, all bases we studied modify the binding of a Lewis acid which is able to take one electron (i.e., Au) by roughly the same amount. Similarly, all bases change the binding energy of oxygen by the same amount. We do not have enough examples to postulate that this invariance in the binding energy of the Lewis acid with the nature of the base is a general rule.
If the observations listed above are explained by the acidbase interaction, similar results should be obtained for other acids with the same bases. Calculations show (15) that this is true when O2 (a Lewis acid) is coadsorbed on TiO2(110) with one of the bases listed above. The binding energy of O2 to rutile is 0.15 eV, and the molecule is unable to gain electron charge from the rutile surface, (15) in spite of the fact that O2 has a large electronegativity; stoichiometric rutile is a poor base. Since DFT does not account for the van der Waals interactions, the magnitude of the binding energy is larger than the calculated one. However, what matters here is that the number is small, which is in agreement with experiment and other calculations. (21-24) The presence on the surface of any of the bases mentioned above changes the binding energy of oxygen from 0.15 (when no base is present) to 1.00 eV. This is the binding energy to the rutile surface, not to the base. The charge on the coadsorbed O2 is  0.5 electron (instead of zero, when no base is present). In agreement with our rule, the presence of a base on the surface allows oxygen to act as a Lewis acid, and this causes a substantial increase in its binding energy to the surface. The binding energy of O2 is roughly the same for all bases, including a slab with an additional electron and no adsorbate on its surface.
This behavior is not confined to rutile or to the acids and the bases mentioned above. A more interesting and somewhat surprising behavior is observed when a halogen or a halogen hydride is adsorbed on La2O3 or on CeO2.
The reaction 1/2Br2 + La2O3(001)  (BrLa)/La2O3, in which one Br atom binds to three La atoms, is endothermic, (25) and the reaction energy is 0.10 eV. The symbol (BrLa)/La2O3 is used to indicate that the Br atom formed by dissociation binds to La not to O. This Br atom is bonded to the surface, but the state is metastable with respect to the formation of 1/2Br2 in the gas. The Bader charge on the Br atom in the BrLa group is 0.40; this atom is a Lewis acid with respect to La2O3. BrLa is the lowest-energy binding site of a Br atom on La2O3.
On the basis of what we just said about the adsorption of one Br atom, one is tempted to guess that the dissociative adsorption of Br2 to form two adsorbed Br atoms ought to be even more endothermic than the adsorption of one Br atom and that both Br atoms formed by dissociation will form a BrLa complex. If we assume that there is no interaction between the two Br atoms formed by the dissociation of Br2, the dissociative adsorption energy ought to be 0.2 eV.
However, according to our rules, the dissociative adsorption energy of Br2 (to form two adsorbed Br atoms) will benefit substantially if one atom binds to a surface site on which it is a Lewis acid and the other binds to a site where it is a Lewis base. Calculations show (25) that this is what happens. The lowest-energy state for the dissociative adsorption of Br2 is the one in which one Br atoms binds to La (to form the BrLa complex) and the other Br atom binds to an oxygen atom (to form a BrO group). The energy of the reaction Br2 + La2O3  (BrLa, BrO)/La2O3 is 0.40 eV (not the 0.2 eV estimated above by assuming that the two Br atoms do not interact). (BrLa, BrO)/La2O3 represents a La2O3 surface on which one Br atom is bonded to La and the other is bonded to O. The Bader charge on the Br atom in the BrLa group is 0.71 electron, and this atom is a strong acid. The Bader charge on the Br atom in the BrO group is 0.21 electron, and this atom is a base. Having a Br atom in the acid BrLa group directs the second Br atom to bind to the basic site BrO. The resulting acidbase interaction lowers substantially the energy of dissociative adsorption of Br2.
We have observed similar behavior when Br2 or Cl2 dissociates on CeO2(111). (26) We discuss here only the results obtained for Br2 since those for Cl2 are similar. A Br atom can adsorb on ceria either on an O atom, to form a compound denoted (BrO)/CeO2(111), or on a Ce atom, to form the compound denoted (BrCe)/CeO2(111). The reaction 1/2Br2 + CeO2(111)  (BrO)/CeO2(111), in which one Br atom is adsorbed on the surface, is endothermic, and its energy is +0.23 eV;the adsorbed Br atom in (BrO)/CeO2(111) loses +0.26 electron when it makes the BrO bond; this Br atom is a Lewis base with respect to CeO2. The reaction 1/2Br2 + CeO2(111)  (BrCe)/CeO2(111), to form one Br atom adsorbed on a Ce site, is also endothermic, and the reaction energy is +0.19 eV; this Br atom gains 0.28 electron when it binds to Ce, and it is a Lewis acid. Note that no matter where a single Br atom binds the reaction is uphill. Naively, one would think that if the binding of one Br atom is exothermic the binding of two of them would be even more so. However, one of our rules predicts that the dissociative adsorption of Br2 should be exothermic if one Br atom binds to O and the other to Ce because this will form a Lewis acidbase pair on the surface; this should stabilize the dissociative adsorption. Indeed, it does: the energy of the dissociative adsorption of Br2, to form (BrO, BrCe)/CeO2(111), is 0.27 eV. The energy to dissociate Br2 and form two BrO groups or two BrCe groups is much higher, and it is positive (a metastable state).
We can also use our rules to predict qualitatively the behavior of HCl dissociation on CeO2(111). The H atom will bind to an oxygen atom since making a hydroxyl is most often preferred to making a hydride. Where will the Cl atom bind to provide the most stable structure when HCl dissociates? Our rule predicts that because H binding to an oxygen atom on the surface of an oxide is a base the presence of the hydroxyl will induce the Cl atom to function as an acid and stabilize the dissociation of HCl by an acidbase interaction. Indeed, we find that formation of (HO, ClCe)/CeO2(111) (acidbase pair) is more exothermic than the formation of (HO, ClO)/CeO2(111) (basebase pair) by 0.85 eV. When the Cl atom is alone on the surface and it binds to a Ce atom, it has a Bader charge of 0.33 electron. However, when it is part of (HO, ClCe)/CeO2(111), the Cl in the ClCe group acts as a strong Lewis acid and has a Bader charge of 0.64 electron. Pairing it with H (a Lewis base) on the surface increases the charge on the Cl (the Lewis acid) by 0.31 electron and the dissociative adsorption energy by a substantial amount. A very similar behavior is seen (25) for the dissociative chemisorption of HBr on La2O3.
Ultrathin films of oxides supported on metals (27-29) provide another example in which manipulating the Lewis acidbase properties of a system changes the chemistry of adsorbed species. Pacchioni et al. (30) predicted that Au atoms adsorbed on an ultrathin MgO film on Ag(100) will draw charge from the Ag substrate. In this process, the metallic Ag works as a base, and the Au atom is an acid. This prediction was confirmed by experiments in Freunds group. (31) The ability of the metal support to act as a base depends on its work function. When the work function is smaller, the LUMO of the metal is higher, and the metal is a stronger base. Therefore, our rules predict that the binding energy of a Au atom or an O2 molecule (which are both Lewis acids) to an ultrathin MgO layer supported on a metal should increase as the work function of the metal decreases. Calculations by Hellman et al. (32, 33) show that this is indeed the case. The binding energy of oxygen to a MgO film supported on Ag(100) is 0.82 eV, and it is 0.2 eV for MgO. (32) The binding energy of a Au atom on an ultrathin film of MgO supported on Mo, Ag, Pd, Au, or Pt is higher than on MgO, and it increases as the work function decreases (i.e., base strength increases). (33) 4 Effect of the AcidBase Strength It is possible to state that a Lewis acid (or base) is stronger than another Lewis acid (or base), and there are many methods for establishing acidity (basicity) scales. Here we use the term strength in a qualitative and limited sense. Rather than try to define it precisely, we clarify it by the examples given below.
One definition of a Lewis acid or base makes use of orbital energies. Qualitatively we can say that A is a stronger Lewis acid than B if the LUMO of A has lower energy than that of B. Similarly, A is a stronger base than B if the HOMO of A has higher energy than that of B. A deficiency of this definition is that HOMO and LUMO energies are not observable quantities (only the excitation energies are), but numerous examples have shown that orbital energies are useful for predicting trends in chemical behavior. (34, 35) One difference between Au and O2 is that O2 has two unpaired electrons, located in two different SOMOs, while the Au atom has only one. It is therefore qualitatively reasonable to say that O2 is a stronger acid than Au since it can use two orbitals for housing electrons. How will Au and O2 behave if they are adsorbed on oxide surfaces having different base strength?
We have already mentioned that the binding energies of Au and O2 to TiO2(110) are substantially increased if a hydroxyl (a Lewis base) is present on the surface. What happens if we make the surface a stronger base by having two hydroxyls per supercell, next to each other, on the bridging-oxygen row? It turns out that the binding energy of Au to the surface with two hydroxyls is the same as that obtained when only one hydroxyl is present. (15) Au is a weak acid, and it behaves as if it is only able to make use of one electron; the existence of an additional electron, provided by the second OH, makes no difference. One hydroxyl already neutralizes the acidity of Au; increasing the basicity (by adding an extra hydroxyl) no longer affects the behavior of Au. In contrast, adding a second hydroxyl changes the binding energy of oxygen from 0.93 eV (when coadsorbed with one hydroxyl) to 1.94 eV (when coadsorbed with two hydroxyls). The Bader charge on O2 changes from 0.47 electron (for one hydroxyl) to 0.91 electron (for two hydroxyls). Making the surface more basic increases the binding energy of a strong acid.
A similar behavior is observed if we add electrons to the rutile slab to turn it into a base. The binding energy of Au is the same whether we add one electron or two electrons, but the binding energy and the Bader charge of O2 depend on the number of electrons: adding two electrons has about the same effect as having two hydroxyls. Again, roughly speaking, the effect of the base depends on its ability to donate electrons and not on other chemical details.
A similar example is provided by calculations regarding the effect of two Au strips present on the rutile surface and used as Lewis bases. (15) One strip has nine atoms in the supercell (and is denoted here Au9), while the other has ten (Au10). We emphasize that Au9 and Au10 are not gold clusters but infinite strips of Au along one lattice vector of the surface. The Au10 strip is obtained from Au9 by adding one Au atom on top of the Au9 strip. This addition does not cause a substantial change in the structure of the Au atoms originally in the Au9 strip, but the chemical properties of Au10 are very different from those of Au9. The question is how these strips affect the binding of a Au atom or of an O2 molecule to the rutile surface (not to the strip but to the oxide surface not covered by the strip). Both strips affect equally the binding of a Au atom to the rutile surface: the binding energies are 1.12 eV (on Au9) and 1.18 eV (on Au10). Given the errors in DFT, these numbers should be considered equal. The binding energy of O2 changes dramatically, from 1.11 eV for Au9 to 1.96 eV for Au10. Adding one Au atom on top of Au9 makes it a stronger Lewis base, but this change can be detected only by coadsorbing O2, which is a stronger acid than Au. An examination of the density of states shows that the HOMO of Au10 has substantially higher energy than the HOMO of Au9, and this explains why Au10 is a stronger base than Au9. Surprisingly, the difference in the binding energy of O2 on the two surfaces (one with Au9 and the other with Au10) is roughly equal to the difference in the HOMO energies of Au9 and Au10. It is prudent to think of this equality as a coincidence rather than a rule.
It is, however, reasonable to generalize these two observations. The acidity of Au is neutralized readily, and increasing the strength of the base beyond a certain value has no effect on the adsorption energy of Au. On the other hand, O2, which is a stronger acid, is not neutralized as readily, and its binding energy can be increased by increasing the strength of the base.
We have already mentioned that the binding energy of Au on an ultrathin MgO film supported on a metal increases as the work function of the metal decreases. (33) A smaller work function means a higher HOMO energy and hence a stronger basicity. Again, increasing the strength of the base results in a larger binding energy for the acid. 5 Structural Effects of Pairing a Lewis Acid with a Lewis Base We have already mentioned that the lowest-energy Au4 cluster does not exchange electrons with rutile when it is adsorbed on its surface. However, Au4 has many structural isomers, (15) which differ from each other through the arrangement of the Au atoms in the cluster and/or through their location on the surface. One of them, which we denote Au4*, is less stable than Au4: the energy of the rutile with Au4* on it is 0.53 eV higher than the energy of rutile with Au4 adsorbed on it. Bader charge calculations show that Au4* is a Lewis base with respect to rutile (i.e., it transfers electrons to the surface). Given the big difference between the energies of these two adsorbed isomers, practically no Au4* will be present on the surface if the isomers of Au4 are in thermodynamic equilibrium.
Calculations (15) show that the binding energy of O2 to the rutile surface (not to the Au cluster) is not affected by the preadsorption of Au4 on the surface. This is consistent with our rules: Au4 is not a Lewis base, so it will not affect the binding of a Lewis acid (the O2). On the other hand, our rules suggest that adsorbed O2 (a Lewis acid) would interact strongly with Au4* (a Lewis base). Calculations show that this is the case: the energy of the rutile slab on which O2 is coadsorbed with Au4* is lower by 0.67 eV than that of the rutile slab on which O2 is coadsorbed with Au4. The presence of the Lewis acid (i.e., O2) stabilizes that Au cluster that is a Lewis base (namely Au4*). In the absence of oxygen, the most stable four-atom Au cluster on the surface is Au4, but when O2 is adsorbed on the rutile surface, the most stable cluster is Au4*. The presence of the Lewis acid on the surface forces the four-atom Au cluster to change its structure to become a Lewis base. The same behavior has been observed for the Au6 clusters coadsorbed with O2.
In an experiment in which a surface covered with four-atom Au clusters is exposed to oxygen, the situation is more complicated because O2 reacts with small Au clusters. (36) The rules proposed here can be applied to the general case when an adsorbed molecule has two isomers A and B whose binding energy to an oxide surface does not differ by a very large amount (no more than 0.4 eV). If isomer A is a Lewis acid, coadsorption with a Lewis base will force the molecule to adopt the structure A. If the isomer B is a Lewis base, coadsorption with a Lewis acid will force the molecule to have the structure B. 6 Oxygen Vacancies as Lewis Bases Removing an oxygen atom from an oxide surface (to make an oxygen vacancy) leaves behind two unpaired electrons. The properties of the oxygen vacancies and the fate of the unpaired electrons left behind have been the subject of many calculations (12, 19, 24, 37-62) and some experiments. (62-64) Oxygen vacancies are of interest because the energy of vacancy formation is an indirect measure of the ability of the oxide to work as an oxidant in catalytic oxidation taking place by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. (65-67) There are differences in the behavior of oxygen vacancies depending on whether the oxide is reducible or not. For the purpose of the present work, we say that the oxide A is reducible when the cation in it is able to form more than one stable oxide. For example, CeO2 and TiO2 are reducible because Ce2O3 and Ti2O3 are stable; MgO or CaO are irreducible.
Because the formation of an oxygen vacancy produces two unpaired electrons, a surface with an oxygen vacancy on it is a Lewis base. It will therefore tend, according to our rules, to interact strongly with a Lewis acid. This means that if a Lewis acid is present on the surface of an oxide the energy of making an oxygen vacancy is considerably lowered by the acidbase interaction. Another way to say this is that the presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface increases the binding energy of a Lewis acid (to the site vacated by the oxygen or to another site on the surface).
Given the fact that the vacancy site in the surface of an irreducible oxide is electron-rich, it is not a surprise that electrophilic compounds such as O2, X2 (X is a halogen), or a Au atom (all these are Lewis acids) will bind readily to the site vacated by oxygen. (24, 68, 69) More interesting is the fact that the presence of an oxygen vacancy affects the binding energy of a Lewis acid away from the vacancy site. One example is provided by a TiO2(110) surface that has an oxygen vacancy in the bridging oxygen row. The presence of the vacancy increases the binding energy of a Au atom (to the surface, not to the vacancy) to 1.2 eV as compared to 0.45 eV on the surface without vacancy. This effect is present whether the oxygen vacancy is in the first or the second oxygen layer.
It is striking that the binding energy of O2 to the rutile surface having an oxygen vacancy is 1.87 eV, and the Bader charge is 0.87 electron; the binding energy of O2 to a rutile slab having two electrons is 2.10 eV, and the Bader charge is 0.95 electron; and the binding energy of O2 to a rutile slab having two hydroxyls on the bridging oxygen row is 1.94 eV, and the Bader charge is 0.91 electron. To a rough approximation, these three basic surfaces have the same effect because they all provide two electrons to the O2 acid.
An interesting situation occurs in the case of a Cl vacancy in LaOCl. (70) Removing a Cl atom from the surface layer leaves behind one unpaired electron (not two as in the case of an oxygen vacancy). Nevertheless, the surface with a missing Cl atom is a strong base, and because of this it adsorbs O2(a strong Lewis acid) readily, even on sites away from the vacancy. If the surface does not have a Cl vacancy, it will not adsorb O2. This is similar to the behavior of an oxygen vacancy except that the oxygen vacancy is a stronger base since it has two electrons to donate.
It is possible to create a Cl vacancy on LaOCl by a spillover process: the Cl atom is removed from its normal lattice site, and it is adsorbed on the surface, rather than being taken away in the gas (as 1/2Cl2). This process is endoergic, but on some of the faces of LaOCl the energy required is small: for example, the spillover energy for LaOCl(110) is 0.10 eV; the largest spillover energy is 2 eV, for LaOCl(001). In contrast, the energy to make a Cl vacancy and form 1/2Cl2 in gas is between 2.76 and 4.23 eV, depending on the crystal face. It is clear that it is easier to make Cl vacancies by spillover than by removing Cl to form 1/2 Cl2 in the gas. The reason for this is the Lewis acidbase interaction. The adsorbed Cl atom, formed by spillover, is a Lewis acid, and the Cl vacancy is a Lewis base. According to the rules proposed here, forming this Lewis acidbase pair should benefit from an acidbase interaction: the acid and the base neutralize each other, and this leads to a gain in energy. This is why it requires much less energy to make a vacancy by spillover than by removing Cl from the surface to form 1/2Cl2 in the gas. A consequence of this neutralization is that the Cl vacancy made by spillover is no longer a base; the electron left behind in the Cl vacancy (the base) is used by the spilled Cl atom to bind to the surface. According to our rules, the surface formed by a Cl spillover is not a base (it has been neutralized by the spilled Cl atom), and it should adsorb O2 (a Lewis acid) weakly. Calculations show that this is the case. In addition, our rules predict that if the Cl vacancy is made by removing the Cl atom in the gas, then the defective surface is a base and will adsorb O2 strongly (on the vacancy site or on another site on the surface). Calculations show that this is indeed the case. 7 Low-Valence Dopants Turn the Oxide Surface into a Lewis Acid There is much work, both experimental (71) and computational, (6, 8-10, 38, 46, 47, 52, 54, 72-85) that explores the possibility that the catalytic activity of an oxide can be improved by substitutional doping (a small fraction of the cations of the oxide are replaced with different cations). In this section, we point out that one can turn an oxide surface into a Lewis acid if one substitutes the cation of the host oxide with a lower-valence cation (46, 77, 86, 87) (which we call a low-valence dopant (LVD)). For example, we could replace a La atom in La2O3 with a Mg atom or a Zn atom. Similarly, a cerium atom in CeO2 can be replaced with a La or a Y atom, etc. When making such a substitution, we create an electron deficit in the oxide. In the first example, the La atom being replaced provided (formally) three electrons to the oxide, and its replacement (Mg or Zn) provides only two. The substitution creates a need for an extra electron, and this turns the doped surface into a Lewis acid.
The notion that the oxide doped with a LVD is a Lewis acid is supported by the analysis of the density of states. It has been found (46, 77, 86, 87) that doping creates a hole in the oxide. The LUMO is shifted, by doping, from the bottom of the valence band to a state of lower energy. Therefore, doping increases the ability of the oxide to accept electrons, making the system a stronger acid. According to our rules, a base binds substantially more strongly to the surface of the doped oxide than to the surface of the undoped one.
The rule that a Lewis base binds more strongly to the surface of an oxide doped with a LVD works whether the oxide is reducible or not. However, the details of the mechanism of charge exchange between the acid and the base can be different on reducible oxides than on the irreducible ones. The reducible oxides are more complicated because their cations are Lewis acids (see Section 9): in the presence of a base they can be reduced from Ce4+ to Ce3+ or from Ti4+ to Ti3+. Therefore, a reducible oxide doped with a LVD has two acidic sites: the hole created by the presence of the LVD and the reducible cation (e.g., Ce4+ or Ti4+). When we adsorb a base on such a surface, the two acids compete for the electron donated by the base. It is not clear a priori whether the electron donated by the base fills the hole or reduces the cation. In an irreducible oxide doped with a LVD, the base always fills the hole since the cations cannot be reduced.
(1) Since making an oxygen vacancy is equivalent to turning the surface of the oxide into a Lewis base, our rules predict that making an oxygen vacancy, which is a base, requires substantially less energy on an oxide doped with a LVD than on the undoped oxide. This happens because the LVD turns the surface into a Lewis acid, and the formation of the vacancy creates a Lewis base. The energy of making a vacancy is lowered by the large Lewis acidbase pair interaction. This prediction has been verified, without exception, in all calculations we are aware of, (9, 38, 46, 52, 72, 73, 80, 87-91) and we give here only a few examples to illustrate the magnitude of the changes of energy of vacancy formation caused by the acidbase interaction. The energy of the reaction Ox  Oxv + 1/2O2(g) (here Ox is an oxide and Oxv is the same oxide with an oxygen vacancy in the top layer of the supercell) is defined here as the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation. Making a vacancy on the surface of La2O3(001) requires 6.44 eV. (46) Doping with Cu reduces this number to 0.52 eV, doping with Zn to 2.01 eV, and doping with Mg to 2.59 eV. We have observed similar effects when doping CaO or ZnO with alkali (79) or TiO2or CeO2 with Au. (73, 80) In all cases that have been examined, (8, 9, 25, 38, 46, 47, 52, 54, 72-85) the reduction in the vacancy formation energy, due to the presence of the dopant, is very large.
This effect is relevant to oxidation, or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides, that proceeds through the Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism. (65-67) In this mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is. (73, 80) This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4). (73, 80) If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle.
(2) If doping an oxide with a LVD turns it into a Lewis acid, then doping should increase substantially the binding energy of any Lewis base, not just the formation of an oxygen vacancy. Calculations show that this is indeed the case. (73, 77, 80, 86) This is true of CO adsorption, which is a Lewis base, whose binding energy to the oxygen atom next to a LVD is substantially larger than the binding energy to the undoped oxide. (54, 72-74, 80, 88, 92, 93) The binding of a H atom (a Lewis base) provides another example. (77, 86, 94) The energy of the reaction 1/2H2 + Ox  H/Ox (here H/Ox is the oxide with a H adsorbed to make a hydroxyl) is 1.53 eV if Ox = La2O3 and 2.35 eV if Ox = MgLa2O3; it is 1.24 eV if Ox = CeO2 and 2.94 eV if Ox = LaCeO2 (here MgLa2O3 is La2O3 doped with Mg, and LaCeO2 has a similar meaning). This large shift in the binding energy has been observed for all surfaces doped with LVDs for which we have calculations. A very similar shift is observed for the energy of the reaction CH3(g) + Ox  CH3/Ox since CH3 is a Lewis base. The energy of the reaction is 4.56 eV if Ox is LaCeO2(111) and 2.71 eV if Ox is CeO2; it is 0.56 eV if Ox = La2O3 and 3.26 eV if Ox = MgLa2O3(001).
It is interesting to see how doping with a LVD affects the reaction CH4(g) + Ox  (HO, CH3O)/Ox, which is the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxy group on the surface. CH3 and H are both Lewis bases. The dissociative adsorption energy is 1.31 eV if Ox = CeO2(111) and 2.93 eV if Ox = LaCeO2(111). The La-doped ceria surface is a Lewis acid, and doping does help the dissociation of CH4 because the reaction creates two Lewis bases (H and CH3). However, the change in the adsorption energy caused by doping with the LVD is not as large as one would expect from knowing the binding energy of H alone and of CH3 alone (which are very large). This happens because one of the bases neutralizes the acidity of the surface, and the second base no longer benefits from a Lewis acidbase interaction. (77, 86) The calculations show that increasing the Lewis acidity of an oxide surface, by doping an oxide with a LVD, increases the energy of the dissociative adsorption of methane (38, 47, 78, 86) and lowers the activation energy (38, 47, 78) for breaking the CH bond. This is important because breaking this bond is the rate-limiting step for methane activation, a process that is becoming more important due to recent changes in the technology of methane extraction, which dramatically increased the supply of natural gas and caused its price to collapse. Converting methane to high value chemicals has become a priority for the chemical industry.
The chemistry of the reducible oxides doped with LVDs is complicated by the fact that the cations are acidic and the dopant-induced acidity is additional to that already present in the oxide. If the oxide is reducible, a base binds strongly to the surface and donates electronic charge to fill the hole created by the LVD. In an irreducible oxide, the electron charge donated by the base may either fill the hole or reduce the cation. Several of Nolans papers have examined how these two mechanisms compete. (6, 8, 9, 52, 72) The rule we propose here, that the acidity of the surface enhances the binding energy of a base, is valid regardless of the details of the mechanism of charge exchange. 8 Chemical Compensation Effect Is Equivalent to the Neutralization of an Acid by a Base In a previous work, (77) we have proposed a chemical compensation rule, which works as follows. An oxide surface doped with a LVD lowers the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, increases the binding energy of H and CH3 to surface oxygen, and makes the dissociative adsorption of CH4 (with H and CH3bonded to surface oxygen) more exothermic than on the undoped oxide. The effect of the dopant on the energy of these processes is very substantial, of the order of several electronvolts.
According to the rule proposed here, we can neutralize the effect of a Lewis acid by adsorbing on the surface a Lewis base. Calculations show (77) that such neutralization takes place and has a large effect on the chemistry of the surface. Consider, as an example, what happens when we adsorb a H atom (a base) on La-doped CeO2 (an acid) to form the system we denote H/LaCeO2. The energy to make an oxygen vacancy is 3.00 eV on CeO2(111), 1.36 eV on LaCeO2, and 2.99 eV on H/LaCeO2(111). The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on H/LaCeO2 is essentially the same as that on CeO2; the presence of the adsorbed hydrogen cancels the effect of the La dopant. Similar behavior was found for Mg-doped La2O3 or CaO doped with alkali. However, the complete compensation observed in the case of H/LaCeO2 is an exception. For example, the energy of oxygen vacancy formation is 5.77 eV on CaO(001), 3.13 eV on NaCaO(001), and 5.33 eV on H/NaCaO(001). The compensation does not return the energy of vacancy formation exactly to the value on the undoped oxide.
If this compensation effect is caused by the acidbase interaction, it should be observed for other bases besides the hydroxyl formed by adsorbing H. This is indeed the case: the adsorption of CH3, instead of H, has the same effect. Moreover, if we do not adsorb a Lewis base but put instead an extra electron in the slab, we observe the same compensation (77) of the acidity of the doped surface. 9 Reducible Oxides Are Weak Lewis Acids Many experiments with ceria or titania have shown (14, 64, 95-103) that, unless special precautions are taken, Ce3+ and Ti3+ are present in TiO2 and CeO2. Something always reduces some of the Ce4+ or Ti4+ cations. Moreover, it was observed that the formation of oxygen vacancies or the presence of hydroxyls on the surface increases the number of the reduced cations. Because the vacancies and the hydroxyls are Lewis bases, this observation suggests that the cations in these two oxides act as Lewis acids. According to our rules, this means that the adsorption of a base on the surface is facilitated (i.e., the binding energy is larger) by the acidity of the cations in the oxide.
Recent calculations have helped clarify the interaction between oxygen vacancies and acidic properties of the reducible cations in ceria (6, 12, 58, 104) and rutile. (40, 105) These calculations have shown that the two unpaired electrons created when an oxygen atom is removed (to create an oxygen vacancy) become localized on two Ce or two Ti atoms, reducing them from a formal charge of 4+ to 3+. The reduction of the cations is accompanied by a displacement of the oxygen atoms from their normal position (i.e., in the stoichiometric oxide) to form a polaron. According to our rules, the formation of an oxygen vacancy, which is a Lewis base, must be aided by the Lewis acidity of the cations being reduced by the unpaired electrons. The magnitude of the acidbase interaction (the vacancy is the base, and the cations are the acid) depends on the location of the polarons and can be as large as 1 eV. (40, 105) Thus, the formation of a base on the surface (i.e., an oxygen vacancy) is facilitated by the acidic character of the cations in the oxide.
The fact that Ce ions are Lewis acids has interesting consequences when ceria is doped with a high-valence dopant (HVD). A HVD is a dopant that has a higher valence than the cation it substitutes. For example, pentavalent Ta is a HVD when it dopes ceria. A HVD is a Lewis base because it has an excess of valence electrons, when compared to the cation it substitutes. According to our rules, we expect that the HVD is affected strongly when it dopes a reducible oxide. Such an influence has been observed in calculations. (87) If CeO2 is doped with Nb or Ta, these pentavalent dopants lose an electron, which fills an f-orbital localized on a Ce ion. The formal valence of this Ce ion is 3+. Similarly, the hexavalent dopants W or Mo lose two electrons to reduce two cerium ions. The energy of these systems is lower than the energy that would be obtained if the formation of Ce3+ was prevented.
This acidbase neutralization has an interesting consequence. Doping ceria with Mo, W, Ta, Nb, Ru, Pt, or Zr has roughly the same effect on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation. (87) This is unexpected since the Zr, Ta, and Nb form very stable oxides, and one would think that they would make strong bonds with the neighboring oxygen atoms in the doped ceria. Moreover, Ru and Pt oxides are much less stable than ceria, and one would expect that they would bind the neighboring oxygen atoms more weakly than Zr, Ta, or Nb. This is not what is observed: the acidbase neutralization process mentioned above makes all dopants tetravalent, and because of this, all these dopants have a similar effect on the neighboring oxygen atoms.
Further evidence for the acidity of the reducible oxides is provided by calculations that show that a Cu atom (106) or a Au atom (107) adsorbed on ceria acts as a base which donates an electron to reduce one cerium cation.
It is important to note that to capture the acid behavior of reducible oxides it is important to use GGA+U. The ability of an adsorbed atom to function as a Lewis base and reduce a cation in the oxide is predicated on the ability of the functional to create states localized on the cation. 10 High-Valence Dopants Are Lewis Bases High-valence dopants in an irreducible oxide have a different behavior than in a reducible one. To illustrate the difference, we contrast the effect of Ta dopant in ZrO2 and in CeO2. In ceria, a Ta dopant donates an electron (87) to the oxide to reduce a Ce4+ to Ce3+. Such reduction does not occur when Ta dopes ZrO2 since Zr2O3 does not exist, and there is no driving force to create Zr3+. When it replaces a Zr atom in ZrO2, a Ta atom can use only four of its five valence electrons. The unused electron stays on the Ta dopant, turning it into a strong Lewis base. We have found this to be true for many HVDs in the irreducible oxides CaO, La2O3, MgO, ZnO, and NiO.
According to our rules, a HVD is a Lewis base, and its presence will make it more difficult to remove an oxygen atom from the surface. Making an oxygen vacancy creates a base on a surface that is already a base (the oxide doped with HVD), and this requires more energy than making the same base (the vacancy) on the undoped oxide (which is neither an acid nor a base). Calculations show that this effect is very small on oxides that bind the oxygen very strongly (e.g., CaO, MgO, or La2O3), but it is substantial on less stable oxides such as ZnO (79) or NiO. The energy of making an oxygen vacancy in NiO(011) is 3.28 eV, and it is 4.13 eV for Nb-doped NiO, 4.25 eV for Ti-doped NiO, and 4.6 eV for Al-doped NiO. A similar increase in the oxygen vacancy formation energy occurs for all HVDs in ZnO. (79) By strengthening the bond of the oxygen atoms to the oxide, these dopants hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism.
We are interested in doped oxides because of their potential of being good catalysts for oxidation reactions. Under catalytic conditions, the doped oxide will be in contact with gas-phase oxygen. Because the HDV is a Lewis base, our rules indicate that the dopant will adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2. It is therefore necessary to examine the chemical properties of this system. We denote the group formed by O2 adsorption on the dopant by DO2 where D is the dopant. Similarly, we use DO for the dopant with an oxygen atom (captured from the gas, not from the oxide) bound to it.
We anticipate that oxides with a DO2 or a DO dopant will fall into two groups. (1) If the dopant is not a very strong base, it adsorbs O2 (or X2), but it does not manage to neutralize its acidity completely. Because of this, the adsorbed O2 is capable of reacting with Lewis bases. (2) If the dopant is a very strong base, it neutralized the (Lewis acid) O2 completely, so it will no longer react with Lewis bases. In this case, it is profitable to think that DO2 is a substitutional dopant. Since the O2 ties down the extra electrons in the dopant, the DO2 behaves as if it is a LVD; the surface becomes acidic, with the attendant change in surface chemistry.
We discuss these limiting cases separately.
10.1 HVDs Adsorb Oxygen and Activate It
If the HVD is a weak base, it will adsorb O2, but it will not neutralize completely its acidity. Therefore, O2 will react readily with bases such as CO, H, or CH3. This prediction has been confirmed by several calculations. If ZnO is doped with Ti (or Al), the oxygen molecule adsorbs on the dopant. (76) The Bader charge on O2 increases, and the bond length of the adsorbed molecule is larger than that of the gas-phase molecule. The chemical properties of this adsorbed species are closer to those of O2 than to those of O2. DFT calculations (76) show that the O2 adsorbed on the HVD reacts readily with CO, initiating a sequence of reactions that result in the CO oxidation to CO2. This mechanism is the antipode of the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism: the oxygen in the oxidized species comes from the adsorbed molecule not from the surface of the oxide. This has been confirmed by C16O oxidation experiments, (76) catalyzed by Ti-doped ZnO, which used gaseous 18O2 and produced C18O16O.
This mechanism is also active for Zr-doped CaO(001) and La-doped CaO(001), which adsorb O2 from the gas phase with the adsorption energy of 2.67 and 2.66 eV, respectively. The binding energy is so large because of the acidbase stabilization proposed here. The bond length of O2 chemisorbed on the Zr dopant is 1.35 Å, while the bond length of the gas phase O2 is 1.20 Å; this suggests the formation of a chemically active, negatively charged O2 species. Methane reacts with the adsorbed O2 to form ZrOH and ZrOCH3; the two oxygen atoms present in these species are from the O2 chemisorbed on Zr (Figure 1). The energy of this dissociative adsorption reaction is 0.84 eV. One can understand this behavior in terms of the acidbase properties of the system. The dopant is not a strong enough base to neutralize completely the O2 acid. Therefore, the O2 in the DO2 group is still sufficiently acid to bind well the basic fragments H and CH3. This additional binding energy in the final state helps lower the energy of the dissociative adsorption of CH4.
Figure 1 Figure 1. (a) Side view of the structure formed by the dissociative adsorption of methane on O2 adsorbed on Zr-doped CaO(001). The dissociation fragments bind to the oxygen atoms of the O2 molecule adsorbed on Zr. Ca is green; oxygen is red; Zr is blue; C is gray; and H is white. The dissociation is exothermic, and the reaction energy is 0.84 eV. (b) Structure in (a) seen from above.
Since a HVD is a Lewis base, it should react readily with other Lewis acids, besides O2. We found that to be the case for Br2 adsorption on Zr-doped La2O3(001). The gas-phase Br2(a Lewis acid) adsorbs and dissociates on Zr (a Lewis base), and the reaction energy is 2.67 eV. This is much larger than the adsorption of Br2 on La2O3 (which is neither acid nor base) or on Mg-doped La2O3 (which is acid). Both Br atoms gain a large Bader charge, 0.68 electron and 0.49 electron, respectively, indicating that the adsorption is an acidbase reaction.
10.2 HVD Adsorbs Oxygen and Becomes a Different Dopant
The adsorption of O2 on the dopant ties down some of the electrons that made the dopant a base. How is the oxide interaction with the dopant modified when the DO2 group is formed? To explore this question, it is simplest to consider that O2 adsorption changed the dopant from D to DO2. Since the oxygen uses some of the extra electrons in D, DO2 has fewer electrons to affect the host oxide than D. How does this affect surface chemistry?
This question was posed in an article (108) that examined how rutile TiO2(110) doped with V, Cr, Mo, W, or Mn is modified by the presence of gas-phase oxygen. A thermodynamic equilibrium calculation showed that, at the oxygen pressure and surface temperatures relevant to catalysis, these dopants (except Mn) will have an oxygen atom adsorbed on them. Therefore, if oxygen is present in the gas, the dopants are Mn, CrO, MoO, WO, or VO. This is not surprising. In its most stable oxide, Mn is tetravalent, and one can conjecture that when it replaces another tetravalent cation (Ti in the case of TiO2) the Mn is neither an acid nor a base. Therefore, it is unlikely to bind O strongly. Since V is pentavalent and W and Mo are hexavalent, they will act as bases and will bind oxygen well. In the case of Cr, there is some ambiguity: CrO3, CrO, and Cr2O3 have roughly the same stability, and it is difficult to predict a priori whether Cr is an acid or a base when it replaces a Ti atom in TiO2.
To test what kind of dopant DO is (D = Cr, V, W, Mo), Kim et al. (108) calculated the energy ΔEv for making an oxygen vacancy in the surface of the oxide near the dopant. If the dopants are V, Cr, Mo, or W, the value of ΔEv is 3.37, 2.67, 3.49, or 3.61 eV, respectively. All naked dopants act as HVDs (they increase the energy of vacancy formation) except Cr which acts more like a low-valence dopant. The behavior of the MO dopants is markedly different. The values of ΔEv for the rutile doped with VO, CrO, MoO, and WO are 1.53, 1.73, 1.71, and 1.97 eV, respectively, which is a substantial decrease as compared to the surface doped with V, Cr, Mo, or W or with the undoped surface. All these dopants behave like LVDs, that is, like Lewis acids. The O atom, which is a strong acid, overcomes the basicity of the naked dopants D, so that DO becomes acidic, and the surface of the host oxide changes accordingly.
These older calculations were performed with GGA, and the results are questionable. It is likely that a GGA+U calculation would allow V, Cr, Mo, and W to donate electrons to reduce the Ti atoms from Ti4+ to Ti3+. In other words, within GGA+U the rutile cations have some acidity, and they will tend to partially neutralize the basicity of the HVDs V, Cr, Mo, or W. However, possible doubts in the reliability of the qualitative results obtained by GGA are allayed by two attenuating circumstance. First, the change in ΔEv when the dopant changes from D to DO is very large, and this provides a margin of safety. It is likely that GGA+U will also find that the presence of DO lowers ΔEv. Moreover, the cations in TiO2 are weak acids: given a choice between neutralizing Ti or forming a bond with the oxygen, it is likely that the extra electrons that make D a base will choose the latter.
A similar behavior has been observed for Zr-doped CaO and La2O3. The formation of ZrO2 does activate the surface oxygen atoms near the dopant. When this system reacts with CH4, the alkane dissociates, and it can either form ZrOCH3 and ZrOH (Figure 1) or form ZrOCH3 and OH (Figure 2), with the oxygen in OH being the surface oxygen. The latter is activated by the presence of ZrO2. The energies for these two dissociative adsorption processes are close to each other (0.84 and 0.91 eV, respectively) Figure 2 Figure 2. (a) Side view of the structure formed by the dissociation of methane on Zr-doped CaO(001). Unlike Figure 1, here the H atom formed by dissociation binds to an oxygen atom from the surface. The CH3 radical forms a methoxide with one of the oxygen atoms adsorbed on the Zr dopant. Ca is green; oxygen is red; Zr is blue; C is gray; and hydrogen is white. The dissociation is exothermic, and the reaction energy is 0.91 eV. (b) Structure in (a) seen from above.
A more dramatic example of this effect is provided by Nb-doped NiO(011). The Nb dopant, which has five valence electrons, replaces a divalent Ni atom. Therefore, Nb is a very strong base. The adsorption energy of O2 on the Nb dopant is 8.40 eV. This energy is so low that no reaction involving the oxygen atoms in the NbO2 group will result in gas-phase products (the Sabatier principle). This means that the exposure of the Nb-doped NiO(011) surface to oxygen, during an oxidation reaction, will cause each Nb atom in the surface to bind two oxygen atoms. If any catalysis is to take place on this surface, the catalyst is NiO(001) doped with NbO2. Our rules can help guess the behavior of this system. Formally, the adsorption of O2 on Nb brings to the NbO2 four electrons (O is divalent) so that (formally) the NbO2 group has only one available valence electron. Since this monovalent NbO2 group replaces a divalent Ni atom, it ought to act as a low-valence dopant and turn the surface into a Lewis acid. If this is true, then according to our rules, the presence of NbO2 dopant will weaken the binding energy of the surface oxygen atoms around the dopant and make it easier to make oxygen vacancies. The DFT calculations show that this prediction is correct. In Figure 3 we show the NiO(011) surface doped with NbO2. We marked two of the oxygen atoms as A and B. Making an oxygen vacancy by removing the atom A requires 2.31 eV, and making a vacancy by removing B costs 2.67 eV. This is substantially lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on the undoped surface, which is 3.28 eV. The NbO2 dopant acts indeed as a LVD (it is acid), and it facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies (which are basic). This surface has another property typical of an oxide doped with a LVD: the oxygen atoms near the NbO2 group help the dissociative adsorption of ethane. Among many possible structures for the dissociation fragments, several involve the binding of H or CH3CH2 to the oxygen atoms in the surface of NiO, which are activated by the presence of the NbO2 dopant. The energy for this dissociative adsorption reaction, for various final fragment configurations, varies between 0.06 and 1.06 eV. This is lower than the dissociation energy on NiO. Doping with NbO2 favors the breaking of the CH bond, which is typical of an oxide doped with a LVD.
Figure 3 Figure 3. NiO(011) doped with NbO2 which was obtained by replacing a surface Ni atom with Nb and then adsorbing an O2 molecule on Nb. The NbO2 group replaces a Ni atom, and it acts as a LVD (it is a Lewis acid). Because of this, the oxygen atoms marked A and B are easier to remove, to make oxygen vacancies, than in the case of the undoped oxide. Ni is purple; the oxygen in the top layer is red; the oxygen in the second layer is yellow; the oxygen adsorbed on Nb is dark blue; and Nb is light blue. 11 Summary We have shown that many trends related to chemical processes relevant to catalytic chemistry of oxide surfaces can be predicted (or rationalized) by a few rules pertaining to the Lewis acidbase properties of the chemicals involved. These rules provide guidance on possible ways of manipulating oxide surface chemistry. (a) The binding energy of a Lewis acid to an oxide surface can be increased substantially if the surface is modified to become a Lewis base. This modification can be achieved by preadsorbing on the surface electron donors. Conversely, the binding energy of a Lewis base can be increased by modifying the surface to become a Lewis acid, which can be achieved by doping with low-valence dopants. (b) It is possible to define, qualitatively, an acid or a base strength, and the acidbase interaction increases as the strength of the acid or the base is increased. (c) If a surface is modified to be a Lewis acid, to confer on it certain properties, these properties can be substantially suppressed by adsorbing on the surface a Lewis base. The system behaves as if the base neutralizes the acid. (d) In some cases, an adsorbed species can have two isomers, one that is a base and the other that is an acid. If that species is coadsorbed with a Lewis acid, it will take the structure that is a base. If it is coadsorbed with a Lewis base, it will take the structure in which it is an acid. (e) Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid). (f) Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms. The vacancy is a strong base, and the unpaired electrons produced when the oxygen atom is removed are transferred to the cations of the oxide. This reduces the energy to form the vacancy. An adsorbed metal atom, such as Pt, or Au, or Cu, donates electrons to reduce the oxides cation. (g) High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases. If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active. However, in some cases the group formed by the dopant with O2 adsorbed on it acts as a low-valence dopant and activates surface oxygen.
These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
