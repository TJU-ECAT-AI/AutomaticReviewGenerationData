Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide information on the preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts, nor does it discuss their influence on the electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems are also not addressed.

1.The literature does not provide information on how preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide using supported vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts, not nickel oxide-based catalysts. It does not discuss the challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, or balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in nickel oxide-based catalytic systems for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
