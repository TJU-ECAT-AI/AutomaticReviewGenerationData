Abstract Natural phlogophite, pre-treated with acids and intercalated with alumina pillars,was used as catalytic support. Transition metals (Fe, Cu) were deposited on the surface of the modified clay materials by an ion-exchange method. The obtained samples were characterized with respect to structure (XRD), texture (BET),composition (EPMA) and chemical nature of the deposited transition metals species (UV-vis-DRS). The phlogophite based materials have been found to be active and selective catalysts of the DeNOx process. The Fe-containing samples were catalytically active at lower temperatures than the clays modified with copper. A competitive ammonia oxidation by oxygen decreased the effectiveness of the DeNOx process in the high temperature range.

INTRODUCTION
Natural cationic layered clays seem to be excellent raw materials for preparation of catalysts and adsorbents. Until now, the majority of studies has been focused on the modification of smectites. Intercalation of smectites with metal oxide pillars (e.g. Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2) [e.g. 1-3] results in formation of high surface area microporous materials. The surface acidity of cationic layered clays can be modified by acid treatment, while deposition of transition metals (e.g. by the ion-exchange method) results in the generation of redox centers.
Smectites intercalated with metal oxide pillars and additionally modified with transition metals have been found to be active catalysts of the selective reduction of NO with ammonia [e.g. 1-3]. However, it should be mentioned that the pillared structure of modified smectites is stable only to about 500C in temperature. Therefore, an overheating of smectites intercalated with metal oxide pillars results in the collapse of their pillared structure. Significantly more thermally stable microporous materials can be obtained by the replacement of smectites for micas. The synthesis of such materials, which are stable at temperatures of about 750C, was proposed by del Rey-Perez-Caballero and Poncelet [4] in 2000. Phlogophites, which were used as raw materials for the synthesis of catalysts, are thioctahedral (2:1) sheet silicates with a general formula of Mx(Si4-xAlx)IV(Mg3)VIO10(OH,F)2·H2O (where: M-interlayer cations; IV-tetrahedral positions, VI-octahedral positions). Octahedral positions are occupied by Mg2+ cations, while the tetrahedral sites are occupied mainly by silicon cations. Part of the Si4+ cations in tetrahedral positions is substituted by Al3+ ions. Such substitution results in a negative charge of the clay layers. This negative charge is compensated by common cations (e.g. K+, Na+, Ca2+), which together with water molecules, are localized in the interlayer space of phlogophites. The direct pillaring of phlogophites with metal oxide pillars is not effective because of a very strong stabilization of cations in the interlayer space of clay. Therefore, before the pillaring process, the charge of the phlogophite layers should be reduced by an acid treatment. During this modification, a part of the Al3+ cations is leached out from the tetrahedral sheets and deposited in the interlayer spaces of the phlogophite. In the next step, interlayer aluminum cations should be complexated (e.g. by oxalic or citric acid) and removed from the clay material. Phlogophite modified in this way is ready for the pillaring process.
In the paper, the synthesis of microporous materials based on natural phlogophite as well as the studies of such materials in the role of the DeNOx catalysts are presented.

EXPERIMENTAL
Catalysts preparation
Natural phlogophite (P), supplied by S&B Industrial Minerals GmbH, was used as a starting material for the preparation of catalysts. The modification of the layered silica has been performed according to the procedure proposed by del Rey-Perez-Caballero and Poncelet [4]. The modification of phlogophite consisted of six steps.
Step 1: The starting clay material was leached with 10 mL of HNO3 solution (0.78 M) per 1 gram of clay at 95C for 4 h under stirring. The solid was washed, separated by filtration and oven dried.
Step 2: The acid treated clay sample was calcined at 600C for 4 h in static air.
Step 3: The calcined phlogophite (P-NA) was leached with oxalic acid or citric acid (10 mL of 0.12 M per 1 g of sample) for 3 h at 80C. Then the solids were washed, separated by filtration and oven dried. The samples treated with oxalic or citric acids are denoted as P-NA-OA or P-NA-CA, respectively.
Step 4: The materials obtained in step 3 were ion exchanged with a solution of NaCl (3 M). The slurry of 5 wt.% of the clay material was kept at 95C under stirring. This procedure was repeated 4 times. Then, the solid was washed until free of chlorides and oven dried.
Step 5: The modified clay samples were pillared with aluminium oligocations. The pillaring solution was prepared by a slow addition of 0.1 M NaOH into AlCl3 solution under constant stirring until the molar ratio of OH/Al reached 2.4. The solution was aged for 2 weeks at room temperature.
Subsequently, the pillaring solution was slowly added into the suspension containing 1 wt.% of the sodium-exchanged clay in deionised water until the Al/clay ratio reached the value of 10 mmole Al/g clay. The mixture was allowed to react at room temperature for 24 h. Then the modified phlogophites were separated, washed with distilled water until all the chloride ions were removed and dried at 120C for 12 h. Finally, the samples were calcined at 450C for 12 h. The Al2O3-pillared clays are denoted as P-NA-Al, P-NA-OA-Al and P-NA- CA-Al.
Step 6: Transition metals (Cu or Fe) were deposited on the modified clays by an ion-exchange method using aqueous solutions (0.02 M) of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O or Fe(NO3)3·9H2O. Then dried at room temperature and finally calcined at 450C for 3 h.
Catalysts characterization
Textural parameters of the samples were determined by N2 sorption at -196C using an ASAP 2010 (Micromeritic) automated gas adsorption system.
Prior to analysis, the samples were outgassed under vacuum at 350C for 12 h. 372 CHMIELARZ et al.: PILLARED PHLOGOPHITES The surface area was determined using the BET equation, while the micropore volumes of the samples were calculated using the t-method of DeBoer. X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples were obtained with a Philips X'Pert APD diffractometer. Transition metal loadings were determined by electron microprobe analysis performed on a JEOL JCXA 733 superprobe. The UV-Vis- DR spectra of the samples were recorded on a Thermo 600 spectrophotometer.The measurements have been performed in the range of 200-900 nm with a resolution of 4 nm.
Catalytic tests
Modified phlogophites have been tested as catalysts of the DeNOx process.
The catalytic experiments have been performed under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed flow microreactor. The reactant concentrations were continuously measured using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (VG QUARTZ) connected directly to the reactor outlet. Prior to the catalytic test, each sample of the catalyst (100 mg) was outgassed in a flow of pure helium at 400C for 1 h.
Composition of the gas mixture at the reactor inlet was [NO]=[NH3]=0.25 vol.%, [O2] = 2.50 vol.%. Helium was used as a balancing gas at a total flow rate of 40 mL/min. The reaction was studied in the temperature range from 100 to 500C. The intensities of the mass lines corresponding to all reactants and possible products were measured at a given temperature at least for 30 min after the reaction had reached steady-state. The signal of the helium line served as an internal standard to compensate possible small fluctuations of the operating pressure. The sensitivity factors of analyzed lines were calibrated using commercial mixtures of gases.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Examples of the N2-adsorption isotherms recorded for the Al2O3-pillared clays are presented in Fig. 1. The pillared phlogophites, especially those treated with oxalic or citric acids are characterized by isotherms of type I in the low- pressure range, and isotherms of type II at higher pressure. Such shape of isotherm suggests an existence of both micropores and also larger pores in the samples. The textural parameters and transition metal loading of the modified phlogophites are shown in Table 1. It should be noted that the pre-treatment of phlogophite with nitric acid followed by the pillaring with Al2O3 resulted in a significant increase in the surface area and pore volume from 1 m2/g and 0.001 cm3/g to 52 m2/g and 0.035 cm3/g, respectively. These parameters increased more than two times when leaching of phlogophites with oxalic or citric acid CHMIELARZ et al.: PILLARED PHLOGOPHITES 373

was performed before the pillaring process. Therefore, this synthesis step seems to be very important. Deposition of transition metals (TM) reduced the surface area and porosity of the pillared phlogophites. This effect is more significant for the Fe-modified samples, probably due to a higher loading of this transition metal as compared to the copper containing samples. 374 CHMIELARZ et al.: PILLARED PHLOGOPHITES 0 5 10 15 Intensity [a.u] 2θ

Fig. 2. X-ray diffractograms of raw and Al2O3-pillared phlogophites
The XRD patterns recorded for raw and Al2O3-pillared phlogophites are shown in Fig. 2. The starting phlogophite showed a single and intensive reflection at 8.8 2Θ (10.0Å). For pillared micas a new peak at 2Θ of 5.0 (17.6Å) related to increased interlayer distance due to the pillaring process has appeared. Additionally, the intensity of the reflection at 8.8 was significantly reduced. An existence of this peak in the XRD patterns of the modified materials suggests an incomplete intercalation of the phlogophites with Al2O3.
This hypothesis is supported by studies performed by del Rey-Perez-Caballero and Poncelet [4], who obtained pillared phlogophites of significantly higher surface areas. The difference in a quality of the mica based materials is probably related to various properties of the starting phlogophites, and it seems that the conditions of modification of micas (treatment with nitric, oxalic or citric acids) should be optimized separately for each starting clay.
The chemical nature of transition metal species deposited on the Al2O3- pillared phlogophites was studied by UV-Vis-DR spectroscopy. Figure 3 presents differential spectra (difference between the spectrum of the transition metal modified sample and that of the support) related only to the state of introduced transition metals. The spectra recorded for the Cu-containing samples can be deconvoluted to three maxima centered at about 230-240, 340- 360 and 800-830 nm. The first peak is attributed to a charge-transfer between the mononuclear Cu2+ ion and oxygen. The maximum at about 340-360 nm can be ascribed to charge-transfer between Cu2+ and oxygen in oligonuclear [Cu-O- Cu]n species, while the peak at about 800-830 nm can be related to the d-d transition of Cu with an octahedral environment in CuO [5].

Significantly higher contribution of copper in the form of isolated cations was found for P-NA-Al-Cu and P-NA-OA-Al-Cu than for P-NA-CA-Al-Cu. Oligomeric and bulky copper oxides were present in similar concentrations for all the Cu-containing samples.

For the Fe-containing samples, broad and asymmetric bands centered at about 500 nm were recorded. These bands were deconvoluted to two peaks centered at about 300-400 nm and 480-530 nm. The first band corresponds to oligonuclear (FeO)n species [6], while the second one can be assigned to spin forbidden d-d transitions of Fe3+ in bulky iron oxide [7].
The modified phlogophites were tested as catalysts of the selective reduction of NO with ammonia. The results of these studies are presented in Fig. 4. The pillared phlogophite unmodified with transition metals (P-NA-OA-Al) has shown activity only at temperature above 350C. However, the NO conversion measured for this sample did not exceed 20% at temperatures below 500C. A significant increase in the catalytic activity of the phlogophite samples was observed after the deposition of transition metals. A decrease in the NO conversion observed in the high temperature region is related to the side process of ammonia oxidation by oxygen. The Fe-containing catalysts (Fig. 4A) were active at lower temperatures than the phlogophites modified with copper (Fig. 4B). In our previous studies performed for other types of Cu- and Fe- containing catalysts [3, 8, 9], the opposite activity order had been found. The activity of Fe-modified samples in the low temperature range could be explained by a significantly higher loading of iron as compared to copper (Table 1). Moreover, iron is present mainly in the form of oligomeric and bulky oxide species, which are catalytically active in the low temperature DeNOx and also in the side reaction of ammonia oxidation by oxygen. In a series of the Fe- as well as Cu-containing samples the highest activity was measured for the catalysts based on phlogophites treated with oxalic or citric acids. As was shown in Table 1, these samples were characterized by significantly higher surface area and porosity than the materials unmodified in this way. Therefore,it seems that the textural parameters of the samples strongly influence their catalytic performance. The high selectivity to nitrogen, which did not drop below 94% in the whole temperature range studied, is a very important parameter of phlogophite based catalysts.
CONCLUSIONS
The procedure applied for the intercalation of natural phlogophite with Al2O3 pillars resulted in a significant increase of its surface area and pore volume. The deposition of transition metals on the surface of the modified phlogophites by an ion exchange method resulted in a decrease in these parameters. Copper introduced onto the clay materials was found in the form of isolated cations, as well as oligomeric and bulky copper oxide species. In the case of the iron modified samples, the transition metal was present only in the form of oligomeric and bulky iron oxides. The Al2O3-pillared phlogophites modified 378 CHMIELARZ et al.: PILLARED PHLOGOPHITES with copper or iron have been found to be active and selective catalysts in the DeNOx process. The Fe-containing catalysts operated effectively at lower temperatures as compared to phlogophites modified with copper. The competitive ammonia oxidation by oxygen decreased the efficiency of the DeNOx process in the high temperature range.
