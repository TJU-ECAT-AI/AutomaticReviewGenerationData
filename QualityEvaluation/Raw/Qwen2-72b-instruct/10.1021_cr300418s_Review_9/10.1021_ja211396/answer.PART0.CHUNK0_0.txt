1.The provided literature does not contain information about the preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts, nor does it discuss their influence on the electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The literature focuses on the effects of Li/Mo codoping of CaO films on the equilibrium shape of Au deposits and does not address the challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, or balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in nickel oxide-based catalytic systems.

1.提供的文献没有包含关于镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成的信息，也没有讨论这些因素对氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中电子结构和催化性能的影响。文献主要关注Li/Mo共掺杂CaO薄膜对Au沉积物平衡形态的影响，没有涉及镍氧化物基催化体系中理论建模、过程优化或平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的挑战。
