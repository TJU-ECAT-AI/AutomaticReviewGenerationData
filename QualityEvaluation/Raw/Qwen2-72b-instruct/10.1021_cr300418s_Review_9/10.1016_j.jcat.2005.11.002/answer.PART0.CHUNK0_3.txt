[1] "A series of mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratio ranging from 0 to 0.67 was prepared by the evaporation method."
[2] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
[3] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
[4] "The introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicat- ing modification of the catalysts and contributions from differ- ent species."
[5] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice in- hibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
[6] "The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity and generates new acid sites of weak and moderate strength."
[7] "The effect is much more pronounced if we compare, for example, pure NiO and the Ni0.9Nb0.1 catalyst,where the introduction of only 10% of Nb leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity."
[8] "The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice con- stant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
[9] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommo- date."
[10] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene [15]. Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

1.The preparation of NiNbO mixed oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratios from 0 to 0.67 by the evaporation method influences the electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, leading to a decrease in the lattice constant up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176. The stable NiO lattice constant for high-Nb loading samples indicates the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice. The introduction of Nb broadens the reduction profiles, indicating modification of the catalysts and contributions from different species. The incorporation of niobium inhibits crystallization, resulting in smaller grain sizes. However, at high Nb loading, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to larger crystals. The introduction of niobium significantly increases the total acidity and generates new acid sites of weak and moderate strength. For example, the introduction of only 10% of Nb leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity compared to pure NiO. The XRD data indicate that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds. The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the complex interactions between the dopant, lattice structure, and surface properties, optimizing the dopant concentration for maximum catalytic performance, and ensuring the stability and safety of the catalysts under reaction conditions.

1.通过蒸发法制备了Nb/Ni原子比从0到0.67变化的NiNbO混合氧化物，这影响了电子结构和氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。铌的掺入导致NiO晶格收缩，晶格常数在Nb/Ni比为0.176时下降。高铌负载样品中稳定的NiO晶格常数表明Nb5+离子在NiO晶格中的最大可能溶解度。铌的引入使还原曲线变宽，表明催化剂的修改和来自不同物种的贡献。铌的掺入抑制了结晶，导致更小的晶粒尺寸。然而，在高铌负载下，NiO的结晶更加自由，导致更大的晶体。铌的引入显著增加了总酸度，产生了弱和中等强度的新酸位点。例如，仅引入10%的Nb就使酸度增加了近300%，与纯NiO相比。XRD数据显示，Ni0.85Nb0.15催化剂中铌离子在NiO中的最大溶解度，证实了观察到的酸度与NiONb键的形成有关。铌离子在NiO晶格中的掺入降低了p+浓度，这应该减少表面可以容纳的过量氧。由于Nb掺杂导致的非化学计量氧的消除很可能对NiNbO混合氧化物表现出的高乙烯选择性负责。在这些催化体系中，理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的关键挑战包括理解掺杂剂、晶格结构和表面性质之间的复杂相互作用，优化掺杂剂浓度以获得最大催化性能，以及确保催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性和安全性。
