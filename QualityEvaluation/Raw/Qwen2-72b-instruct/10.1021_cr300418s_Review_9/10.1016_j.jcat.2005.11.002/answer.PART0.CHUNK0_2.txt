[1] "A series of mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratio ranging from 0 to 0.67 was prepared by the evaporation method."
[2] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
[3] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
[4] "The introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicat- ing modification of the catalysts and contributions from differ- ent species."
[5] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice in- hibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
[6] "The introduction of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommo- date."
[7] "The characterization results show that up to a Nb/Ni atomic ratio of 0.176, Nb5+ ions efficiently substitute Ni2+ ions and/or fill the cationic vacancies in the NiO lattice, with higher Nb content leading to saturation of the bulk lattices sites and formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 phase and pure Nb2O5."
[8] "The surface composition of the catalysts, determined by XPS,indicates that the relative exposure of nickel and niobium on the surface is constant irrespective of the nominal Nb/Ni ratio,with the exception of the highest-Nb content catalyst, proba- bly due to the high inhomogeneity and extended segregation of the two phases detected on this sample."
[9] "A clear correla- tion between the ability of the catalytic surface to activate the ethane substrate and the number of exposed surface Ni sites is apparent, with these two values following the same trend with increasing Nb/Ni ratio."
[10] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO accep- tor."
[11] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene [15]. Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

1.The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts involve the evaporation method to create mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratios. The incorporation of niobium leads to a contraction of the NiO lattice, with an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice. The reduction profiles are broadened by the introduction of Nb, indicating modifications to the catalysts. The incorporation of niobium inhibits crystallization, resulting in smaller grain sizes, but at high Nb loading, the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, leading to larger crystals. The introduction of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate. The surface composition of the catalysts shows that the relative exposure of nickel and niobium on the surface is constant, except for the highest-Nb content catalyst. There is a clear correlation between the ability of the catalytic surface to activate the ethane substrate and the number of exposed surface Ni sites. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides.

4.The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions include understanding the complex interactions between the dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, and electronic structure of the catalysts. Theoretical modeling must accurately predict the electronic structure and catalytic performance of the catalysts, while process optimization requires the identification of the optimal dopant concentrations and preparation methods to achieve the desired catalytic performance. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety requires the development of catalysts that can achieve high yields of the desired product while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts and ensuring the safety of the catalytic system.
