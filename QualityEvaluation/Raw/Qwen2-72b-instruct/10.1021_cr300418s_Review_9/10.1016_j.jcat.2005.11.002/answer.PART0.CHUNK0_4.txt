[1] "A series of mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratio ranging from 0 to 0.67 was prepared by the evaporation method."
[2] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
[3] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
[4] "The introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicat- ing modification of the catalysts and contributions from differ- ent species."
[5] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice in- hibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
[6] "The introduction of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommo- date."
[7] "The characterization results show that up to a Nb/Ni atomic ratio of 0.176, Nb5+ ions efficiently substitute Ni2+ ions and/or fill the cationic vacancies in the NiO lattice, with higher Nb content leading to saturation of the bulk lattices sites and formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 phase and pure Nb2O5."
[8] "A clear correla- tion between the ability of the catalytic surface to activate the ethane substrate and the number of exposed surface Ni sites is apparent, with these two values following the same trend with increasing Nb/Ni ratio."
[9] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO accep- tor."
[10] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene [15]. Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

1.The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts involve the evaporation method to create mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratios from 0 to 0.67. The incorporation of niobium leads to a contraction of the NiO lattice, with the lattice constant decreasing monotonously with increasing Nb content up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176. For high-Nb loading samples, the NiO lattice constant stabilizes, indicating the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice. The introduction of Nb modifies the catalysts, broadening the reduction profiles and contributing from different species. The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, resulting in smaller grain sizes. However, at high Nb loading, the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, leading to the detection of larger crystals. The introduction of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, decreasing the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate. Up to a Nb/Ni atomic ratio of 0.176, Nb5+ ions efficiently substitute Ni2+ ions and/or fill the cationic vacancies in the NiO lattice. A clear correlation exists between the ability of the catalytic surface to activate the ethane substrate and the number of exposed surface Ni sites, with these two values following the same trend with increasing Nb/Ni ratio. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides.

1.镍基催化剂的制备方法涉及蒸发法，用于创建Nb/Ni原子比从0到0.67变化的混合NiNbO氧化物。铌的掺入导致NiO晶格的收缩，晶格常数随着Nb含量的增加而单调下降，直到Nb/Ni比为0.176。对于高Nb负载样品，NiO晶格常数稳定，表明Nb5+离子在NiO晶格中的最大可能溶解度。铌的引入改变了催化剂，使还原曲线变宽，来自不同物种的贡献。铌在镍氧化物晶格中的掺入抑制了结晶，导致更小的晶粒尺寸。然而，在高Nb负载下，两个相（NiO和Nb2O5）开始分离，导致检测到更大的晶体。铌离子在NiO晶格中的引入降低了p+浓度，减少了表面可以容纳的过量氧量。直到Nb/Ni原子比为0.176，Nb5+离子有效地取代Ni2+离子和/或填充NiO晶格中的阳离子空位。催化表面激活乙烷基质的能力与暴露的表面Ni位点的数量之间存在明显的相关性，这两个值随着Nb/Ni比的增加而遵循相同的趋势。铌作为电子供体，降低了NiO受体的正p+空穴浓度。由于Nb掺杂导致的非化学计量氧的消除很可能导致NiNbO混合氧化物表现出的高乙烯选择性。
