[1] "A series of mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratio ranging from 0 to 0.67 was prepared by the evaporation method."
[2] "The effect of the Nb/Ni ratio on the performance of the materi- als is discussed in view of a detailed investigation of the bulk and surface properties of the oxides."
[3] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
[4] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO accep- tor."
[5] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

1.The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts, such as the evaporation method, and the incorporation of dopants like niobium, have a significant influence on their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The varying Nb/Ni atomic ratio affects the bulk and surface properties of the oxides, leading to changes in the lattice constant and the reduction of the positive hole concentration. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen by Nb doping enhances the ethene selectivity. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the complex interactions between the dopants and the host lattice, optimizing the dopant concentration for maximum catalytic activity and selectivity, and ensuring the stability and safety of the catalysts under reaction conditions.
