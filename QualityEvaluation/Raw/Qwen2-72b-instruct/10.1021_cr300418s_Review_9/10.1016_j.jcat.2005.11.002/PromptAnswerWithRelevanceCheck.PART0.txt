[1] "A series of mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratio ranging from 0 to 0.67 was prepared by the evaporation method."
[2] "The effect of the Nb/Ni ratio on the performance of the materi- als is discussed in view of a detailed investigation of the bulk and surface properties of the oxides."
[3] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
[4] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
[5] "The XRD analysis shows that pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, in agree- ment with reported data (JCPDS 4-835)."
[6] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice in- hibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
[7] "The reducibility of the catalysts was studied with TPR in H2."
[8] "The introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicat- ing modification of the catalysts and contributions from differ- ent species."
[9] "The acidity was determined by TPD after saturation of the cat- alytic surface with ammonia at 100 C."
[10] "The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity and generates new acid sites of weak and moderate strength."
[11] "The effect is much more pronounced if we compare, for example, pure NiO and the Ni0.9Nb0.1 catalyst,where the introduction of only 10% of Nb leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity."
[12] "The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice con- stant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
[13] "The surface composition of the mixed nickelniobium ox- ides was determined by XPS, because this technique has a surface-specific character and allows quantitative determina- tion of the elemental content in the upper layers of the sample."
[14] "Electrical conductivity measurements carried out on oxide- based catalysts can provide valuable information on the nature of structural defects, the existence of oxidizing species, and so on."
[15] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb."
[16] "Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers."

[19] "The incorporation of even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO causes a 100% increase in the per weight reactivity com- pared with the pure nickel oxide."
[20] "The most important requirement for a good ODH cata- lyst is the ability to effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity."
[21] "The most prominent feature is the enormous in- crease of ethene selectivity upon incorporation of Nb, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content cata- lyst (Ni0.9Nb0.1)."
[22] "The developed NiNbO cata- lysts for ethane ODH presented in this study appear to be clearly superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels (66% C2H6 con- version and 70% C2H4 selectivity at 400 C), with very stable catalytic performance."
[23] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO accep- tor."
[24] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene."
[25] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

1.通过蒸发法制备了Nb/Ni原子比从0到0.67变化的NiNbO混合氧化物，这影响了电子结构和氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。铌的掺入导致NiO晶格收缩，晶格常数在Nb/Ni比为0.176时下降。高铌负载样品中稳定的NiO晶格常数表明Nb5+离子在NiO晶格中的最大可能溶解度。铌的引入使还原曲线变宽，表明催化剂的修改和来自不同物种的贡献。铌的掺入抑制了结晶，导致更小的晶粒尺寸。然而，在高铌负载下，NiO的结晶更加自由，导致更大的晶体。铌的引入显著增加了总酸度，产生了弱和中等强度的新酸位点。例如，仅引入10%的Nb就使酸度增加了近300%，与纯NiO相比。XRD数据显示，Ni0.85Nb0.15催化剂中铌离子在NiO中的最大溶解度，证实了观察到的酸度与NiONb键的形成有关。铌离子在NiO晶格中的掺入降低了p+浓度，这应该减少表面可以容纳的过量氧。由于Nb掺杂导致的非化学计量氧的消除很可能对NiNbO混合氧化物表现出的高乙烯选择性负责。在这些催化体系中，理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的关键挑战包括理解掺杂剂、晶格结构和表面性质之间的复杂相互作用，优化掺杂剂浓度以获得最大催化性能，以及确保催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性和安全性。

[1] "A series of mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratio ranging from 0 to 0.67 was prepared by the evaporation method."
[2] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
[3] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
[4] "The introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicat- ing modification of the catalysts and contributions from differ- ent species."
[5] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice in- hibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
[6] "The introduction of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommo- date."
[7] "The characterization results show that up to a Nb/Ni atomic ratio of 0.176, Nb5+ ions efficiently substitute Ni2+ ions and/or fill the cationic vacancies in the NiO lattice, with higher Nb content leading to saturation of the bulk lattices sites and formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 phase and pure Nb2O5."
[8] "A clear correla- tion between the ability of the catalytic surface to activate the ethane substrate and the number of exposed surface Ni sites is apparent, with these two values following the same trend with increasing Nb/Ni ratio."
[9] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO accep- tor."
[10] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene [15]. Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

1.The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts involve the evaporation method to create mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratios from 0 to 0.67. The incorporation of niobium leads to a contraction of the NiO lattice, with the lattice constant decreasing monotonously with increasing Nb content up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176. For high-Nb loading samples, the NiO lattice constant stabilizes, indicating the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice. The introduction of Nb modifies the catalysts, broadening the reduction profiles and contributing from different species. The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, resulting in smaller grain sizes. However, at high Nb loading, the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, leading to the detection of larger crystals. The introduction of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, decreasing the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate. Up to a Nb/Ni atomic ratio of 0.176, Nb5+ ions efficiently substitute Ni2+ ions and/or fill the cationic vacancies in the NiO lattice. A clear correlation exists between the ability of the catalytic surface to activate the ethane substrate and the number of exposed surface Ni sites, with these two values following the same trend with increasing Nb/Ni ratio. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides.

1.镍基催化剂的制备方法涉及蒸发法，用于创建Nb/Ni原子比从0到0.67变化的混合NiNbO氧化物。铌的掺入导致NiO晶格的收缩，晶格常数随着Nb含量的增加而单调下降，直到Nb/Ni比为0.176。对于高Nb负载样品，NiO晶格常数稳定，表明Nb5+离子在NiO晶格中的最大可能溶解度。铌的引入改变了催化剂，使还原曲线变宽，来自不同物种的贡献。铌在镍氧化物晶格中的掺入抑制了结晶，导致更小的晶粒尺寸。然而，在高Nb负载下，两个相（NiO和Nb2O5）开始分离，导致检测到更大的晶体。铌离子在NiO晶格中的引入降低了p+浓度，减少了表面可以容纳的过量氧量。直到Nb/Ni原子比为0.176，Nb5+离子有效地取代Ni2+离子和/或填充NiO晶格中的阳离子空位。催化表面激活乙烷基质的能力与暴露的表面Ni位点的数量之间存在明显的相关性，这两个值随着Nb/Ni比的增加而遵循相同的趋势。铌作为电子供体，降低了NiO受体的正p+空穴浓度。由于Nb掺杂导致的非化学计量氧的消除很可能导致NiNbO混合氧化物表现出的高乙烯选择性。
