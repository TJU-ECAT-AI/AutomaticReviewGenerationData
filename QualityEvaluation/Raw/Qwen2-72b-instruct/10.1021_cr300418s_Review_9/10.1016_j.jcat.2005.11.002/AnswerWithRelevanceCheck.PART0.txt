          [1] "A series of mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratio ranging from 0 to 0.67 was prepared by the evaporation method."
          [2] "The effect of the Nb/Ni ratio on the performance of the materi- als is discussed in view of a detailed investigation of the bulk and surface properties of the oxides."
          [3] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
          [4] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
          [5] "The XRD analysis shows that pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, in agree- ment with reported data (JCPDS 4-835)."
          [6] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice in- hibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
          [7] "The reducibility of the catalysts was studied with TPR in H2."

          [11] "The effect is much more pronounced if we compare, for example, pure NiO and the Ni0.9Nb0.1 catalyst,where the introduction of only 10% of Nb leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity."
          [12] "The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice con- stant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
          [13] "The surface composition of the mixed nickelniobium ox- ides was determined by XPS, because this technique has a surface-specific character and allows quantitative determina- tion of the elemental content in the upper layers of the sample."

          [16] "Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers."

          [20] "The most important requirement for a good ODH cata- lyst is the ability to effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity."
          [21] "The most prominent feature is the enormous in- crease of ethene selectivity upon incorporation of Nb, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content cata- lyst (Ni0.9Nb0.1)."
          [22] "The developed NiNbO cata- lysts for ethane ODH presented in this study appear to be clearly superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels (66% C2H6 con- version and 70% C2H4 selectivity at 400 C), with very stable catalytic performance."
          [23] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO accep- tor."
          [24] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene."
          [25] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

          The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts involve the incorporation of dopants like niobium through the evaporation method, which can vary the Nb/Ni atomic ratio from 0 to 0.67. This ratio influences the electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The dopant concentrations, specifically the Nb/Ni atomic ratio, have a significant impact on the bulk and surface properties of the oxides, affecting their catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of niobium into nickel oxide leads to a contraction of the NiO lattice, evidenced by the decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176, which influences the electronic structure and catalytic activity. High Nb loading in nickel oxide catalysts reaches an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice, affecting the electronic structure and catalytic performance. Pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, and the incorporation of niobium modifies this structure, impacting the electronic properties and catalytic activity. The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, leading to smaller grain sizes, but at high Nb loading, the segregation of NiO and Nb2O5 phases occurs, resulting in larger crystals. The reducibility of the catalysts was studied using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in hydrogen, which broadens the reduction profiles upon the introduction of niobium, indicating modifications to the catalysts. The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity of the catalysts, generating new acid sites of weak and moderate strength, which can influence the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of only 10% of niobium leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity compared to pure NiO, demonstrating the pronounced effect of niobium on the catalytic properties. The maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which can affect the catalytic performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface composition of the mixed nickel-niobium oxides, providing insights into the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Electrical conductivity measurements on oxide-based catalysts can provide information on structural defects and the existence of oxidizing species, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of higher valence cations like Nb5+ in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of niobium, which can modify the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers, influencing the electronic properties and catalytic performance. The incorporation of niobium ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate, impacting the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored under steady-state conditions, demonstrating the influence of the preparation method and dopant concentration on catalytic performance. The incorporation of even small amounts of niobium in NiO causes a significant increase in the per weight reactivity compared to pure nickel oxide, highlighting the role of dopant concentration in enhancing catalytic performance. A good oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst should effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity, which is influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. The incorporation of niobium leads to a significant increase in ethene selectivity, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on selectivity. The developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH are superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with very stable catalytic performance, influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor, which can affect the electronic structure and catalytic performance. The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, highlighting the importance of controlling the electronic structure for enhanced catalytic performance. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on the electronic structure and catalytic performance.
