Niobium inhibits crystallization, leading to smaller grain sizes, but at high Nb loading, larger crystals form due to phase segregation. The introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicating catalyst modifications. Niobium causes a 300% increase in total acidity compared to pure NiO (quote 11), generating new acid sites that influence catalytic performance. The incorporation of 10% Nb leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity, demonstrating its pronounced effect. The Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst shows maximum solubility of niobium cations, confirming acidity is related to NiONb bond formation. XPS determines surface composition, providing insights into electronic structure and catalytic activity. Electrical conductivity measurements offer information on structural defects and oxidizing species, crucial for understanding catalytic performance. Incorporating Nb5+ in the p-type NiO lattice suggests n-doping, modifying electronic structure and catalytic activity. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry, impacting electronic properties and catalytic performance. Incorporating Nb reduces the p+ concentration, affecting excess oxygen accommodation and catalytic performance. The activity of NiNbO catalysts in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation shows enhanced reactivity with Nb addition. A good ODH catalyst effectively converts ethane to ethylene at low temperatures with high selectivity, influenced by preparation methods and dopant concentrations. Incorporating Nb leads to an 80% ethene selectivity increase from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst (quote 21), demonstrating its impact on selectivity. Developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH combine high activity at low temperatures and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with stable catalytic performance. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the p+ hole concentration, affecting electronic structure and catalytic performance. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen due to Nb doping is likely responsible for high ethene selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002"},
