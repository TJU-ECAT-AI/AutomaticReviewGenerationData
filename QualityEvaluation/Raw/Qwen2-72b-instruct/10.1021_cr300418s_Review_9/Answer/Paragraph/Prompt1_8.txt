{"DOC": "Doped nickel oxide catalysts, specifically NiNbO with varying niobium (Nb) content, have been studied for their role in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Optimal performance, achieving 33% ethane conversion with 78% selectivity to ethylene, was observed at 15% Nb content at 350 C. The efficiency is attributed to surface interactions between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which also prevents sintering of active phase particles. Oxalate ions, present due to the niobium precursor, reduce NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, affecting catalytic properties. Above 15% Nb, an inactive NiNb2O6 phase forms. Long-term testing reveals a slow but systematic deactivation, linked to decreasing NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and NiNb2O6 phase formation.
