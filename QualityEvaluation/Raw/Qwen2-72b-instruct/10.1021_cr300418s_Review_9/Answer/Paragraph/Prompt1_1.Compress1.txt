{"DOC": "NiNbO catalysts with varying Nb contents have been studied for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, achieving optimal ethane conversion of 33% with 78% selectivity to ethylene at 15% Nb content and 350 C. The catalyst's efficiency is attributed to the surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which reduces NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry through the thermal decomposition of oxalate ions. This influences catalytic properties, with optimal activity linked to the prevention of sintering by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase. Above 15% Nb, an inactive NiNb2O6 phase forms. Long-term deactivation is due to the continuous reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and the formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase.
