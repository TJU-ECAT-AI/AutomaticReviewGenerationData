{"Quotes": "", "English": "The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of dopants with different valences can modify the lattice constant of the NiO structure, leading to the formation of solid solutions. The valence of the dopants plays a crucial role in the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to COx. The reduction or elimination of these oxygen species favors the selective oxidation to ethylene. Lower valence dopants increase the non-stoichiometric oxygen, while higher valence dopants reduce it, enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The lability of the oxygen species is also affected, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species. The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product.

Pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, and the incorporation of niobium modifies this structure, impacting the electronic properties and catalytic activity. The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, leading to smaller grain sizes, but at high Nb loading, the segregation of NiO and Nb2O5 phases occurs, resulting in larger crystals. The reducibility of the catalysts was studied using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in hydrogen, which broadens the reduction profiles upon the introduction of niobium, indicating modifications to the catalysts. The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity of the catalysts, generating new acid sites of weak and moderate strength, which can influence the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of only 10% of niobium leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity compared to pure NiO, demonstrating the pronounced effect of niobium on the catalytic properties. The maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which can affect the catalytic performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface composition of the mixed nickel-niobium oxides, providing insights into the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Electrical conductivity measurements on oxide-based catalysts can provide information on structural defects and the existence of oxidizing species, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of higher valence cations like Nb5+ in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of niobium, which can modify the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers, influencing the electronic properties and catalytic performance. The incorporation of niobium ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate, impacting the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored under steady-state conditions, demonstrating the influence of the preparation method and dopant concentration on catalytic performance. The incorporation of even small amounts of niobium in NiO causes a significant increase in the per weight reactivity compared to pure nickel oxide, highlighting the role of dopant concentration in enhancing catalytic performance. A good oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst should effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity, which is influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. The incorporation of niobium leads to a significant increase in ethene selectivity, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on selectivity. The developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH are superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with very stable catalytic performance, influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor, which can affect the electronic structure and catalytic performance. The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, highlighting the importance of controlling the electronic structure for enhanced catalytic performance. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on the electronic structure and catalytic performance.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002"},

The reducibility of the catalysts was studied using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in hydrogen, which broadens the reduction profiles upon the introduction of niobium, indicating modifications to the catalysts. The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity of the catalysts, generating new acid sites of weak and moderate strength, which can influence the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of only 10% of niobium leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity compared to pure NiO, demonstrating the pronounced effect of niobium on the catalytic properties. The maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which can affect the catalytic performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface composition of the mixed nickel-niobium oxides, providing insights into the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Electrical conductivity measurements on oxide-based catalysts can provide information on structural defects and the existence of oxidizing species, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of higher valence cations like Nb5+ in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of niobium, which can modify the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers, influencing the electronic properties and catalytic performance. The incorporation of niobium ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate, impacting the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored under steady-state conditions, demonstrating the influence of the preparation method and dopant concentration on catalytic performance. The incorporation of even small amounts of niobium in NiO causes a significant increase in the per weight reactivity compared to pure nickel oxide, highlighting the role of dopant concentration in enhancing catalytic performance. A good oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst should effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity, which is influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. The incorporation of niobium leads to a significant increase in ethene selectivity, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on selectivity. The developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH are superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with very stable catalytic performance, influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor, which can affect the electronic structure and catalytic performance. The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, highlighting the importance of controlling the electronic structure for enhanced catalytic performance. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on the electronic structure and catalytic performance.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002"},

The maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which can affect the catalytic performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface composition of the mixed nickel-niobium oxides, providing insights into the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Electrical conductivity measurements on oxide-based catalysts can provide information on structural defects and the existence of oxidizing species, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of higher valence cations like Nb5+ in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of niobium, which can modify the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers, influencing the electronic properties and catalytic performance. The incorporation of niobium ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate, impacting the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored under steady-state conditions, demonstrating the influence of the preparation method and dopant concentration on catalytic performance. The incorporation of even small amounts of niobium in NiO causes a significant increase in the per weight reactivity compared to pure nickel oxide, highlighting the role of dopant concentration in enhancing catalytic performance. A good oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst should effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity, which is influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. The incorporation of niobium leads to a significant increase in ethene selectivity, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on selectivity. The developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH are superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with very stable catalytic performance, influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor, which can affect the electronic structure and catalytic performance. The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, highlighting the importance of controlling the electronic structure for enhanced catalytic performance. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on the electronic structure and catalytic performance.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002"},

The incorporation of higher valence cations like Nb5+ in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of niobium, which can modify the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers, influencing the electronic properties and catalytic performance. The incorporation of niobium ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate, impacting the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored under steady-state conditions, demonstrating the influence of the preparation method and dopant concentration on catalytic performance. The incorporation of even small amounts of niobium in NiO causes a significant increase in the per weight reactivity compared to pure nickel oxide, highlighting the role of dopant concentration in enhancing catalytic performance. A good oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst should effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity, which is influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. The incorporation of niobium leads to a significant increase in ethene selectivity, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on selectivity. The developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH are superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with very stable catalytic performance, influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor, which can affect the electronic structure and catalytic performance. The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, highlighting the importance of controlling the electronic structure for enhanced catalytic performance. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on the electronic structure and catalytic performance.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002"},

The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored under steady-state conditions, demonstrating the influence of the preparation method and dopant concentration on catalytic performance. The incorporation of even small amounts of niobium in NiO causes a significant increase in the per weight reactivity compared to pure nickel oxide, highlighting the role of dopant concentration in enhancing catalytic performance. A good oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst should effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity, which is influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. The incorporation of niobium leads to a significant increase in ethene selectivity, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on selectivity. The developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH are superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with very stable catalytic performance, influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor, which can affect the electronic structure and catalytic performance. The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, highlighting the importance of controlling the electronic structure for enhanced catalytic performance. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on the electronic structure and catalytic performance.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002"},

The incorporation of niobium leads to a significant increase in ethene selectivity, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on selectivity. The developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH are superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with very stable catalytic performance, influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor, which can affect the electronic structure and catalytic performance. The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, highlighting the importance of controlling the electronic structure for enhanced catalytic performance. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on the electronic structure and catalytic performance.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002"},

The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, highlighting the importance of controlling the electronic structure for enhanced catalytic performance. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on the electronic structure and catalytic performance.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002"}
