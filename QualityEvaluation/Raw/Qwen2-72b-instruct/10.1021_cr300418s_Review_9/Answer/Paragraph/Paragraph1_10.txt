Doped nickel oxide materials have garnered significant attention in the field of catalysis, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, due to their tunable electronic properties and enhanced catalytic activity. The preparation of these materials typically involves the incorporation of dopants, such as metals or non-metals, into the nickel oxide lattice, which can significantly alter the electronic structure and create vacancies that serve as active sites for reactions. The presence of dopants and vacancies can lead to improved charge transfer and oxygen mobility, enhancing the material's catalytic performance. Theoretical modeling, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, plays a crucial role in understanding the effects of dopants on the electronic structure and predicting catalytic activity. However, these models face challenges in accurately representing the complex interactions and dynamic processes occurring at the surface of the catalyst. Process optimization considerations, such as reaction temperature, pressure, and gas composition, are also critical for maximizing the efficiency of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions using doped nickel oxide catalysts. Understanding and controlling these factors is essential for the development of more efficient and selective catalytic systems.
