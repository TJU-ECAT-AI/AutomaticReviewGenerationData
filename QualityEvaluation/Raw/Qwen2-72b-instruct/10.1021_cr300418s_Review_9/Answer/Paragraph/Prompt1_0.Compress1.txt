{"DOC": "NiNbO catalysts, with varying Nb contents, have been studied for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, achieving optimal conversion (33%) and selectivity (78%) to ethylene at 15% Nb content. The efficiency is linked to surface interaction between NiO and amorphous Nb2O5, reducing NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry. Optimal activity at 15% Nb is due to decreased active phase particle size, preventing sintering. Above 15%, an inactive NiNb2O6 phase forms. Long-term deactivation is attributed to reduced NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and NiNb2O6 phase formation.
