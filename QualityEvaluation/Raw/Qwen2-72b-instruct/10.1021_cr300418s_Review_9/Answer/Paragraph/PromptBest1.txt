The preparation, properties, and catalytic applications of doped nickel oxide materials in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, particularly focusing on propane dehydrogenation, are extensively reviewed. Niobium-doped nickel oxide catalysts have been extensively studied for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, achieving optimal conversion and selectivity to ethylene at 15% Nb content \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. The efficiency is attributed to the surface interaction between NiO and amorphous Nb2O5, reducing NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry. The optimal activity at 15% Nb is due to decreased active phase particle size, preventing sintering. Above 15%, an inactive NiNb2O6 phase forms, leading to long-term deactivation \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. Citric acid-assisted preparation methods for nickel-rich NbNi gel lead to NiO nanocomposites with a thin niobium-rich mixed oxide layer, affecting redox properties and inhibiting NiO reducibility \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\]. For ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, the size of NiO crystallites and the coverage of the Nb-rich phase on active oxygen species determine activity and selectivity. High Nb loadings cause catalyst deactivation, whereas 34 at.% Nb optimizes activity, selectivity, and stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\]. Doped nickel oxide catalysts, particularly with Nb, exhibit enhanced catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions due to changes in electronic structure \[10.1016/j.apcata.2007.02.030\]. Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO creates a non-stoichiometric phase with cationic deficiency, leading to structural defects. Upon Nb doping, two phases emerge: a NiO phase with Nb cations forming a solid solution, and a distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor to NiNb2O6. The interaction of niobium ions with structural defects in NiO boosts selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH, as these defects generate strong oxidizing oxygen species, promoting ethane's total oxidation to CO2 \[10.1016/j.apcata.2007.02.030\]. Dopant concentrations and vacancy formation in nickel oxide catalysts significantly impact their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. Dopants with varying valences modify the lattice constant, influencing the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which are crucial for ethane conversion. Lower valence dopants increase non-stoichiometric oxygen, favoring ethylene production, while higher valence dopants reduce it, enhancing selectivity. The oxygen species' lability is also affected, with high valence dopants creating more strongly bonded oxygen. A linear relationship between oxygen exchange rate and ethane consumption confirms the oxygen species' role in ethane activation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. Dopant concentrations and preparation methods in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1021/cr300418s_9\]. Systematic studies are scarce, with few cases of a single host oxide being doped with various dopants and tested under different conditions for the same reaction. Doping with Fe or Zr increases the surface area per gram, enhancing catalytic activity. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) facilitate oxide reduction, improving performance. Doping with V also boosts surface area compared to undoped TiO2. Ni-doped ceria shows improved selectivity and conversion for ethylbenzene to styrene. Zr-doped NiO improves selectivity to ethylene, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly, aligning with theoretical predictions \[10.1021/cr300418s_9\]. Niobium-doped nickel oxide catalysts exhibit enhanced performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethane to ethylene, due to altered electronic structures \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\]. Niobium doping reduces the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, eliminating electrophilic active oxygen species responsible for ethane's total oxidation to CO2. The ethane ODH reaction follows a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism on both oxides, but oxygen replenishment differs, affecting surface oxygen species and product distribution. On NiO, rapid gaseous oxygen dissociation on cation vacancies leads to high electrophilic oxygen concentrations, while niobium filling these vacancies shifts the process to diffusion-limited, favoring nucleophilic oxygen species selective for ethylene production \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\]. Nickel oxide-based catalysts, prepared by incorporating niobium through the evaporation method, exhibit enhanced catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. The Nb/Ni ratio, varying from 0 to 0.67, significantly impacts the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Niobium incorporation leads to a contraction of the NiO lattice, affecting the lattice constant and inhibiting crystallization, resulting in smaller grain sizes. At high Nb loading, the segregation of NiO and Nb2O5 phases occurs, leading to larger crystals. The introduction of niobium significantly increases the total acidity of the catalysts, generating new acid sites of weak and moderate strength. This effect is pronounced, with a 300% increase in acidity upon the addition of only 10% niobium. The Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst shows maximum solubility of niobium cations, confirming the acidity is related to NiONb bond formation. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the p+ hole concentration in the NiO lattice. In ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, even small amounts of niobium (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO double the per weight reactivity compared to pure nickel oxide. A good ODH catalyst should convert ethane to ethylene at low temperatures with high selectivity. Incorporating niobium increases ethene selectivity from 20% for NiO to 80% for the Ni0.9Nb0.1 catalyst. Developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH exhibit high activity at low temperatures, high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, and stable catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\].
