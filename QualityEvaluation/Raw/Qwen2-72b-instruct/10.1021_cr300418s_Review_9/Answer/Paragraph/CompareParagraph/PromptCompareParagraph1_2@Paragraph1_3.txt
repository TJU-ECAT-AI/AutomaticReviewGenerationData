The preparation, properties, and catalytic applications of doped nickel oxide materials in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, particularly propane dehydrogenation, are influenced by dopant concentrations and vacancy formation, as established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Niobium-doped nickel oxide catalysts exhibit enhanced catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethane to ethylene conversion, due to altered electronic structures. The incorporation of niobium through the evaporation method, varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio, affects the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Niobium incorporation leads to a contraction of the NiO lattice, impacting the lattice constant and inhibiting crystallization, resulting in smaller grain sizes. At high Nb loading, the segregation of NiO and Nb2O5 phases occurs, leading to larger crystals. The reducibility of the catalysts broadens upon niobium introduction, indicating structural modifications. Niobium increases total acidity, generating new acid sites, which significantly boosts catalytic performance. Surface composition analysis by XPS reveals electronic structure changes. Electrical conductivity measurements suggest Nb5+ incorporation has an n-doping character, impacting electronic properties. Niobium reduces p+ concentration, affecting excess oxygen accommodation. NiNbO catalysts show high activity and ethene selectivity in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, with Nb acting as an electron donor, reducing p+ hole concentration. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen by Nb doping correlates with high ethene selectivity.

                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel preparation methods that can further optimize the electronic structure and catalytic performance of doped nickel oxide catalysts. Theoretical modeling efforts should aim to accurately predict the effects of dopants and vacancies on electronic structure and reactivity, addressing the challenges of understanding complex reaction mechanisms. Optimizing processes for efficiency, selectivity, and safety at high temperatures and pressures remains a key challenge. The exploration of alternative dopants and the investigation of their impact on the electronic structure and catalytic performance could lead to the discovery of more efficient and selective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Additionally, the development of advanced characterization techniques could provide deeper insights into the role of dopants and vacancies in these catalytic systems, paving the way for the design of next-generation catalysts with enhanced properties.

The preparation, properties, and catalytic applications of doped nickel oxide materials in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, with emphasis on the effects of dopants and vacancies on electronic structure, theoretical modeling challenges, and process optimization considerations, have been extensively studied \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. NiNbO catalysts, with varying Nb contents, exhibit optimal ethane conversion to ethylene at 33% with 78% selectivity for 15% Nb at 350 C, due to surface interaction between NiO and amorphous Nb2O5 \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. The efficiency is linked to the reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry by oxalate ions, impacting catalytic properties \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. Optimal activity at 15% Nb is attributed to decreased active phase particle size, preventing sintering \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. Above 15% Nb, an inactive NiNb2O6 phase forms, leading to deactivation \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. Doped nickel oxide catalysts, prepared using citric acid to form a nickel-rich NbNi gel, exhibit enhanced catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\]. The presence of a niobium-rich mixed oxide layer inhibits NiO reducibility, impacting redox properties \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\]. Optimal ethane oxidative dehydrogenation activity and selectivity are achieved with 34 at.% Nb content, balancing high activity, selectivity, and stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\]. High Nb loadings lead to catalyst deactivation, highlighting the importance of the preparation method in optimizing structural and catalytic properties for improved performance \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\]. In nickel oxide-based catalysts, low-temperature treatment of pure NiO creates a non-stoichiometric phase with cationic deficiency \[10.1016/j.apcata.2007.02.030\]. Upon Nb doping, two phases emerge: a NiO phase with Nb incorporated, forming a NiNb solid solution, and a Nb-rich phase \[10.1016/j.apcata.2007.02.030\]. The interaction between niobium ions and structural defects in NiO correlates with high ethylene selectivity in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.apcata.2007.02.030\]. Dopants in nickel oxide catalysts alter the lattice constant, influencing oxygen species and ethane conversion selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. Lower valence dopants increase non-stoichiometric oxygen, favoring ethylene production, while higher valence dopants enhance oxygen bonding \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. A linear relationship exists between oxygen exchange and ethane consumption, confirming oxygen species' role in ethane conversion \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. Dopant concentrations and preparation methods in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1021/cr300418s\_9\]. Doping with Fe or Zr notably increases the surface area per gram, enhancing catalytic activity \[10.1021/cr300418s\_9\]. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) facilitate oxide reduction, improving performance \[10.1021/cr300418s\_9\]. Doping with V also boosts surface area compared to undoped TiO2 \[10.1021/cr300418s\_9\]. Zr-doped NiO exhibits improved selectivity to ethylene, makes the oxide less reducible, and strengthens surface oxygen binding, aligning with theoretical predictions \[10.1021/cr300418s\_9\]. Niobium-doped nickel oxide catalysts exhibit enhanced performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethane to ethylene, due to altered electronic structures \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\]. Niobium doping reduces activation energy and the rate of labeled oxygen exchange, eliminating electrophilic active oxygen species responsible for ethane's total oxidation to CO2 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\]. The ethane ODH reaction follows a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, with oxygen replenishment differing between doped and undoped catalysts, affecting product distribution \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\]. Nickel oxide-based catalysts, prepared by incorporating niobium through the evaporation method, exhibit enhanced catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. The Nb/Ni atomic ratio, varying from 0 to 0.67, significantly impacts the electronic structure and catalytic activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Niobium incorporation leads to a contraction of the NiO lattice, affecting the lattice constant and electronic properties \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. High Nb loading reaches an upper limit for Nb5+ cation dissolution, impacting the electronic structure \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Niobium doping suggests an n-doping character, modifying the electronic structure \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Niobium oxide's n-type semiconductor properties influence catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Ethane oxidative dehydrogenation activity is significantly increased by niobium, with even small amounts causing a 100% increase in reactivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. A good ODH catalyst requires high ethylene conversion and selectivity at low temperatures, which is achieved by niobium incorporation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Ethene selectivity increases from 20% for NiO to 80% for Ni0.9Nb0.1, demonstrating niobium's impact \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. NiNbO catalysts exhibit high activity and ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with stable catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\].
