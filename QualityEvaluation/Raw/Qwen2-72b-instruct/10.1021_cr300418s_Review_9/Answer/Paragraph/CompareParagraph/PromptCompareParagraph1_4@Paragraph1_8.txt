Small niobium amounts in NiO significantly increase per weight reactivity compared to pure NiO \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. A good ODH catalyst should convert ethane to ethylene at low temperatures with high selectivity, influenced by preparation methods and dopant concentration \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Niobium incorporation significantly increases ethene selectivity, from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH combine high activity at low temperatures and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with stable catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing p+ hole concentration \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Excess oxygen correlates inversely with ethylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\].
