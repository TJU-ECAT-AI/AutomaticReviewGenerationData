          [1] "The two catalytic systems giving outstanding performance far beyond most of the proposed ones are those based either on NiO oxide [18], or mixed molybdates [913]."
          [2] "The materials have been characterized and it has been proposed that the active phase corresponds to a Ni1xNbxO solid solution with 0 < x < 0.18 and Nb cations substituting either Ni cations and/or filling the cationic vacancies in the defective non- stoichiometric structure [2,3]."
          [3] "The catalytic efficiency of these compounds in ethane ODH would thus be related to the presence at the surface of NiO of dispersed Ospecies in amount high enough to convert sufficiently ethane but low enough to avoid total oxidation."
          [4] "The results clearly showed that Nb has two main effects at low and high content."
          [5] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously,which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number."
          [6] "The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease."
          [7] "In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases."
          [8] "At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant."
          [9] "The active sites are not modified anymore and since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase,the conversion of ethane increases."
          [10] "The best yields are consequently observed for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound."
          [11] "Above 15% of Nb, the phase inactive NiNb2O6 phase is formed and the relative content in active phase starts to decrease."
          [12] "The results obtained on NiO-OA catalysts show that oxalic acid introduced in the preparation medium has an effect on the texture of the NiO oxide with a decrease in the particle size and an increase in the specific surface area of the solids."
          [13] "The decrease in rate of ethane conversion is high."
          [14] "This decrease can only be explained by a reduction at least at the surface of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry i.e. of the relative concentration of Ni3+ and consequently of the amount of O."
          [15] "The decrease in the number of the latter species leads to higher selectivity to ethylene."
          [16] "The O2-TPD-MS experiments data may contribute to understand the nature of the active surface species."
          [17] "As the strength of the adsorption bonding increases with the desorption temperature,  oxygen should be more labile than  oxygen."
          [18] "Both upon oxalic acid and niobium additions, the  species, which were the minor in quantity, disappeared and the number  and  species strongly decreased."
          [19] "It may be proposed that the selective oxygen species are of  type since contrarily to the  species, these species become more labile when less numerous."
          [20] "After deactivation only new oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound; these high temperature species should not be involved in the reaction and correspond presumably to species strongly adsorbed on surface defects (dislocations, edges and cor- ners) which number may increase after surface transformations related to the deactivation."
          [21] "The deactivation of these catalysts is rather low and is apparently not coupled with a decrease in selectivity although it could exist but to a small extent and be compensated by an increase related to the decrease in conversion."
          [22] "This deactivation is not related to a decrease in specific surface area neither to the formation of coke at the surface."
          [23] "It may be ascribed to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6, which can be evidenced in some catalysts after catalytic testing by X-ray diffrac- tion."
          [24] "The deactivation can also be explained by a decrease in the oxygen over-stoichiometry of the active NiO phase."
          [25] "When the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO was decreased to the state where all the surface Ospecies are isolated, a further decrease did not change the nature of the sites but simply decreased their number implying a decrease in activity without change in selectivity."
          [26] "The deactivation process, which can be evidenced by Raman spectroscopy, was difficult to observe on the NiNbO catalysts since the deactivation after testing was moderate and the change in the spectra are within the experimental precision."
          [27] "However the decrease in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry was clearly evidenced by Raman spectroscopy in the Nb/NiO and NiO-OA-3/1 compounds that suffered from stronger deactivation."
          [28] "The deactivation process may be explain by the fact that contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extrac- tion work from such surface is favored [32,35]."
          [29] "Inversely when the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry decreases, the O2 adsorption is slowed down as well as the re-oxidation and the deactivation process is auto-catalyzed."
          [30] "It is furthermore probable that the two pro- cesses could be linked to each other as the mobility of the surface species necessary to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6 should depend on the surface oxygen stoichiometry."
          [31] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
          [32] "An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL1."
          [33] "The catalysts have been characterized using various techniques allowing to show that the efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase."
          [34] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."
          [35] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."
          [36] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."
          [37] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation."
          [38] "This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."
          [39] "Attempt to regenerate the catalysts has failed."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents have been studied for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% selectivity to ethylene was achieved for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% Nb at 350 C. The efficiency of the catalysts is related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase. The thermal decomposition of oxalate ions, present due to the use of ammonium oxalato niobate as the niobium precursor, reduces the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, influencing catalytic properties. A small percentage of Nb is necessary for these effects, and the optimal activity observed for 15% Nb is related to the decrease in active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which prevents sintering of the active phase particles. Above 15% Nb, the amorphous phase reacts with nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6. Long-term studies show that NiNbO catalysts undergo slow but systematic deactivation, attributed to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and the formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase at the catalytic reaction temperature. Attempts to regenerate the catalysts have failed. Key challenges include theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.

          镍铌氧化物催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对基于镍氧化物的催化剂的电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙烷至乙烯)的催化性能有重大影响。研究了不同铌含量的NiNbO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的应用。在350°C下,含有15%Nb的NiNbO催化剂实现了33%的乙烷转化率和78%的乙烯选择性。催化剂的效率与NiO活性相和无定形Nb2O5相之间的表面相互作用有关。由于使用了铌酸铵草酸盐作为铌前体,草酸盐离子的存在导致NiO过氧化物含量的热分解,从而影响催化性能。只需要少量的Nb就能产生这些效果,而15%Nb时观察到的最佳活性与无定形Nb2O5相引起的活性相粒径减小有关,该相防止了催化剂前体热转化过程中活性相颗粒的烧结。超过15%的Nb,无定形相与氧化镍反应,形成不活跃的混合铌镍氧化物相NiNb2O6。长期研究表明,NiNbO催化剂经历了缓慢但系统的失活,归因于NiO过氧化物含量在反应条件下的连续减少和NiNb2O6相在催化反应温度下热力学稳定的形成。尝试再生催化剂失败了。主要挑战包括理论建模、过程优化以及在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性。
