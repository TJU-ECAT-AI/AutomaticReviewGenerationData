          [1] "A method for the preparation of NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites is developed, based on the slow oxi- dation of a nickel-rich NbNi gel obtained in citric acid."
          [2] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."
          [3] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."
          [4] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."
          [5] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
          [6] "The close interac- tion between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
          [7] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
          [8] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."

          The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts, including the use of citric acid to form a nickel-rich NbNi gel, influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of a thin layer of niobium-rich mixed oxide inhibits the reducibility of NiO, affecting the redox properties of the nanocomposites. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation are related to the size of NiO crystallites and the coverage of the Nb-rich phase on the active oxygen species of NiO. High Nb loadings lead to significant catalyst deactivation, while optimal Nb content (34 at.%) results in high activity, selectivity, and stability. The preparation method has a significant impact on the structural and catalytic properties of the catalysts, suggesting that further optimization can lead to improved performance.

          镍基催化剂的制备方法，包括使用柠檬酸形成富镍的NbNi凝胶，影响其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能。铌富集的混合氧化物薄层的存在抑制了NiO的还原性，影响了纳米复合材料的氧化还原性质。催化剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的活性和选择性与NiO晶粒的大小和Nb富集相在NiO活性氧物种上的覆盖有关。高Nb负载会导致催化剂显著失活，而最佳Nb含量（34 at.%）可实现高活性、选择性和稳定性。制备方法对催化剂的结构和催化性能有显著影响，表明进一步优化可以提高催化剂的性能。
