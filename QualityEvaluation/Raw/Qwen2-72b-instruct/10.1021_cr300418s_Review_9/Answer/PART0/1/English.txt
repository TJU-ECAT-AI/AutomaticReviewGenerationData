The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents have been studied for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% selectivity to ethylene was achieved for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% Nb at 350 C. The efficiency of the catalysts is related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase. The thermal decomposition of oxalate ions, present due to the use of ammonium oxalato niobate as the niobium precursor, reduces the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, influencing catalytic properties. A small percentage of Nb is necessary for these effects, and the optimal activity observed for 15% Nb is related to the decrease in active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which prevents sintering of the active phase particles. Above 15% Nb, the amorphous phase reacts with nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6. Long-term studies show that NiNbO catalysts undergo slow but systematic deactivation, attributed to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and the formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase at the catalytic reaction temperature. Attempts to regenerate the catalysts have failed. Key challenges include theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.

The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts, including the use of citric acid to form a nickel-rich NbNi gel, influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of a thin layer of niobium-rich mixed oxide inhibits the reducibility of NiO, affecting the redox properties of the nanocomposites. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation are related to the size of NiO crystallites and the coverage of the Nb-rich phase on the active oxygen species of NiO. High Nb loadings lead to significant catalyst deactivation, while optimal Nb content (34 at.%) results in high activity, selectivity, and stability. The preparation method has a significant impact on the structural and catalytic properties of the catalysts, suggesting that further optimization can lead to improved performance.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with structural defects due to cationic deficiency. Upon doping with Nb, two distinct structural phases are formed: a NiO phase with Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The reduction of structural defects in NiO via interaction with niobium ions correlates with the high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction. The vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems are not explicitly mentioned in the literature.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of dopants with different valences can modify the lattice constant of the NiO structure, leading to the formation of solid solutions. The valence of the dopants plays a crucial role in the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to COx. The reduction or elimination of these oxygen species favors the selective oxidation to ethylene. Lower valence dopants increase the non-stoichiometric oxygen, while higher valence dopants reduce it, enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The lability of the oxygen species is also affected, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species. The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the nature and reactivity of the different oxygen species on the catalysts, optimizing the dopant concentration and preparation method to achieve the desired electronic structure and catalytic performance, and ensuring the safety and stability of the catalysts under reaction conditions.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doped oxides have been studied less systematically than expected, with few cases of a single host oxide being doped with various dopants and tested under different conditions for the same reaction. Doping with Fe or Zr increases the surface area per gram of the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) make the reduction of the oxide easier, potentially improving the catalyst's performance. Doping with V also increases the surface area compared to undoped TiO2. The performance of doped catalysts can vary, with some showing improved selectivity and conversion, such as Ni-doped ceria for ethylbenzene to styrene conversion. Doped NiO with Zr shows improved selectivity to ethylene, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly, which is consistent with theoretical predictions for an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Key challenges include theoretical modeling to accurately predict the effects of dopants, optimizing the process for efficiency and selectivity, and balancing safety concerns, especially when using oxygen as an oxidant in reactions like ethane to ethylene.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction. On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the complex reaction mechanisms, predicting the effects of dopants and vacancies on electronic structure and reactivity, optimizing reaction conditions for maximum yield and selectivity, and ensuring safe operation at high temperatures and pressures.

The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts involve the incorporation of dopants like niobium through the evaporation method, which can vary the Nb/Ni atomic ratio from 0 to 0.67. This ratio influences the electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The dopant concentrations, specifically the Nb/Ni atomic ratio, have a significant impact on the bulk and surface properties of the oxides, affecting their catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of niobium into nickel oxide leads to a contraction of the NiO lattice, evidenced by the decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176, which influences the electronic structure and catalytic activity. High Nb loading in nickel oxide catalysts reaches an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice, affecting the electronic structure and catalytic performance. Pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Ã…, and the incorporation of niobium modifies this structure, impacting the electronic properties and catalytic activity. The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, leading to smaller grain sizes, but at high Nb loading, the segregation of NiO and Nb2O5 phases occurs, resulting in larger crystals. The reducibility of the catalysts was studied using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in hydrogen, which broadens the reduction profiles upon the introduction of niobium, indicating modifications to the catalysts. The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity of the catalysts, generating new acid sites of weak and moderate strength, which can influence the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of only 10% of niobium leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity compared to pure NiO, demonstrating the pronounced effect of niobium on the catalytic properties. The maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which can affect the catalytic performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface composition of the mixed nickel-niobium oxides, providing insights into the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Electrical conductivity measurements on oxide-based catalysts can provide information on structural defects and the existence of oxidizing species, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of higher valence cations like Nb5+ in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of niobium, which can modify the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers, influencing the electronic properties and catalytic performance. The incorporation of niobium ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate, impacting the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored under steady-state conditions, demonstrating the influence of the preparation method and dopant concentration on catalytic performance. The incorporation of even small amounts of niobium in NiO causes a significant increase in the per weight reactivity compared to pure nickel oxide, highlighting the role of dopant concentration in enhancing catalytic performance. A good oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst should effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity, which is influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. The incorporation of niobium leads to a significant increase in ethene selectivity, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on selectivity. The developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH are superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with very stable catalytic performance, influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor, which can affect the electronic structure and catalytic performance. The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, highlighting the importance of controlling the electronic structure for enhanced catalytic performance. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on the electronic structure and catalytic performance.

The thermal decomposition of oxalate ions, present due to the use of ammonium oxalato niobate as the niobium precursor, reduces the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, influencing catalytic properties. A small percentage of Nb is necessary for these effects, and the optimal activity observed for 15% Nb is related to the decrease in active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which prevents sintering of the active phase particles. Above 15% Nb, the amorphous phase reacts with nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6. Long-term studies show that NiNbO catalysts undergo slow but systematic deactivation, attributed to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and the formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase at the catalytic reaction temperature. Attempts to regenerate the catalysts have failed. Key challenges include theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.

The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts, including the use of citric acid to form a nickel-rich NbNi gel, influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of a thin layer of niobium-rich mixed oxide inhibits the reducibility of NiO, affecting the redox properties of the nanocomposites. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation are related to the size of NiO crystallites and the coverage of the Nb-rich phase on the active oxygen species of NiO. High Nb loadings lead to significant catalyst deactivation, while optimal Nb content (34 at.%) results in high activity, selectivity, and stability. The preparation method has a significant impact on the structural and catalytic properties of the catalysts, suggesting that further optimization can lead to improved performance.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with structural defects due to cationic deficiency. Upon doping with Nb, two distinct structural phases are formed: a NiO phase with Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The reduction of structural defects in NiO via interaction with niobium ions correlates with the high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction. The vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems are not explicitly mentioned in the literature.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of dopants with different valences can modify the lattice constant of the NiO structure, leading to the formation of solid solutions. The valence of the dopants plays a crucial role in the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to COx. The reduction or elimination of these oxygen species favors the selective oxidation to ethylene. Lower valence dopants increase the non-stoichiometric oxygen, while higher valence dopants reduce it, enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The lability of the oxygen species is also affected, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species. The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the nature and reactivity of the different oxygen species on the catalysts, optimizing the dopant concentration and preparation method to achieve the desired electronic structure and catalytic performance, and ensuring the safety and stability of the catalysts under reaction conditions.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doped oxides have been studied less systematically than expected, with few cases of a single host oxide being doped with various dopants and tested under different conditions for the same reaction. Doping with Fe or Zr increases the surface area per gram of the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) make the reduction of the oxide easier, potentially improving the catalyst's performance. Doping with V also increases the surface area compared to undoped TiO2. The performance of doped catalysts can vary, with some showing improved selectivity and conversion, such as Ni-doped ceria for ethylbenzene to styrene conversion. Doped NiO with Zr shows improved selectivity to ethylene, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly, which is consistent with theoretical predictions for an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Key challenges include theoretical modeling to accurately predict the effects of dopants, optimizing the process for efficiency and selectivity, and balancing safety concerns, especially when using oxygen as an oxidant in reactions like ethane to ethylene.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction. On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the complex reaction mechanisms, predicting the effects of dopants and vacancies on electronic structure and reactivity, optimizing reaction conditions for maximum yield and selectivity, and ensuring safe operation at high temperatures and pressures.

The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts involve the incorporation of dopants like niobium through the evaporation method, which can vary the Nb/Ni atomic ratio from 0 to 0.67. This ratio influences the electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The dopant concentrations, specifically the Nb/Ni atomic ratio, have a significant impact on the bulk and surface properties of the oxides, affecting their catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of niobium into nickel oxide leads to a contraction of the NiO lattice, evidenced by the decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176, which influences the electronic structure and catalytic activity. High Nb loading in nickel oxide catalysts reaches an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice, affecting the electronic structure and catalytic performance. Pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Ã…, and the incorporation of niobium modifies this structure, impacting the electronic properties and catalytic activity. The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, leading to smaller grain sizes, but at high Nb loading, the segregation of NiO and Nb2O5 phases occurs, resulting in larger crystals. The reducibility of the catalysts was studied using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in hydrogen, which broadens the reduction profiles upon the introduction of niobium, indicating modifications to the catalysts. The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity of the catalysts, generating new acid sites of weak and moderate strength, which can influence the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of only 10% of niobium leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity compared to pure NiO, demonstrating the pronounced effect of niobium on the catalytic properties. The maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which can affect the catalytic performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface composition of the mixed nickel-niobium oxides, providing insights into the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Electrical conductivity measurements on oxide-based catalysts can provide information on structural defects and the existence of oxidizing species, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of higher valence cations like Nb5+ in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of niobium, which can modify the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers, influencing the electronic properties and catalytic performance. The incorporation of niobium ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate, impacting the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored under steady-state conditions, demonstrating the influence of the preparation method and dopant concentration on catalytic performance. The incorporation of even small amounts of niobium in NiO causes a significant increase in the per weight reactivity compared to pure nickel oxide, highlighting the role of dopant concentration in enhancing catalytic performance. A good oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst should effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity, which is influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. The incorporation of niobium leads to a significant increase in ethene selectivity, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on selectivity. The developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH are superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with very stable catalytic performance, influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor, which can affect the electronic structure and catalytic performance. The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, highlighting the importance of controlling the electronic structure for enhanced catalytic performance. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on the electronic structure and catalytic performance.

A small percentage of Nb is necessary for these effects, and the optimal activity observed for 15% Nb is related to the decrease in active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which prevents sintering of the active phase particles. Above 15% Nb, the amorphous phase reacts with nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6. Long-term studies show that NiNbO catalysts undergo slow but systematic deactivation, attributed to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and the formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase at the catalytic reaction temperature. Attempts to regenerate the catalysts have failed. Key challenges include theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.

The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts, including the use of citric acid to form a nickel-rich NbNi gel, influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of a thin layer of niobium-rich mixed oxide inhibits the reducibility of NiO, affecting the redox properties of the nanocomposites. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation are related to the size of NiO crystallites and the coverage of the Nb-rich phase on the active oxygen species of NiO. High Nb loadings lead to significant catalyst deactivation, while optimal Nb content (34 at.%) results in high activity, selectivity, and stability. The preparation method has a significant impact on the structural and catalytic properties of the catalysts, suggesting that further optimization can lead to improved performance.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with structural defects due to cationic deficiency. Upon doping with Nb, two distinct structural phases are formed: a NiO phase with Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The reduction of structural defects in NiO via interaction with niobium ions correlates with the high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction. The vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems are not explicitly mentioned in the literature.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of dopants with different valences can modify the lattice constant of the NiO structure, leading to the formation of solid solutions. The valence of the dopants plays a crucial role in the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to COx. The reduction or elimination of these oxygen species favors the selective oxidation to ethylene. Lower valence dopants increase the non-stoichiometric oxygen, while higher valence dopants reduce it, enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The lability of the oxygen species is also affected, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species. The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the nature and reactivity of the different oxygen species on the catalysts, optimizing the dopant concentration and preparation method to achieve the desired electronic structure and catalytic performance, and ensuring the safety and stability of the catalysts under reaction conditions.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doped oxides have been studied less systematically than expected, with few cases of a single host oxide being doped with various dopants and tested under different conditions for the same reaction. Doping with Fe or Zr increases the surface area per gram of the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) make the reduction of the oxide easier, potentially improving the catalyst's performance. Doping with V also increases the surface area compared to undoped TiO2. The performance of doped catalysts can vary, with some showing improved selectivity and conversion, such as Ni-doped ceria for ethylbenzene to styrene conversion. Doped NiO with Zr shows improved selectivity to ethylene, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly, which is consistent with theoretical predictions for an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Key challenges include theoretical modeling to accurately predict the effects of dopants, optimizing the process for efficiency and selectivity, and balancing safety concerns, especially when using oxygen as an oxidant in reactions like ethane to ethylene.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction. On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the complex reaction mechanisms, predicting the effects of dopants and vacancies on electronic structure and reactivity, optimizing reaction conditions for maximum yield and selectivity, and ensuring safe operation at high temperatures and pressures.

The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts involve the incorporation of dopants like niobium through the evaporation method, which can vary the Nb/Ni atomic ratio from 0 to 0.67. This ratio influences the electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The dopant concentrations, specifically the Nb/Ni atomic ratio, have a significant impact on the bulk and surface properties of the oxides, affecting their catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of niobium into nickel oxide leads to a contraction of the NiO lattice, evidenced by the decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176, which influences the electronic structure and catalytic activity. High Nb loading in nickel oxide catalysts reaches an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice, affecting the electronic structure and catalytic performance. Pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Ã…, and the incorporation of niobium modifies this structure, impacting the electronic properties and catalytic activity. The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, leading to smaller grain sizes, but at high Nb loading, the segregation of NiO and Nb2O5 phases occurs, resulting in larger crystals. The reducibility of the catalysts was studied using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in hydrogen, which broadens the reduction profiles upon the introduction of niobium, indicating modifications to the catalysts. The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity of the catalysts, generating new acid sites of weak and moderate strength, which can influence the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of only 10% of niobium leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity compared to pure NiO, demonstrating the pronounced effect of niobium on the catalytic properties. The maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which can affect the catalytic performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface composition of the mixed nickel-niobium oxides, providing insights into the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Electrical conductivity measurements on oxide-based catalysts can provide information on structural defects and the existence of oxidizing species, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of higher valence cations like Nb5+ in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of niobium, which can modify the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers, influencing the electronic properties and catalytic performance. The incorporation of niobium ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate, impacting the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored under steady-state conditions, demonstrating the influence of the preparation method and dopant concentration on catalytic performance. The incorporation of even small amounts of niobium in NiO causes a significant increase in the per weight reactivity compared to pure nickel oxide, highlighting the role of dopant concentration in enhancing catalytic performance. A good oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst should effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity, which is influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. The incorporation of niobium leads to a significant increase in ethene selectivity, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on selectivity. The developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH are superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with very stable catalytic performance, influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor, which can affect the electronic structure and catalytic performance. The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, highlighting the importance of controlling the electronic structure for enhanced catalytic performance. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on the electronic structure and catalytic performance.
