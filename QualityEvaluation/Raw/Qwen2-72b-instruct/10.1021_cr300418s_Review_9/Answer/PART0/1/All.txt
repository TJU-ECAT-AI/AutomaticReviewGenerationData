The incorporation of dopants with different valences can modify the lattice constant of the NiO structure, leading to the formation of solid solutions. The valence of the dopants plays a crucial role in the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to COx.

nickel oxide-based catalysts involve the incorporation of dopants like niobium through the evaporation method, which can vary the Nb/Ni atomic ratio from 0 to 0.67. This ratio influences the electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The dopant concentrations, specifically the Nb/Ni atomic ratio, have a significant impact on the bulk and surface properties of the oxides, affecting their catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of niobium into nickel oxide leads to a contraction of the NiO lattice, evidenced by the decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176, which influences the electronic structure and catalytic activity. High Nb loading in nickel oxide catalysts reaches an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice, affecting the electronic structure and catalytic performance. Pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, and the incorporation of niobium modifies this structure, impacting the electronic properties and catalytic activity. The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, leading to smaller grain sizes, but at high Nb loading, the segregation of NiO and Nb2O5 phases occurs, resulting in larger crystals. The reducibility of the catalysts was studied using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in hydrogen, which broadens the reduction profiles upon the introduction of niobium, indicating modifications to the catalysts. The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity of the catalysts, generating new acid sites of weak and moderate strength, which can influence the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of only 10% of niobium leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity compared to pure NiO, demonstrating the pronounced effect of niobium on the catalytic properties. The maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which can affect the catalytic performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface composition of the mixed nickel-niobium oxides, providing insights into the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Electrical conductivity measurements on oxide-based catalysts can provide information on structural defects and the existence of oxidizing species, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of higher valence cations like Nb5+ in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of niobium, which can modify the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers, influencing the electronic properties and catalytic performance. The incorporation of niobium ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate, impacting the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored under steady-state conditions, demonstrating the influence of the preparation method and dopant concentration on catalytic performance. The incorporation of even small amounts of niobium in NiO causes a significant increase in the per weight reactivity compared to pure nickel oxide, highlighting the role of dopant concentration in enhancing catalytic performance. A good oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst should effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity, which is influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. The incorporation of niobium leads to a significant increase in ethene selectivity, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on selectivity. The developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH are superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with very stable catalytic performance, influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor, which can affect the electronic structure and catalytic performance. The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, highlighting the importance of controlling the electronic structure for enhanced catalytic performance.

The incorporation of dopants with different valences can modify the lattice constant of the NiO structure, leading to the formation of solid solutions. The valence of the dopants plays a crucial role in the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to COx. The reduction or elimination of these oxygen species favors the selective oxidation to ethylene. Lower valence dopants increase the non-stoichiometric oxygen, while higher valence dopants reduce it, enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The lability of the oxygen species is also affected, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species. The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above.

Pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, and the incorporation of niobium modifies this structure, impacting the electronic properties and catalytic activity. The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, leading to smaller grain sizes, but at high Nb loading, the segregation of NiO and Nb2O5 phases occurs, resulting in larger crystals. The reducibility of the catalysts was studied using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in hydrogen, which broadens the reduction profiles upon the introduction of niobium, indicating modifications to the catalysts.

Electrical conductivity measurements on oxide-based catalysts can provide information on structural defects and the existence of oxidizing species, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of higher valence cations like Nb5+ in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of niobium, which can modify the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers, influencing the electronic properties and catalytic performance.

The incorporation of even small amounts of niobium in NiO causes a significant increase in the per weight reactivity compared to pure nickel oxide, highlighting the role of dopant concentration in enhancing catalytic performance. A good oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst should effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity, which is influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration. The incorporation of niobium leads to a significant increase in ethene selectivity, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content catalyst, demonstrating the impact of dopant concentration on selectivity. The developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH are superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, with very stable catalytic performance, influenced by the preparation method and dopant concentration.

Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction. On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface.

The dopant concentrations, specifically the Nb/Ni atomic ratio, have a significant impact on the bulk and surface properties of the oxides, affecting their catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of niobium into nickel oxide leads to a contraction of the NiO lattice, evidenced by the decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176, which influences the electronic structure and catalytic activity. High Nb loading in nickel oxide catalysts reaches an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice, affecting the electronic structure and catalytic performance. Pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, and the incorporation of niobium modifies this structure, impacting the electronic properties and catalytic activity. The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, leading to smaller grain sizes, but at high Nb loading, the segregation of NiO and Nb2O5 phases occurs, resulting in larger crystals. The reducibility of the catalysts was studied using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in hydrogen, which broadens the reduction profiles upon the introduction of niobium, indicating modifications to the catalysts. The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity of the catalysts, generating new acid sites of weak and moderate strength, which can influence the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of only 10% of niobium leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity compared to pure NiO, demonstrating the pronounced effect of niobium on the catalytic properties. The maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which can affect the catalytic performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface composition of the mixed nickel-niobium oxides, providing insights into the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Electrical conductivity measurements on oxide-based catalysts can provide information on structural defects and the existence of oxidizing species, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of higher valence cations like Nb5+ in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of niobium, which can modify the electronic structure and catalytic activity.

The incorporation of dopants with different valences can modify the lattice constant of the NiO structure, leading to the formation of solid solutions. The valence of the dopants plays a crucial role in the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to COx. The reduction or elimination of these oxygen species favors the selective oxidation to ethylene. Lower valence dopants increase the non-stoichiometric oxygen, while higher valence dopants reduce it, enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The lability of the oxygen species is also affected, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species. The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the nature and reactivity of the different oxygen species on the catalysts, optimizing the dopant concentration and preparation method to achieve the desired electronic structure and catalytic performance, and ensuring the safety and stability of the catalysts under reaction conditions.", "Chinese": "镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯)的催化性能有重大影响。不同价态的掺杂剂的引入可以改变NiO结构的晶格常数,导致固溶体的形成。掺杂剂的价态在形成亲电氧物种中起着关键作用,这些物种负责乙烷的完全氧化为COx。减少或消除这些氧物种有利于选择性氧化为乙烯。低价掺杂剂增加非化学计量氧,而高价掺杂剂减少非化学计量氧,增强选择性转化为乙烯。氧物种的活性也受到影响,高价掺杂剂导致氧物种更牢固地结合。在TPIE实验中表面16O交换速率与ODH活性测试中C2H6消耗速率之间建立的线性关系证实,监测的氧物种确实参与并在这类反应中发挥着重要作用。催化剂容纳的非化学计量氧与选择性转化乙烷底物为乙烯的能力之间存在明显的相关性,随着外来阳离子价态的增加,这两个值呈反比趋势,这有力地支持了上述观点。掺杂剂阳离子的价态越高,对所需产物的初始选择性越高。在这些催化体系中,理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的关键挑战包括理解催化剂上不同氧物种的性质和反应性,优化掺杂浓度和制备方法以实现所需的电子结构和催化性能,以及确保催化剂在反应条件下的安全性和稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004"},

Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction. On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface.

The dopant concentrations, specifically the Nb/Ni atomic ratio, have a significant impact on the bulk and surface properties of the oxides, affecting their catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of niobium into nickel oxide leads to a contraction of the NiO lattice, evidenced by the decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176, which influences the electronic structure and catalytic activity. High Nb loading in nickel oxide catalysts reaches an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice, affecting the electronic structure and catalytic performance. Pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, and the incorporation of niobium modifies this structure, impacting the electronic properties and catalytic activity. The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, leading to smaller grain sizes, but at high Nb loading, the segregation of NiO and Nb2O5 phases occurs, resulting in larger crystals. The reducibility of the catalysts was studied using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in hydrogen, which broadens the reduction profiles upon the introduction of niobium, indicating modifications to the catalysts. The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity of the catalysts, generating new acid sites of weak and moderate strength, which can influence the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of only 10% of niobium leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity compared to pure NiO, demonstrating the pronounced effect of niobium on the catalytic properties. The maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which can affect the catalytic performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface composition of the mixed nickel-niobium oxides, providing insights into the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Electrical conductivity measurements on oxide-based catalysts can provide information on structural defects and the existence of oxidizing species, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of higher valence cations like Nb5+ in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of niobium, which can modify the electronic structure and catalytic activity.

The incorporation of dopants with different valences can modify the lattice constant of the NiO structure, leading to the formation of solid solutions. The valence of the dopants plays a crucial role in the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to COx. The reduction or elimination of these oxygen species favors the selective oxidation to ethylene. Lower valence dopants increase the non-stoichiometric oxygen, while higher valence dopants reduce it, enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The lability of the oxygen species is also affected, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species. The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the nature and reactivity of the different oxygen species on the catalysts, optimizing the dopant concentration and preparation method to achieve the desired electronic structure and catalytic performance, and ensuring the safety and stability of the catalysts under reaction conditions.", "Chinese": "镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯)的催化性能有重大影响。不同价态的掺杂剂的引入可以改变NiO结构的晶格常数,导致固溶体的形成。掺杂剂的价态在形成亲电氧物种中起着关键作用,这些物种负责乙烷的完全氧化为COx。减少或消除这些氧物种有利于选择性氧化为乙烯。低价掺杂剂增加非化学计量氧,而高价掺杂剂减少非化学计量氧,增强选择性转化为乙烯。氧物种的活性也受到影响,高价掺杂剂导致氧物种更牢固地结合。在TPIE实验中表面16O交换速率与ODH活性测试中C2H6消耗速率之间建立的线性关系证实,监测的氧物种确实参与并在这类反应中发挥着重要作用。催化剂容纳的非化学计量氧与选择性转化乙烷底物为乙烯的能力之间存在明显的相关性,随着外来阳离子价态的增加,这两个值呈反比趋势,这有力地支持了上述观点。掺杂剂阳离子的价态越高,对所需产物的初始选择性越高。在这些催化体系中,理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的关键挑战包括理解催化剂上不同氧物种的性质和反应性,优化掺杂浓度和制备方法以实现所需的电子结构和催化性能,以及确保催化剂在反应条件下的安全性和稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004"},
