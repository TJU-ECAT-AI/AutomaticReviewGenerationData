[1] "The two catalytic systems giving outstanding performance far beyond most of the proposed ones are those based either on NiO oxide [18], or mixed molybdates [913]."
          [2] "The materials have been characterized and it has been proposed that the active phase corresponds to a Ni1xNbxO solid solution with 0 < x < 0.18 and Nb cations substituting either Ni cations and/or filling the cationic vacancies in the defective non- stoichiometric structure [2,3]."
          [3] "The catalytic efficiency of these compounds in ethane ODH would thus be related to the presence at the surface of NiO of dispersed Ospecies in amount high enough to convert sufficiently ethane but low enough to avoid total oxidation."
          [4] "The results clearly showed that Nb has two main effects at low and high content."
          [5] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously,which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number."
          [6] "The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease."
          [7] "In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases."
          [8] "At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant."
          [9] "The active sites are not modified anymore and since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase,the conversion of ethane increases."
          [10] "The best yields are consequently observed for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound."
          [11] "Above 15% of Nb, the phase inactive NiNb2O6 phase is formed and the relative content in active phase starts to decrease."
          [12] "The results obtained on NiO-OA catalysts show that oxalic acid introduced in the preparation medium has an effect on the texture of the NiO oxide with a decrease in the particle size and an increase in the specific surface area of the solids."
          [13] "The decrease in rate of ethane conversion is high."
          [14] "This decrease can only be explained by a reduction at least at the surface of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry i.e. of the relative concentration of Ni3+ and consequently of the amount of O."
          [15] "The decrease in the number of the latter species leads to higher selectivity to ethylene."
          [16] "The O2-TPD-MS experiments data may contribute to understand the nature of the active surface species."
          [17] "As the strength of the adsorption bonding increases with the desorption temperature,  oxygen should be more labile than  oxygen."
          [18] "Both upon oxalic acid and niobium additions, the  species, which were the minor in quantity, disappeared and the number  and  species strongly decreased."
          [19] "It may be proposed that the selective oxygen species are of  type since contrarily to the  species, these species become more labile when less numerous."
          [20] "After deactivation only new oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound; these high temperature species should not be involved in the reaction and correspond presumably to species strongly adsorbed on surface defects (dislocations, edges and cor- ners) which number may increase after surface transformations related to the deactivation."
          [21] "The deactivation of these catalysts is rather low and is apparently not coupled with a decrease in selectivity although it could exist but to a small extent and be compensated by an increase related to the decrease in conversion."
          [22] "This deactivation is not related to a decrease in specific surface area neither to the formation of coke at the surface."
          [23] "It may be ascribed to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6, which can be evidenced in some catalysts after catalytic testing by X-ray diffrac- tion."
          [24] "The deactivation can also be explained by a decrease in the oxygen over-stoichiometry of the active NiO phase."
          [25] "When the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO was decreased to the state where all the surface Ospecies are isolated, a further decrease did not change the nature of the sites but simply decreased their number implying a decrease in activity without change in selectivity."
          [26] "The deactivation process, which can be evidenced by Raman spectroscopy, was difficult to observe on the NiNbO catalysts since the deactivation after testing was moderate and the change in the spectra are within the experimental precision."
          [27] "However the decrease in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry was clearly evidenced by Raman spectroscopy in the Nb/NiO and NiO-OA-3/1 compounds that suffered from stronger deactivation."
          [28] "The deactivation process may be explain by the fact that contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extrac- tion work from such surface is favored [32,35]."
          [29] "Inversely when the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry decreases, the O2 adsorption is slowed down as well as the re-oxidation and the deactivation process is auto-catalyzed."
          [30] "It is furthermore probable that the two pro- cesses could be linked to each other as the mobility of the surface species necessary to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6 should depend on the surface oxygen stoichiometry."
          [31] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
          [32] "An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL1."
          [33] "The catalysts have been characterized using various techniques allowing to show that the efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase."
          [34] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."
          [35] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."
          [36] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."
          [37] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation."
          [38] "This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."
          [39] "Attempt to regenerate the catalysts has failed."

[1] "A method for the preparation of NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites is developed, based on the slow oxi- dation of a nickel-rich NbNi gel obtained in citric acid."
          [2] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."
          [3] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."
          [4] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."
          [5] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
          [6] "The close interac- tion between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
          [7] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
          [8] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."

[1] "In this work, we report an in-depth structural characterization of pure NiO and NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts (Nb/Ni = 00.25), highly active and selective materials for ethylene production via ethane ODH, using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS)."
          [2] "It was found that low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."
          [3] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."
          [4] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."



[1] "While the literature on catalysis by doped oxide is extensive, there are very few cases in which such catalysts were studied systematically, by preparing one host oxide with a variety of dopants, by a variety of methods, and by using them for the same reaction under a variety of conditions."
          [2] "Doping with Fe increases substantially the area per gram even though the doped and the undoped oxide were prepared by the same solgel method, under identical conditions (except for the presence of the precursor for the dopant)."
          [3] "Doping with an LVD makes the reduction of the oxide more facile."
          [4] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
          [5] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
          [6] "Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."
          [7] "Zr-doped NiO behaves as calculations lead us to expect from an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide surface, just as the calculations predict."
          [8] "Doping with Ga increases the conversion, however, as the area per gram of 15GZ is 53.9 m2/g, while that of ZrO2 is 19.0 m2/g."
          [9] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
          [10] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
          [11] "The method of preparation makes a difference. Ce0.9Ni0.1O2 made by oxalate-gel coprecipitation has a conversion of 40.8%, which is much lower than that of the same composition prepared by the template-assisted method."
          [12] "The presence of a Ni vacancy creates (formally) a deficit of two electrons, which is equivalent to two holes and is believed to be responsible for the p-conductivity of the material."
          [13] "Because of these uncertainties in the accuracy of DFT, we only emphasize here the trends suggested by the calculations."
          [14] "The difficulties encountered by DFT in describing NiO correctly have been discussed by Pacchioni and Illas."
          [15] "The presence of Zr is likely to decrease ethane oxidation."
          [16] "Doping with Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."
          [17] "Doping with Zr makes the oxide less able to consume hydrogen or to release oxygen."



[1] "A series of mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratio ranging from 0 to 0.67 was prepared by the evaporation method."
          [2] "The effect of the Nb/Ni ratio on the performance of the materi- als is discussed in view of a detailed investigation of the bulk and surface properties of the oxides."
          [3] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
          [4] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
          [5] "The XRD analysis shows that pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, in agree- ment with reported data (JCPDS 4-835)."
          [6] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice in- hibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
          [7] "The reducibility of the catalysts was studied with TPR in H2."
          [8] "The introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicat- ing modification of the catalysts and contributions from differ- ent species."
          [9] "The acidity was determined by TPD after saturation of the cat- alytic surface with ammonia at 100 C."
          [10] "The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity and generates new acid sites of weak and moderate strength."
          [11] "The effect is much more pronounced if we compare, for example, pure NiO and the Ni0.9Nb0.1 catalyst,where the introduction of only 10% of Nb leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity."
          [12] "The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice con- stant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
          [13] "The surface composition of the mixed nickelniobium ox- ides was determined by XPS, because this technique has a surface-specific character and allows quantitative determina- tion of the elemental content in the upper layers of the sample."
          [14] "Electrical conductivity measurements carried out on oxide- based catalysts can provide valuable information on the nature of structural defects, the existence of oxidizing species, and so on."
          [15] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb."
          [16] "Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers."
          [17] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommo- date."
          [18] "The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored un- der steady-state conditions at 300425 C with a constant W/F (0.54 g s/cm3) and ethane-to-oxygen ratio (1/1)."
          [19] "The incorporation of even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO causes a 100% increase in the per weight reactivity com- pared with the pure nickel oxide."
          [20] "The most important requirement for a good ODH cata- lyst is the ability to effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity."
          [21] "The most prominent feature is the enormous in- crease of ethene selectivity upon incorporation of Nb, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content cata- lyst (Ni0.9Nb0.1)."
          [22] "The developed NiNbO cata- lysts for ethane ODH presented in this study appear to be clearly superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels (66% C2H6 con- version and 70% C2H4 selectivity at 400 C), with very stable catalytic performance."
          [23] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO accep- tor."
          [24] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene."
          [25] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

[1] "The two catalytic systems giving outstanding performance far beyond most of the proposed ones are those based either on NiO oxide [18], or mixed molybdates [913]."
          [2] "The materials have been characterized and it has been proposed that the active phase corresponds to a Ni1xNbxO solid solution with 0 < x < 0.18 and Nb cations substituting either Ni cations and/or filling the cationic vacancies in the defective non- stoichiometric structure [2,3]."
          [3] "The catalytic efficiency of these compounds in ethane ODH would thus be related to the presence at the surface of NiO of dispersed Ospecies in amount high enough to convert sufficiently ethane but low enough to avoid total oxidation."
          [4] "The results clearly showed that Nb has two main effects at low and high content."
          [5] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously,which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number."
          [6] "The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease."
          [7] "In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases."
          [8] "At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant."
          [9] "The active sites are not modified anymore and since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase,the conversion of ethane increases."

          [13] "The decrease in rate of ethane conversion is high."
          [14] "This decrease can only be explained by a reduction at least at the surface of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry i.e. of the relative concentration of Ni3+ and consequently of the amount of O."
          [15] "The decrease in the number of the latter species leads to higher selectivity to ethylene."
          [16] "The O2-TPD-MS experiments data may contribute to understand the nature of the active surface species."
          [17] "As the strength of the adsorption bonding increases with the desorption temperature,  oxygen should be more labile than  oxygen."
          [18] "Both upon oxalic acid and niobium additions, the  species, which were the minor in quantity, disappeared and the number  and  species strongly decreased."
          [19] "It may be proposed that the selective oxygen species are of  type since contrarily to the  species, these species become more labile when less numerous."
          [20] "After deactivation only new oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound; these high temperature species should not be involved in the reaction and correspond presumably to species strongly adsorbed on surface defects (dislocations, edges and cor- ners) which number may increase after surface transformations related to the deactivation."
          [21] "The deactivation of these catalysts is rather low and is apparently not coupled with a decrease in selectivity although it could exist but to a small extent and be compensated by an increase related to the decrease in conversion."
          [22] "This deactivation is not related to a decrease in specific surface area neither to the formation of coke at the surface."
          [23] "It may be ascribed to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6, which can be evidenced in some catalysts after catalytic testing by X-ray diffrac- tion."
          [24] "The deactivation can also be explained by a decrease in the oxygen over-stoichiometry of the active NiO phase."
          [25] "When the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO was decreased to the state where all the surface Ospecies are isolated, a further decrease did not change the nature of the sites but simply decreased their number implying a decrease in activity without change in selectivity."
          [26] "The deactivation process, which can be evidenced by Raman spectroscopy, was difficult to observe on the NiNbO catalysts since the deactivation after testing was moderate and the change in the spectra are within the experimental precision."

Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide surface, just as the calculations predict."
          [8] "Doping with Ga increases the conversion, however, as the area per gram of 15GZ is 53.9 m2/g, while that of ZrO2 is 19.0 m2/g."
          [9] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
          [10] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
          [11] "The method of preparation makes a difference. Ce0.9Ni0.1O2 made by oxalate-gel coprecipitation has a conversion of 40.8%, which is much lower than that of the same composition prepared by the template-assisted method."
          [12] "The presence of a Ni vacancy creates (formally) a deficit of two electrons, which is equivalent to two holes and is believed to be responsible for the p-conductivity of the material."
          [13] "Because of these uncertainties in the accuracy of DFT, we only emphasize here the trends suggested by the calculations."
          [14] "The difficulties encountered by DFT in describing NiO correctly have been discussed by Pacchioni and Illas."
          [15] "The presence of Zr is likely to decrease ethane oxidation."
          [16] "Doping with Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."
          [17] "Doping with Zr makes the oxide less able to consume hydrogen or to release oxygen."



[1] "A series of mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratio ranging from 0 to 0.67 was prepared by the evaporation method."
          [2] "The effect of the Nb/Ni ratio on the performance of the materi- als is discussed in view of a detailed investigation of the bulk and surface properties of the oxides."
          [3] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
          [4] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
          [5] "The XRD analysis shows that pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, in agree- ment with reported data (JCPDS 4-835)."
          [6] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice in- hibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
          [7] "The reducibility of the catalysts was studied with TPR in H2."
          [8] "The introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicat- ing modification of the catalysts and contributions from differ- ent species."
          [9] "The acidity was determined by TPD after saturation of the cat- alytic surface with ammonia at 100 C."
          [10] "The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity and generates new acid sites of weak and moderate strength."
          [11] "The effect is much more pronounced if we compare, for example, pure NiO and the Ni0.9Nb0.1 catalyst,where the introduction of only 10% of Nb leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity."
          [12] "The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice con- stant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
          [13] "The surface composition of the mixed nickelniobium ox- ides was determined by XPS, because this technique has a surface-specific character and allows quantitative determina- tion of the elemental content in the upper layers of the sample."
          [14] "Electrical conductivity measurements carried out on oxide- based catalysts can provide valuable information on the nature of structural defects, the existence of oxidizing species, and so on."
          [15] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb."
          [16] "Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers."
          [17] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommo- date."
          [18] "The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored un- der steady-state conditions at 300425 C with a constant W/F (0.54 g s/cm3) and ethane-to-oxygen ratio (1/1)."
          [19] "The incorporation of even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO causes a 100% increase in the per weight reactivity com- pared with the pure nickel oxide."
          [20] "The most important requirement for a good ODH cata- lyst is the ability to effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity."
          [21] "The most prominent feature is the enormous in- crease of ethene selectivity upon incorporation of Nb, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content cata- lyst (Ni0.9Nb0.1)."
          [22] "The developed NiNbO cata- lysts for ethane ODH presented in this study appear to be clearly superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels (66% C2H6 con- version and 70% C2H4 selectivity at 400 C), with very stable catalytic performance."
          [23] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO accep- tor."
          [24] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene."
          [25] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

[1] "The two catalytic systems giving outstanding performance far beyond most of the proposed ones are those based either on NiO oxide [18], or mixed molybdates [913]."
          [2] "The materials have been characterized and it has been proposed that the active phase corresponds to a Ni1xNbxO solid solution with 0 < x < 0.18 and Nb cations substituting either Ni cations and/or filling the cationic vacancies in the defective non- stoichiometric structure [2,3]."
          [3] "The catalytic efficiency of these compounds in ethane ODH would thus be related to the presence at the surface of NiO of dispersed Ospecies in amount high enough to convert sufficiently ethane but low enough to avoid total oxidation."
          [4] "The results clearly showed that Nb has two main effects at low and high content."
          [5] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously,which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number."
          [6] "The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease."
          [7] "In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases."
          [8] "At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant."
          [9] "The active sites are not modified anymore and since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase,the conversion of ethane increases."
          [10] "The best yields are consequently observed for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound."
          [11] "Above 15% of Nb, the phase inactive NiNb2O6 phase is formed and the relative content in active phase starts to decrease."
          [12] "The results obtained on NiO-OA catalysts show that oxalic acid introduced in the preparation medium has an effect on the texture of the NiO oxide with a decrease in the particle size and an increase in the specific surface area of the solids."
          [13] "The decrease in rate of ethane conversion is high."
          [14] "This decrease can only be explained by a reduction at least at the surface of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry i.e. of the relative concentration of Ni3+ and consequently of the amount of O."
          [15] "The decrease in the number of the latter species leads to higher selectivity to ethylene."
          [16] "The O2-TPD-MS experiments data may contribute to understand the nature of the active surface species."
          [17] "As the strength of the adsorption bonding increases with the desorption temperature,  oxygen should be more labile than  oxygen."
          [18] "Both upon oxalic acid and niobium additions, the  species, which were the minor in quantity, disappeared and the number  and  species strongly decreased."
          [19] "It may be proposed that the selective oxygen species are of  type since contrarily to the  species, these species become more labile when less numerous."
          [20] "After deactivation only new oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound; these high temperature species should not be involved in the reaction and correspond presumably to species strongly adsorbed on surface defects (dislocations, edges and cor- ners) which number may increase after surface transformations related to the deactivation."
          [21] "The deactivation of these catalysts is rather low and is apparently not coupled with a decrease in selectivity although it could exist but to a small extent and be compensated by an increase related to the decrease in conversion."
          [22] "This deactivation is not related to a decrease in specific surface area neither to the formation of coke at the surface."
          [23] "It may be ascribed to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6, which can be evidenced in some catalysts after catalytic testing by X-ray diffrac- tion."
          [24] "The deactivation can also be explained by a decrease in the oxygen over-stoichiometry of the active NiO phase."
          [25] "When the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO was decreased to the state where all the surface Ospecies are isolated, a further decrease did not change the nature of the sites but simply decreased their number implying a decrease in activity without change in selectivity."
          [26] "The deactivation process, which can be evidenced by Raman spectroscopy, was difficult to observe on the NiNbO catalysts since the deactivation after testing was moderate and the change in the spectra are within the experimental precision."
          [27] "However the decrease in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry was clearly evidenced by Raman spectroscopy in the Nb/NiO and NiO-OA-3/1 compounds that suffered from stronger deactivation."
          [28] "The deactivation process may be explain by the fact that contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extrac- tion work from such surface is favored [32,35]."
          [29] "Inversely when the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry decreases, the O2 adsorption is slowed down as well as the re-oxidation and the deactivation process is auto-catalyzed."
          [30] "It is furthermore probable that the two pro- cesses could be linked to each other as the mobility of the surface species necessary to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6 should depend on the surface oxygen stoichiometry."
          [31] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
          [32] "An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL1."
          [33] "The catalysts have been characterized using various techniques allowing to show that the efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase."
          [34] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."
          [35] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."
          [36] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."
          [37] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation."
          [38] "This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."
          [39] "Attempt to regenerate the catalysts has failed."

[1] "A method for the preparation of NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites is developed, based on the slow oxi- dation of a nickel-rich NbNi gel obtained in citric acid."
          [2] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."
          [3] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."
          [4] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."
          [5] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
          [6] "The close interac- tion between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
          [7] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
          [8] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."

[1] "In this work, we report an in-depth structural characterization of pure NiO and NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts (Nb/Ni = 00.25), highly active and selective materials for ethylene production via ethane ODH, using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS)."
          [2] "It was found that low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."
          [3] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."
          [4] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."



[1] "While the literature on catalysis by doped oxide is extensive, there are very few cases in which such catalysts were studied systematically, by preparing one host oxide with a variety of dopants, by a variety of methods, and by using them for the same reaction under a variety of conditions."
          [2] "Doping with Fe increases substantially the area per gram even though the doped and the undoped oxide were prepared by the same solgel method, under identical conditions (except for the presence of the precursor for the dopant)."
          [3] "Doping with an LVD makes the reduction of the oxide more facile."
          [4] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
          [5] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
          [6] "Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."
          [7] "Zr-doped NiO behaves as calculations lead us to expect from an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide surface, just as the calculations predict."

          [27] "However the decrease in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry was clearly evidenced by Raman spectroscopy in the Nb/NiO and NiO-OA-3/1 compounds that suffered from stronger deactivation."
          [28] "The deactivation process may be explain by the fact that contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extrac- tion work from such surface is favored [32,35]."
          [29] "Inversely when the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry decreases, the O2 adsorption is slowed down as well as the re-oxidation and the deactivation process is auto-catalyzed."
          [30] "It is furthermore probable that the two pro- cesses could be linked to each other as the mobility of the surface species necessary to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6 should depend on the surface oxygen stoichiometry."
          [31] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
          [32] "An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL1."
          [33] "The catalysts have been characterized using various techniques allowing to show that the efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase."
          [34] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."
          [35] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."
          [36] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."
          [37] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation."
          [38] "This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."
          [39] "Attempt to regenerate the catalysts has failed."

[1] "A method for the preparation of NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites is developed, based on the slow oxi- dation of a nickel-rich NbNi gel obtained in citric acid."
          [2] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."
          [3] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."
          [4] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."
          [5] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
          [6] "The close interac- tion between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
          [7] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
          [8] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."

[1] "In this work, we report an in-depth structural characterization of pure NiO and NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts (Nb/Ni = 00.25), highly active and selective materials for ethylene production via ethane ODH, using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS)."
          [2] "It was found that low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."
          [3] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."
          [4] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."



[1] "While the literature on catalysis by doped oxide is extensive, there are very few cases in which such catalysts were studied systematically, by preparing one host oxide with a variety of dopants, by a variety of methods, and by using them for the same reaction under a variety of conditions."
          [2] "Doping with Fe increases substantially the area per gram even though the doped and the undoped oxide were prepared by the same solgel method, under identical conditions (except for the presence of the precursor for the dopant)."
          [3] "Doping with an LVD makes the reduction of the oxide more facile."
          [4] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
          [5] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
          [6] "Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."
          [7] "Zr-doped NiO behaves as calculations lead us to expect from an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide surface, just as the calculations predict."
          [8] "Doping with Ga increases the conversion, however, as the area per gram of 15GZ is 53.9 m2/g, while that of ZrO2 is 19.0 m2/g."
          [9] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
          [10] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
          [11] "The method of preparation makes a difference. Ce0.9Ni0.1O2 made by oxalate-gel coprecipitation has a conversion of 40.8%, which is much lower than that of the same composition prepared by the template-assisted method."
          [12] "The presence of a Ni vacancy creates (formally) a deficit of two electrons, which is equivalent to two holes and is believed to be responsible for the p-conductivity of the material."
          [13] "Because of these uncertainties in the accuracy of DFT, we only emphasize here the trends suggested by the calculations."
          [14] "The difficulties encountered by DFT in describing NiO correctly have been discussed by Pacchioni and Illas."
          [15] "The presence of Zr is likely to decrease ethane oxidation."
          [16] "Doping with Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."
          [17] "Doping with Zr makes the oxide less able to consume hydrogen or to release oxygen."



[1] "A series of mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratio ranging from 0 to 0.67 was prepared by the evaporation method."
          [2] "The effect of the Nb/Ni ratio on the performance of the materi- als is discussed in view of a detailed investigation of the bulk and surface properties of the oxides."
          [3] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
          [4] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
          [5] "The XRD analysis shows that pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, in agree- ment with reported data (JCPDS 4-835)."
          [6] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice in- hibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
          [7] "The reducibility of the catalysts was studied with TPR in H2."
          [8] "The introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicat- ing modification of the catalysts and contributions from differ- ent species."
          [9] "The acidity was determined by TPD after saturation of the cat- alytic surface with ammonia at 100 C."
          [10] "The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity and generates new acid sites of weak and moderate strength."
          [11] "The effect is much more pronounced if we compare, for example, pure NiO and the Ni0.9Nb0.1 catalyst,where the introduction of only 10% of Nb leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity."
          [12] "The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice con- stant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
          [13] "The surface composition of the mixed nickelniobium ox- ides was determined by XPS, because this technique has a surface-specific character and allows quantitative determina- tion of the elemental content in the upper layers of the sample."
          [14] "Electrical conductivity measurements carried out on oxide- based catalysts can provide valuable information on the nature of structural defects, the existence of oxidizing species, and so on."
          [15] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb."
          [16] "Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers."
          [17] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommo- date."
          [18] "The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored un- der steady-state conditions at 300425 C with a constant W/F (0.54 g s/cm3) and ethane-to-oxygen ratio (1/1)."
          [19] "The incorporation of even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO causes a 100% increase in the per weight reactivity com- pared with the pure nickel oxide."
          [20] "The most important requirement for a good ODH cata- lyst is the ability to effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity."
          [21] "The most prominent feature is the enormous in- crease of ethene selectivity upon incorporation of Nb, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content cata- lyst (Ni0.9Nb0.1)."
          [22] "The developed NiNbO cata- lysts for ethane ODH presented in this study appear to be clearly superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels (66% C2H6 con- version and 70% C2H4 selectivity at 400 C), with very stable catalytic performance."
          [23] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO accep- tor."
          [24] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene."
          [25] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

[1] "The two catalytic systems giving outstanding performance far beyond most of the proposed ones are those based either on NiO oxide [18], or mixed molybdates [913]."
          [2] "The materials have been characterized and it has been proposed that the active phase corresponds to a Ni1xNbxO solid solution with 0 < x < 0.18 and Nb cations substituting either Ni cations and/or filling the cationic vacancies in the defective non- stoichiometric structure [2,3]."
          [3] "The catalytic efficiency of these compounds in ethane ODH would thus be related to the presence at the surface of NiO of dispersed Ospecies in amount high enough to convert sufficiently ethane but low enough to avoid total oxidation."
          [4] "The results clearly showed that Nb has two main effects at low and high content."
          [5] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously,which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number."
          [6] "The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease."
          [7] "In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases."
          [8] "At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant."
          [9] "The active sites are not modified anymore and since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase,the conversion of ethane increases."
          [10] "The best yields are consequently observed for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound."
          [11] "Above 15% of Nb, the phase inactive NiNb2O6 phase is formed and the relative content in active phase starts to decrease."
          [12] "The results obtained on NiO-OA catalysts show that oxalic acid introduced in the preparation medium has an effect on the texture of the NiO oxide with a decrease in the particle size and an increase in the specific surface area of the solids."
          [13] "The decrease in rate of ethane conversion is high."
          [14] "This decrease can only be explained by a reduction at least at the surface of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry i.e. of the relative concentration of Ni3+ and consequently of the amount of O."
          [15] "The decrease in the number of the latter species leads to higher selectivity to ethylene."
          [16] "The O2-TPD-MS experiments data may contribute to understand the nature of the active surface species."
          [17] "As the strength of the adsorption bonding increases with the desorption temperature,  oxygen should be more labile than  oxygen."
          [18] "Both upon oxalic acid and niobium additions, the  species, which were the minor in quantity, disappeared and the number  and  species strongly decreased."
          [19] "It may be proposed that the selective oxygen species are of  type since contrarily to the  species, these species become more labile when less numerous."
          [20] "After deactivation only new oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound; these high temperature species should not be involved in the reaction and correspond presumably to species strongly adsorbed on surface defects (dislocations, edges and cor- ners) which number may increase after surface transformations related to the deactivation."
          [21] "The deactivation of these catalysts is rather low and is apparently not coupled with a decrease in selectivity although it could exist but to a small extent and be compensated by an increase related to the decrease in conversion."
          [22] "This deactivation is not related to a decrease in specific surface area neither to the formation of coke at the surface."
          [23] "It may be ascribed to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6, which can be evidenced in some catalysts after catalytic testing by X-ray diffrac- tion."
          [24] "The deactivation can also be explained by a decrease in the oxygen over-stoichiometry of the active NiO phase."
          [25] "When the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO was decreased to the state where all the surface Ospecies are isolated, a further decrease did not change the nature of the sites but simply decreased their number implying a decrease in activity without change in selectivity."
          [26] "The deactivation process, which can be evidenced by Raman spectroscopy, was difficult to observe on the NiNbO catalysts since the deactivation after testing was moderate and the change in the spectra are within the experimental precision."
          [27] "However the decrease in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry was clearly evidenced by Raman spectroscopy in the Nb/NiO and NiO-OA-3/1 compounds that suffered from stronger deactivation."
          [28] "The deactivation process may be explain by the fact that contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extrac- tion work from such surface is favored [32,35]."
          [29] "Inversely when the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry decreases, the O2 adsorption is slowed down as well as the re-oxidation and the deactivation process is auto-catalyzed."

          [33] "The catalysts have been characterized using various techniques allowing to show that the efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase."

          [35] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."
          [36] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."
          [37] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation."
          [38] "This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."
          [39] "Attempt to regenerate the catalysts has failed."

[1] "A method for the preparation of NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites is developed, based on the slow oxi- dation of a nickel-rich NbNi gel obtained in citric acid."

          [6] "The close interac- tion between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."

          [13] "The surface composition of the mixed nickelniobium ox- ides was determined by XPS, because this technique has a surface-specific character and allows quantitative determina- tion of the elemental content in the upper layers of the sample."
          [14] "Electrical conductivity measurements carried out on oxide- based catalysts can provide valuable information on the nature of structural defects, the existence of oxidizing species, and so on."
          [15] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb."
          [16] "Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers."
          [17] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommo- date."
          [18] "The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored un- der steady-state conditions at 300425 C with a constant W/F (0.54 g s/cm3) and ethane-to-oxygen ratio (1/1)."
          [19] "The incorporation of even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO causes a 100% increase in the per weight reactivity com- pared with the pure nickel oxide."
          [20] "The most important requirement for a good ODH cata- lyst is the ability to effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity."
          [21] "The most prominent feature is the enormous in- crease of ethene selectivity upon incorporation of Nb, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content cata- lyst (Ni0.9Nb0.1)."
          [22] "The developed NiNbO cata- lysts for ethane ODH presented in this study appear to be clearly superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels (66% C2H6 con- version and 70% C2H4 selectivity at 400 C), with very stable catalytic performance."
          [23] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO accep- tor."
          [24] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene."
          [25] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

[1] "The two catalytic systems giving outstanding performance far beyond most of the proposed ones are those based either on NiO oxide [18], or mixed molybdates [913]."
          [2] "The materials have been characterized and it has been proposed that the active phase corresponds to a Ni1xNbxO solid solution with 0 < x < 0.18 and Nb cations substituting either Ni cations and/or filling the cationic vacancies in the defective non- stoichiometric structure [2,3]."
          [3] "The catalytic efficiency of these compounds in ethane ODH would thus be related to the presence at the surface of NiO of dispersed Ospecies in amount high enough to convert sufficiently ethane but low enough to avoid total oxidation."
          [4] "The results clearly showed that Nb has two main effects at low and high content."
          [5] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously,which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number."
          [6] "The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease."
          [7] "In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases."
          [8] "At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant."
          [9] "The active sites are not modified anymore and since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase,the conversion of ethane increases."
          [10] "The best yields are consequently observed for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound."
          [11] "Above 15% of Nb, the phase inactive NiNb2O6 phase is formed and the relative content in active phase starts to decrease."
          [12] "The results obtained on NiO-OA catalysts show that oxalic acid introduced in the preparation medium has an effect on the texture of the NiO oxide with a decrease in the particle size and an increase in the specific surface area of the solids."
          [13] "The decrease in rate of ethane conversion is high."
          [14] "This decrease can only be explained by a reduction at least at the surface of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry i.e. of the relative concentration of Ni3+ and consequently of the amount of O."
          [15] "The decrease in the number of the latter species leads to higher selectivity to ethylene."
          [16] "The O2-TPD-MS experiments data may contribute to understand the nature of the active surface species."
          [17] "As the strength of the adsorption bonding increases with the desorption temperature,  oxygen should be more labile than  oxygen."
          [18] "Both upon oxalic acid and niobium additions, the  species, which were the minor in quantity, disappeared and the number  and  species strongly decreased."
          [19] "It may be proposed that the selective oxygen species are of  type since contrarily to the  species, these species become more labile when less numerous."
          [20] "After deactivation only new oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound; these high temperature species should not be involved in the reaction and correspond presumably to species strongly adsorbed on surface defects (dislocations, edges and cor- ners) which number may increase after surface transformations related to the deactivation."
          [21] "The deactivation of these catalysts is rather low and is apparently not coupled with a decrease in selectivity although it could exist but to a small extent and be compensated by an increase related to the decrease in conversion."
          [22] "This deactivation is not related to a decrease in specific surface area neither to the formation of coke at the surface."
          [23] "It may be ascribed to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6, which can be evidenced in some catalysts after catalytic testing by X-ray diffrac- tion."
          [24] "The deactivation can also be explained by a decrease in the oxygen over-stoichiometry of the active NiO phase."
          [25] "When the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO was decreased to the state where all the surface Ospecies are isolated, a further decrease did not change the nature of the sites but simply decreased their number implying a decrease in activity without change in selectivity."
          [26] "The deactivation process, which can be evidenced by Raman spectroscopy, was difficult to observe on the NiNbO catalysts since the deactivation after testing was moderate and the change in the spectra are within the experimental precision."
          [27] "However the decrease in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry was clearly evidenced by Raman spectroscopy in the Nb/NiO and NiO-OA-3/1 compounds that suffered from stronger deactivation."
          [28] "The deactivation process may be explain by the fact that contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extrac- tion work from such surface is favored [32,35]."
          [29] "Inversely when the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry decreases, the O2 adsorption is slowed down as well as the re-oxidation and the deactivation process is auto-catalyzed."
          [30] "It is furthermore probable that the two pro- cesses could be linked to each other as the mobility of the surface species necessary to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6 should depend on the surface oxygen stoichiometry."
          [31] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
          [32] "An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL1."
          [33] "The catalysts have been characterized using various techniques allowing to show that the efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase."
          [34] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."
          [35] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."
          [36] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."
          [37] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation."
          [38] "This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."
          [39] "Attempt to regenerate the catalysts has failed."

[1] "A method for the preparation of NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites is developed, based on the slow oxi- dation of a nickel-rich NbNi gel obtained in citric acid."
          [2] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."
          [3] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."
          [4] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."
          [5] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
          [6] "The close interac- tion between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
          [7] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
          [8] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."

[1] "In this work, we report an in-depth structural characterization of pure NiO and NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts (Nb/Ni = 00.25), highly active and selective materials for ethylene production via ethane ODH, using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS)."
          [2] "It was found that low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."
          [3] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."
          [4] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."



[1] "While the literature on catalysis by doped oxide is extensive, there are very few cases in which such catalysts were studied systematically, by preparing one host oxide with a variety of dopants, by a variety of methods, and by using them for the same reaction under a variety of conditions."
          [2] "Doping with Fe increases substantially the area per gram even though the doped and the undoped oxide were prepared by the same solgel method, under identical conditions (except for the presence of the precursor for the dopant)."
          [3] "Doping with an LVD makes the reduction of the oxide more facile."
          [4] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
          [5] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
          [6] "Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."
          [7] "Zr-doped NiO behaves as calculations lead us to expect from an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide surface, just as the calculations predict."
          [8] "Doping with Ga increases the conversion, however, as the area per gram of 15GZ is 53.9 m2/g, while that of ZrO2 is 19.0 m2/g."
          [9] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
          [10] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
          [11] "The method of preparation makes a difference. Ce0.9Ni0.1O2 made by oxalate-gel coprecipitation has a conversion of 40.8%, which is much lower than that of the same composition prepared by the template-assisted method."
          [12] "The presence of a Ni vacancy creates (formally) a deficit of two electrons, which is equivalent to two holes and is believed to be responsible for the p-conductivity of the material."
          [13] "Because of these uncertainties in the accuracy of DFT, we only emphasize here the trends suggested by the calculations."
          [14] "The difficulties encountered by DFT in describing NiO correctly have been discussed by Pacchioni and Illas."
          [15] "The presence of Zr is likely to decrease ethane oxidation."
          [16] "Doping with Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."
          [17] "Doping with Zr makes the oxide less able to consume hydrogen or to release oxygen."



[1] "A series of mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratio ranging from 0 to 0.67 was prepared by the evaporation method."
          [2] "The effect of the Nb/Ni ratio on the performance of the materi- als is discussed in view of a detailed investigation of the bulk and surface properties of the oxides."
          [3] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
          [4] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
          [5] "The XRD analysis shows that pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, in agree- ment with reported data (JCPDS 4-835)."
          [6] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice in- hibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
          [7] "The reducibility of the catalysts was studied with TPR in H2."
          [8] "The introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicat- ing modification of the catalysts and contributions from differ- ent species."
          [9] "The acidity was determined by TPD after saturation of the cat- alytic surface with ammonia at 100 C."
          [10] "The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity and generates new acid sites of weak and moderate strength."
          [11] "The effect is much more pronounced if we compare, for example, pure NiO and the Ni0.9Nb0.1 catalyst,where the introduction of only 10% of Nb leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity."
          [12] "The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice con- stant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."

          [6] "The close interac- tion between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
          [7] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
          [8] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."

[1] "In this work, we report an in-depth structural characterization of pure NiO and NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts (Nb/Ni = 00.25), highly active and selective materials for ethylene production via ethane ODH, using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS)."
          [2] "It was found that low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."
          [3] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."
          [4] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."



[1] "While the literature on catalysis by doped oxide is extensive, there are very few cases in which such catalysts were studied systematically, by preparing one host oxide with a variety of dopants, by a variety of methods, and by using them for the same reaction under a variety of conditions."
          [2] "Doping with Fe increases substantially the area per gram even though the doped and the undoped oxide were prepared by the same solgel method, under identical conditions (except for the presence of the precursor for the dopant)."
          [3] "Doping with an LVD makes the reduction of the oxide more facile."
          [4] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
          [5] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
          [6] "Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."
          [7] "Zr-doped NiO behaves as calculations lead us to expect from an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide surface, just as the calculations predict."
          [8] "Doping with Ga increases the conversion, however, as the area per gram of 15GZ is 53.9 m2/g, while that of ZrO2 is 19.0 m2/g."
          [9] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
          [10] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
          [11] "The method of preparation makes a difference. Ce0.9Ni0.1O2 made by oxalate-gel coprecipitation has a conversion of 40.8%, which is much lower than that of the same composition prepared by the template-assisted method."
          [12] "The presence of a Ni vacancy creates (formally) a deficit of two electrons, which is equivalent to two holes and is believed to be responsible for the p-conductivity of the material."
          [13] "Because of these uncertainties in the accuracy of DFT, we only emphasize here the trends suggested by the calculations."
          [14] "The difficulties encountered by DFT in describing NiO correctly have been discussed by Pacchioni and Illas."
          [15] "The presence of Zr is likely to decrease ethane oxidation."
          [16] "Doping with Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."
          [17] "Doping with Zr makes the oxide less able to consume hydrogen or to release oxygen."



[1] "A series of mixed NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratio ranging from 0 to 0.67 was prepared by the evaporation method."
          [2] "The effect of the Nb/Ni ratio on the performance of the materi- als is discussed in view of a detailed investigation of the bulk and surface properties of the oxides."
          [3] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
          [4] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
          [5] "The XRD analysis shows that pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, in agree- ment with reported data (JCPDS 4-835)."
          [6] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice in- hibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
          [7] "The reducibility of the catalysts was studied with TPR in H2."
          [8] "The introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicat- ing modification of the catalysts and contributions from differ- ent species."
          [9] "The acidity was determined by TPD after saturation of the cat- alytic surface with ammonia at 100 C."
          [10] "The introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity and generates new acid sites of weak and moderate strength."
          [11] "The effect is much more pronounced if we compare, for example, pure NiO and the Ni0.9Nb0.1 catalyst,where the introduction of only 10% of Nb leads to an almost 300% increase in acidity."
          [12] "The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice con- stant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
          [13] "The surface composition of the mixed nickelniobium ox- ides was determined by XPS, because this technique has a surface-specific character and allows quantitative determina- tion of the elemental content in the upper layers of the sample."
          [14] "Electrical conductivity measurements carried out on oxide- based catalysts can provide valuable information on the nature of structural defects, the existence of oxidizing species, and so on."
          [15] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb."
          [16] "Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers."
          [17] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommo- date."
          [18] "The activity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored un- der steady-state conditions at 300425 C with a constant W/F (0.54 g s/cm3) and ethane-to-oxygen ratio (1/1)."
          [19] "The incorporation of even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO causes a 100% increase in the per weight reactivity com- pared with the pure nickel oxide."
          [20] "The most important requirement for a good ODH cata- lyst is the ability to effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature with high selectivity."
          [21] "The most prominent feature is the enormous in- crease of ethene selectivity upon incorporation of Nb, climbing from 20% for NiO to 80% for the lowest Nb content cata- lyst (Ni0.9Nb0.1)."
          [22] "The developed NiNbO cata- lysts for ethane ODH presented in this study appear to be clearly superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels (66% C2H6 con- version and 70% C2H4 selectivity at 400 C), with very stable catalytic performance."
          [23] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO accep- tor."
          [24] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene."
          [25] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."
