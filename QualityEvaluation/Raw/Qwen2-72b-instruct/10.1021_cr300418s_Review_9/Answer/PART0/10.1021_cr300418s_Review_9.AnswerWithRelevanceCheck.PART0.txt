          [1] "While the literature on catalysis by doped oxide is extensive, there are very few cases in which such catalysts were studied systematically, by preparing one host oxide with a variety of dopants, by a variety of methods, and by using them for the same reaction under a variety of conditions."
          [2] "Doping with Fe increases substantially the area per gram even though the doped and the undoped oxide were prepared by the same solgel method, under identical conditions (except for the presence of the precursor for the dopant)."
          [3] "Doping with an LVD makes the reduction of the oxide more facile."
          [4] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
          [5] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
          [6] "Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."
          [7] "Zr-doped NiO behaves as calculations lead us to expect from an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide surface, just as the calculations predict."
          [8] "Doping with Ga increases the conversion, however, as the area per gram of 15GZ is 53.9 m2/g, while that of ZrO2 is 19.0 m2/g."
          [9] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
          [10] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
          [11] "The method of preparation makes a difference. Ce0.9Ni0.1O2 made by oxalate-gel coprecipitation has a conversion of 40.8%, which is much lower than that of the same composition prepared by the template-assisted method."
          [12] "The presence of a Ni vacancy creates (formally) a deficit of two electrons, which is equivalent to two holes and is believed to be responsible for the p-conductivity of the material."
          [13] "Because of these uncertainties in the accuracy of DFT, we only emphasize here the trends suggested by the calculations."
          [14] "The difficulties encountered by DFT in describing NiO correctly have been discussed by Pacchioni and Illas."
          [15] "The presence of Zr is likely to decrease ethane oxidation."
          [16] "Doping with Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."
          [17] "Doping with Zr makes the oxide less able to consume hydrogen or to release oxygen."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doped oxides have been studied less systematically than expected, with few cases of a single host oxide being doped with various dopants and tested under different conditions for the same reaction. Doping with Fe or Zr increases the surface area per gram of the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) make the reduction of the oxide easier, potentially improving the catalyst's performance. Doping with V also increases the surface area compared to undoped TiO2. The performance of doped catalysts can vary, with some showing improved selectivity and conversion, such as Ni-doped ceria for ethylbenzene to styrene conversion. Doped NiO with Zr shows improved selectivity to ethylene, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly, which is consistent with theoretical predictions for an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Key challenges include theoretical modeling to accurately predict the effects of dopants, optimizing the process for efficiency and selectivity, and balancing safety concerns, especially when using oxygen as an oxidant in reactions like ethane to ethylene.

          镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）的催化性能有重大影响。掺杂氧化物的研究不如预期的系统，很少有单一的宿主氧化物被各种掺杂剂掺杂，并在不同的条件下用于同一反应。用Fe或Zr掺杂会增加每克催化剂的表面积，这可能增强催化活性。低价掺杂剂（LVD）使氧化物的还原更容易，可能改善催化剂的性能。用V掺杂也会增加与未掺杂的TiO2相比的表面积。掺杂催化剂的性能可能有所不同，有些显示出改进的选择性和转化率，例如Ni掺杂的CeO2用于乙苯转化为苯乙烯。用Zr掺杂的NiO显示出对乙烯的改进选择性，使氧化物的还原性降低，并更牢固地结合表面氧，这与对不可还原氧化物掺杂高价掺杂剂的理论预测一致。主要挑战包括准确预测掺杂剂影响的理论建模，优化过程以提高效率和选择性，以及在使用氧气作为氧化剂（如乙烷转化为乙烯的反应）时平衡安全问题。
