[1] "While the literature on catalysis by doped oxide is extensive, there are very few cases in which such catalysts were studied systematically, by preparing one host oxide with a variety of dopants, by a variety of methods, and by using them for the same reaction under a variety of conditions."
[2] "Doping with Fe increases substantially the area per gram even though the doped and the undoped oxide were prepared by the same solgel method, under identical conditions (except for the presence of the precursor for the dopant)."
[3] "Doping with Ga increases the conversion, however, as the area per gram of 15GZ is 53.9 m2/g, while that of ZrO2 is 19.0 m2/g."
[4] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
[5] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
[6] "The method of preparation makes a difference. Ce0.9Ni0.1O2 made by oxalate-gel coprecipitation has a conversion of 40.8%, which is much lower than that of the same composition prepared by the template-assisted method."
[7] "The presence of a Ni vacancy creates (formally) a deficit of two electrons, which is equivalent to two holes and is believed to be responsible for the p-conductivity of the material."
[8] "Because of these uncertainties in the accuracy of DFT, we only emphasize here the trends suggested by the calculations."
[9] "The difficulties encountered by DFT in describing NiO correctly have been discussed by Pacchioni and Illas."
[10] "The presence of Zr is likely to decrease ethane oxidation."
[11] "Doping with Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."
[12] "Doping with Zr makes the oxide less able to consume hydrogen or to release oxygen."

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doping with Fe, Ga, and V increases the surface area of the catalysts, which can enhance their activity. However, the performance of the catalysts also depends on the method of preparation, as seen in the case of Ce0.9Ni0.1O2, where the conversion is much lower when prepared by oxalate-gel coprecipitation compared to the template-assisted method. The presence of Ni vacancies in NiO can create holes, which are responsible for the p-conductivity of the material. Theoretical modeling using DFT has uncertainties in accurately describing NiO, but it can still suggest trends in the behavior of doped oxides. Key challenges include optimizing the process to balance efficiency, selectivity, and safety, as well as understanding the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the host oxide.
2.Theoretical modeling using DFT has uncertainties in accurately describing NiO, which can make it challenging to predict the effects of dopants and vacancies on the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts. The presence of Ni vacancies can create holes, which are responsible for the p-conductivity of the material. Doping with Zr can decrease ethane oxidation and increase the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins, making the oxide less able to consume hydrogen or release oxygen. These effects can influence the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene.
3.Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is a key challenge. Doping with Fe, Ga, and V can increase the surface area of the catalysts, potentially enhancing their activity. However, the performance of the catalysts also depends on the method of preparation, as seen in the case of Ce0.9Ni0.1O2, where the conversion is much lower when prepared by oxalate-gel coprecipitation compared to the template-assisted method. The presence of Ni vacancies in NiO can create holes, which are responsible for the p-conductivity of the material. Theoretical modeling using DFT has uncertainties in accurately describing NiO, but it can still suggest trends in the behavior of doped oxides. Optimizing the process to balance efficiency, selectivity, and safety requires a thorough understanding of the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the host oxide.

1.镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）的催化性能有显著影响。掺杂Fe、Ga和V可以增加催化剂的表面积，从而增强其活性。然而，催化剂的性能也取决于制备方法，如Ce0.9Ni0.1O2在通过草酸凝胶共沉淀制备时，其转化率远低于通过模板辅助方法制备的。NiO中Ni空位的存在可以产生空穴，这是材料p型导电性的原因。使用DFT的理论建模在准确描述NiO方面存在不确定性，但仍然可以暗示掺杂氧化物的行为趋势。主要挑战包括优化过程以平衡效率、选择性和安全性，以及理解掺杂剂、空位和宿主氧化物之间的复杂相互作用。
