[1] "While the literature on catalysis by doped oxide is extensive, there are very few cases in which such catalysts were studied systematically, by preparing one host oxide with a variety of dopants, by a variety of methods, and by using them for the same reaction under a variety of conditions."
[2] "Doping with Fe increases substantially the area per gram even though the doped and the undoped oxide were prepared by the same solgel method, under identical conditions (except for the presence of the precursor for the dopant)."
[3] "Doping with an LVD makes the reduction of the oxide more facile."
[4] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
[5] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
[6] "Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."
[7] "Zr-doped NiO behaves as calculations lead us to expect from an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide surface, just as the calculations predict."

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doped oxides have been studied less systematically than expected, with few cases of a single host oxide being doped with various dopants and tested under different conditions for the same reaction. Doping with Fe or Zr increases the surface area per gram of the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) make the reduction of the oxide easier, potentially improving the catalyst's performance. Doping with V also increases the surface area compared to undoped TiO2. The performance of doped catalysts can vary, with some showing improved selectivity and conversion, such as Ni-doped ceria for ethylbenzene to styrene conversion. Doped NiO with Zr shows improved selectivity to ethylene, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly, which is consistent with theoretical predictions for an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Key challenges include theoretical modeling to accurately predict the effects of dopants, optimizing the process for efficiency and selectivity, and balancing safety concerns, especially when using oxygen as an oxidant in reactions like ethane to ethylene.

1.镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）的催化性能有重大影响。掺杂氧化物的研究不如预期的系统，很少有单一的宿主氧化物被各种掺杂剂掺杂，并在不同的条件下用于同一反应。用Fe或Zr掺杂会增加每克催化剂的表面积，这可能增强催化活性。低价掺杂剂（LVD）使氧化物的还原更容易，可能改善催化剂的性能。用V掺杂也会增加与未掺杂的TiO2相比的表面积。掺杂催化剂的性能可能有所不同，有些显示出改进的选择性和转化率，例如Ni掺杂的CeO2用于乙苯转化为苯乙烯。用Zr掺杂的NiO显示出对乙烯的改进选择性，使氧化物的还原性降低，并更牢固地结合表面氧，这与对不可还原氧化物掺杂高价掺杂剂的理论预测一致。主要挑战包括准确预测掺杂剂影响的理论建模，优化过程以提高效率和选择性，以及在使用氧气作为氧化剂（如乙烷转化为乙烯的反应）时平衡安全问题。

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doping with Fe, Ga, and V increases the surface area of the catalysts, which can enhance their activity. However, the performance of the catalysts also depends on the method of preparation, as seen in the case of Ce0.9Ni0.1O2, where the conversion is much lower when prepared by oxalate-gel coprecipitation compared to the template-assisted method. The presence of Ni vacancies in NiO can create holes, which are responsible for the p-conductivity of the material. Theoretical modeling using DFT has uncertainties in accurately describing NiO, but it can still suggest trends in the behavior of doped oxides. Key challenges include optimizing the process to balance efficiency, selectivity, and safety, as well as understanding the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the host oxide.
2.Theoretical modeling using DFT has uncertainties in accurately describing NiO, which can make it challenging to predict the effects of dopants and vacancies on the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts. The presence of Ni vacancies can create holes, which are responsible for the p-conductivity of the material. Doping with Zr can decrease ethane oxidation and increase the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins, making the oxide less able to consume hydrogen or release oxygen. These effects can influence the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene.
3.Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is a key challenge.

Doping with Fe or V increases the surface area per gram, which can enhance catalytic activity. The presence of a low-valence dopant (LVD) facilitates the reduction of the oxide, making it a better oxidant. The performance of Ni-doped ceria catalysts can be optimized by adjusting the Ni content and the method of preparation. The method of preparation can significantly affect the catalytic performance, as demonstrated by the difference in conversion between Ce0.9Ni0.1O2 prepared by oxalate-gel coprecipitation and the template-assisted method. The presence of an LVD, such as Al, is expected to make the surface a better oxidant. Doping with Zr increases the specific area of the catalyst and improves the selectivity to ethylene, making the oxide less reducible and binding surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide surface. Doping with a small amount of Zr increases the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins.
2.Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the effects of dopants on the electronic structure and catalytic activity of nickel oxide-based catalysts. Process optimization requires a thorough understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the influence of dopant concentration and preparation method on catalyst performance. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involves optimizing reaction conditions to maximize conversion and selectivity while minimizing the risk of explosion and fire, especially when using oxygen as an oxidant.

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doped oxides have been studied less systematically than undoped oxides, but the available data suggest that doping can increase the surface area of the catalyst, which can lead to higher catalytic activity. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) make the reduction of the oxide easier, which can affect the reactivity of the oxygen atoms on the surface. High-valence dopants (HVDs) increase the binding energy of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the oxide surface, making them less reactive and potentially improving selectivity. However, the presence of dopants can also lead to the formation of new phases, which may not have the desired catalytic properties. Theoretical modeling of these systems is challenging due to the complex interplay between the dopant, the host oxide, and the reaction conditions. Process optimization requires careful consideration of the trade-offs between efficiency, selectivity, and safety, as aggressive oxidants like oxygen can react with the desired product, reducing selectivity, and the danger of explosion and fire limits the oxygen/hydrocarbon ratios that can be used.

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doping with Fe or Zr increases the surface area per gram of the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity. The reduction of the oxide is made easier by doping with a low-valence dopant (LVD), which can improve the catalyst's ability to break CH bonds. Doping with V also increases the surface area per gram compared to TiO2 prepared by the same method. The best catalyst for ethylbenzene conversion to styrene is Ni0.1Ce0.9O2, which achieves high conversion and selectivity under specific conditions. Doping with Zr increases the specific area of NiO, but it also makes the oxide less able to consume hydrogen or release oxygen, which may limit the reactivity of the doped oxide with ethylene, potentially leading to a gain in selectivity at the expense of conversion.
2.Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately describing the electronic structure of doped oxides and predicting the effects of dopants on catalytic performance.
