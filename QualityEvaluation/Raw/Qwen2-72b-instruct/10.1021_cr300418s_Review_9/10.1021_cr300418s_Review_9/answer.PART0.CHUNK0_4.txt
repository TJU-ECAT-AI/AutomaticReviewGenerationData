[1] "While the literature on catalysis by doped oxide is extensive, there are very few cases in which such catalysts were studied systematically, by preparing one host oxide with a variety of dopants, by a variety of methods, and by using them for the same reaction under a variety of conditions."
[2] "Doping with Fe increases substantially the area per gram even though the doped and the undoped oxide were prepared by the same solgel method, under identical conditions (except for the presence of the precursor for the dopant)."
[3] "Doping with an LVD makes the reduction of the oxide more facile."
[4] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
[5] "The best catalyst in this group is Ni0.1Ce0.9O2, which gives an ethylbenzene conversion of 70% and a selectivity to styrene of 75%, at a temperature of 450 C, O2/ethylbenzene ratio = 0.8, and space velocity = 250 mL/gcat/min."
[6] "Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."
[7] "Doping with Zr makes the oxide less able to consume hydrogen or to release oxygen."
[8] "The presence of Zr should make this reaction more difficult. This is not necessarily bad, because Zr will also limit the reactivity of the doped oxide with ethylene: a loss in conversion may be a gain in selectivity."

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doping with Fe or Zr increases the surface area per gram of the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity. The reduction of the oxide is made easier by doping with a low-valence dopant (LVD), which can improve the catalyst's ability to break CH bonds. Doping with V also increases the surface area per gram compared to TiO2 prepared by the same method. The best catalyst for ethylbenzene conversion to styrene is Ni0.1Ce0.9O2, which achieves high conversion and selectivity under specific conditions. Doping with Zr increases the specific area of NiO, but it also makes the oxide less able to consume hydrogen or release oxygen, which may limit the reactivity of the doped oxide with ethylene, potentially leading to a gain in selectivity at the expense of conversion.
2.Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately describing the electronic structure of doped oxides and predicting the effects of dopants on catalytic performance. Process optimization requires careful consideration of dopant concentration, preparation method, and reaction conditions to balance efficiency, selectivity, and safety. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems is crucial for achieving high conversion and selectivity while minimizing the risk of explosion and fire, especially when using oxygen as an oxidant.

1.镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯)的催化性能有重大影响。Fe或Zr的掺杂增加了每克催化剂的表面积,这可以增强催化活性。低价掺杂剂(LVD)的掺杂使氧化物的还原变得更容易,这可以提高催化剂分解CH键的能力。V的掺杂也增加了与相同方法制备的TiO2相比的每克表面积。乙苯转化为苯乙烯的最佳催化剂是Ni0.1Ce0.9O2,在特定条件下可实现高转化率和选择性。Zr的掺杂增加了NiO的特定面积,但也使氧化物消耗氢或释放氧的能力降低,这可能限制了掺杂氧化物与乙烯的反应性,可能以转化率为代价,选择性有所提高。
2.理论建模的关键挑战包括准确描述掺杂氧化物的电子结构和预测掺杂剂对催化性能的影响。过程优化需要仔细考虑掺杂浓度、制备方法和反应条件,以平衡效率、选择性和安全性。在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性对于实现高转化率和选择性至关重要,同时最小化使用氧气作为氧化剂时爆炸和火灾的风险。
