[1] "While the literature on catalysis by doped oxide is extensive, there are very few cases in which such catalysts were studied systematically, by preparing one host oxide with a variety of dopants, by a variety of methods, and by using them for the same reaction under a variety of conditions."
[2] "Doping with Fe increases substantially the area per gram even though the doped and the undoped oxide were prepared by the same solgel method, under identical conditions (except for the presence of the precursor for the dopant)."
[3] "Doping with an LVD makes the reduction of the oxide more facile."
[4] "Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method."
[5] "The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower."
[6] "Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."
[7] "Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide, just as the calculations predict."

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doped oxides have been studied less systematically than undoped oxides, but the available data suggest that doping can increase the surface area of the catalyst, which can lead to higher catalytic activity. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) make the reduction of the oxide easier, which can affect the reactivity of the oxygen atoms on the surface. High-valence dopants (HVDs) increase the binding energy of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the oxide surface, making them less reactive and potentially improving selectivity. However, the presence of dopants can also lead to the formation of new phases, which may not have the desired catalytic properties. Theoretical modeling of these systems is challenging due to the complex interplay between the dopant, the host oxide, and the reaction conditions. Process optimization requires careful consideration of the trade-offs between efficiency, selectivity, and safety, as aggressive oxidants like oxygen can react with the desired product, reducing selectivity, and the danger of explosion and fire limits the oxygen/hydrocarbon ratios that can be used.

1.镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）的催化性能有重大影响。掺杂氧化物的研究不如未掺杂氧化物系统，但现有数据表明，掺杂可以增加催化剂的表面积，从而提高催化活性。低价掺杂剂（LVD）使氧化物的还原更容易，这可能影响表面氧原子的反应性。高价掺杂剂（HVD）增加了邻近氧原子与氧化物表面的结合能，使它们的反应性降低，从而可能提高选择性。然而，掺杂剂的存在也可能导致新相的形成，这些相可能不具备所需的催化性能。这些系统的理论建模由于掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和反应条件之间的复杂相互作用而具有挑战性。过程优化需要仔细考虑效率、选择性和安全性之间的权衡，因为像氧气这样的强氧化剂可以与所需产品反应，降低选择性，而爆炸和火灾的危险限制了可以使用的氧/碳氢化合物比。
