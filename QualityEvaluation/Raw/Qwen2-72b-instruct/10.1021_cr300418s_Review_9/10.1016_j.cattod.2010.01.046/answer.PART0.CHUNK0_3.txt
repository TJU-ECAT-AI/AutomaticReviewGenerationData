1.The literature does not provide information on how preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on the selective oxidation of C2C4 alkanes on MoVTeNb mixed oxide catalysts and does not discuss nickel oxide-based catalysts or their application in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. It also does not address the challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.

1.文献没有提供关于制备方法、掺杂浓度和镍氧化物基催化剂中空位形成如何影响其在氧化脱氢反应(如乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯)中的电子结构和催化性能的信息。该文件专注于MoVTeNb混合氧化物催化剂上C2C4烷烃的选择性氧化,并未讨论镍氧化物基催化剂及其在乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯的氧化脱氢反应中的应用。它也没有涉及这些催化系统中理论建模、过程优化以及效率、选择性和安全性平衡的挑战。
