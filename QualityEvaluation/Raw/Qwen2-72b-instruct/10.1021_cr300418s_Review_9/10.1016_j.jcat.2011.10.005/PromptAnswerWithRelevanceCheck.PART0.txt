[1] "A method for the preparation of NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites is developed, based on the slow oxi- dation of a nickel-rich NbNi gel obtained in citric acid."
[2] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."
[3] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."
[4] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."
[5] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
[6] "The close interac- tion between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."

1.The preparation methods for nickel oxide-based catalysts, including the use of citric acid to form a nickel-rich gel, can influence the electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of niobium dopants at concentrations greater than 3 atomic percent leads to the formation of an amorphous thin layer of niobium-rich mixed oxide, which affects the redox properties of the nanocomposites. This layer limits the size of nickel oxide crystallites and inhibits the reducibility of NiO, impacting the activity and selectivity of the catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. At niobium contents above 5 atomic percent, the catalysts become less active but more selective, suggesting that the niobium-rich phase covers some of the non-stoichiometric active oxygen species on the nickel oxide surface. The interaction between NiO and the niobium-rich layer, along with possible restructuring under oxidative dehydrogenation conditions, can lead to catalyst deactivation at high niobium loadings. The key challenges in theoretical modeling include understanding the complex interplay between the dopant concentration, vacancy formation, and the electronic structure of the catalysts. Process optimization requires balancing the efficiency, selectivity, and safety of these catalytic systems, particularly in the context of ethane to ethylene conversion.

1.镍基催化剂的制备方法，包括使用柠檬酸形成富镍凝胶，可以影响氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。当铌掺杂浓度大于3原子百分比时，会形成一层铌富集的无定形混合氧化物层，影响纳米复合材料的氧化还原性质。这层铌富集的混合氧化物限制了镍氧化物晶粒的大小，抑制了NiO的还原性，影响了乙烷氧化脱氢的活性和选择性。当铌含量超过5原子百分比时，催化剂活性降低但选择性提高，表明铌富集相覆盖了镍氧化物表面的部分非化学计量活性氧物种。NiO与铌富集层之间的相互作用，以及在氧化脱氢条件下可能的重构，会导致高铌负载下催化剂的失活。理论建模的关键挑战包括理解掺杂浓度、空位形成与催化剂电子结构之间的复杂相互作用。过程优化需要在这些催化体系的效率、选择性和安全性之间取得平衡，特别是在乙烷转化为乙烯的背景下。

1.The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts, including the use of citric acid to form a nickel-rich NbNi gel, have a significant impact on the electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of niobium in the catalysts leads to the formation of an amorphous thin layer of a niobium-rich mixed oxide, which limits the size of NiO crystallites and inhibits the reducibility of NiO. This results in a decrease in activity but an increase in selectivity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation at high Nb loadings. The most efficient catalysts are those containing 3-4 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability. Theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems remain key challenges.

1.镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法，如在柠檬酸中获得的镍丰富的NbNi凝胶的缓慢氧化，可以影响它们在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。铌富集的混合氧化物薄层的存在可以限制NiO晶粒的大小，抑制NiO的还原性，影响催化剂的氧化还原性质。在高Nb负载下，催化剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的活性降低，但选择性提高，表明铌富集相可能覆盖了NiO中非选择性、非化学计量的活性氧物种的一部分。NiO和铌富集的混合氧化物层之间的相互作用，在氧化脱氢条件下，可导致催化剂显著失活。通过这种方法获得的最有效的氧化脱氢催化剂是那些含有34 at.% Nb的催化剂，它们结合了高活性、选择性和稳定性。制备方法对NbNiO纳米复合材料的结构和催化性能的影响表明，通过优化催化剂，可以期待NiO催化的乙烷氧化脱氢有进一步的改善。

1.制备方法、掺杂浓度和镍氧化物基催化剂中的空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙基苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯)的催化性能有显著影响。这些纳米氧化物在低温下对乙烷氧化脱氢的活性与其氧化还原性质有关。Nb富集相的存在抑制了NiO的还原性,导致在Nb含量>5 at.%时,催化剂对乙烷ODH的活性降低,但选择性提高。NiO与薄的Nb富集混合氧化层之间的紧密相互作用,加上在ODH条件下可能的纳米复合材料的重构,导致在高Nb负载下催化剂显著失活。通过这种方法获得的最有效的ODH催化剂是那些含有34 at.% Nb的催化剂,它们结合了高活性、选择性和稳定性。制备方法对NbNiO纳米复合材料的结构和催化性能的影响表明,在优化催化剂后,可以期待NiO催化乙烷ODH的进一步改进。
