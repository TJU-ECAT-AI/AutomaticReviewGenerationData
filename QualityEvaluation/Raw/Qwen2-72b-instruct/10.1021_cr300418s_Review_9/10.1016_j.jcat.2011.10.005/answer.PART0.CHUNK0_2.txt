[1] "A method for the preparation of NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites is developed, based on the slow oxi- dation of a nickel-rich NbNi gel obtained in citric acid."
[2] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."
[3] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."
[4] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."
[5] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
[6] "The close interac- tion between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
[7] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
[8] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."

1.The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts, such as the slow oxidation of a nickel-rich NbNi gel obtained in citric acid, can influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of a thin layer of a niobium-rich mixed oxide can limit the size of NiO crystallites and inhibit NiO reducibility, affecting the redox properties of the catalysts. At high Nb loadings, the catalysts become less active for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation but more selective, suggesting that the Nb-rich phase may cover part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO. The interaction between NiO and the Nb-rich mixed oxide layer can lead to significant catalyst deactivation under oxidative dehydrogenation conditions. The most efficient oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability. The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane oxidative dehydrogenation can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst.

1.镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法，如在柠檬酸中获得的镍丰富的NbNi凝胶的缓慢氧化，可以影响它们在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。铌富集的混合氧化物薄层的存在可以限制NiO晶粒的大小，抑制NiO的还原性，影响催化剂的氧化还原性质。在高Nb负载下，催化剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的活性降低，但选择性提高，表明铌富集相可能覆盖了NiO中非选择性、非化学计量的活性氧物种的一部分。NiO和铌富集的混合氧化物层之间的相互作用，在氧化脱氢条件下，可导致催化剂显著失活。通过这种方法获得的最有效的氧化脱氢催化剂是那些含有34 at.% Nb的催化剂，它们结合了高活性、选择性和稳定性。制备方法对NbNiO纳米复合材料的结构和催化性能的影响表明，通过优化催化剂，可以期待NiO催化的乙烷氧化脱氢有进一步的改善。
