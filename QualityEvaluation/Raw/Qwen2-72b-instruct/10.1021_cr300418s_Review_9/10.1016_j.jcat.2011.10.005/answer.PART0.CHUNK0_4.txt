[1] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility. At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
[2] "The close interac- tion between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
[3] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
[4] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts have a significant influence on their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation is related to their redox properties. The presence of the Nb-rich phase inhibits NiO reducibility, leading to less active but more selective catalysts for ethane ODH at Nb content >5 at.%. The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings. The most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability. The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst.

1.制备方法、掺杂浓度和镍氧化物基催化剂中的空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙基苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯)的催化性能有显著影响。这些纳米氧化物在低温下对乙烷氧化脱氢的活性与其氧化还原性质有关。Nb富集相的存在抑制了NiO的还原性,导致在Nb含量>5 at.%时,催化剂对乙烷ODH的活性降低,但选择性提高。NiO与薄的Nb富集混合氧化层之间的紧密相互作用,加上在ODH条件下可能的纳米复合材料的重构,导致在高Nb负载下催化剂显著失活。通过这种方法获得的最有效的ODH催化剂是那些含有34 at.% Nb的催化剂,它们结合了高活性、选择性和稳定性。制备方法对NbNiO纳米复合材料的结构和催化性能的影响表明,在优化催化剂后,可以期待NiO催化乙烷ODH的进一步改进。
