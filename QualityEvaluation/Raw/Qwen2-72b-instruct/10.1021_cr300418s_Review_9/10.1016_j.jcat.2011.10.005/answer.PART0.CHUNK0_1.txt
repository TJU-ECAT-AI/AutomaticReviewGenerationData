[1] "A method for the preparation of NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites is developed, based on the slow oxi- dation of a nickel-rich NbNi gel obtained in citric acid."
[2] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."
[3] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."
[4] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."
[5] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
[6] "The close interac- tion between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
[7] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
[8] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."

1.The preparation methods of nickel oxide-based catalysts, including the use of citric acid to form a nickel-rich NbNi gel, have a significant impact on the electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of niobium in the catalysts leads to the formation of an amorphous thin layer of a niobium-rich mixed oxide, which limits the size of NiO crystallites and inhibits the reducibility of NiO. This results in a decrease in activity but an increase in selectivity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation at high Nb loadings. The most efficient catalysts are those containing 3-4 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability. Theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems remain key challenges.

1.镍基催化剂的制备方法，包括使用柠檬酸形成富镍的NbNi凝胶，对氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能有重大影响。铌的存在导致形成一层富含铌的混合氧化物的无定形薄层，这限制了NiO晶粒的大小，抑制了NiO的还原性。这导致活性降低，但选择性在高Nb负载下增加。最有效的催化剂是那些含有3-4 at.% Nb的催化剂，它们结合了高活性、选择性和稳定性。理论建模、过程优化以及在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性仍然是主要挑战。
