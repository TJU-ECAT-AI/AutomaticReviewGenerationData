[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[2] "An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL1."
[3] "The catalysts have been characterized using various techniques allowing to show that the efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase."
[4] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."
[5] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."
[6] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."
[7] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation."
[8] "This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."
[9] "Attempt to regenerate the catalysts has failed."

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents have been studied for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% selectivity to ethylene was achieved for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% Nb at 350 C. The efficiency of the catalysts is related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase. The thermal decomposition of oxalate ions, present due to the use of ammonium oxalato niobate as the niobium precursor, reduces the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, influencing catalytic properties. A small percentage of Nb is necessary for these effects, and the optimal activity observed for 15% Nb is related to the decrease in active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which prevents sintering of the active phase particles. Above 15% Nb, the amorphous phase reacts with nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6. Long-term studies show that NiNbO catalysts undergo slow but systematic deactivation, attributed to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and the formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase at the catalytic reaction temperature. Attempts to regenerate the catalysts have failed. Key challenges include theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.

1.镍铌氧化物催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对基于镍氧化物的催化剂的电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙烷至乙烯)的催化性能有重大影响。研究了不同铌含量的NiNbO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的应用。在350°C下,含有15%Nb的NiNbO催化剂实现了33%的乙烷转化率和78%的乙烯选择性。催化剂的效率与NiO活性相和无定形Nb2O5相之间的表面相互作用有关。由于使用了铌酸铵草酸盐作为铌前体,草酸盐离子的存在导致NiO过氧化物含量的热分解,从而影响催化性能。只需要少量的Nb就能产生这些效果,而15%Nb时观察到的最佳活性与无定形Nb2O5相引起的活性相粒径减小有关,该相防止了催化剂前体热转化过程中活性相颗粒的烧结。超过15%的Nb,无定形相与氧化镍反应,形成不活跃的混合铌镍氧化物相NiNb2O6。长期研究表明,NiNbO催化剂经历了缓慢但系统的失活,归因于NiO过氧化物含量在反应条件下的连续减少和NiNb2O6相在催化反应温度下热力学稳定的形成。尝试再生催化剂失败了。主要挑战包括理论建模、过程优化以及在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性。
