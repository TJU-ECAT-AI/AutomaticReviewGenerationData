Abstract
SnO2–ZrO2 nanocomposite catalysts with different compositions ranging from 0 to 100% of SnO2 were prepared at room temperature by co-
precipitation method using aqueous ammonia as a hydrolyzing agent. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopic characterization
revealed the SnO2–ZrO2 nanocomposite behavior. Acid–base properties of these catalysts were ascertained by temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2. Both acidic and basic sites distribution of the nanocomposite catalysts is quite different from those of
respective single oxides (SnO2 or ZrO2). Catalytic activity of these nanocomposite catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation (EBD) to styrene in
the presence of excess CO2 was evaluated. The change in the acid–base bi-functionality of the nanocomposite catalysts in comparison with single
oxides had profound positive inﬂuence in enhancing the catalytic activity.

1. Introduction
Styrene is one of the important commodity chemicals in the
petrochemical industry for the production of polystyrene,
expandable polystyrene, styrene–butadiene rubber, styrene–
butadiene latex and so forth. Based on its wider applications,
the demand of styrene has continuously been increasing. The
production demand of styrene exceeded 24 million metric tons
per annum, of which, more than 90% of its production is from
the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over potassium-
doped iron oxide catalysts in the presence of excess steam [1,2].
The present commercial process is highly endothermic and
volume expanding hence, a large amount of superheated steam
has been under use to supply heat, to lower the partial pressure
of the product mixture, and to avoid the formation of carbon
deposits. However at the gas–liquid separator a large amount of
latent heat of steam is being wasted [3]. Consequently, the
estimated hike in production cost is about 10% and in addition,
development of hotspots, diminishing of catalysts life are
inevitable. Among the alternative processes, production of
styrene monomer along with propylene oxide is also one of the
important processes, wherein ethylbenzene is converted into
ethylbenzene hydroperoxide in the presence of oxidizing agents
such as hydrogen peroxide or molecular oxygen. Further
conversion of ethylbenzene hydroperoxide with propylene
leads to propylene oxide and 1-phenyl ethanol. 1-Phenyl
ethanol on dehydration produces styrene monomer. In this
process styrene production depends on the demand of
propylene oxide along with other inevitable problems [4].
The next alternative is the membrane technology, wherein (i)
manufacture of highly permeable and resistive membrane, (ii)
highly efﬁcient catalyst and (iii) the design of suitable rector are
the major constraints [5]. Alternatively, several technological
advancements
have
been
emerging
recently,
of
which,
oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 instead
of steam has been under intensive investigation [6–13].
However, the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene process with
CO2 is still in the laboratory scale due to lack of suitable
catalysts, which motivated us to explore the possibility of CO2
utilization on different catalytic systems.
Of late, we have studied the oxidative dehydrogenation of
ethylbenzene with CO2 using ZrO2 as a catalyst and found that

the acidic and basic sites are indispensable requirement [14].
Latter on, the study has been extended to ZrO2-based mixed
oxide catalysts [15–18]. MnO2–ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts
prepared by co-precipitation method exhibited substantial
enhancement in the acid–base bi-functionality, which led to
higher conversion of ethylbenzene and higher selectivity of
styrene in the presence of CO2 [15]. Similar catalytic behavior
has been observed in the case of TiO2–ZrO2 mixed oxide
catalysts [16]. In both of these catalytic systems, the common
observation is that the enhanced acidic and basic sites
cooperatively activated CO2 as well as ethylbenzene under
the reaction conditions. In another attempt, CeO2–ZrO2 mixed
oxide supported SBA-15 catalyst system has been used as a
catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into
styrene with CO2 [17]. The high performance of this system
depends on two factors: (i) enhancement in acid–base bi-
functionality and (ii) ﬁne dispersion of CeO2–ZrO2 mixed
oxide on the support surface. The above results reveal that the
mixed oxides are superior to their isolated oxides for the
conversion of ethylbenzene in the presence of CO2 and also
smaller particles have superior activity to larger particles.
Accordingly, in the present study, SnO2–ZrO2 mixed oxide
nanocomposite catalysts preparation, characterization and
catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to
styrene in the presence of CO2 have been elucidated and
furthermore, similar catalytic system has not yet been reported.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the catalysts
The preparation of SnO2–ZrO2 nanocomposite catalysts is
based on the co-precipitation method by governing the
nucleation and growth process using diluted metal precursor
salts. In this synthetic procedure, both the component oxides are
mutually contributing for hastening of nucleation and prevention
of particle growth. A series of SnO2–ZrO2 nanocomposite
catalysts were prepared in the full range from 0 to 100% of SnO2.
In a typical preparation, 0.1 M mixed aqueous nitrate or chloride
precursor salts solution of each component were prepared under
vigorous mechanical stirring at room temperature. Prior to
hydrolysis, stirring was continuedfora periodof 1 h to ensure the
formation of homogeneous mixed salt solution. Aqueous
ammonium hydroxide solution was added drop wise in a
controlled manner in a stretch of 1 h under vigorous stirring until
the attainment of required pH (8–9). The stirring was continued
for further 2 h and allowed it for 12 h aging at room temperature.
The precipitated mixed gel was separated by centrifugation. The
mixed hydroxide gel was dried at 100 8C for 12 h and calcined it
at 600 8C for 8 h in a mufﬂe furnace in air atmosphere. The
catalysts were coded based on the molar percentages. For
example 100% SnO2 catalyst is coded as Sn10Zr0, 100% ZrO2 is
coded as Sn0Zr10 and 10% SnO2 + 90% ZrO2 mixed oxide
nanocompositecatalystisdenoted as Sn1Zr9,similar pattern was
adopted in coding the other catalysts.
A semi-quantitative portable XRF analyzer (Xmet-300,
Oxford, UK) is used to estimate the elemental analysis. Inbuilt
software directly gives the composition of the elements in
weight percent. The weight % of Sn and Zr are converted into
mole% assuming 100% yields of SnO2 and ZrO2 instead of 99.8
and 98.6, respectively. Small amounts of Hf and Fe are found as
impurities in ZrO2. Similarly, a small amount of Fe is present as
impurity in SnO2.
2.2. Characterization of the catalysts
X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out using Rigaku X-
ray diffractometer, model D/max-2200/PC, equipped with a
graphite monochromator and Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.5405 A
˚ )
in the 2u (2 theta) range of 10–808 at a scan speed of 0.5 s, at
40 kV voltage and 20 mA current.
The
size,
and
organization
behavior
of
SnO2–ZrO2
nanocomposite catalysts were determined by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) using a Philips 420 transmission
electron microscope (TEM) operated at 120 kV and a JEOL-
20l0F
high-resolution
transmission
electron
microscope
(HRTEM) operated at 200 kV. A small amount of the sample
was dispersed in absolute ethanol by sonication, and then a drop
of this solution was deposited on an amorphous carbon ﬁlm on
300 mesh Cu grid for TEM observation.
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) studies were
made using an adsorption unit (Chemisorb-2705) supplied by
Micromeritics, USA. The acidity and basicity of the catalysts
were determined by TPD of NH3 and CO2, respectively. In a
typical experiment, c.a 50 mg catalyst sample was pretreated in
ﬂowing helium gas at 500 8C for 1 h and allowed it to cool up to
100 8C and at this temperature the pretreated catalyst was
exposed to either 5% NH3 in helium or 10% CO2 in helium gas
mixture with a ﬂow rate of 20 ml/min for 30 min and
subsequently the adsorbed NH3 was purged with helium gas
at 100 8C for 1 h to remove the physisorbed NH3 or CO2. The
chemisorbed amount of either NH3 or CO2 was measured in
ﬂowing helium gas with the ﬂow rate of 20 ml/min from 100 to
825 8C with the heating rate of 5 8C/min.
2.3. Catalytic performance tests
The catalytic activity studies were performed in a ﬁxed bed
down ﬂow stainless steel reactor (i.d. 4.5 mm and length
300 mm) under atmospheric pressure. In a typical experiment,
approximately 1.0 g of the catalyst sample was loaded with the
support
of
quartz
wool
and
subjected
to
the
catalyst
pretreatment at 600 8C for 0.5 h in the ﬂow of N2 (20 ml/
min). After the completion of the pretreatment, the reaction was
conducted at different temperatures either in the ﬂow of N2 or
CO2. Ethylbenzene was introduced by a peristaltic pump with a
feed rate of 8.2 mmol/h along with either CO2 or N2. Products
were analyzed by a gas chromatogram (Younglin Instrument,
Acme 6000 series, Korea) equipped with TCD and FID.
3. Results and discussion
The molar composition of SnO2 and ZrO2 in the SnO2–ZrO2
nanocomposite catalysts was
obtained approximately as
D.R. Burri et al. / Catalysis Today 131 (2008) 173–178
174
calculated based on the yield of the catalysts. The composition
of the catalyst was also estimated by XRF and displayed in
Table 1. The molar composition (during the preparation step) of
the catalysts was given in the code name and the composition of
the catalysts obtained by XRF was shown in Table 1.
It is clear from Table 1 that the composition of the catalysts
determined by experiment was close to that of taken in the
preparation step. Hence, both SnO2 and ZrO2 might be
precipitated simultaneously during the preparation.
The XRD patterns of SnO2–ZrO2 binary mixed metal oxide
nanocomposites, SnO2 (Sn10Zr0) and ZrO2 (Sn0Zr10) were
depicted in Fig. 1. Sn0Zr10 nanocatalyst exhibited sharp
diffraction peaks at 2u = 24.1(1 1 0), 28.1(1 1 1), 31.3(1 1 1),
34.1(2 0 0) and 50.2(0 2 2), which are well consistent with the
monoclinic phase of ZrO2 according to the ICDD No. 37-1484.
No other crystalline phases of ZrO2 have been observed. The
diffraction lines of Sn10Zr0 are centered at 2u = 26.7(1 1 0),
33.9(1 0 1), 37.9(2 0 0), 51.8(2 1 1) 54.8(2 2 0) and 62.0(3 1 0)
are well matched with the rutile cassiterite phase of SnO2
(JCPDS 41-1445). Both monoclinic phase of ZrO2 and
cassiterite phase of SnO2 were present in the nanocomposite
catalysts containing 10–40% of SnO2 content, i.e. Sn1Zr9,
Sn1.5Zr8.5, Sn2Zr8, Sn3Zr7 and Sn4Zr6 catalysts.
When the content of SnO2 increased to 50% the XRD pattern
is completely different from the ZrO2-rich nanocomposite
catalysts. Fifty to 90% of SnO2 content nanocomposite
catalysts exhibited only cassiterite phase of SnO2. No
signiﬁcant ZrO2 XRD reﬂections were noticed from 50 to
90% SnO2 content nanocomposites. XRD results of Sn5Zr5,
Sn6Zr4, Sn7Zr3, Sn8Zr2 and Sn9Zr1 nanocomposite catalysts
suggest two possibilities. The ﬁrst one is the formation of
single-phase solid solution between SnO2 and ZrO2 as reported
by Ba et al. similar to indium–tin system [19]. The second
possibility is the separation of amorphous phase of ZrO2 from
the crystalline phase of SnO2. The XRD reﬂections of all the
nanocomposite catalysts were broad and less intense, which is
an indication of the formation of nanosized crystallites [20].
As
a
representative
example,
TEM
micrographs
of
Sn1.5Zr8.5 are shown in Fig. 2. An overview image (Fig. 2)
illustrates both individual particles and agglomerates. A closer
view on the area with well-dispersed particles demonstrates that
the particle size distribution is in the range of 10–15 nm
(Fig. 3). The particles are not only characterized by a relatively
narrow particle size distribution but also exhibit nearly
spherical and uniform particle morphology.
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 gives
the information about the strength and number of acid sites
present in the catalysts. TPD of NH3 patterns of pure Sn10Zr0,
Sn0Zr10 and Sn1.5Zr8.5 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. It is
interesting to see that the reducible SnO2 has a high-
temperature signal (Tmax  525 8C) while the irreducible

ZrO2 has a low-temperature signal (Tmax  200 8C). The high-
temperature signal signiﬁes the presence of strong acidic sites
and the low-temperature signal indicates the presence of
moderate acidic sites. Thus, Sn10Zr0 contains large number of
strong acid sites and a very few moderate acid sites
(Tmax  200 8C). On the other hand Sn0Zr10 contains good
number of moderate acid sites and a very few strong acid sites
(Tmax  400, 575 and >600 8C). The signal intensities clearly
indicate that the total acidity of Sn0Zr10 is less than that of
Sn10Zr0. The TPD of NH3 pattern of Sn1.5Zr8.5 catalyst
exhibits the characteristic features of both SnO2 and ZrO2.
However, it is surprising to see the more intense low-
temperature signal (Tmax  225 8C) than the high-temperature
signal (Tmax  525 8C). Also one can observe a slight shifting
of low-temperature signal to higher side when compared to that
of Sn0Zr10. This is a clear indication of the synergistic effect
between SnO2 and ZrO2.
The interaction between the two oxides results in a
signiﬁcantly greater surface acidity than that of the single
component oxides. As reported in the literature [21], the
generation of acidic sites in the mixed oxides is due to the
development of negative or positive charge in the model
structure. When two transition metals are bonded (M1–O–M2),
charge imbalance arises due to electronegativity difference of the
contributing two transition metals (M1 and M2), consequently
new acidic sites with different strengths will be generated. It is
also quite possible that as the transition metal oxide particle size
decreases, the numbers of surface oxygen anion vacancies
increases, hence new and stronger acid sites are created, with the
particles of smallest diameter having the strongest acidity [22].
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2 gives
information about the strength and number of basic sites
present in the catalysts. TPD of CO2 patterns of pure Sn10Zr0,
Sn0Zr10 and Sn1.5Zr8.5 catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. TPD of
Fig. 3. HRTEM images of Sn1.5Zr8 catalyst at (a) 5 nm and (b) 10 nm

CO2 pattern of Sn10Zr0 shows the presence of high intense
high-temperature signal (Tmax  550 8C) due to strong basic
sites and low intense low-temperature signal (Tmax  200 8C)
due to weak basic sites. On the other hand, TPD of CO2 pattern
of Sn0Zr10 shows two temperature maxima with more low
intense low-temperature signal. The one at a Tmax of 200 8C is
due to the presence of weak basic sites and other at a Tmax of
750 8C is due to the presence of very strong basic sites. The
CO2 TPD pattern of Sn1.5Zr8.5 shows the presence of more or
less equal intensities of two temperature maxima one at
200 8C and the other at a Tmax of 600 8C. Thus the Sn1.5Zr8.5
catalyst contains the characteristic features of both Sn10Zr0
and Sn0Zr10. The shifting of high-temperature signal to lower
temperature compared to that of Sn0Zr10 is again due to the
synergistic effect between these two oxides. The acid–base
properties of ZrO2–SnO2 with different compositions calcined
at different temperatures have been reported are more or less
similar to cited literature report [23].
As documented in the literature, the dehydrogenation of
ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of CO2 has beneﬁcial
effects than those of inert carriers and steam [6–18]. The
beneﬁcial role of CO2 as a carrier gas and as a mild oxidant has
been proved on the SnO2–ZrO2 nanocomposite catalyst for the
selective conversion of ethylbenzene to styrene with enhanced
activity. The catalytic activity behavior with and with out CO2
has been displayed in Fig. 6. It is clear that there is a clear
demarcation in the activity pattern in the presence and absence
of CO2. The higher activity of the catalyst in the presence of
CO2 is believed to be release of equilibrium limitation through
coupling of reverse water gas shift reaction with simple
dehydrogenation. Hydrogen that produced in the simple
dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (C6H5–CH2–CH3 ! C6H5–
CH2 CH2 + H2) is oxidized when coupled with reverse water
gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 ! CO + H2O) and there by
releases the equilibrium limitation to get higher conversion
of ethylbenzene.
Since CO2 has profound inﬂuence on the catalytic activity of
SnO2–ZrO2 for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to
styrene, the optimization of the catalyst composition, reaction
temperature and activity of the best catalyst has been compared
with single oxides (SnO2 and ZrO2) in the presence of CO2.
The conversion of ethylbenzene over different compositions
of SnO2–ZrO2 nanocomposite catalysts with time on stream has
been depicted in Fig. 7. The catalytic activity in terms of
ethylbenzene conversion over Sn0.5Zr95.5 catalyst is very
poor. When SnO2 content increased from 5 to 10% (Sn1Zr9) the
conversion of ethylbenzene has drastically increased and at
15% SnO2 content catalyst (Sn1.5Zr8.5) the conversion is 61%.
Further enhancement in the SnO2 content from 20 to 80%, the
diminishing trend in the conversion of ethylbenzene has been
noticed. In spite of low activity of these catalysts (Sn2Zr8 to
Sn8Zr2), the time on stream study represent a continuous
enhancement in the conversion of ethylbenzene from 2 to 8 h.
In the case of Sn1Zr9 and Sn1.5Zr8.5 catalysts, there has been
marginal decrease in the conversion of ethylbenzene with time
on stream. However, based on the available reaction data the
optimum catalyst is Sn1.5Zr8.5 (from XRF data Sn = 13.4%
and Zr = 86.6%).
In order to elucidate the catalytic behavior of SnO2–ZrO2
nanocomposite catalysts the catalytic activity of Sn1.5Zr8.5
catalyst has been compared with its constituent oxide catalysts
(Fig. 8). The conversion of ethylbenzene over bulk SnO2
(Sn10Zr0) is only 20.6% with the styrene selectivity of 96%
and on bulk ZrO2 (Sn0Zr10) the conversion is 48.8% with the
styrene selectivity of 97%, whereas over Sn1.5Zr8.5 nano-
composite catalyst the conversion is 61.1% with 98% styrene
selectivity. The superior performance of Sn1.5Zr8.5 nanocom-
posite catalyst is not surprising. This type of peculiar character
of mixed oxides such as TiO2–ZrO2, MnO2–ZrO2, CeO2–ZrO2
have already been reported for the dehydrogenation of
ethylbenzene in our earlier reports [15–18]. The peculiarity
in the acid–base properties can be seen from Figs. 4 and 5. In
the best catalyst (Sn1.5Zr8.5) weak to moderate acidic sites are
higher in number than those of isolated ZrO2 and also strong
acidic sites have been generated, which are believed to be
originated from the SnO2 content (Fig. 5). Weak to strong basic
sites have been developed, which are higher in number than

conditions: catalyst weight = 1.0 g, temperature = 600 8C, pressure = 1 atm,

those are present in the isolated oxides. In other words, in
Sn1.5Zr8.5 catalyst acid–base bi-functionality has been sig-
niﬁcantly increased, which has been reﬂected in the dehydro-
genation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of CO2 as in
our earlier report [15]. Furthermore, nanosize effect might be
playing a role in enhancing the catalytic activity.
The catalytic activity of Sn1.5Zr8.5 at different reaction
temperatures has been shown in Fig. 9. The catalytic activity of
Sn1.5Zr8.5 at 450 8C is negligible, wherein, the conversion of
ethylbenzene is only 2.2% and the selectivity of styrene is
89.8%. As the reaction temperature increases to 500 8C the
conversion of ethylbenzene augmented, but it is not so
considerable amount. At 600 8C the conversion of ethylbenzene
has been attained a maximum value of 61.1% with the styrene
selectivity of 97.6%. Further increase of reaction temperature to
650 8C, the conversion has been increased to 79.4%, but the
selectivity of styrene has been substantially diminished. Hence,
the optimum reaction temperature is 600 8C.
4. Conclusions
Preparation of SnO2–ZrO2 nanocomposite catalysts by
simpliﬁed and environmentally acceptable conditions has been
achieved. The formation of mixed oxide nanocomposite
catalysts, consequent enhancement in the acid–base bi-
functional
behavior
and
the
augmentation
of
catalytic
performance for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
to styrene than those of single constituent oxides has been
accomplished.
