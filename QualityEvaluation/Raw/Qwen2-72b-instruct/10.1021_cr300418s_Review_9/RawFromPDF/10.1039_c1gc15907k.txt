Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene has been studied with
vanadium-incorporated mesoporous nanocrystalline titania (Ti1-xVxO2) and molecular oxygen
between 440 and 530 ◦C. Incorporation of V in TiO2 lattice framework has been achieved by
simple solution combustion method. Incorporation of V in TiO2 lattice has been conﬁrmed by
X-ray diffraction, XPS and Raman spectra and other physicochemical analysis. High ethyl
benzene conversion and stable styrene yield has been observed with 10% V-containing rutile phase
titania at 500 ◦C. However, stable but relatively lower styrene yield has been observed with 2 and
5% V-containing catalysts between 440 and 500 ◦C. Highest selectivity is observed with lower
vanadium content. Comparable activity has been observed under similar experimental conditions
with four times higher air-ﬂow than that of O2. In order to understand the structure activity
relationship, spent catalysts were analyzed by all physico-chemical methods. Although there is a
phase change from anatase to rutile Ti1-xVxO2 within 1 h of reaction, higher activity is primarily
attributed to the ionic V5+ in Ti1-xVxO2 lattice, which prevents agglomeration to V2O5. It is to be
underscored the reactivity is retained at the cost of textural properties and phase change from
anatase to rutile, which is essential for the reaction.
Introduction
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene (EB) to
styrene is one of the commercially important reactions. Styrene
is mainly used in the production of polystyrene and several
copolymers. At present, bulk styrene monomer is produced
through dehydrogenation of EB on Fe–K–Cr oxide-based cata-
lysts with superheated steam at 700 ◦C.1 This dehydrogenation
is endothermic in nature (DH = 124.85 kJ mol-1), and highly
energy intensive process.1 Although hydrogen is available as a
side product, steam-based processes utilize a large amount of
latent heat and they pose thermodynamic limitations. Also coke
formation on the catalyst leads to severe catalyst deactivation.
Moreover, EB conversion of less than 50% was achieved per
pass. Hence there are constant efforts to develop alternate
catalysts to produce styrene, especially by ODH.2,3 Unlike
dehydrogenation, ODH is an exothermic reaction and hence
the reactions can be carried out at relatively lower temperatures
than the conventional endothermic dehydrogenation reactions.

Exothermicity also allows the heat energy to be tapped for other
applications. Design of new catalysts which gives reasonable
conversion with maximum selectivity for this ODH reaction is
one of the challenges in the ﬁeld of heterogeneous catalysis. Shiju
et al. achieved around 45% styrene yield with VOx/Al2O3 catalyst
using N2O as the oxidant at 500 ◦C.4 Schl¨
ogl et al. synthesized
onion-like carbon material and explored the same for ODH
of EB at 520 ◦C using O2 and achieved around 62% styrene
yield with 68% selectivity.5 Drago et al. also developed novel
carbon-based catalysts and showed high styrene yield (72%)
at lower temperatures (350 ◦C).6 Kustrowski et al. used many
different catalytic systems for ODH of EB reaction.7 They have
also synthesised VOx supported on SBA-15 and performed EB
ODH by using N2O as an oxidant.8 Recently Liu et al. demon-
strated around 60% EB conversion and high selectivity with
V2O5/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3 using CO2 as an oxidant at 550 ◦C.9
Supported vanadium oxide catalysts are widely studied for
several oxidation and ODH reactions.10–16 Among all catalysts,
VOx/TiO2 is a promising catalyst which shows high activity for
oxidation of o-xylene, toluene, methanol, lactic acid as well as in
ODH of alkanes.17–25 In these reactions, activity mainly depends
on the type of vanadia species and the nature of the support
used for the reaction.26–28 Titania is an excellent heterogeneous
catalyst-support material; the major limitation of conventional
titania to act as a good support is its low surface area and
its easy conversion between anatase to rutile. If titania can be

stabilised in the thermodynamically stable rutile phase, it would
be advantageous to exothermic ODH reactions.29 In general,
ordered mesoporous materials show high surface area and the
majority of active sites are present on the surface of porous
channels. Hence the reactants have to diffuse further in order
to interact with these active sites. However, in contrast to the
above, disordered wormhole mesoporous materials30,31 exhibit
smaller diffusion lengths due to the pseudo-three-dimensional
(p3D) nature of the pores compared to regular mesopores.32
Therefore the reactants and products can easily diffuse in/out
of the active sites, which increases the selectivity and yield of the
desired product and hence the rate of the reaction.
EB to styrene ODH is, generally, carried out at high tem-
perature (>500
◦C) on supported catalysts, which leads to
segregation and agglomeration of active phase. Especially, this
is true with V-based catalysts. It is also well known that isolated
VOx species are active for partial oxidation and polymeric (VOx)n
species totally oxidises organic moieties and compounds to
CO2.4 This can be avoided by introducing V into the lattice
framework of oxide support material. Lattice incorporation of
vanadium has more advantages and it is unlikely to segregate
out from the TiO2 lattice as a result of high temperature or
exothermic nature of ODH reaction. Further, this will increase
the monomeric or isolated VOx species in the lattice, which in
turn will enhance the activity of ODH reactions. Indeed this
concept has not been proposed and evaluated for any ODH
reactions. Therefore a simple method to prepare crystalline
mesoporous supports with high surface area along with lattice
incorporation of active species is of high relevance.
In the present investigations, we follow a simple solution
combustion method (SCM) in order to meet most of the above
important criteria. SCM is an energy efﬁcient simple process.
Short reaction time and cheap starting materials are the major
advantages of this method.32–35 For the ﬁrst time we have
studied the effect of incorporation of vanadium ions in the
titania (Ti1-xVxO2) lattice, along with wormhole mesoporosity
for the ODH of EB at temperature £530 ◦C with O2 as oxidant.
Prepared catalysts were analyzed by various physico-chemical
methods and structure–activity relationship has been deduced.
The present report is a part of our ongoing investigations from
our group towards comprehensive understanding of metal oxide
catalysts for different heterogeneous catalytic reactions.36
Experimental section
All the chemicals employed were of analytical grade and used
as such without any further puriﬁcation. Titanyl nitrate (Spec-
trochem) as Ti precursor, ammonium meta vanadate (Sigma–
Aldrich) as vanadium precursor and urea (Merck) as a fuel were
used as such. All TVx materials were prepared with 1 : 1 molar
ratio of urea to metal ions (Ti + V). x in TVx indicating the
nominal vanadium atom percentage. Aqueous solution of the
desired amount of titanyl nitrate, ammonium meta vanadate
and urea were taken in a 250 ml beaker and introduced into
a mufﬂe furnace maintained at 400 ◦C. Water evaporates in
the ﬁrst few minutes followed by smoldering type combustion
that occurs and continues for about 1 min. Solid products were
obtained within 15 min of total preparation time. A series of
catalysts were prepared by changing the nominal vanadium
content from 2 to 15 atom%. Here we have used urea as a fuel,
to avoid any carbon impurities. All of the prepared materials
were characterized by Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis,
X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, N2 adsorption-desorption
isotherm, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy,
high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM),
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data of Ti1-xVxO2 materials
was collected from PANalytical X’pert Pro dual goniometer
diffractometer. A proportional counter detector was used for
low angle experiments. The data were collected with a step size
of 0.02◦and a scan rate of 0.5◦min-1. The sample was rotated
throughout the scan for better counting statistics. The radiation
used was Cu-Ka (1.5418 A
˚ ) with Ni ﬁlter and the data collection
was carried out using a ﬂat holder in Bragg–Brentango geometry
(0.20). EDX measurements were performed on an SEM system
(FEI, Model Quanta 200 3D) equipped with EDX attachment.
EDX spectra were recorded in the spot-proﬁle mode by focusing
the electron beam onto speciﬁc regions of the sample. Nitrogen
adsorption/desorption isotherms for the materials were col-
lected from Quantachrome Autosorb Automated gas sorption
system (NOVA 1200).37 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
equation was used to calculate the surface area from the adsorp-
tion branch. The pore size distribution was calculated by ana-
lyzing the adsorption branch of the nitrogen sorption isotherm
using BJH method. A FEI TECNAI 3010 electron microscope
operating at 300 kV (Cs = 0.6 mm, resolution 1.7 A
˚ ) was used for
recording HRTEM of all materials. Samples were crushed and
dispersed in isopropanol before depositing onto a holey carbon
grid. Raman spectra were recorded on a Horiba JY LabRAM
HR 800 Raman spectrometer coupled with microscope in
reﬂectance mode with 633 nm excitation laser source and a
spectral resolution of 0.3 cm-1. XPS spectra were recorded on a
VG Microtech Multilab ESCA 3000 spectrometer equipped with
non-monochromatised Mg-Ka X-ray source (hn = 1253.6 eV).37
Catalytic activity
Vapour phase oxidative dehydrogenation of EB was carried out
at atmospheric pressure in a ﬁxed bed, vertical downﬂow, quartz
reactor placed inside a double zone furnace (Geomechanique,
France).36,37 Fresh catalyst (1.0 g) with particle size up to 10
mesh was charged each time in the center of the reactor in such
a way that the catalyst was sandwiched between the layers of inert
glass beads. The reactant (EB) was fed using a syringe pump at a
weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 2. Oxygen is used as an
oxidant. 40 ml min-1 is ﬁxed as an optimum ﬂow rate of oxygen.
We deliberately used molecular O2 in order to increase the reac-
tion rate, minimize coke deposition as well as to inhibit catalyst
deactivation. Reaction products were collected at ice cold condi-
tions from a condenser ﬁxed below the reactor and analyzed by
an Agilent Gas Chromatograph (19091J-413) containing an HP
5.5% phenyl methyl siloxane column equipped with a ﬂame ion-
ization detector. Products were also analyzed by using GC-MS.

titania Ti1-xVxO2 (TVx) materials. In TVx, x stands for nominal
V atom%, which is higher than the actual V-content due to
the evaporation loss of some V during solution combustion
synthesis. Fig. 1 shows XRD pattern of as prepared TVx
materials from low angle to wide angle. All TVx materials were
prepared with 1 : 1 urea to oxidizer ratio. PXRD pattern of TVx
materials could be indexed to anatase phase of titania with
small amount of rutile phase (JCPDS ﬁle 21-1272, 21-1276).
It is clearly observed that the rutile content increases from 6%
for TiO2 with increasing V-content to 11% for TV15. It is well
known that vanadium ion incorporation enhances the formation
of thermodynamically stable rutile phase.38,39 Very small amount
of brookite phase is also observed with high V-content (≥10%).
However, there is no vanadium oxide peak observed even at 15%
of vanadium loading. This observation hints that vanadium ions
are likely to occupy the lattice position of titania. Although
no VOx, particularly V2O5, has been observed in PXRD, it
cannot be ruled out a highly dispersed vanadium oxide on
titania.40 Nonetheless, it is to be noted that Feng et al.41 observed
V2O5 phase even at 7% loading itself. No V2O5 formation
in TVx indicates the potential of SCM to introduce V into
the lattice. A broad peak conﬁrms the formation of nanosize
crystalline particles. Crystallite size was calculated by using
Debye–Scherrer equation and shown in Table 1. There is no peak
shift observed after vanadium incorporation in TiO2. However
broad XRD features, due to nanocrystallite size, does not show
any shift due to V-introduction in the TiO2 lattice.
In Fig. 1, a single diffraction peak is observed around 0.8◦
demonstrates the mesoporous nature of the Ti1-xVxO2 materials.
Unlike ordered mesoporous materials, such as, SBA-15 and
MCM-48, all TVx materials exhibit only one peak around 0.8◦
without any extra peaks.42,43 This highlights the presence of
disordered mesoporosity30,31 for all TVx materials. Increasing
V-content affects the mesoporosity of the materials. An increase
in surface area and pore volume (Table 1) to be noted up
to V = 10% compared to TiO2 and then a marginal decrease
in surface area is observed for TV15. Nonetheless, it is clear
that all TVx materials exhibit mesoporosity along with high
crystallinity.
EDX analysis has been carried out to measure the material
composition as well as to ﬁnd out the extent of homogeneity of
the material. Representative results are given in Fig. 2 for TV5
(a and b), and TV10 (c and d). Elemental mapping have been
carried out and shown with colour coding for different elements.
High intense and low intense (or diffused) color indicates the
high and low content of corresponding elements, respectively,
in a particular area/spot. Fig. 2b and d shows the vanadium
and titanium mapping of the above materials to show the
homogeneous distribution over a large area (5.2 mm2). A glance
at TV5 (Fig. 2a) and TV10 (Fig. 2c) highlights an increase in V

content from the former to the latter. An increase in V content
on TV10 compared to TV5 is evident from Fig. 2. The above
results conﬁrm the homogeneous distribution of, particularly,
vanadium at the microscopic level, indicating the effectiveness
of the preparation method. Bulk atom% values reported in
Table 1 are the average values obtained over large area of
>500 mm2.

investigate the textural properties of the Ti1-xVxO2 materials.

and shown in Table 1. Surface area increases as the V-content
increases, and TV10 shows the highest surface area (210 m2
g-1). It is interesting to note that an increase in the V-content
signiﬁcantly increases the extent of mesoporosity, surface area
and the pore volume. This is attributed to a decrease in crystallite
size from 15 nm for TiO2 to 10 nm for TV10 and TV15. This
observation is in agreement with low angle XRD data. Unimodel
pore size distribution is observed with an average pore diameter
around 4.7 ± 1 nm for all TVx materials.
Particle morphology and textural properties of TVx cata-
lysts has been studied by HRTEM carefully. Representative
HRTEM images recorded for TiO2, TV5 and TV10 materials
are shown in Fig. 4. Generally TVx exhibits spherical particles
and the size of the particles also decreases with increasing V-
content. A wormhole like mesoporous structure can be seen

image as that of given in panel (a) is observed for all TVx materials.
for TVx materials. This wormhole mesoporosity arises due
to intergrowth of fundamental particles and the same leads
to aggregates with signiﬁcant extra framework void space.30–32
Selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern conﬁrms the
crystalline nature of the nanocrystalline TVx materials and
also it shows the anatase phase in both materials. HRTEM
image shows the majority of lattice fringes corresponding to
(101) (d(101) = 0.352 nm) crystallographic planes of anatase
phase. These observations are in excellent agreement with XRD
as well as with N2 adsorption isotherm results. Similar types
of images are already observed by Yu et al. for wormhole
type phosphated mesoporous titania prepared using co-block
polymers as a template.46 The wormhole mesoporous nature
has additional advantages like low diffusional barriers, since the
depth or length of mesopores are minimum to a few nanometres,
unlike several hundred nanometres in conventional ordered
mesoporous materials, like SBA-15. These types of mesopores
are known as p3D mesopores.32 This disordered p3D wormhole
like framework provides an easy route for the diffusion of
reactants due to less diffusion barriers.
Spectral analysis
Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy.
Raman spectroscopy is a
versatile tool to determine the structural features of the oxide
materials. Fig. 5a shows Raman spectra of all TVx materials. In
the case of pure titania, all six Raman active fundamental modes
are observed at 145 (Eg), 198 (Eg), 398 (B1g), 516 (A1g + B1g), 640
(Eg) cm-1 for the anatase phase. Broad nature of these peaks
conﬁrms the formation of nanosize particles. None of the four
Raman active modes (144 (B1g), 446 (Eg), 610 (A1g), 827 (B2g)
cm-1) of rutile titania was observed, possibly due to low rutile
content as well as very broad nature of the anatase features.
Raman spectra for V2O5 also included for better comparison.
None of the Raman features of V2O5 (285, 703, and 997 cm-1)
was observed in the Raman spectra underscores the absence
of bulk crystalline V2O5 phase in mesoporous TVx materials.
There is no peak that corresponds to monomeric or polymeric
vanadium species has been observed for TVx materials, unlike

observed in TVx materials highlighting the absence of V2O5 and
suggesting the introduction of V into the titania framework.

other impregnated catalysts.26,40 Importantly, the intensity of all
the peaks decreased drastically (up to two orders of magnitude)
with increasing V-content. XRD and TEM analysis reveals that
the crystallinity as well as morphology, respectively, of the bare
TiO2 as well as Ti1-xVxO2 remains the same. Therefore this
decrease in the peak intensity is mainly due to the symmetry
breaking of TiO2 lattice due to the incorporation of vanadium.47
This symmetry breaking could occur only if vanadium was
incorporated into the titania lattice. This observation also rules
out the homogeneous distribution of vanadium oxide on titania.
No V2O5 features observed for TVx with x ≥5 supports the
above conclusion. These results are in well agreement with the
literature report.40,47
Fig. 5b shows the FT-IR spectra for pure titania and TVx
materials and compared to V2O5. Pure TiO2 shows broad band
in the region of 400–900 cm-1 due to unresolved stretching
vibrations of Ti–O–Ti. Bulk V2O5 displays well resolved stretch-
ing and bending vibrations of V
O at 1025 and 831 cm-1,
respectively. However, there are no V2O5 features observed even
with TV15. This conﬁrms the absence of separate V2O5 phase in
all TVx materials. Along with XRD and Raman spectroscopy,
FT-IR also supports the lattice incorporation of vanadium in
titania. Moreover there is no direct evidence observed for the
dispersion of vanadia on anatase titania which strongly proves
that vanadium is incorporated into titania lattice. TVx material
reported in this manuscript is different from conventional
impregnated catalysts.4,7
X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
Fig. 6 shows XPS spectra
of (a) Ti 2p, and (b) V 2p and O 1s core level spectra of TVx
materials. Ti 2p3/2 core level appears at a BE around 459 ±
0.2 eV for all TVx materials. This is in good agreement with
the BE reported for Ti4+ in literature reports.48 Indeed Ti 2p3/2
BE increases gradually from 458.8 eV for TiO2 to 459.2 eV for
TV15. V 2p3/2 core level is observed around 517 ± 0.1 eV for
all TVx materials, indicating the oxidation state of V to be 5+.
Indeed this observation suggests that the charge compensation
requires extra oxygen to be present in the lattice. We do not
want to rule out the presence of extra oxygen in the lattice.

a Carbon percentage on spent catalyst is 100 - (Ti% + V% + O%); spent
catalyst is recovered after 12 h of reaction at 500 ◦C.
However, it is to be noted that the isolated V5+ reported on
supported system, such as V/Al2O3, displays a BE of 517.5 ±
0.2 eV for V 2p3/2 core level and bulk V2O5 shows the same at
517 eV
. However, V5+ in TiO2 crystal lattice is bound to behave
considerably different, due to charge redistribution within the
lattice. In this sense, the BE observed for V 2p3/2 core level for
TVx materials at 517 eV should be considered as that of an
oxidation state between 4+ and 5+. Indeed a signiﬁcant increase
in Ti 2p3/2 BE with increasing V-content suggests a decrease in
electron density on Ti, which is attributed to the above charge
distribution within the lattice. O 1s core level BE increases from
529.8 eV for TiO2 to 530.4 for TV15. A linear increase in BE
with increasing V-content, indeed, supports that there is a charge
redistribution within the lattice system due to V-incorporation
in the lattice.
Surface atom percentage calculated from XPS results, are
shown in Table 2. Although V-content on the surface increases
with increasing nominal V-concentration, it is lower than the
input V amount. This is, in part, attributed to the loss of V in
the combustion synthesis. Introduction of V into the bulk of
titania crystal lattice, as observed in XRD, Raman analysis and
EDX, suggests a large amount of V should be available in the
bulk. This is further supported by a relatively smaller decrease in
surface Ti- content. It is also to be noted that the surface oxygen
percentage varied little with increasing V-content.
Catalytic activity
Effect of EB ﬂow and oxygen ﬂow.
EB to styrene ODH
reaction with oxygen has been used as a probe reaction to explore
the catalytic activity of the TVx materials. This is primarily
to explore the inﬂuence of V5+ introduced in TiO2 lattice
framework. Environmentally benign O2 is used as an oxidant.49
However, caution must be exercised due to the exothermic nature
of the reaction with combustible reactant and products in the
presence of oxygen. Reactions were carried out at relatively low
temperature, compared to conventional endothermic reaction,
and at atmospheric pressure. Feed (EB) and O2 ﬂow variation
measurements was carried out separately in order to optimize
the reaction conditions to get the maximum styrene yield. Fig. 7a
and 7b shows feed as well as O2 ﬂow variation, respectively, with
TV10 catalyst at 500 ◦C. O2 ﬂow was ﬁxed at 40 ml min-1 for all
EB ﬂow variation measurements, and EB ﬂow was ﬁxed at 2 ml
h-1 for all O2 ﬂow variation measurements. Maximum conversion
and yield was observed with very low EB ﬂow, such as 1 and 2
ml h-1. Conversion decreases with increasing EB ﬂow rate due

opposite changes observed with conversion and selectivity.
to reduction in contact time between the reactant and active
sites which in turn results in lower yield. Lower EB ﬂow leads to
somewhat lower selectivity. It may be due to the decomposition
of some amount of styrene due to longer contact time. Based on
these observations, 2 ml h-1 EB ﬂow is kept as an optimum ﬂow
rate to attain the maximum styrene yield for further studies.
EB conversion and styrene yield increases with increasing O2
ﬂow from 10 to 40 ml min-1 (Fig. 7b). However, on further
increase in O2 ﬂow (60 ml min-1), selectivity and yield decreases
although conversion remains high. Optimum styrene selectivity
is observed with 40 ml min-1 O2 ﬂow. Higher than 40 ml min-1
ﬂow leads to some decomposition of styrene and hence styrene
selectivity is reduced. Interestingly, coke deposition is very
minimum at 40 ml min-1 O2 ﬂow. This observation was further
conﬁrmed by TG/DTA analysis of the spent catalysts which
will be discussed in later section. In view of this optimization
all further reactions were carried out at 40 ml min-1 O2 ﬂow
and EB ﬂow of 2 ml h-1 in order to get the maximum styrene
yield.
Effect of reaction temperature.
Temperature of the reaction
is one of the important parameter which affects the selectivity
and yield of the desired product. The effect of reaction tempera-
ture as a function of time on stream (TOS) on EB conversion and
styrene yield is shown in Fig. 8 with TV10 catalyst. Following
points are worth highlighting. (i) EB conversion increases with
increasing reaction temperature. However, stable conversion is
observed up to 470 ◦C, and the conversion decreases fast as
the temperature increases as a function of TOS. (ii) Stable
styrene yield is observed up to 500 ◦C and the yield also
increases from 440 to 500 ◦C. Further increase in temperature,
decreases the yield as a function of TOS. (iii) In spite of
high EB conversion in the initial hours, a decrease in styrene
selectivity at 530 ◦C indicating a possible decomposition of
styrene. (iv) The highest styrene yield is observed at 500 ◦C.
Therefore 500 ◦C is chosen as an optimum reaction temperature
to achieve the maximum yield of styrene. Apart from the
above points, relatively stable EB conversion and stable styrene
yield at 440 and 470
◦C is worth noting. At higher time
on stream there is an increasing convergence in the value of
conversion and stable yield has been observed between 440
and 500 ◦C. It is well known that stable product yield have
deﬁnite advantages at large scales production, especially at lower
temperatures.

Effect of vanadium content and time on stream.
Temperature
dependent EB conversion and styrene yield with all TVx
catalysts at TOS = 5 h is shown in Fig. 9. This shows a volcano
type activity pattern with V-content and the maximum activity
has been observed with TV10 catalyst. Pure TiO2 gives very
low styrene yield. EB conversion and styrene yield increases
with increasing V incorporation and attains the maximum with
TV10 catalyst. Among all TVx catalysts, TV15 gives low yield
of styrene.

Fig. 9
Catalytic activity dependence of EB to styrene reaction on nom-
inal V-content at different temperatures. Data collected at TOS = 5 h is
given for (a) conversion, and (b) yield. 10% nominal V-containing titania
shows the best performance under present experimental conditions.
Optimum EB ﬂow (2 ml h-1), reaction temperature (500 ◦C)
and oxygen ﬂow (40 ml min-1) was ﬁxed in order to understand
the inﬂuence of V-content towards the EB to styrene ODH
reaction. Fig. 10 (a–c) shows the catalytic activity of TVx
materials for ODH reaction of EB at 500 ◦C. Pure TiO2 displays
2–3 times lower conversion and yield than that of any TVx
materials, highlighting the necessity of V for the present ODH
reaction. However, selectivity is comparable to that of the best
performing TV2 catalyst. Generally the EB conversion increases
with increasing V-content from 2 to 10%, on further increase in
V-content leads to a decrease in EB conversion. Irrespective
of the V-content, initial high conversion of EB observed keep
on decreases linearly with time. In contrast to the above, the
styrene selectivity linearly increases with TOS and irrespective
of V-content. Hence styrene yield is relatively constant over
the reaction time of 12 h. Among all catalysts, TV10 shows
higher EB conversion as well as styrene yield. The decrease
in EB conversion is more pronounced with high V-content
incorporated (TV15) catalyst. Moreover the surface area of
these catalysts reaches the value of around 40 m2 g-1 within
2 h of reaction (will be discussed later). Therefore change in the
ODH activity is mainly due to the difference in the V content in
Ti1-xVxO2 catalysts. Apparently at high V-content, probability of
one V5+ ﬁnding another V5+ in the near neighbour environment
is high, and chances of polymeric vanadyl type species cannot be
ruled out. Hence it is concluded that incorporation of vanadium
ions more than 10% is detrimental to styrene yield. Therefore
conversion and yield also decreases with TV15 catalyst. It
is observed that the selectivity is more in the case of lower
vanadium incorporated catalyst (TV2).
Interestingly, the activity of the catalysts after 12 h on TOS
can be regenerated by simply passing oxygen for 20 min at 500 ◦C
(Fig. 10). A little amount of coke deposited during the reaction
can be burnt off by oxygen. Although the total amount of coke
deposited is small (1 wt%, see Fig. 13), it increasingly blocks the
active sites on the surface, and hence a reduction in activity. On
regeneration the catalyst shows similar trend in conversion and

TV10 regenerated (after 4 h of reaction) with 20 min. O2 treatment at
500 ◦C fully recovers and displays the activity that of fresh TV10. A
distinct change in catalytic activity observed with TVx compared to
pure titania highlights the importance of V for ODH reaction. (d–f)

yield, as that of fresh catalyst, conﬁrms the coke deposition is
exclusively limited to the surface (Fig. 10 (a–c), TV10-Regen).
To evaluate the feasibility of the EB to styrene ODH in air
atmosphere, above reactions has been repeated under the same
conditions with TV10 at different air-ﬂow rates. Results obtained
are shown in Fig. 10 (d–f). EB conversion and styrene yield
increases linearly with increase in air-ﬂow rate from 60 to 180 ml
min-1. Indeed increase in the above rate is proportional to the
oxygen content in air. However, compared to molecular O2, a
relatively fast decline in conversion and yield in fewer hours of
reaction time underscores a relatively fast deposition of coke.
Further, selectivity remains around a constant value and it is in
contrast to an increasing selectivity in O2 atm. It is also to be
noted that the TOS = 1 h activity is the same for 40 ml min-1 of
O2 and 180 ml min-1 of air. It is expected that the same activity
might be obtained under air or air + O2 atmosphere as that

of pure O2 by employing ﬂuid catalytic cracking (FCC) reactors
and changing the contact time suitably. This would also decrease
the hazardous nature of the reaction. However more studies are
necessary to conﬁrm the above aspects.
Although the styrene selectivity is high, benzene is one of
the signiﬁcant side product observed along with minor amount
of toluene and styrene oxide. No other secondary products were
observed. Table 3 shows the selectivity of the above side products
with TV10 at TOS = 10 h at different temperatures. Decrease
in selectivity of styrene and benzene at higher temperatures
(530 ◦C) is due to the increasing total oxidation of reactant
and products to CO2.
Physicochemical analysis of spent catalysts and its correlation to
activity
XRD, thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis
(TG/DTA), XPS and Raman spectra of the spent catalysts
have been recorded in order to explore the structure activity
relationship. Catalysts that were subjected to optimized reaction
conditions for 12 h of reaction at 500 ◦C in O2 atm. have
been analyzed for the above study, unless otherwise speciﬁed.
Fig. 11a shows the XRD for the spent catalysts along with
fresh TiO2. All of the spent catalysts were completely converted
into the rutile phase. Even after 1 to 2 h of reaction also
the catalysts shows >90% of the rutile phase (Fig. 11a). This
underscores the total phase change of TiO2 to rutile occurs at the
beginning of the reaction within ﬁrst 2 h. However, this anatase
to rutile phase conversion does not affect the activity of the
catalysts. Commonly active phase will get segregate out under
these reaction conditions. However, there is no peak observed
for V2O5 phase even with TV15 after this highly exothermic
reaction conditions. This observation strongly supports the
incorporation of active V species into titania lattice. Hence these
Ti1-xVxO2 catalysts are highly recyclable. A simple calcination
of fresh catalysts at 500 ◦C for 5 h leads to about 15% rutile,
indicating the accelerated anatase to rutile phase conversion is
due to the exothermic nature of the reaction. In fact rutile phase
conversion is observed with reaction carried out even at 440 ◦C
underscores the phase conversion is due to the exothermic nature
of the reaction.
Mesoporosity of TVx materials was analyzed by low angle
XRD and N2 adsorption-desorption studies of spent catalyst.
Mesoporosity is completely lost after the reaction. It is mainly
attributed to the exothermic nature of the ODH reaction.
Surface area also signiﬁcantly reduced with the spent catalyst.
After reaction for 12 h, all TVx catalysts exhibits a low surface
area between 35 to 40 m2 g-1. Compared to anatase, formation
of highly dense rutile phase is the main cause25 for the loss of
Fig. 11

catalysts after 12 h of reaction at 500 ◦C. Fresh TiO2 catalyst spectrum
is given for comparison purposes.
mesoporosity as well as reduction in surface area. Interestingly,
from the reaction point of view, it is to be stated that the
above changes seems to be essential for stable styrene yield at
reaction temperature between 440 and 500 ◦C. In other words,
reactivity is retained at the cost of textural properties, such as
high surface area, pore volume, mesoporosity and rutile phase
change.

Fig. 11b shows the Raman spectra of the spent catalysts
along with fresh TiO2. Raman features of anatase phase fully
disappears and the new features that appear correspond to that
of rutile phase.42 Raman spectra conﬁrm the phase transfor-
mation of TiO2 from anatase to rutile due to the reaction.
None of the Raman features of vanadium oxide (Fig. 5a) are
observed for the spent catalysts strongly emphasize that there is
no segregation of active phase due to the reaction. Hence there
is no signiﬁcant decrease in the styrene yield with TVx catalysts.
This conclusion emphasizes the efﬁcacy of the SCM procedure,
which effectively incorporates active vanadium into the support
TiO2 lattice and prevents any agglomeration and segregation
due to the exothermic reaction.
XPS spectra were recorded for the spent catalysts, and the
results are shown in Fig. 12. XPS results of TV10 (fresh) catalyst
is also plotted for comparison. A comparison of BE of Ti 2p, V
2p and O 1s core levels of fresh TV10 catalyst to that of spent
TVx catalysts reveals a decrease in BE of all of the core level
features. However, the extent of variation changes for all three
elements. BE of Ti 2p3/2, V 2p3/2 and O 1s core level decreased
by 0.8, 0.6 and 0.5 eV, respectively, compared to fresh TV10
catalyst. In addition there is a signiﬁcant change in intensity of
all three core levels observed, as seen in Fig. 12. A glance at the
spectra in Fig. 12 suggests a marked decrease in the intensity
of O and Ti after the reaction; however the intensity of V
apparently looks similar for fresh and spent catalysts. To explore
more on the surface composition surface atom percentage was
calculated from XPS results and the photo ionization cross
section of different element core levels,50 and the results are given
in Table 2. It is worth highlighting the following three important
observations: (1) A sizeable decrease in Ti and O atom% on
the surface at the cost of soft coke which is characterized by
graphitic carbon around 284 eV
. (2) A signiﬁcant increase in the
surface V % is observed for all spent TVx catalysts, compared
to fresh TVx materials. However the percent increase in surface
V-content after the reaction is much higher for TV2 and TV5
than the other compositions (TV8–TV15). (3) Even with TV10
and TV15, the surface V content does not exceed 6 atom%

highlighting that the vanadium is ionically distributed and not
agglomerated. Indeed no V2O5 phase has been observed in XRD
and Raman spectra of spent catalysts supports this conclusion.
Resumption of original catalytic activity after regeneration by
burning coke demonstrates the integrity of catalyst and without
V2O5 segregation. (4) A decrease in BE of all the core level
features suggest a change in the electronic structure of the
TVx materials, and it is attributed to the phase change to
rutile.
Thermal analysis (TG-DTA) results of spent catalysts are
shown in Fig. 13. All the spent catalysts hardly show a weight
loss of around 1%. Surface coke content measured from XPS
results varied between 19% for spent TiO2 to 38% for spent TV5.
It is also to be noted that higher V-containing spent catalysts
(TV10 and TV15) shows a surface coke content between 26 and
28%. Similar amount of coke content was observed for TV10
spent catalyst obtained after 6 h of reaction in air atmosphere.
Very small amount of weight loss observed in TG-DTA of
spent catalysts highlights the deposition of coke is likely to
be exclusively on the surface. Indeed a simple calcination in
air for just 20 min. at 500 ◦C removes all coke and original
activity is restored, supports the above conclusion. Also a
minimum coke percentage observed in Fig. 13 is mainly due
to an optimum ﬂow of oxygen throughout the reaction which
prevents bulk coke formation. This is in contrast to most of the
earlier reports that reports a high coke deposition on the V-based
catalysts.2–17

Conclusion
Vanadium incorporated wormhole mesoporous nanocrytalline
titania catalysts were prepared by simple solution combustion
method. Incorporation of vanadium ions in the titania lattice
framework was conﬁrmed by XRD, Raman, FT-IR and XPS
techniques. ODH of EB to styrene was carried out with
molecular oxygen at relatively low temperatures (£530 ◦C) to
evaluate the catalytic activity of the TVx catalysts. Compared
to pure TiO2, all TVx catalysts shows 2–3 times higher catalytic
activity demonstrates the importance of V for ODH reaction.
Among the TVx catalysts, 10% nominal vanadium incorporated

titania shows the stable yield towards styrene. Side products
selectivity decreases enormously with increasing time on stream
toward total styrene selectivity. A simple regeneration of the
spent catalysts by heating in oxygen for 20 min restores the
original activity. After 12 h reaction also there is no formation
of V2O5 phase in any of the TVx catalysts. Due to the exothermic
nature of the reaction, anatase phase titania converts completely
to rutile phase within 2 h of reaction, and it is the rutile
phase responsible for the stable yield due to its stability under
exothermic conditions. Vanadium ion incorporation beyond
10% leads to a decrease in EB conversion and styrene yield,
due to a possible increase in near neighbour V–V interaction
that leads to more total oxidation. Comparable catalytic activity
has been observed in air atmosphere indicates the possibility of
enhancing the green chemistry and green engineering aspect of
the reaction, by employing FCC reactor.
It is to be underscored the reactivity is retained at the cost
of textural properties and phase change to rutile which is
essential for the reaction. Some of the 24 principles of green
chemistry and green engineering51 has been adopted in the
present work, such as catalyst preparation by simple method
in a short time, recyclability of catalyst, reaction temperature
is relatively decreased (compared to the commercial process)
and successful incorporation of ionic vanadium in the titania
lattice framework to avoid agglomeration and hence unwanted
secondary reactions. However the present set of TVx catalysts
should be explored for other ODH and oxidation reactions at
relatively lower temperatures, so that textural properties also
could be retained for even better catalytic activity.
