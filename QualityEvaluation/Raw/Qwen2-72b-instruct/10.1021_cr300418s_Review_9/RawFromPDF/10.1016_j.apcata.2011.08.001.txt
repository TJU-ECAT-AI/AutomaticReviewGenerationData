 the  superior

 can
be
 attributed
 to the  dramatic
 improvement
 in  oxygen

 of  the  ceria  materials,
resulting
 from
 the  introduction
 of  Ni  species

 Introduction
Styrene
 
(ST)
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
chemi-
cals
 
in
 
the
 
petrochemical
 
industry
 
for
 
the
 
production
 
of
polystyrene,
 
acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene
 
(ABS)
 
terpoly-
mer,
 styrene–butadiene
 rubber
 (SBR),
 and
 so
 forth
 [1–3].
 In
 2009,
the
 worldwide
 production
 of
 ST
 was
 more
 than
 23
 megatons
 [4].
Commercially,
 ST
 is
 mainly
 produced
 by
 direct
 dehydrogenation
 of
ethylbenzene
 (EB),
 over
 K2O-promoted
 Fe2O3 catalysts
 in
 the
 pres-
ence
 of
 a
 large
 quantity
 of
 steam
 at
 high
 temperature
 (600–650 ◦C)
[5,6].
 Due
 to
 its
 highly
 endothermic
 nature,
 this
 conventional
 pro-
cess
 suffers
 from
 some
 disadvantages
 such
 as
 the
 thermodynamic
limitation,
 irreversible
 catalyst
 deactivation
 and
 coke
 deposition
[1,7].
 Alternatively,
 the
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 (ODH)
 process
of
 EB
 to
 ST
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 O2 has
 attracted
 considerable
attention
 since
 it
 can
 be
 operated
 under
 lower
 temperatures
 and
the
 EB
 conversion
 would
 not
 be
 equilibrium
 limited
 [8–10].
A
 variety
 of
 catalytic
 systems,
 including
 amorphous
 AlPO4
[1],  CaO/SiO2 [11],
 MnO2/SiO2 [12],
 Mg(VO4)2–MgO
 [13],
 and
V2O5/CeO2/Al2O3 [14],
 have
 been
 investigated
 for
 the
 process
 of
the
 ODH
 of
 EB
 recently.
 To
 date,
 the
 most
 promising

suggested
 for
 the
 process
 have
 been
 conﬁned
 to
 several
 nanos-
tructured
 carbon
 materials
 including
 onion
 like
 carbon
 (OLC)
 [9,15]
or
 carbon
 nanoﬁbers
 (CNF)
 [16,17],  which
 have
 exhibited
 high
conversion
 (>60%)
 of
 EB
 as
 well
 as
 high
 selectivity
 (>80%)
 to
 ST
at
 450–500 ◦C.
 Nevertheless,
 due
 to
 their
 properties
 of
 ﬁne
 pow-
der
 [16–18]
 and
 intrinsically
 low
 resistance
 to
 combustion
 of
 the
materials
 in
 oxidative
 gas,
 the
 carbon-based
 catalysts
 cannot
 be
extensively
 employed
 in
 the
 industrial
 application.
 In
 this
 context,
it
 is
 highly
 desired
 to
 develop
 a
 newly
 robust
 catalyst
 applicable
 for
the
 ODH
 of
 EB.
Ceria
 is
 one
 of
 the
 key
 components
 in
 the
 catalyst
 formulations
for
 many
 industrially
 important
 reactions,
 e.g.
 three-way-catalysts
(TWC)
 for
 automobile
 exhaust
 treatment
 [19,20],  CO
 oxidation
 [21],
and
 low
 temperature
 water-gas
 shift
 reaction
 [22,23].  The
 success
of
 ceria
 in
 various
 applications
 is
 largely
 attributed
 to
 its
 unique
combination
 of
 an
 elevated
 oxygen
 transport
 capacity
 with
 the
ability
 to
 shift
 easily
 between
 Ce3+ and
 Ce4+ states,
 i.e.
 oxygen
 stor-
age/release
 capacities
 (OSC)
 [14,24].  Despite
 this,
 the
 use
 of
 pure
CeO2 is
 highly
 discouraged
 because
 of
 its
 poor
 thermostability
 at
high
 temperatures,
 thereby
 losing
 its
 crucial
 OSC
 characteristics
[25].
 To
 overcome
 the
 drawback,
 other
 transition
 metal
 ions
 are
normally
 introduced
 into
 the
 ceria
 cubic
 structure,
 resulting
 in
 the
formation
 of
 a
 defective
 ﬂuorite-structured
 solid
 solution.
 Such
modiﬁcations
 may
 confer
 new
 properties
 to
 the
 materials
 such
 as
better
 resistance
 to
 sintering
 and
 higher
 OSC
 for
 various
 reactions,
thus
 leading
 to
 totally
 different
 catalytic
 behavior
 [26].

More
 recently,
 we
 have
 reported
 that
 mesostructured
 ceria
materials
 with
 high
 accessible
 speciﬁc
 areas
 can
 catalyze
 the
 ODH
of
 EB
 at
 ca.
 450 ◦C
 [27].
 Whereas,
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 in
 terms
of
 ST
 productivity
 achieved
 over
 the
 mesostructured
 ceria
 cata-
lysts
 was
 still
 lower
 (22.7%
 convention
 of
 EB
 with
 87.3%
 selectivity
to
 ST)
 for
 the
 further
 application.
 In
 view
 of
 the
 aforementioned
modiﬁcations
 for
 ceria
 materials,
 we
 envisioned
 that
 it
 would
 be
of
 interest
 to
 explore
 the
 doped
 ceria
 materials
 for
 the
 ODH
 of
 EB.
Herein,
 we
 report
 the
 development
 of
 a
 mesostructured
 Ni-doped
ceria
 catalyst
 with
 enhanced
 activity
 and
 stability
 for
 the
 ODH
 of
EB.
 Our
 results
 have
 revealed
 that
 the
 prominent
 increase
 of
 oxygen
capacity
 combined
 with
 storage
 capacity,
 after
 the
 introduction
 of
Ni
 species
 with
 an
 optimal
 amount,
 is
 indispensable
 for
 an
 efﬁcient
ceria-based
 catalyst.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Catalyst
 preparation
Ce1−xMxO
 (M
 =
 Al,
 Sn,
 Zr,
 Mn,
 and
 Ni,
 x
 denoted
 the
 molar
 ratio
of
 M
 of
 to
 Ce)
 materials
 with
 high
 surface
 areas
 were
 synthe-
sized
 via
 a
 previously
 established
 template-assisted
 precipitation
method
 [28,29].  Typically,
 4.5
 mmol
 of
 Ce(NO3)3,
 the
 correspond-
ing
 nitrate
 hydrate
 precursors
 (0.5
 mmol),
 and
 CTAB
 (1.09
 g)
 were
dissolved
 in
 100
 ml
 of
 distilled
 water.
 Then,
 150
 ml
 of
 NaOH
 solu-
tion
 (0.16
 mol
 L−1)
 was
 added
 into
 the
 solution
 under
 stirring.
 The
mixture
 was
 then
 maintained
 in
 a
 sealed
 glass
 vessel
 under
 stirring
for
 3
 days.
 After
 aging
 at
 90 ◦C
 for
 3
 h,
 the
 as-obtained
 precipitate
was
 ﬁltered
 and
 washed
 with
 hot
 water
 (∼80 ◦C)
 for
 several
 times
to
 remove
 the
 residual
 CTAB.
 The
 resultant
 powder
 was
 dried
 at
100 ◦C
 for
 6
 h
 and
 then
 calcined
 at
 500 ◦C
 for
 4
 h.
 For
 the
 sake
 of
 com-
parison
 in
 the
 following
 catalytic,
 the
 oxalate
 gel
 co-precipitation
method
 [30]
 was
 also
 employed
 to
 synthesize
 the
 Ni-doped
 ceria
sample
 (designated
 as
 Ce1−xNixO–CP).
2.2.
 Characterization
Nitrogen
 sorption
 at
 −196 ◦C
 was
 measured
 using
 a
 Micromerit-
ics
 TriStar
 3000
 after
 the
 samples
 were
 degassed
 (1.33
 ×
 10−2 Pa)
 at
300 ◦C
 overnight.
 The
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 was
 calculated
 using
 the
Brunauer–Emmet–Teller
 (BET)
 method,
 and
 pore
 size
 distribution
was
 determined
 by
 the
 Barret–Joyner–Halenda
 (BJH)
 method.
TEM
 analysis
 was
 carried
 out
 with
 a
 JEOL
 2010
 electron
 micro-
scope
 operating
 at
 200
 kV.
 Before
 being
 transferred
 into
 the
 TEM
chamber,
 the
 samples
 dispersed
 in
 ethanol
 were
 deposited
 onto
 a
carbon-coated
 copper
 grid
 and
 then
 quickly
 moved
 into
 the
 vacuum
evaporator.
Structural
 analysis
 of
 CeO2 and
 the
 doped
 ceria
 samples
 was
carried
 out
 on
 a
 Bruker
 D8
 Advance
 X-ray
 diffractometer
 equipped
with
 a
 graphite
 monochromator,
 operating
 at
 40
 kV
 and
 40
 mA  and
employing
 nickel-ﬁltered
 Cu-K
 radiation
 (

Temperature
 
programmed
 
reduction
 
(TPR)
 
proﬁles
 
were
obtained
 on
 a
 homemade
 apparatus.
 100
 mg  of
 the
 samples
 were
pretreated
 in
 a
 mixed
 gas
 (O2/N2 =
 1/8)
 at
 450 ◦C
 for
 30
 min
 and
cooled
 to
 room
 temperature.
 Subsequently,
 the
 samples
 were
reduced
 with
 5%
 H2/Ar
 at
 40
 mL
 min−1 with
 a
 ramping
 rate
 of
5 ◦C
 min−1 to
 910 ◦C.
 The
 H2 consumption
 was
 monitored
 by
 a
 TCD
detector.
Thermal
 gravimetric
 analysis
 (TGA),
 as
 well
 as
 temperature-
programmed
 oxidation
 (TPO)
 measurements
 of
 the
 fresh
 and
 spent
catalysts,
 was
 conducted
 on
 a
 Perkin–Elmer
 TGA
 7
 analyzer.
 The
sample
 was
 placed
 in
 an
 -Al2O3 cumber
 and
 heated
 in
 ﬂowing
air
 (50
 mL  min−1)
 from
 room
 temperature
 to
 800 ◦C
 at
 a
 rate
 of
20 ◦C
 min−1.
X-ray
 photoelectron
 spectra
 (XPS)
 analysis
 was
 performed
 on
a
 Perkin–Elmer
 PHI
 5000C
 spectrometer
 using
 Mg  K
 radiation
(1253.6
 eV,
 pass
 energy
 of
 20.0
 eV).
 The
 carbonaceous
 C
 1s
 line
(284.6
 eV)
 was
 used
 as
 the
 reference
 to
 calibrate
 the
 binding
 ener-
gies
 (BE).
2.3.
 Measurements
 of
 catalytic
 activity
The
 activity
 of
 the
 catalysts
 for
 the
 ODH
 of
 EB
 was
 measured
 in
the
 temperature
 range
 of
 350–500 ◦C
 at
 atmospheric
 pressure
 using
a
 ﬁx-bed,
 down-ﬂow,
 tubular
 quartz
 reactor
 (i.d.
 4
 mm,
 length
 400
mm).
 Approximately
 50
 mg
 of
 catalyst,
 in
 the
 form
 of
 60–80
 mesh
particles,
 was
 used
 and
 mixed
 with
 300
 mg  of
 SiC
 grains
 of
 similar
size
 for
 best
 temperature
 control
 for
 each
 run.
 EB
 was
 evapo-
rated
 at
 35 ◦C
 in
 ﬂowing
 N2 and
 subsequently
 mixed
 with
 O2.
The
 corresponding
 ﬂow
 rate
 of
 EB,
 O2,
 and
 N2 is
 ﬁxed
 at
 0.5,
 0.4
and
 20
 mL  min−1,
 respectively.
 Prior
 to
 testing,
 the
 catalysts
 were
pretreated
 in
 a
 mixed
 gas
 (O2/N2 =
 1/8)
 at
 450 ◦C
 for
 30
 min.
 The
products
 were
 analyzed
 by
 an
 on-line
 gas
 chromatography
 (Agi-
lent
 GC
 6820
 equipped
 with
 FFAP
 column
 for
 hydrocarbons
 and
TDX-01
 column
 for
 permanent
 gas
 analysis,
 coupled
 with
 FID
 and
TCD
 detectors,
 respectively).
 The
 carbon
 balance
 was
 maintained
closed
 to
 100
 ±
 5%
 and
 the
 COx content
 was
 additionally
 monitored
after
 catalytic
 combustion
 of
 organic
 species
 in
 a
 ﬁnal
 total
 oxida-
tion
 reactor.
 The
 data
 of
 catalytic
 performance
 was
 acquired
 after
2
 h
 from
 the
 start
 of
 the
 reaction
 to
 obtain
 the
 steady
 result.
2.4.
 Total
 OSC
 measurement
The
 measurement
 of
 total
 OSC
 was
 tested
 at
 450 ◦C.
 25
 mg  of
catalyst
 (60–80
 mesh)
 was
 placed
 in
 a
 quartz
 U-shaped
 reactor.
The
 concentrations
 of
 the
 three
 components
 (H2,
 H2O,
 and
 He)
in
 the
 outlet
 gas
 were
 monitored
 by
 an
 on-line
 mass
 spectrom-
eter
 (Balzers
 OmniStar).
 A
 sample
 was
 exposed
 to
 alternating
 H2
(40
 mL  min−1 for
 10
 s)
 and
 He
 (40
 mL  min−1 for
 80
 s)
 pulses,
 and
 the
alternating
 pulsation
 lasted
 until
 the
 signal
 intensity
 of
 H2 reached
a
 balance.
 Total
 OSC
 was
 calculated
 by
 integrating
 the
 H2 consumed
(mmol
 [O]
 g−1).

 Results
 and
 discussions
3.1.
 Catalyst
 tests
The
 catalytic
 performance
 of
 CeO2 and
 a
 series
 of
 doped
 ceria
samples
 in
 the
 ODH
 of
 EB
 was
 tested
 with
 the
 O2/EB
 ratio
 of
nO2/nEB =
 0.8
 at
 450 ◦C.
 In
 all
 cases,
 the
 major
 product
 in
 the
reaction
 is
 ST,
 accompanied
 with
 a
 small
 amount
 of
 oxygenates
(e.g.
 benzaldehyde
 or
 benzyl
 alcohol)
 and/or
 carbon
 oxides.
 As
shown
 in
 Fig.
 1,
 the
 pure
 CeO2 gives
 a
 relatively
 low
 EB
 conversion
(26.4%).
 After
 doping
 of
 Al
 and
 Zr
 (10
 wt%),
 the
 ceria
 catalysts
demonstrated
 a
 poorer
 catalytic
 activity
 with
 a
 falling
 by
 ca.
 10%
of
 EB
 conversion.
 In
 sharp
 contrast,
 the
 dopants
 of
 Sn,
 Mn,
 and
Ni
 with
 the
 same
 amount
 exhibit
 an
 apparent
 improvement
 of
catalytic
 activity.
 The
 maximum
 catalytic
 performance
 is
 obtained
over
 the
 Ce0.90Ni0.10O
 sample
 with
 an
 excellent
 EB
 conversion
of
 63.8%,
 allowing
 a
 highest
 yield
 of
 ST.
 In
 summary,
 the
 order
of
 the
 steady
 activity
 of
 doped
 ceria
 at
 450 ◦C
 is
 as
 follows:
Ce0.90Ni0.10O
 >
 Ce0.90Mn0.10O
 >
 Ce0.90Sn0.10O
 >
 CeO2 >
 Ce0.90Zr0.10O
>
 Ce0.90Al0.10O.
To
 evaluate
 the
 effects
 of
 the
 dopant
 amount
 on
 the
 catalytic
behavior,
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 of
 a
 series
 of
 Ce1−xNixO
 sam-
ples
 are
 summarized
 in
 Table
 1.
 It
 is
 remarkable
 that
 a
 little
 amount
of
 Ni
 doping
 (5%)
 into
 the
 ceria
 could
 drastically
 elevate
 the
 catalytic
activity,
 with
 a
 twofold
 increase
 of
 EB
 conversion.
 However,
 higher
amount
 of
 Ni
 with
 20%
 would
 compromise
 the
 catalytic
 activity.

One
 can
 see
 that
 when
 the
 amount
 of
 Ni
 is
 up
 to
 10%,
 the
 EB
 conver-
sion
 reaches
 the
 maximum,
 affording
 a
 substantially
 high
 ST
 yield
of
 55.1%.
 Additionally,
 the
 Ce0.90Ni0.10O-CP
 sample
 prepared
 by
 the
co-precipitation
 method
 was
 employed
 in
 the
 ODH
 of
 EB
 at
 the
same
 reaction
 condition.
 As
 indicated
 in
 Table
 1,
 the
 Ce0.90Ni0.10O-
CP
 catalyst
 gives
 an
 inferior
 catalytic
 activity,
 in
 contrast
 to
 the
Ce0.90Ni0.10O
 sample
 with
 identical
 amount
 of
 Ni.
The
 catalytic
 activity
 of
 the
 Ni-doped
 ceria
 catalysts
 is
 also
 found
to
 be
 strongly
 dependent
 on
 the
 reaction
 temperature.
 To

 of
 the

 the
 catalytic
 performance
 of
 the

 was

 It
 is
 found
 that
 the
 Ce0.90Ni0.10O
catalyst
 displays
 a
 poor
 catalytic
 activity
 at
 350 ◦C.
 As
 the
 reaction
temperature
 increases,
 the
 EB
 conversion
 increases
 rapidly
 with
a
 smooth
 decrease
 of
 the
 ST
 selectivity
 from
 95.4%
 to
 65.2%.
 The
decrease
 of
 the
 selectivity
 to
 the
 target
 product
 can
 be
 ascribed
 to
the
 consecutive
 oxidation
 of
 ST
 or
 direct
 oxidation
 of
 EB
 into
 oxy-
genates
 and/or
 COx at
 the
 elevated
 temperature
 [1]. Concerning
 a
higher
 ST
 yield,
 the
 temperature
 of
 450 ◦C
 is
 the
 ratio
 of
 choice.
Besides
 the
 activity
 and
 selectivity,
 stability
 of
 the
 catalyst
 is
 also
of
 paramount
 importance
 in
 ODH
 of
 EB
 to
 ST.
 Herein,
 Ni-doped
 ceria
catalysts,
 together
 with
 the
 pure
 CeO2,
 were
 tested
 in
 the
 ODH
 of
EB
 at
 450 ◦C
 for
 12
 h.
 The
 evolution
 of
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 as
a
 function
 of
 reaction
 time
 for
 the
 catalysts
 is
 compiled
 in
 Fig.
 3.
The
 ST
 selectivity
 for
 all
 samples
 remains
 constant
 at
 a
 value
 of
 ca.
85%,
 with
 the
 Ce0.80Ni0.20O
 sample
 being
 appreciably
 higher
 selec-
tive
 (87.2%)
 than
 its
 counterparts
 (not
 shown
 here).
 It
 is
 worthy
to
 note
 that,
 in
 our
 previous
 report
 [27],
 the
 pure
 mesostructured
ceria
 catalyst
 underwent
 an
 apparent
 decrease
 of
 EB
 conversion
during
 the
 initial
 2
 h,
 which
 was
 due
 to
 the
 decrease
 of
 the
 BET
 sur-
face.
 In
 contrast,
 after
 the
 reaction
 for
 12
 h,
 the
 BET
 surface
 area
and
 pore
 volume
 of
 the
 spent
 Ni-doped
 ceria

 compares
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 of
 Ce0.90Ni0.10O
 in
the
 ODH
 of
 EB
 with
 that
 of
 other
 reported
 catalysts.
 It
 should
 be
stressed
 that
 the
 experimental
 conditions
 in
 the
 literature
 concern-
ing
 the
 reaction
 may
 deviate
 from
 each
 other.
 Nevertheless,
 a
 rough
comparison
 is
 still
 feasible
 in
 the
 present
 study.
 As
 summarized
 in
Table
 2,
 the
 Ce0.90Ni0.10O
 catalyst
 gives
 a
 high
 catalytic
 performance
even
 under
 high
 space
 velocity
 condition.
 At
 450 ◦C
 and
 total
 space
velocity
 of
 415
 mL  gcatal.−1 min−1,
 the
 obtained
 space–time
 yield
(STY)
 for
 ST
 production
 is
 14.8
 mmolST gcatal. −1 h−1 while
 the
 selec-
tivity
 to
 ST
 is
 86%.
 These
 values
 compare
 favorably
 with
 the
 results
reported
 on
 most
 conventional
 metal
 oxide
 catalysts,
 wherein
 the
space
 velocities
 are
 much
 lower
 and
 the
 EB
 conversions
 are
 around
35%.
 Of
 particular
 note
 is
 that
 such
 ODH
 performance
 is
 appreciably
higher
 than
 those
 of
 the
 carbon-based
 catalytic
 systems
 reported
in
 the
 literature.
 At
 this
 juncture,
 the
 above
 catalytic
 evaluation
strongly
 manifests
 that
 the
 present
 mesostructured
 Ce0.90Ni0.10O
material
 can
 serve
 as
 a
 promising
 catalyst
 for
 styrene
 synthesis
from
 the
 ODH
 of
 EB.

 a

 from

 a
 typical

 Furthermore,
 the
 pore

 distribution
 calculated
 from
 the

 of
 CeO2 shows
 that
 the
 pore
 diameter
 ranges
from
 4
 nm
 to
 30
 nm
 with
 a
 maximum
 at
 around
 9.6
 nm
 (the
 inset

 By
 contrast,
 the
 doped
 ceria
 sample
 containing
 with
 10
 wt%
Ni
 represents
 a
 quite
 narrow
 size
 distribution
 centered
 at
 3.7
 nm.
These
 results
 suggest
 that
 the
 introduction
 of
 Ni
 species
 can
 obvi-
ously
 affect
 the
 mesostructures
 of
 the
 ceria
 materials.
 In
 addition,
TEM
 was
 used
 as
 a
 complementary
 technique
 to
 examine
 the
 struc-
tures
 of
 the
 ceria-based
 samples
 and
 representative

 for

to
 the
 higher
 2
 angle,
 compared
 with
 the
 pristine
 ceria
 sample.
 The
reason
 is
 that
 the
 replacement
 of
 Ce4+ (0.97 ˚
A)
 [6]
 with
 smaller
 Ni2+
ions
 (0.84 ˚
A)
 leads
 to
 a
 further
 shrinkage
 of
 ceria
 lattice.
 Among
 all
the
 Ni-doped
 CeO2 samples,
 the
 Ce0.90Ni0.10O
 sample
 demonstrates
the
 highest
 angle
 which
 implied
 the
 smallest
 unit-cell
 parameter.
Generally,
 it
 is
 proposed
 that
 the
 formation
 of
 the
 solid
 solution
of
 Ce–Ni–O
 by
 the
 incorporation
 of
 Ni2+ ions
 into
 ceria
 lattice
 can
favor
 the
 generation
 of
 oxygen
 vacancies
 which
 adsorb
 oxygen
 eas-
ily
 [14,32]. As
 a
 result,
 a
 large
 amount
 of
 highly
 reactive
 oxygen
species
 are
 formed
 over
 the
 doped
 ceria
 sample
 and
 the
 species
can
 be
 easily
 reduced
 by
 H2 and
 other
 hydrocarbons.
The
 redox
 behavior
 of
 the
 pure
 CeO2 and
 Ni-doped
 ceria
 sam-
ples
 has
 been
 investigated
 by
 TPR
 experiment
 (Fig.
 7).
 Two
 main
reduction
 peaks
 have
 been
 identiﬁed
 for
 all
 the
 samples:
 peak

 (280–550 ◦C)
 and
 peak
 
 (750–820 ◦C),
 generally
 attributed
 to
the
 reduction
 of
 surface-capping
 oxygen
 and
 bulk
 oxygen
 species
respectively
 [33,34].  While
 the
 pure
 ceria
 exhibits
 a
 broad
 reduc-
tion
 temperature
 in
 the
 range
 250–550 ◦C,
 the
 introduction
 of
 Ni
species
 drastically
 decreases
 the
 temperature
 of
 peak
 .
 Upon
increasing
 the
 amount
 of
 Ni,
 peak
 
 of
 the
 Ce1−xNixO
 samples
 shifts
to
 the
 lower
 temperature
 and
 the
 lowest
 temperature
 along
 with
the
 largest
 H2-consumption
 is
 obtained
 over
 Ce0.90Ni0.10O
 sample
(Table
 3).
 In
 the
 case
 of
 the
 Ce0.90Ni0.10O-CP
 sample,
 the
 TPR
 proﬁle
conﬁrms
 that
 the
 mesostructured
 sample
 could
 provide
 superior
reducibility
 to
 that
 by
 the
 co-precipitation
 method.
 For
 the
 sake
of
 detailed
 comparison,
 the
 redox
 behaviors
 of
 other
 doped
 ceria
catalysts
 were
 also
 compared
 and
 the
 corresponding
 temperatures
of
 the
 maximum
 H2 consumption
 (TM)
 are
 summarized
 in
 Table
 3.
The
 relatively
 higher
 TM together
 with
 lower
 H2 consumption
 of
peak
 
 for
 Ce0.90Al0.10O
 and
 Ce0.90Zr0.10O
 imply
 that
 the
 two
 cat-
alysts
 possess
 less
 reactive
 lattice
 oxygen
 and
 thus
 demonstrate
poor
 catalytic
 activity
 under
 the
 reaction
 conditions.
Combined
 XRD
 patterns
 and
 TPR
 proﬁles,
 it
 is
 clariﬁed
 that
 the
incorporation
 of
 10
 wt%
 Ni
 into
 ceria
 leads
 to
 the
 smallest
 unit-cell
parameter,
 and
 hence
 a
 more
 reactive
 oxygen
 species
 generating
over
 the
 ceria
 samples.
 To
 elucidate
 the
 origin
 of
 the
 superior
 ODH
activity
 achieved
 by
 using
 ceria-based
 catalyst,
 the
 total
 OSC
 of
the
 catalysts
 has
 been
 investigated
 under
 anaerobic
 atmosphere
 at
450 ◦C.
 It
 is
 noteworthy
 that
 the
 consumption
 and
 replenishment
of
 the
 lattice
 oxygen
 is
 dynamic
 between
 reduction
 and
 oxidation
environments
 for
 ODH
 reaction.
 Nevertheless,
 the
 contribution
 of
the
 total
 OSC
 to
 the
 catalytic
 behavior
 remains
 valuable
 to
 study.
As
 illustrated
 in
 Fig.
 8,
 the
 pure
 ceria
 presents
 a
 limited
 OSC
 of
 ca.
0.16

 permitting
 a
 rational
 explanation
 for
 the
positive

 of
 the

 of

With
 regard
 to
 the
 essential
 active
 phase
 of
 previously
 estab-
lished
 transition-metal-oxide
 and
 phosphate-based
 catalysts
 [1,2]
for
 the
 ODH
 of
 ethylbenzene,
 it
 is
 widely
 believed
 that
 the
 car-
bon
 deposits
 detected
 on
 these
 catalysts
 are
 indispensable
 for
 the
genesis
 of
 “true”
 catalytically
 active
 sites
 for
 the
 ODH
 reaction.
Speciﬁcally,
 it
 has
 been
 suggested
 that
 the
 surface
 redox
 couples
consisting
 of
 strongly
 basic
 adjacent
 (quinoidic)
 oxygen
 groups
 of
the
 carbon
 deposits
 are
 responsible
 for
 the

for

 be

 over
the
 used

 indicates
 that

 is
 not

We
 therefore
 infer
 that
 the
 present
 ODH
 of
 EB
 over
 the
 doped
CeO2 catalysts
 may
 proceed
 via
 a
 simple
 surface
 redox
 (Mars-
van
 Krevelen)
 mechanism
 [35,36]
 involving
 the
 Ce4+/Ce3+ couple,
in
 which
 the
 catalyst
 undergoes
 reduction
 (by
 EB)
 and
 reoxida-
tion
 (by
 O2)
 cycles.
 In
 this
 context,
 the
 overall
 reaction
 pathway
can
 be
 envisaged
 to
 involve
 a
 delicate
 redox
 mechanism
 involving
the
 Ce4+/Ce3+ couple
 during
 the
 EB
 ODH
 process,
 i.e.
 the
 reaction
proceeds
 by
 a
 facile
 oxygen-transfer
 mechanism
 in
 which
 the
 con-
sumption
 and
 replenishment
 of
 the
 ceria
 lattice
 surface
 oxygen
species
 play
 a
 key
 role
 in
 the
 reaction
 process.
 To
 testify
 this
 hypoth-
esis,
 XPS
 studies
 on
 Ce0.90Ni0.10O
 subjected
 to
 sequential
 EB/O2
exposures
 were
 carried
 out.
 The
 results
 show
 that
 the
 consump-
tion
 and
 replenishment
 of
 the
 lattice
 oxygen,
 as
 reﬂected
 by
 the
distinct
 atmospheric-dependent
 variation
 of
 the
 ratio
 of
 Ce4+/Ce3+,
is
 essential
 for
 this
 reaction.
 These
 ﬁndings
 constitute
 a
 deep
 insight
for
 the
 design
 and
 development
 of
 ceria-based
 catalyst
 system
 that
exhibits
 improved
 activity
 for
 the
 ODH
 of
 EB
 (Fig.
 10).

 Conclusions
In
 summary,
 an
 efﬁcient
 mesostructured
 doped
 ceria
 catalyst
with
 high
 surface
 area
 has
 been
 developed
 for
 the
 ODH
 of
 EB
 to
ST
 using
 O2 as
 oxidant.
 Among
 various
 metal-doped
 ceria
 catalysts
investigated,
 the
 Ni-doped
 samples
 have
 demonstrated
 superior
catalytic
 activity
 for
 the
 ODH
 of
 EB.
 N2 adsorption–desorption
results
 exhibit
 that
 template-assisted
 precipitation
 method
 derived
Ni-doped
 samples
 possess
 mesostructures
 with
 large
 surface
 areas.
Combined
 TPR
 and
 total
 OSC
 results
 conﬁrm
 that,
 in
 compared
 with
pure
 ceria
 sample,
 Ni-doped
 ceria
 samples
 present
 easily
 reducible
oxygen
 species
 and
 improved
 total
 oxygen
 storage
 capacity.
 Our
results
 show
 that
 best
 catalytic
 performance
 can
 be
 attainted
over
 the
 Ce0.90Ni0.10O
 catalyst
 which
 allowing
 a
 steady
 ST
 yield
of
 14.8
 mmolST gcatal. −1 h−1 at
 450 ◦C.
 The
 high
 catalytic
 activity
and
 stability
 of
 the
 Ni-doped
 catalyst
 have
 been
 contributed
 to
the
 enhanced
 oxygen
 mobility,
 and
 modiﬁcations
 of
 structure
 by
introducing
 Ni
 species,
 respectively.
 Furthermore,
 the
 XPS
 results
imply
 that
 the
 ODH
 of
 EB
 over
 the
 doped
 ceria
 catalysts
 may
 pro-
cess
 via
 a
 simple
 surface
 redox
 mechanism
 involving
 Ce4+/Ce3+
couple.
