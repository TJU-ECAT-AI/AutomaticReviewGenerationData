Abstract
MnO2-ZrO2 binary oxide catalytic system was applied for the effective utilization of CO2 as an oxidant in the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation
(EBD) to styrene monomer (SM). MnO2-ZrO2 oxides were prepared by co-precipitation method and characterized as solid solution mixture having
surface area more than 1002 g1. 10% MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst exhibited conversion of 73% with the selectivity of 98% at 650 8C. The
MnO2-ZrO2 binary oxides were X-ray amorphous whereas the individual oxides (MnO2 and ZrO2) having much lower surface areas were
crystalline in nature. As a result, MnO2-ZrO2 binary oxides exhibited greatly elevated catalytic activity for the conversion of ethylbenzene (EB)
than those of individual oxides in the presence of CO2. However, in the absence of CO2 poor catalytic activity and stabilities were observed.
Gradual enhancement of activities were demonstrated in the higher CO2 to EB ratios. Hence, CO2 had a profound role as a soft oxidant by
improving both activity and stability in the EBD over MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts.

1. Introduction
Ethylbenzene dehydrogenation (EBD) is a representative
process for the production of styrene (SM), an important
monomer for synthetic polymers. This is one of the ten most
important industrial petrochemical processes. However, the
present industrial process is thermodynamically limited, energy
consuming, super heated steam obligatory, coke-deactivating,
partially active, and poorly selective [1]. Alternatively,
oxidative EBD has been proposed in order to circumvent
some of the cited difﬁculties [2]. However, in the oxidative
dehydrogenation process the usage of O2 (strong oxidant)
produces unwanted by-products (oxygenates) along with SM
resulting in low selectivity of SM [3]. Hence, alternative
oxidative EBD with CO2 oxidant has been emerging as a
potential process [4–6], because CO2 utilization offer several
advantages in catalysis such as acceleration of the reaction rate,
enhancement in product selectivity, alleviation of thermo-
dynamic equilibrium limitations, suppression of total oxida-
tion, prolonging of catalyst life, and prevention of hot spots on
the catalyst surface. Based on these unique characteristics it has
been coined as a soft oxidant [7,8].
Since the present commercial iron based catalysts are
ineffective for the EBD in the presence of CO2, intensive
explorations have emerged recently in order to develop
compatible catalytic systems that can operate effectively with
CO2. Mimura et al. [9–11] and Badstube et al. [12,13] have
investigated Al2O3 and active carbon (AC) supported alkali
metal promoted iron oxide based catalysts, respectively, for
EBD in the presence of CO2. The effective utilization of CO2
was accomplished in our earlier publications over zeolite and
ZrO2 supported iron oxides [8,14], Al2O3 supported vanadium
and vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts [15–17]. In our recent
report, the inﬂuence of CO2 over ZrO2 has been described,
wherein enhancement in conversion of EB as well as
selectivity towards SM in presence of CO2 oxidant was
observed [18]. Furthermore, catalytic activity of ZrO2 has been
signiﬁcantly improved when it was mixed with TiO2 [19].
Presently, the study has been extended to MnO2-ZrO2 mixed
oxides, based on our results on TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide
catalysts. In the present publication, apart from the general
catalytic activity studies of MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides in the
dehydrogenation of EB to SM, the role of CO2 as a soft oxidant
has been delineated.

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides were prepared by co-precipitation
method taking zirconyl nitrate and manganese nitrate as
precursors and aqueous ammonia solution was used as a
hydrolyzing agent. In a typical experiment, 0.1 M mixed
aqueous solution of respective precursors was stirred at room
temperature for 0.5 h. After attainment of homogeneous
solution, requisite amount of aqueous ammonia solution was
added until the pH of the solution reached 9 and the stirring was
continued further 1 h followed by aging at 100 8C for 12 h. The
resultant precipitate was ﬁltered off under reduced pressure and
washed thoroughly with water and dried at 120 8C for 12 h in
oven and ﬁnally calcined at 550 8C for 6 h in a mufﬂe furnace.
Individual oxides (MnO2 and ZrO2) were prepared adopting the
same procedure. In order to ﬁnd out the EBD activity on MnO2
and ZrO2 solid solution, 50% MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide was
further calcined at 650, 750 and 850 8C.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
BET surface area of the catalyst was measured by nitrogen
adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature (196 8C) using
pulse chemisorb 2705 (Micromeritics Instrument Co., USA).
The catalysts were evacuated for 2 h at 200 8C prior to the
experiment. Bulk density was estimated on the basis of mass
and volume of the catalysts.
X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded on a
Rigaku X-ray Diffractometer (Multiﬂex, Japan), with Ni
ﬁltered Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.5406 A
˚ ) operated at 50 kV
and 50 mA in the 2u range of 10–908 with scan speed of
48 min1.
Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 (5%
NH3 in helium) and CO2 (5% CO2 in helium) studies were
performed using pulse chemisorb 2705 (Micromeritics Instru-
ment Co., USA). In the individual TPD experiments either NH3
or CO2 was adsorbed at 100 8C for 30 min and purged at the
same temperature with helium gas (20 ml/min) for the removal
of the physisorbed gasses, followed by desorption of the gasses
from 100 to 700 8C at a heating rate of 5 8C/min.
2.3. Reaction and analysis
The catalytic activity studies were performed in a ﬁxed bed
continuous ﬂow stainless steel reactor (i.d., 4.5 mm and length,
300 mm). Typically, 1.0 g of catalyst sample was loaded into
the reactor with the support of quartz wool. The reactor was
heated to 600 8C in presence of N2 ﬂow (20 ml/min) at the rate
of 2 8C/min and pretreated at this temperature for 2 h then
altered to the reaction temperature and pretreated with CO2
(20 ml/min) prior to conducting the reaction for 0.5 h. EB was
introduced by a peristaltic pump with a feed ﬂow rate of
9.8 mmol/h along with either N2 or N2 + CO2. Unless otherwise
speciﬁed contact time (W/F) is 16.73 g h/mole at 5.1 molar
ratio of CO2 to EB. Contact time (W/F) is deﬁned as the weight
of the catalyst in grams divided by the sum of the ﬂow rates of
the reactants and nitrogen in moles per hour. Gaseous and liquid
products were analyzed simultaneously by on-line GC (Younlin
Instrument, Acme 6000 series, Korea) equipped with TCD and
FID. Poropak N 80/100 column (6 ft  1/8
00) was used for the
analysis of gaseous products such as hydrogen, nitrogen,
carbon monoxide, methane, and carbon dioxide. HP-innowax
column (30 m long, 0.32 mm i.d. and 0.25 mm ﬁlm thickness)
was used for the analysis of liquid products in which, SM is the
major product, and benzene, toluene, benzaldehyde, and
acetophenone were minor/trace products.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physico-chemical properties of MnO2-ZrO2 mixed
oxides
The surface areas of individual oxides of MnO2, ZrO2 and
their mixed oxides (MnO2-ZrO2) were depicted in Table 1. The
surface areas of all the mixed oxides are much higher than that
of individual oxides, whereas the bulk densities are lighter than
either MnO2 or ZrO2 (Table 1). The mixed oxides were X-ray
amorphous or poorly crystalline, whereas both MnO2 and ZrO2
are purely crystalline (Fig. 1). The TPD of NH3 and CO2 of
individual oxides (MnO2 and ZrO2) and 10% MnO2-ZrO2
mixed oxide reveal that the individual oxides possessed fewer
number of acidic as well as basic sites than 10% MnO2-ZrO2
mixed oxide (Figs. 2 and 3). The mixed oxides calcined at
higher temperatures (>650 8C) were transformed into crystal-
line materials (Fig. 4). The formation of amorphous, high

surface area, and low density mixed oxide of ZrO2 based binary
oxides during the stages of preparation are reported [19,20]. In
accordance with our previous publication, ZrO2 contributes
towards the activation of CO2 based on its crystallographic
phases [18] and acid–base capacities [20]. The addition of
MnO2, chosen not only for the enhancement in acid base
properties of mixed oxide but also for its redox properties [21],
anticipated the improved performance for the dehydrogenation
of EB to SM in presence of CO2.
3.2. Catalytic activity
EBD over MnO2, ZrO2, and 10% MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide
in the presence of CO2 was shown in the Fig. 5. The superior
activity of MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide over its respective
individual oxides might be due to generation of active sites
during the stages of mixed oxide catalyst preparation as
described above. Mimura and Saito also reported that either
Al2O3 or Fe2O3 is inferior to Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts for the EBD
in the presence of CO2 and explained that special interaction
between iron oxide and alumina might be necessary for higher
activity [9]. EB conversion on MnO2 was higher than ZrO2 but
the average selectivity (total 6 h selectivity averaged) was
lower. The combination of redox and acid base bi-functional
mechanism might be responsible for the higher activity of
MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides. However, further studies are
necessary for the elucidation of the mechanism. Marginal
decrease in activity of MnO2, ZrO2, and MnO2-ZrO2 mixed
oxide might be due to coke deposition.
The inﬂuence of MnO2 and ZrO2 composition in the EBD
with time on stream in the presence of CO2 was shown in Fig. 6.
Almost all the studied compositions were catalytically active
with little variation. However, 10% MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide
catalyst was found to be the best. It showed that the contribution
of the ZrO2 surface was clearly necessary for the effective
activation of CO2.
In order to ﬁnd out the role of pretreatment, the catalyst was
treated with CO2 (20 ml/min) at the reaction temperature at
different lengths of time from 0.5 to 12 h (Fig. 7). The catalysts

pretreated with CO2 for 0.5–1 h showed marginal hike in
activity. The reason for the small hike in activity with CO2
pretreatment might be adsorption of certain amount of CO2
facilitates the reaction instead of competitive adsorption of both
EB and CO2 at a time. The catalysts pretreated for more than
1 h showed reduction in activity, but the total deactivation has
not been detected even after 12 h pretreatment with CO2. The
decrease in activity with longer pretreatment periods might be
due to neutralization of some of the active basic sites by CO2.
The catalytic activity of 50% MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides
calcined at different temperatures for the EBD in presence of
CO2 was shown in Fig. 8. The MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide
calcined at 550 8C exhibited higher conversion and selectivity.
The catalytic activity decreased with increased calcination
temperatures. The change in phases from amorphous to
crystalline (Fig. 4) drastically decreased the EB conversion
and SM selectivity.
3.3. Effects of reaction conditions
EB conversion and SM selectivity as a function of reaction
temperature, was shown in Fig. 9. The conversion of EB
increased monotonically with increase in reaction temperature
from 450 to 650 8C. Surprisingly the selectivity to SM was
maintained at 98% at higher temperatures (600 and 650 8C).
Sugino et al. reported that the conversion of EB increased
sharply with reaction temperature over active carbon supported
iron catalyst wherein the yield of SM was 20% at 500 8C and
rose to 47% at 600 8C but the selectivity dropped from 99 to
85% [22]. In a recent report [23], decrease in SM selectivity
with reaction temperature over Cr-MCM-41 was mainly due to

enhancement in benzene and toluene formation. The sharp
increase, in EB conversion with reaction temperatures over
MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides was observed. Similar behavior in
EB conversion with reaction temperature was reported in earlier
publications [22,23].
The effect of contact time (W/F) on the conversion of EB
was shown in Fig. 10. The data were obtained by varying the
weight of the catalyst keeping the ﬂow rates of EB as well as
CO2 constant at 10.2 molar ratios of CO2 to EB. The conversion
of EB was 46.81% at the contact time of 8.37 g h/mole. The EB
conversion was considerably increased to 72.81% with increase
in contact time to 16.73 g h/mole. Further increase of contact
time to 25.1 and 33.46 g h/mole, increased EB conversions to
75.33 and 78.15%, respectively. However as this increase in
contact time did not inﬂuence the EB conversion considerably,
the contact time was ﬁxed at 16.73 g h/mole.
The catalytic activity of 25% MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide
catalyst for EBD in the presence of CO2 and its absence was
shown in Table 2. The selectivity of SM is always constant at
about 98% under either N2 or CO2 atmosphere, whereas the
conversion under CO2 atmosphere was higher than under N2
atmosphere except for the ﬁrst 2 h of time on stream. The initial
low activity was observed with CO2 when the catalyst was not
pretreated with CO2. The constant selectivity with decreasing
conversion under N2 atmosphere represents that both the yields
of SM as well as by-products were diminished with the time on
stream. In other words, the catalyst deactivation rate was more
under N2 atmosphere rather than CO2 atmosphere. It can be
explained that the catalyst deactivation might be taking place due
to coke deposition. In the presence of CO2, certain amount of
coke might be converting into CO [24]. As a result the rate of
catalyst deactivation decreases. Similar catalytic behavior in the
presence of CO2 over Cr/Cab-O-Sil catalyst for the EBD was
reported [24]. The maximum difference in conversion of EB was
5% over 10% MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst at 600 8C in the
presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. Theyield of SM
in the presence of CO2 was 2.5 times higher than that in the
absence of CO2 at 550 8C over V/MgO catalyst [25].
The inﬂuence of CO2 was also determined by varying the
feed composition of CO2 and EB. The conversion of EB at
different feed ratios of CO2 to EB over 10% MnO2-ZrO2 mixed
oxide catalyst at 650 8C was depicted in Fig. 11. The
conversion of EB in the absence of CO2 was 64.25%, which
was increased to 72.82% when N2 (N2/EB = 10.2) was replaced
by CO2 (CO2/EB = 10.2) in the feed. The increase in the
conversion of EB was observed with increase in the amount of
CO2 in the feed up to CO2 to EB ratio of 10.2. At a CO2 to EB
ratio of 15.3, the conversion of EB was decreased. Similar trend
was observed in the catalytic activity pattern of activated
carbon supported iron catalysts for the dehydrogenation of EB
[12]. It seems that optimum concentration of surface CO2 could
be required to get high stability and activity due to the
competitive adsorption of CO2 and EB onto the catalyst surface.
Therefore, 10% MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst showed the
optimum activity and stability at the CO2 to EB ratio of 10.2
due to the adequate balance for the adsorption and activation of
CO2 and EB.

4. Conclusions
MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts were demonstrated to be
highly active in the dehydrogenation of EB to SM in the
presence of CO2. The best results were obtained over 10% of
MnO2 loaded on ZrO2 catalyst at 650 8C with a conversion of
73% and the selectivity to styrene was about 98%. CO2
attributed to the enhancement in catalytic activity by the
oxidative conversion as well as catalytic life by suppressing the
coke deposition.
