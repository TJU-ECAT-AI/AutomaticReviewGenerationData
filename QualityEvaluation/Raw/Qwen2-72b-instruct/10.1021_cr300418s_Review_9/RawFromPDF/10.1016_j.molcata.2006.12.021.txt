Abstract
By varying the composition of TiO2 and ZrO2, various TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation method using
ammonium hydroxide as a hydrolyzing agent. Similarly, TiO2 and ZrO2 isolated oxides were also prepared for the purpose of comparison.
60 mol% TiO2 + 40 mol% ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst (here after simply termed as TiO2-ZrO2) was impregnated with different amounts of potassium
oxide (K2O). These catalysts were characterized by BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature programmed desorption of NH3.
K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high performance towards the selective conversion of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of CO2, wherein
K2O improved the conversion of ethylbenzene and selectivity of styrene acting as a basic promoter, similarly CO2 enhanced both conversion and
selectivity acting as an oxidant as well as a diluent. The uniﬁed promotional effects of K2O and CO2 improved the conversion of ethylbenzene up
to 60–65% at 95–99% selectivity levels of styrene.

1. Introduction
Currently, more than 80% of styrene is produced based on the
catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at high temperatures
(>600 ◦C) with promoted iron oxide catalysts in the presence
of large excess of superheated steam. The major disadvantage
of this process is its reversible reaction, which imposing a ther-
modynamic limitation [1]. Low conversion of ethylbenzene, low
selectivity of styrene and high energy consumption of the present
process has been the driving force for the exploration of alterna-
tive technologies [1]. Developments are going on to increase the
conversion and selectivity by the removal of the reaction product
hydrogen and thereby shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium
towards products direction. The oxidative dehydrogenation of
ethylbenzene has been proposed to be free from thermodynamic
limitations regarding conversion and operating at lower temper-
atures with an exothermic reaction, but the low selectivity of
styrene is the major drawback of this process [2].

Alternatively, it has been realized that the carbon dioxide
(CO2) utilization as a diluent as well as a mild oxidant will
be the technologically important advancement. Because,
CO2 utilization offers several advantages, like acceleration
of the reaction rate, enhancement in the product selectivity,
diminishing of thermodynamic limitations, suppression of total
oxidation, prolonging of catalyst life, prevention of hotspots
and so on. Hence, several research groups including us have
been exploring the possibility of CO2 utilization in the dehy-
drogenation of ethylbenzene over different catalysts such as
F2O3, V2O5, Sb2O5, Cr2O3, CuO, CeO2, ZrO2, La2O3, alkali
metals, etc., on different supports [3–10]. Among these reports,
Sakurai et al. [3] found that the conversion of ethylbenzene
in the presence of CO2 is 14% higher than in the presence of
argon over carbon supported V2O5 catalysts. Sugino et al. [6]
reported that the active carbon supported and alkali metal oxide
promoted iron catalysts showed better activity in the presence
of CO2. Mimura et al. [7] realized that 10% Fe2O3/Al2O2 with
proper amount of CaO is highly effective in the presence of
CO2. Sun et al. [11] demonstrated that the selectivity of styrene
can be improved to 95–99% at the conversion levels of 50% over
chromium promoted and alumina supported vanadium catalysts

in the presence of CO2. We investigated the dehydrogenation of
ethylbenzene with CO2 over a ZSM-5 supported iron oxide cat-
alyst and found that ethylbenzene was predominantly converted
into styrene via an oxidative manner, wherein CO2 played
the role of an oxidant in order to improve catalytic activity as
well as coke resistance of the catalyst remarkably [9,10]. The
role of CO2 has thoroughly been investigated over alumina
supported vanadium catalysts with a vide varieties of promoters
[12–15].
Recently, in one of our recent reports the enhanced activity
of ZrO2 in the presence of CO2 has been described [16]. In
another report, we illustrated the signiﬁcant enhancement in
the catalytic activity of ZrO2 when it is mixed with MnO2 [17].
Apart from MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst system, we found
that CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst supported on SBA-15
showed remarkable catalytic activity in the presence CO2 [18].
These two series of mixed oxide catalysts showed superior
activity to their individual oxides (ZrO2, TiO2 and CeO2).
Based on these results TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts has
been investigated. Furthermore, we found that these TiO2-ZrO2
mixed oxide catalysts can be further improved up to the stage of
complete suppression of by-products by neutralizing the strong
acidic sites by K2O addition. TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst
system with K2O promoter has not yet been reported for the
dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence
of CO2.
Hence, in the present report, the preparation, characterization
and catalytic performance of K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts for
the selective dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene
emphasizing the synergistic inﬂuence of K2O and CO2 have
been delineated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the catalysts
Various loadings of TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts were
prepared by co-precipitation method. In a typical experiment,
by taking the requisite amounts of zirconyl(IV) nitrate hydrate
(Acros Organics, USA, 99.5%) and titanium(IV) chloride
(Yakuri Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd., Japan), homogeneous 0.1 M
aqueous mixed salt solution was made under mechanical
stirring. To this homogeneous salt solution requisite amount of
ammonium hydroxide (DC Chemicals Co. Ltd., Korea, Assay
25.0–28.0%) was added until the pH of the solution reached
to 8 under constant mechanical stirring at room temperature.
The resultant white precipitate was separated by ﬁltration
under reduced pressures and washed with de-ionized water
several times until the complete removal of chloride ions,
followed by drying at 120 ◦C for 12 h and calcination at 600 ◦C
for 6 h in a mufﬂe furnace. TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide was
impregnated with 1, 2, 3 and 4 wt.% K2O wherein, potassium
carbonate (Aldrich, USA) was used as a precursor for K2O
promoter. After the impregnation, all these samples were dried
at 120 ◦C for 12 h, and calcined at 600 ◦C for 6 h in static air
atmosphere.
2.2. Catalytic activity test
The catalytic activity studies were performed in a ﬁxed
bed down ﬂow stainless steel reactor (i.d. 4.5 mm and length
300 mm) under atmospheric pressure. In a typical experiment,
approximately 1.0 g of the catalyst sample was loaded with the
support of quartz wool and subjected to the catalyst pretreat-
ment at 600 ◦C for 0.5 h in the ﬂow of N2 (20 ml/min). After the
completion of the pretreatment, the reaction was conducted at
different temperatures either in the ﬂow of N2 or CO2. Ethyl-
benzene was introduced by a peristaltic pump with a feed rate
of 9.8 mmol/h along with either CO2 or N2. Products were ana-
lyzed by a gas chromatogram (Younglin Instrument, Acme 6000
series, Korea) equipped with TCD and FID.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
BET surface areas of the catalysts were determined using
Chemisorp 2705 unit (Micromeritics Instrument Co., USA). All
the samples were pretreated at 200 ◦C for 4 h before measure-
ment. N2 was used as an adsorbate gas and the measurements
were performed at 77 K.
X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded using a Rigaku,
Miniﬂex, diffractometer with a nickel ﬁltered Cu K radiation
of wave length 1.5418 ˚
A at a voltage of 40 kV and a current
of 100 mA up to 80◦of 2θ range for the veriﬁcation of struc-
tural aspects of TiO2, ZrO2, TiO2-ZrO2 and K2O/TiO2-ZrO2
catalysts.
Acidity measurements were performed by temperature pro-
grammed desorption of NH3 using Chemisorp 2705 unit
(Micromeritics Instrument Co.) equipped with thermal con-
ductivity detector (TCD). Typically, ca. 50 mg of catalyst was
pretreated in ﬂowing helium at 500 ◦C for 1 h, cooled to 100 ◦C
and allowed to expose 5% NH3 in helium gas mixture with a ﬂow
rate of 20 ml/min for 30 min and subsequently the adsorbed NH3
was purged with helium gas at the same temperature for 1 h to
remove the physisorbed NH3. The chemisorbed NH3 was mea-
sured in ﬂowing helium gas with the ﬂow rate of 20 ml/min from
100 to 800 ◦C with the heating rate of 10 ◦C/min.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physico-chemical properties of the catalysts
The TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst exhibited high surface
area, amorphous phase and profound acid–base bi-functional
properties. Similar observation was reported by several authors
at various ratios of TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts [19–21].
The BET surface areas and the crystalline phases are depicted
in Table 1. The estimated BET surface area of TiO2-ZrO2 is
135 m2/g.
By the addition of 1, 2, 3 and 4 wt.% of K2O to TiO2-ZrO2
the BET surface areas have been decreased to 118, 108, 96 and
89 m2/g, respectively, which are shown in Table 1. The dimin-
ishing trend in the BET surface areas with the increased amount
of K2O might be due to the blockage of certain pores. Mao et
al. [21] reported that the surface area of TiO2-ZrO2 was dra-

matically decreased from 103 to 45.9 m2/g by the addition of
8% B2O3 to TiO2-ZrO2. This behavior was explained on the
basis of the blockage of micropores that are present in the TiO2-
ZrO2 mixed oxide. The XRD data depicted in Table 1 and shown
in Fig. 1 have clearly been indicating the monoclinic phase of
ZrO2, rutile phase of TiO2 and amorphous phase of TiO2-ZrO2
mixed oxide catalyst.
The change of phases from crystalline to amorphous has
been reported by several authors during the stages of TiO2-
ZrO2 mixed oxide preparation [22,23]. Although the TiO2-ZrO2
mixed oxide is in the amorphous phase, its K2O promoted coun-
terparts exhibited crystalline behavior with the anatase phase of
TiO2 as shown in Fig. 2. Due to the K2O addition, anatase TiO2
phase separation has been observed. Neither ZrO2 crystalline
phases nor TiO2 rutile phase has been observed from the XRD
results.

3.1.1. Acidic properties of the catalysts
The acidic properties have been determined by the
well-known TPD technique for the best catalyst (3% K2O/TiO2-
ZrO2) and also for the purpose of comparison the NH3 TPD
patterns were also generated forTiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide, TiO2
and ZrO2. As shown in Fig. 3, the NH3 TPD patterns have been
indicating that the wide distribution of acidic sites from weak to
strong in isolated oxides (TiO2 and ZrO2) and TiO2-ZrO2 mixed
oxide. The acidic sites in TiO2 are much less in number, but are
distributed uniformly from weak acidic sites to strong acidic
sites. In ZrO2 weak to moderate acidic sites are more or less
equal in number, whereas the strong acidic sites are compara-
tively higher. In the case of TiO2-ZrO2 and 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2
catalysts the acid site distribution and their number are entirely
different from TiO2 and ZrO2. The number of weak to moder-
ate acidic sites in TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide is very high, but the
strong acidic sites are comparable to TiO2 and ZrO2. In the case
of 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst only weak to moderated acidic
sites are present. Almost all strong acidic sites and some weak
to moderate acidic sites present in TiO2-ZrO2 have been neu-
tralized by K2O. Fung and Wang studied the changes in the acid
base properties of TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides after K2O addition
and reported that at minimum loading of K2O strong acids get
poisoned, with the increase in K2O loading simultaneously both
moderate and weak acidic sites were neutralized [24,25].
3.2. Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
3.2.1. Inﬂuence of TiO2 loading
The inﬂuence of TiO2 content in TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide
catalysts including TiO2 and ZrO2 for the dehydrogenation
of ethylbenzene into styrene have been shown in Fig. 4. The
catalytic performance of ZrO2 and TiO2 is inferior to all the
TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts. The enhancement in cat-
alytic activity of TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts might be
due to huge hike in weak to moderate acidic sites compared
to either TiO2 or ZrO2 and other changes in the physico-
chemical properties such as BET surface area and crystalline
properties. Among the various mixed oxide catalysts TiO2-ZrO2
mixed oxide catalyst showed highest activity towards the con-
version of ethylbenzene. Based on the high performance of

TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst; it has been utilized for further
studies.
3.2.2. Inﬂuence of K2O on TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst
Physico-chemical and catalytic properties have been changed
signiﬁcantly due to K2O addition to TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide
catalyst. From Fig. 5 it is clear that the K2O promoter has a
substantial positive inﬂuence in converting ethylbenzene over
TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2. The catalytic activ-
ity of unpromoted TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst is higher in
the ﬁrst 2 h of time on stream, but latter on its activity has shown
a marginal diminishing trend due to coke deposition. Contrarily,
the activity of K2O promoted TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts has continu-
ously been increasing with the increase in reaction time up to 7 h
of time on stream. The maximum conversion on 3% K2O/TiO2-
ZrO2 is 57.39%, but on TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst it is only 46.97%.
The difference in the maximum conversion of ethylbenzene over
K2O promoted and unpromoted TiO2-ZrO2 is 10.42%. In other
words, the hike in the conversion of ethylbenzene is 10.42% due
to usage of K2O promoter under the speciﬁed reaction condi-
tions. The catalytic activities of K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts in the
ﬁrst 2 h of time on stream are much lower than that of TiO2-ZrO2
Fig. 5. Conversion of ethylbenzene with respect to time on stream (K2O loading
is in wt.%). Reaction conditions: weight of the catalyst, 1.0 g; ethylbenzene ﬂow

mixed oxide catalyst, but after third hour of time on stream the
catalytic activity has been increased signiﬁcantly. The initial low
activities of K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts are unclear. However, it
has been reported that the initial low activity of certain catalysts
in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in presence of
CO2 [26].
The catalytic activity comparison of various loadings of K2O
promoter on TiO2-ZrO2 can be seen from Fig. 5, wherein, the
increase of ethylbenzene conversion with increase in K2O load-
ing from 1 to 3% has been noticed. But the activity of 4% K2O
loaded catalyst is inferior to 3% K2O loaded TiO2-ZrO2 cata-
lyst. Based on these results, 3% K2O loading can be considered
as the optimum loading on TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst for the higher
conversion of ethylbenzene. In the present context the role of
K2O promoter is not yet fully understood.
However,itcanbeassumedthatK2Oactsasanelectronicpro-
moter. Other possibility is that the crystallites of TiO2 anatase
phase that is separated from the mixed oxide phase might be
contributing for the enhancement in the conversion of ethylben-
zene. Alternatively, acid–base active site compatibility might
have taken place due to neutralization of strong acidic sites that
are present in the TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst as observed
from the TPD results (Fig. 3) and also the other possibility is
that K2O promoter as a basic oxide might be facilitating the acti-
vation of CO2. However, it is difﬁcult to draw any conclusion at
the present moment regarding the enhancement in activity with
the K2O promoter.
3.2.3. Combined inﬂuence of K2O and CO2 on the
dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over TiO2-ZrO2 mixed
oxide catalyst
To examine the combined inﬂuence of K2O and CO2 in
the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene four separate experiments
were conducted under similar reaction conditions by changing
the reaction environment with and without CO2 over TiO2-ZrO2
mixed oxide catalyst and 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst, respec-
tively, and the results are displayed in Fig. 6. The conversion
of ethyl benzene over TiO2-ZrO2 in the nitrogen atmosphere
is 52.19%, which has been signiﬁcantly increased to 60.59%

in the presence CO2 and furthermore, the selectivity of styrene
is also increased to 97.09% from 94.6%. Similarly, the conver-
sion and the selectivity have been substantially increased even
in the presence of nitrogen over 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst,
which is due to the effect of K2O promoter. The catalytic activ-
ity of 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst has dramatically increased
in the presence of CO2, which is due to the combined pro-
motional effects of both K2O promoter and CO2. In order to
explain the combined promotional effects, the data obtained
over TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst in the presence of nitrogen has been
compared with the data obtained on 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 cat-
alyst in the presence of CO2. The conversion of ethylbenzene
over TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst in the presence of nitrogen is 52.19%,
which has been increased to 71.95% over 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2
catalyst in the presence of CO2. Indeed, the hike in the conver-
sion is 19.76%, which is exceptionally high improvement and
in addition selectivity has almost reached to 100% (99.63%).
Still, the conversion is much lower than the equilibrium con-
versions of ethylbenzene in the presence of CO2 as reported
by Qin et al. [27], wherein, it is reported that the 25.2% of
ethylbenzene conversion in the simple dehydrogenation can be
elevated to 82.4% at 550 ◦C when the ethylbenzene dehydro-
genation reaction coupled with reverse water gas shift reaction
(CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O). However, the data obtained over 3%
K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst is worth noting, particularly in the
selectivity point of view. There are certain reports concerning the
higher selectivities such as 99–100%, but at the lower conver-
sionlevelsofethylbenzene[11].Thehigherselectivityofstyrene
over 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst can be explained mainly based
on two reasons. The ﬁrst one is the suppression of dealkylation
products by neutralizing the strong acidic sites of TiO2-ZrO2
catalyst by optimal amount of K2O addition as evidenced from
the NH3 TPD results that shown in Fig. 3. The second reason
is that the hydrogen produced in the simple dehydrogenation
is converting into water by the coupling of reverse water gas
shift reaction. Hence, there is less scope for the hydrogenol-
ysis and its subsequent reactions, consequently selectivity of
styrene increased remarkably. As reported by Dulamita et al.
[28], if the surface basic sites are strong enough to abstract
-hydrogen from ethylbenzene, the break of the lateral C–C
bond is promoted and, therefore, the selectivity to toluene will
increase. If the catalyst surface acidity is larger, -hydrogen can
be abstracted from ethylbenzene and the break of the phenyl–C
bond become more probably, therefore, a higher selectivity
to benzene will be obtained. The data are suggesting that the
basic sites are not strong enough to convert ethylbenzene into
toluene.
The high activity of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 is
due to the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface to produce
active oxygen species. This oxygen species oxidizes H2 that
produced in the simple ethylbenzene dehydrogenation process
intoH2Obyreversewater–gasshiftreactionandtherebyreleases
the limitation of thermodynamic equilibrium. As it is evidenced
from the literature, the energy required for the production of one
ton styrene when coupled with reverse water gas shift reaction
is CO2 is 6.3 × 108, whereas, in the simple dehydrogenation
is 1.5 × 109 cal [26]. Due to facile conversion of ethylbenzene
into styrene in the presence of CO2, the selectivity of styrene
increased dramatically as shown in Fig. 6.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst is promising for
the selective dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the
presence excess of CO2. As evidenced from the TPD of NH3
weak to moderate acidic sites are essential for the selective
production of styrene, whereas the strong acidic sites lead to
the formation of by-products. 3 wt% K2O addition to TiO2-
ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst neutralized the strong acidic sites
that are responsible for coke deposition and the formation of
unwanted by-products. CO2 enhanced the conversion of ethyl-
benzene and styrene selectivity acting as oxidant and diluent.
Hence, the uniﬁed effects of K2O and CO2 enhanced both
the conversion of ethylbenzene and the selectivity of styrene
signiﬁcantly.
