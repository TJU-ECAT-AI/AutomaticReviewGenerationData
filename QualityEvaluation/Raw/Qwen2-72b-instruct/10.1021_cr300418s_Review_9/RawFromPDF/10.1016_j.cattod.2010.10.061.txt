Doping of anatase TiO2 with Au and Fe has been investigated using DFT methods. The geometry distortion,
charge and spin density distribution in the lattice and oxygen vacancy formation energies calculated for
the Au- and Fe-doped materials are compared with those of undoped titania, and the inﬂuence of the
dopant atom on the way of interaction and activation of molecular O2 on oxygen vacancy defects in
reduced surfaces is analyzed in detail. An enhanced oxidation activity is expected for Fe-doped TiO2.

1. Introduction
Gold nanoparticles supported on transition metal oxides are
highly active catalysts in a number of oxidation reactions, the most
widely studied being the oxidation of CO at low temperatures
[1–9]. The research effort devoted to understand the reasons for
the strong inﬂuence of the method of preparation and pretreat-
ment conditions on the activity of supported gold catalysts has
revealed the role of gold coordination and oxidation state, par-
ticle size and shape, and charge transfer between gold and the
support. The higher oxidation activity of gold nanoparticles sup-
ported on reducible oxides such as TiO2, Fe2O3, or CeO2 has been
remarked [7–13], and a key role of the support for the stabilization
of small clusters or cationic gold species, the activation of molec-
ular O2 and the direct participation of oxygen atoms of the oxide
surface in the reaction mechanism have been proposed [13–16].
In particular, the excellent oxidation activity of Au/CeO2 catalysts
has been related to the facility to form oxygen vacancy defects on
ceria surfaces, which arises from the ability of cerium to change
oxidation state from Ce4+ to Ce3+ [17]. In this sense, the enhanced
activity for CO oxidation of catalysts consisting of gold nanoclusters
supported on nanocrystalline ceria as compared to convention-
ally prepared Au/CeO2 catalysts has been attributed to the higher
concentration of Ce3+ in small CeO2 nanoparticles [10,11,18,19]. If

Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from
the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore
the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the
oxygen vacancy energy formation. Recent theoretical [20,21] and
spectroscopic [22] studies have shown that nanoparticulated ceria
is able to stabilize small neutral gold clusters and also to incor-
porate cationic Au species into the lattice, and that this doping
process reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation. Moreover,
the complete catalytic cycle for CO oxidation on Au/CeO2 has been
calculated using density functional theory, and it has been shown
that substitutional Au3+ cations dispersed in the ceria lattice are
able to catalyze the oxidation of CO with O2 and close the cycle
without catalyst deactivation [23]. The same principle of promoting
the oxidation activity of cerium oxide by doping with gold has been
applied to other metals such as Ti, Zr, Hf, Pt or Pd, whose presence
weakens the metal–oxygen bonds around the dopant decreasing
the energy necessary to form a oxygen vacancy defect [24–27]. A
similar strategy has been employed in the case of titanium dioxide
[28,29], which is widely used as support for gold catalysts but is
less reducible than ceria. Theoretical studies indicate that doping
of rutile TiO2(1 1 0) surface with Au, Ag, Cu, Ni, Pd or Pt reduces the
bond of surface oxygen to titania, making it a better oxidation cat-
alyst [30]. Addition of Fe to TiO2 increases the oxidation activity of
Au/TiO2 catalysts by a factor of two, and it has been demonstrated
by theory [31] and experiment [32,33] that the effect of Fe-doping
is to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancy defects on the TiO2
surface. In this paper, we went one step further and investigated the
possibility of anatase TiO2 doping with Au. Although the presence
of Au3+ species in Au/TiO2 catalysts has already been proposed on
the basis of CO adsorption experiments [34,35], their exact nature

and role in the mechanism of CO oxidation by gold supported on
TiO2 have not been unequivocally demonstrated yet.
In this work we have investigated, from a theoretical point of
view, the substitution of one Ti atom in the (0 0 1) surface of anatase
TiO2 with an Au atom, and have compared the results with those
previously obtained for Fe-doping. The geometry distortion, charge
distribution in the lattice, and oxygen vacancy formation energy
calculated for the Au-doped material are described, and the inﬂu-
ence of Au and Fe-doping on the way of interaction and activation
of molecular O2 on oxygen vacancy defects in reduced TiO2 surfaces
is analyzed in detail.
2. Theoretical basis
The (0 0 1) surface of anatase TiO2 was modelled by means of a
3 × 3 supercell slab containing 12 atomic layers, that is, 36 Ti atoms
and 72 O atoms, separated by a vacuum width of ∼21 ˚
A. The Fe-
doped and Au-doped surface models were created by substituting
one ﬁve-coordinated Ti atom at the surface by one Fe or one Au
atom, respectively. A model for a reduced TiO2 surface (r-TiO2)
containing one oxygen vacancy defect was created by removing
one oxygen atom from the stoichiometric TiO2 surface. In a similar
way, reduced r-Fe–TiO2 and r-Au–TiO2 surface models were cre-
ated by removing one oxygen atom from the respective Fe–TiO2
and Au–TiO2 stoichiometric surface models. In all calculations, the
coordinates of the atoms in the three uppermost atomic layers were
fully relaxed, while the rest of the atoms were kept ﬁxed as in the
bulk. In a second step, molecular O2 was adsorbed on the three
reduced surfaces containing a oxygen vacancy defect, and the coor-
dinates of the adsorbate molecule and of the atoms in the three
uppermost atomic layers were again fully relaxed. Harmonic OO
vibrational frequencies were calculated by diagonalizing the block
Hessian matrix corresponding to displacements of the two O atoms
of molecular O2 and the Ti, Fe and Au atoms directly interacting with
these two O atoms.
Calculations are based on density functional theory (DFT)
and were performed using the Perdew–Wang (PW91) exchange-
correlation functional within the generalized gradient approach
(GGA) [36,37]. The valence density was expanded in a plane wave
basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 415 eV, and the effect of
the core electrons in the valence density was taken into account by
means of the projected augmented wave (PAW) formalism [38] as
implemented in the VASP code [39,40]. Integration in the recipro-
cal space was carried out at the  k-point of the Brillouin zone.
The atomic positions were optimized by means of a conjugate-
gradient algorithm until atomic forces were smaller than 0.01 eV/ ˚
A.
Since creation of a oxygen vacancy defect in TiO2 leaves two elec-
trons localized in adjacent Ti atoms, and because the introduction
of a Au or Fe atom in the lattice leads to unpaired electrons, spin
polarization effects were always taken into account. For each sys-
tem, states with different number of unpaired electrons N–N
were considered, and the optimized geometries, charge distribu-
tions and interaction energies obtained for each N–N ﬁxed value
are compared and discussed. Charge distributions were estimated
using the theory of atoms in molecules (AIM) of Bader employing
the algorithm developed by Henkelman et al. [41,42]. It should be
mentioned that the electronic properties of transition metal oxides,
such as band gap, and the localization of the extra electrons left in
the oxide after creation of a oxygen vacancy defect, are not well
described at the GGA-DFT level employed in this work [43,44]. The
use of hybrid functionals including Hartree–Fock exchange in them
or addition of a correlation Hubbard term to GGA, resulting in the
so-called GGA + U methods, are the two possible ways of improv-
ing the description of these electronic properties. However, it is not
clear whether they provide better geometries and total energies.
Comparison of our GGA geometries and energies with previously
reported GGA + U data [31,45] indicate that the properties we are
analyzing do not signiﬁcantly change with the inclusion of a U term,
and validate the theoretical approach employed in this work.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Stoichiometric and reduced surfaces
In this theoretical study of TiO2 doping with Au and Fe we have
considered the (0 0 1) crystal face of anatase. Although this is not
the most stable surface, it is the most reactive [46] and therefore it
seems interesting to check whether doping can increase its already
higher reactivity. The structures of the stoichiometric and reduced
M–TiO2 surfaces considered, with M = Ti, Au, Fe, are depicted in
Fig. 1 together with the labelling of the most relevant distances ana-
lyzed, and the optimized values of these distances are summarized
in Table 1.
3.1.1. Stoichiometric surfaces
Based on previous work [31], we have only considered one
spin state for each of the three stoichiometric surfaces: a closed
shell solution with all electrons paired for s-TiO2, a state with one
unpaired electron for s-Au–TiO2, and a high spin state with four

unpaired electrons for s-Fe–TiO2. The GGA optimized geometries
of s-TiO2 and s-Fe–TiO2 are equivalent to those obtained at the
GGA + U level. Substitution of one Ti4+ by a Fe3+ in the oxide lattice
does not imply important structural deformations, which is not sur-
prising if we compare the ionic radius of the two cations, 0.68 ˚
A for
Ti4+ and 0.64 ˚
A for Fe3+. The optimized Fe–Ti and Ti–Ti distances
are similar, and only the Fe–O distances in the direction normal
to the surface (r(M–O)b in Fig. 1 and Table 1) are slightly longer
than the corresponding r(Ti–O)b values. Since the ionic radius of
Au3+ (0.86 ˚
A) is larger than that of Ti4+, the structural deformation
caused by Au doping is more important than when doping with
iron, and is reﬂected in a protruding of the gold atom above the
surface plane. Thus, the Au–Ti and Au–O distances along the z-axis
(r(M–Ti)b and r(M–O)b in Fig. 1 and Table 1) are 0.241 ˚
A and 0.705 ˚
A
larger than the corresponding Ti–Ti and Ti–O values, while the geo-
metrical changes within the surface plane (r(M–Ti)a and r(M–O)a
in Fig. 1 and Table 1) are considerably smaller. These differences
between Au and Fe doping are also reﬂected in the substitution
energies Esubs calculated according to:
Esubs = {E(MTi35O72) + E(Ti)} −{E(Ti36O72) + E(M)}
where E(MTi35O72) is the total energy of the doped surface,
E(Ti36O72) the energy of the undoped surface, and E(Ti) and E(M)
are the energies of one isolated Ti or dopant (M = Au, Fe) atoms,
respectively. The doping process is endothermic in both cases, but
the energy necessary to substitute one Ti atom in the oxide lattice
by a Au atom (13.05 eV) is considerably larger than that found for
Fe (6.61 eV).
Table 1 reports the calculated atomic charges qM and spin den-
sities M on the doping M atom and the averaged values on the
other eight ﬁve-coordinated Ti atoms of the surface. The net charge
on each Ti atom is between 2.13 and 2.16 atoms in all systems, indi-
cating that it exists as Ti4+ [31]. The calculated atomic charge on the
Au atom, 1.30, indicates that it exists as a cationic Au3+ species, and
the spin density of 0.07 suggests that the unpaired electron is not
localized on the Au atom but shared among the O atoms directly
bonded to Au. In the case of Fe–TiO2, the spin densities indicate
that three of the four unpaired electrons of the system are local-
ized on the Fe atom, while the other one is shared among the O
atoms directly bonded to Fe.
3.1.2. Reduced surfaces
According to the results obtained in our previous study of oxy-
gen vacancy formation in Fe-doped TiO2 [31], we have considered
a state with two unpaired electrons for reduced r-TiO2, and a
high spin state with four unpaired electrons for r-Fe–TiO2. For
the reduced r-Au–TiO2 surface we explored a high spin solution
(N −N = 3) and a low spin solution (N −N = 1) that was found to
be the most stable by 1.80 eV and is therefore the only one discussed
next. In all cases, creation of the oxygen vacancy defect causes a
considerable lengthening of the distance between the M and Ti
atoms that were connected by the missing oxygen atom r(M–Ti)V,
from ∼3.8 ˚
A to 4.792–5.078 ˚
A. This large distortion is caused by the
repulsion between the two extra electrons that are left in the oxide
after creation of the vacancy, and which are totally or partially local-
ized on the M and Ti atoms in direct contact with the vacancy. In
fact, the degree of localization of these two electrons depends on
the theoretical approach employed in the calculations. For the most
studied case, that is bulk anatase, a solution with the two electrons
clearly localized on the two Ti atoms in direct contact with the
vacancy is only obtained at the GGA + U level using a U value equal
or larger than 4, or with the hybrid B3LYP method. However, a solu-
tion with one electron localized on a Ti atom that is reduced from
Ti4+ to Ti3+ and the other electron delocalized is very close in energy
to the fully localized solution both at the GGA + U (with U = 3) and
B3LYP levels [45]. This means that while the degree of electron
localization and therefore the description of the electronic proper-
ties of reduced TiO2 strongly vary with the methodology employed,
the energies involved in the formation of defects are quite indepen-
dent of the method, and therefore these energy values can be more
reliably discussed.
In this work, using the GGA approach without any correction,
we obtain a semilocalized solution with one electron localized on
the Ti atom (labelled M in Fig. 1 and Table 1) and the other one delo-
calized among the other Ti atoms of the surface. The net charge on
this Ti atom decreases from 2.16 to 2.01 e, and the calculated spin
density on it is 0.70, indicating that it has been reduced to Ti3+. In
the Au-doped surface one of the electrons associated to the defect is
localized on the Au atom, whose atomic charge decreases from 1.30
to 0.92 e, suggesting a reduction from formal oxidation state Au3+
to Au+. According to the calculated spin density, the unpaired elec-
tron is on the Au atom, and the Ti atom in contact with the vacancy
does not change its oxidation state. Reduction of the Fe-doped sur-
face is similar. The calculated spin density on the Fe atom increases
from 3.02 to 3.55, and the atomic charge decreases from 1.68 to
1.37 e, indicating that it is reduced from Fe3+ to Fe2+. It should be
mentioned that the net charge on the Ti atom in contact with the
vacancy slightly decreases from 2.13 to 2.08 e. However, such a
small variation together with a negligible spin density on this Ti
atom seems to conﬁrm that, in doped surfaces, creation of a oxy-
gen vacancy defect does not modify the oxidation state of the Ti
atoms.
Finally, the energy necessary to create a oxygen vacancy defect
Ef has been calculated as:
Ef = E(MTi35O71) + (1/2)E(O2) −E(MTi35O72)
where E(MTi35O71) is the total energy of the reduced surface model,
E(MTi35O72) is the total energy of the stoichiometric surface, and
E(O2) is the total energy of a oxygen molecule in the “triplet” state
calculated with the same computational setup used for the oxide
surfaces.
The energy necessary to create a oxygen vacancy defect in the
(0 0 1) surface of anatase–TiO2 given in Table 1 is 2.70 eV. This value
is equivalent to that previously obtained at the GGA + U (U = 4) level
using a 3 × 3 supercell (2.73 eV), and quite similar to a value of
2.63 eV, not included in Table 1, that was obtained in this work using
the GGA approach and a 4 × 4 supercell. The similarity between
these three calculated values validates the methodology and the
models employed in the present study to investigate the energies
involved in the formation of oxygen vacancy defects on titania sur-
faces. As already shown by theory [31] and experiment [32], the
presence of Fe reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation to
1.24 eV, and the effect is still more pronounced when doping with

55
Au, in which case formation of the vacancy is slightly exothermic.
The ﬁnding that doping with Au results in thermodynamically sta-
ble oxygen vacancies had already been reported for the (1 1 0) and
(1 0 0) surfaces of ceria [20,21], but to our knowledge it is the ﬁrst
time that this result is reported for titania. It should be mentioned
at this point that although formation of an oxygen vacancy defect
close to a Au atom is exothermic, the stability of the Au-doped sur-
faces is low, and it will probably be difﬁcult to obtain TiO2 crystals
doped with gold.
3.2. O2 adsorption on reduced surfaces
In a second step we investigated the adsorption of molecular
oxygen on the three reduced surfaces r-TiO2, r-Au–TiO2 and r-
Fe–TiO2 containing one oxygen vacancy defect. As clearly remarked
by Metiu [44,47], a key point when studying oxidation reactions
involving molecular O2 is the issue of spin. Molecular O2 is a triplet,
and it is well known that chemical reactions involving a change in
the spin state between reactants and products are slow. Chrétien
and Metiu studied O2 dissociation at an oxygen vacancy defect on a
TiO2(1 1 0) rutile surface [47], and they found that only when a con-
stant spin polarization (N −N) is assumed for reactant, product
and transition state, the calculated activation energy is consistent
with the experimental observations. In this work we have con-
sidered the different possible spin states that can be obtained by
combining the triplet state of molecular O2 with the most stable
spin state obtained for each of the three reduced surfaces discussed
in Section 3.1. For each surface and spin state, molecular O2 has
been adsorbed on the oxygen vacancy defect and the geometry of
the system has been optimized within this ﬁxed spin state. The
resulting structures are depicted in Figs. 2–4, and the calculated
O–O bond lengths, OO stretching frequencies, net atomic charges
and spin densities on selected atoms, and adsorption energies are
summarized in Table 2.
3.2.1. O2 adsorption on r-TiO2
As in the case of O2 adsorption on reduced rutile TiO2(1 1 0) sur-
face [47] the combination of O2 triplet with the reduced anatase
TiO2(0 0 1) surface described in Section 3.1, that is also a triplet,
can be a system in a singlet (N −N = 0), a triplet (N −N = 2) or
a quintet (N −N = 4) state. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2, not
only the relative stability of the three systems, but also the opti-
mized structures and charge and spin distributions signiﬁcantly
differ from one spin state to another. The most stable system which
is presented at Fig. 2a is the closed shell singlet state, with all elec-
trons paired. In this complex, each of the two oxygen atoms of O2 is
directly bonded to one of the Ti atoms in contact with the vacancy,
at Ti–O distances quite similar to those existing in the oxide lat-
tice. Due to these interactions, the (Ti–Ti)V distance is reduced from
4.792 to 4.314 ˚
A, and the O–O bond length increases from 1.235 to
1.391 ˚
A. The net atomic charges indicate that all Ti atoms are equiv-
alent Ti4+ species, and that one electron from the vacancy defect
has been transferred to the O2 fragment, which can be described
as a superoxide O2−species. In agreement with this assignation,
the calculated OO vibration frequency is 1065 cm−1, quite close to
the experimental value of 1120–1130 cm−1 reported for superox-
ide species on ceria [11,18,48]. O2 adsorption on the vacancy defect
in a triplet state is also highly exothermic, and in the optimized
structure depicted in Fig. 2b one of the O atoms of the adsorbed O2
molecule is at the vacancy site, with calculated Ti–O distances of
2.144 and 2.430 ˚
A, and the other one is interacting strongly with
one of the two Ti atoms in contact with the vacancy, with a opti-
mized Ti–O distance of 2.103 ˚
A. The net charge transfer to the O2
fragment is not as large as in the singlet state but it could also be
described as a superoxide species, with a calculated OO vibration
frequency of 1167 cm−1. Of the two unpaired electrons of the sys-

tem, one is shared between the two O atoms (O = 0.5) and the other
one is delocalized in the oxide lattice. Finally, in the quintet state,
O2 adsorbs very weakly on the reduced TiO2 surface. As shown in
Fig. 2c, one of the O atoms of molecular O2 is interacting with one Ti
atom, but the optimized Ti–O distance is long, 2.339 ˚
A, and the O–O

and (Ti–Ti)V distances in the adsorption complex are almost equiv-
alent to those obtained for the isolated O2 molecule, 1.235 ˚
A, and
r-TiO2 surface. The same image arises when analyzing the charge
and spin distributions. Two of the four unpaired electrons of the
system are localized on the O2 fragment, that can thus be described
as O2 molecule in its triplet state. The net charge and spin density
on the non-interacting Ti atom are 1.93 and 0.7, respectively, indi-
cating that it exists as Ti3+, while the other unpaired electron of the
system is again delocalized in the oxide lattice, as was found for the
reduced r-TiO2 surface without adsorbate.
3.2.2. O2 adsorption on r-Au–TiO2
For O2 adsorption on the reduced Au-doped anatase TiO2(0 0 1)
surface only two different spin states have been considered, a
doublet state with only one unpaired electron (N −N = 1) and a
quartet state with N −N = 3. The calculated adsorption energies
listed in Table 2 are considerably lower than those obtained on the
r-TiO2 surface and, as depicted in Fig. 3, O2 does not directly interact
with the Au atom. The reason is that O2 adsorption always involves
a certain degree of electron density transfer from the oxide sur-
face, and this is more difﬁcult in the presence of Au atoms, whose
electronegativity is larger than that of Ti. In fact, the ﬁnding that
formation of a oxygen vacancy defect in the Au-doped surface is
exothermic is indicative of the low tendency of Au to directly bind
to more than four oxygen atoms.
In the most stable adsorption complex, corresponding to a dou-
blet state, the two atoms of the O2 molecule are directly bonded
to the Ti atom located at the vacancy, that thus completes its coor-
dination sphere, and the local environment around the Au atom is
not modiﬁed, as shown in Fig. 3a. The net charge on the adsorbed
O2 molecule is −0.5 e, and the increase in the OO distance and the
corresponding shift in the calculated OO vibration frequency are
slightly lower than those obtained for O2 adsorption on the r-TiO2
surface in the triplet state. On the other hand, the interaction of O2
with the r-Au–TiO2 surface considering a quartet state is negligible.
The calculated adsorption energy is less than −0.1 eV, the optimized
structure depicted in Fig. 3b shows an undistorted O2 molecule
placed almost parallel to the surface and at distances larger than
3.2 ˚
A from any surface atom, the OO vibration frequency value is
equivalent to that obtained for the isolated molecule, 1561 cm−1,
and the charge and spin distributions reﬂect a situation in which a
neutral O2 molecule in its triplet state is not interacting with the
reduced Au-doped TiO2 surface described in Section 3.1.
Previous theoretical studies about oxygen vacancy formation in
CeO2 have considered that, since formation of the ﬁrst vacancy is
exothermic, the catalytic activity of the oxide will depend on the
energy cost to form a second oxygen vacancy [20,21]. The energy
necessary to form a second oxygen vacancy defect in our r-Au–TiO2
model is 2.57 eV, as high as that obtained for formation of the ﬁrst
vacancy in stoichiometric TiO2, and therefore we have not further
investigated this process. Other authors have studied the stability
of vacancies formed by removing one O atom that was not directly
bonded to the dopant atom [30]. Although this possibility is inter-
esting, it has not been explored now, and we have only focused on
the formation of one vacancy defect in the vicinity of the dopant
atom. In this context, the results presented in this work seem to
indicate that doping of anatase TiO2 with Au is not an effective way
of increasing the oxidation activity of titania catalysts, and that the
active species in Au/TiO2 systems are, as is generally accepted, neu-
tral or slightly positively charged Au atoms placed at the interface
between the nanoparticle and the support, but not in the oxide
lattice substituting Ti atoms.
3.2.3. O2 adsorption on r-Fe–TiO2
To describe the interaction of molecular O2 in its triplet state
with the reduced Fe-doped anatase TiO2(0 0 1) surface, that has four
unpaired electrons, it has been necessary to consider four different
possible spin states with N −N = 0, 2, 4 and 6. Despite the large
variation in the total number of unpaired electrons in the system,
the calculated adsorption energies given in Table 2 differ in less
than 0.6 eV, and the optimized structures depicted in Fig. 4, with
the exception of that corresponding to the triplet state (Fig. 4b),
show a similar way of coordination of O2 to the oxide surface. The
most stable adsorption complex is the quintet state depicted in
Fig. 4c, with a total of four unpaired electrons. O2 molecule adsorbs
on the vacancy, and each of its two oxygen atoms is directly bonded
to either Fe or the Ti atom in contact with the vacancy, with calcu-
lated Fe–O and Ti–O distances similar to those existing in the oxide
lattice. As a result of these interactions, the O–O distance increases
to 1.352 ˚
A, and the Fe–Ti distance across the vacancy is reduced by
0.153 ˚
A. If the optimized geometry of the system with six unpaired
electrons, that is only 0.24 eV less stable, is analyzed, similar in
nature but slightly weaker interactions are observed between O2
and the surface. That is, the Ti–O and Fe–O distances are longer, and
the O–O bond length is shorter. The charge and spin density dis-
tributions in the quintet and heptet states are also similar but not
completely equivalent. O2 adsorption involves a transfer of electron
density from the oxide surface to molecular O2, that becomes neg-
atively charged by −0.8 and −0.6 e in the quintet and heptet states,
respectively. Accordingly, the calculated OO vibration frequen-
cies are 1047 and 1195 cm−1, respectively, and could be related to
superoxide species. At the same time, the net charge on the Fe atom
increases from 1.37 e in the reduced surface to 1.65–1.67 e, sug-
gesting that it has been reoxidized from Fe2+ to Fe3+. The largest
difference between the two spin states that are being discussed
now is found in the spin density distribution. In the quintet state,
three of the four unpaired electrons are fully localized on the Fe
atom and the other one is delocalized in the lattice. However, in
the system with 6 unpaired electrons, there are four electrons fully
localized on the Fe atom, one electron shared between the two oxy-
gen atoms of O2, and the last one is again delocalized in the oxide
lattice.
The optimized geometry of the system with two unpaired elec-
trons is different from the others, as depicted in Fig. 4b. Molecular
O2 does not interact with the Fe atom but is coordinated to the Ti
atom in contact with the vacancy, as was found for the doublet state
in the Au-doped surface. This interaction causes a lengthening of
the O–O bond to 1.335 ˚
A and, accordingly, a shift in the OO stretch-
ing mode to 1187 cm−1. The charge transfer to the O2 molecule is
−0.52 e, the same value obtained for the doublet state in the Au-
doped surface. A point that deserves a deeper analysis is the spin
density distribution. The calculated spin density on the Fe atom is
2.53, a surprising value if we take into account that we are con-
sidering a triplet state. However, the N −N value ﬁxes the total
number of unpaired electrons in the whole system, and not the way
in which they are distributed. In this case, there are 2.53 unpaired
electrons localized on the Fe atom, but there is also a spin density
of opposite sign of ∼0.5 e on the O2 fragment, resulting in a total
of two unpaired electrons. These results reﬂect the tendency of Fe
to be in a high spin state, and seem to indicate that ﬁxing the total
spin of the system to low values leads to a nonrealistic description
of the Fe-doped TiO2 system. The results obtained for the closed
shell state with all electrons paired conﬁrm this hypothesis. In this
structure the O2 molecule is highly activated, with a calculated
OO bond length of 1.37 ˚
A, and the OO stretching frequency value
of 898 cm−1, which is the lowest among all the calculated values,
could be initially related to a peroxide species. However, the degree
of charge transfer from the oxide surface to O2 is −0.74 e, similar
to the values found in the case of superoxide species. Since this
spin state is the less stable and the charge distribution is probably
forced by the spin unpolarized calculation performed, it has not
been further considered in the analysis of the results.

3.3. Catalytic implications
In a recent theoretical study about activation of molecular O2
on isolated and supported gold nanoparticles [49] we found that
the activation energy involved in O2 dissociation is directly related
with the degree of electron density transfer from the catalyst to
the * molecular orbital of adsorbed O2, and therefore with the
OO vibration frequency that reﬂects the strength of the O–O bond.
Fig. 5 shows the correlation existing between the OO vibration
frequencies and the total charge on adsorbed O2 in the adsorption
complexes calculated in this work. Assuming that the lower the
OO frequency the lower the barrier for O2 dissociation, it could
be deduced from Table 2 that the best catalysts for O2 dissociation
are r-TiO2 and r-Fe–TiO2. In both cases the spin state involving the
highest degree of O2 activation is the most stable one, that is, the
singlet state for O2 adsorbed on r-TiO2 and the quintet state for O2
adsorbed on r-Fe–TiO2. But there are several reasons pointing to
a better oxidation catalytic performance of the Fe-doped system.
The ﬁrst one is related to the energy necessary to create the oxygen
vacancies on which molecular O2 adsorbs and is activated. Doping
with Fe decreases the Ef value in ∼1.5 eV, suggesting that the con-
centration of active vacancy defects might be much higher on the
Fe-doped system. On the other hand, O2 adsorption on r-TiO2 both
in the singlet state leading to the most activated complex or in the
triplet state resulting in a structure in which the vacancy is healed,
are very exothermic. Too stable adsorption complexes may involve
high activation energies and therefore low reactivity. In this sense,
work is in progress to calculate the activation and reaction energies
for O2 dissociation and vacancy healing in r-TiO2 and r-Fe–TiO2.
In relation with the inﬂuence of Au doping on the oxidation
activity of TiO2, the conclusions obtained from this study are a bit
disappointing. While the activity of Au3+ cations towards CO oxi-
dation dispersed in the ceria lattice as substitutional point defects
has been postulated and conﬁrmed by theory [23], the present
results indicate that although formation of oxygen vacancy defects
is favoured by the presence of Au atoms substituting Ti in the oxide
lattice, the charge distribution in the reduced r-Au–TiO2 surface is
such that its interaction with molecular O2 is weak and implies a
really small degree of molecular activation.
4. Conclusions
The substitution of one Ti atom in the (0 0 1) surface of anatase
TiO2 by either a Au or a Fe atom, the creation of a oxygen vacancy
defect in the doped and undoped surfaces, and the interaction of
molecular O2 with the reduced doped and undoped surfaces have
been investigated by means of periodic density functional calcu-
lations including spin polarization and considering different spin
states with a ﬁxed number of unpaired electrons for each system
considered.
As previously reported for ceria and rutile, doping of TiO2
anatase with Au or Fe weakens the metal-oxygen bonds around the
dopant, decreases the energy necessary to form an oxygen vacancy
defect from 2.7 eV in TiO2 to 1.24 eV in the Fe-doped system, and
makes the reduction process exothermic in the case of Au-doped
TiO2. Analysis of charge and spin distributions in the stoichiometric
and reduced surfaces indicates that Ti4+ is reduced to Ti3+ only in
the undoped material. In the presence of Au3+or Fe3+ species, these
are preferentially reduced to Au+ and Fe2+, respectively.
The interaction of molecular O2 with the oxygen vacancies in the
reduced r-TiO2, r-Au–TiO2 and r-Fe–TiO2 surfaces has been studied
considering all possible different spin states arising from combi-
nation of triplet O2 with the corresponding state of the reduced
surface. It has been found that not only the calculated adsorption
energies, but also the optimized structures and charge and spin
distributions signiﬁcantly differ from one spin state to another.
O2 adsorption on the undoped surface is highly exothermic and
involves a charge transfer from the oxide surface to molecular oxy-
gen, with a reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ and formation of a adsorbed
superoxide O2−species. Interaction of O2 with the vacancy defect
in Au-doped TiO2 is weak, and in the most stable complex the two
atoms of molecular O2 are directly bonded to the Ti atom in con-
tact with the vacancy, that exists as Ti4+, and not with the Au atom.
The O2 species thus formed is less activated than on undoped r-
TiO2, suggesting that doping of anatase with Au is not an effective
way of increasing the oxidation activity of titania catalysts. The
most promising result has been obtained with the Fe-doped sur-
face. O2 adsorption involves a transfer of 0.8 e from the oxide to
the molecule, that is activated as a superoxide O2−species, while
Fe2+ is reoxidized to Fe3+. Since the energy changes involved in the
creation of the vacancy and in the subsequent O2 adsorption and
vacancy healing are not as large as those found in undoped anatase,
an enhanced oxidation activity can be expected in Fe-doped TiO2.
