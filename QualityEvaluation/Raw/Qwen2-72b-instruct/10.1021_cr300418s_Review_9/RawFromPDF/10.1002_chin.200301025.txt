The Nature and Structure of a New MoVTeO Crystalline Phase. — The new 
phase Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33 is obtained by evaporation of an aqueous slurry comprising 
(NH4)6Mo7O24, Te(OH)6, and VOSO4, followed by calcination at 600 °C for 2 h in N2. 
The samples are characterized by powder XRD, SAED, HREM, and UV/VIS spectros-
copy. The XRD pattern is indexed on the basis of a hexagonal cell. However, HREM 
reveals the crystals as being formed by structural domains of an orthorhombically dis-
torted unit cell derived from the K0.13—0.33WO3 structure. The results constitute the first 
step for elucidating the role of this new orthorhombic phase in the effectiveness of 
Mo—V—Te—Nb mixed oxide catalysts. — (GARCIA-GONZALEZ*, E.; LOPEZ
