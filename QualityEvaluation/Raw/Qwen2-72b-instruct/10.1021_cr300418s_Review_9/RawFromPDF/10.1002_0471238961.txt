Dinuclear nickel(II) and palladium(II) complexes with Schiff-base ligands (derived form salicyl-
aldehyde condensed with 2-amino-1-alcohols or from 2-hydroxy-5-methylisophthaldialdehyde and
pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde condensed with semicarbazide, thiosemicarbazide, carbonodihydrazide,
or thiocarbonodihydrazide) can be activated with the co-catalysts methylalumoxane (MAO) or
tris(pentaﬂuorophenyl)borane/triethylaluminium, B(C6F5)3/AlEt3 for the vinyl/addition polymer-
ization of norbornene to reach activities of up to 2.4 · 107 gpolymer/mol(metal)·h (molar ratios
metal:AlMAO = 1:100, metal:borane:AlEt3 = 1:9:10). Polymer characterization by GPC gave molar
mass distributions of Mw/Mn ≈2, thereby indicating a coordination polymerization with a single-site
character of the active species.

Introduction
The attractive properties of cyclic oleﬁn (co-) poly-
mers such as low birefringence, high glass transition
temperature, high optical transparency, and low mois-
ture absorption have increased the interest in these
materials over the past decade. Particularly the ho-
mopolymer of norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene)
is of interest as a specialty polymer with good me-
chanical strength, heat resistance, and optical trans-
parency, e.g. for deep ultraviolet photoresists, inter-
level dielectrics in microelectronics applications or
as cover layer for liquid-crystal displays [1, 2]. Nor-
bornene can be polymerized via ring-opening metathe-
sis polymerization (ROMP) [3 – 5], cationic or radical
polymerization [6] and by vinyl or addition polymer-
ization [7] (Scheme 1). In the latter case the bicyclic
structure remains intact and only the π-bond of the cy-
clooleﬁn is opened.
Catalysts containing the metals titanium [8,9], zir-
conium [10 – 14], chromium [15], and currently the
late transition-metals cobalt [16– 18], nickel [19– 33],
and palladium [31, 34– 51] are described in the lit-
erature for the vinyl/addition polymerization of nor-

bornene [1, 29, 52 – 57]. The late transition-metal com-
plexes are commonly activated with methylalumox-
ane (MAO) [20– 23, 36], except for the cationic pal-
ladium-complexes [Pd(NCR)4]2+2A−(NCR weakly
bound nitrile-ligand; A = “non”-coordinating counter
ion) [37 – 47]. Another co-catalytic system for the
activation of metal complexes is the organo-Lewis
acid tris(pentaﬂuorophenyl)borane, B(C6F5)3 with or
without triethylaluminum (AlEt3). This co-catalytic
system is applied for the activation of transition-

merization [58 – 66] and was recently also applied
to the activation of late transition-metal complexes
for the (co)polymerization of cyclopentene [67],
ethene [68], norbornene and norbornene deriva-
tives [19,29, 33,34, 50 – 57].
During our work, we became aware that only sin-
gular examples of homodinuclear NiII-, PdII-, CoII-
and CrIII-complexes [15, 18,22, 24,69] were investi-
gated. Thus, we present here the ﬁrst polymerization
results of a series of homodinuclear nickel(II) and pal-
ladium(II) complexes 1 to 10 with Schiff-base ligands
derived from different (di)-aldehydes condensed with
2-amino-1-alcohols or with (thio)-semicarbazide and
(thio)-carbonodihydrazide (Scheme 2) which can be
activated with MAO, B(C6F5)3, or a combination of
both B(C6F5)3/AlEt3. The Ni(salen)-complex 3 is in-
cluded as a mononuclear reference system.
Experimental Section
General procedures
All work involving air- and/or moisture-sensitive com-
pounds was carried out by using standard vacuum, Schlenk
or drybox techniques. IR spectra (KBr pellet) were mea-
sured on a Bruker Optik IFS 25. NMR spectra were recorded
with a Bruker AXS 200 at 300 K and 200 MHz (1H NMR).
The NMR spectra for compound 1,2-bis-(2-hydroxo-benzyl-
amino)-ethane-nickel(II) (3) were recorded with a Varian O-
300 at 300 K and 300 MHz (1H NMR). 1H NMR spectra
were calibrated against the solvent signal (CD2Cl2 5.32 ppm,
DMSO-d6 2.53 ppm). Elemental analyses were obtained on
a VarioEL from Elementaranalysensysteme GmbH. ESI-MS
measurements for 1, 2 and 6 were carried out using a Thermo
Finnigan LCQ Advantage spectrometer with methanol as
the solvent. A pre-injector column contained impurities of
triﬂuoroacetic acid (CF3COOH, M = 114). Mass spectra
were measured in positive mode in the range m/z = 200 –
1200. Nickel containing ions had a clearly visible metal
isotope pattern, arising from the distribution: 58Ni 100%,
60Ni 38.2%, 61Ni 1.6%, 62Ni 5.3%, 64Ni 1.3% [70]. Peaks
were given for the most abundant combinations of the nickel
isotopes. For Ni2-containing ions the most intense peak
stems from 58Ni2 (100%) with 58Ni60Ni of ∼80% rela-
tive intensity. For Ni3 the most abundant combinations have
58Ni260Ni, followed by 58Ni3 (∼80%), 58Ni60Ni2 (∼50%)
etc. For Ni4 the species with 58Ni360Ni is most intense fol-
lowed by 58Ni260Ni2 (∼80%), 58Ni4 (∼60%) etc. Gel per-
meation chromatography (GPC) analyses were performed on

lection and cell reﬁnement with SMART [71], data reduction
with SAINT [71]. An experimental absorption correction
was performed with SADABS [72]. Structure Analysis and
Reﬁnement: The structures were solved by direct methods
(SIR97 for 1, SHELXS-97 for 6) [73, 74]; reﬁnement was
done by full-matrix least squares on F2 using the SHELXL-
97 program suite [74]. All non-hydrogen positions were
found and reﬁned with anisotropic temperature factors. The
hydrogen atoms in 1 were found from the difference Fourier
map and reﬁned isotropically with free temperature factors.
The hydrogen atoms in 6 were placed at calculated positions,
using appropriate riding models (HFIX 43 for aromatic and
methine CH and NH, HFIX 33 for CH3, HFIX 83 for OH)
and isotropic temperature factors of U(H) = 1.2 Ueq(CH and
NH) or U(H) = 1.5 Ueq(CH3). The temperature factor for
(O)H was free to reﬁne. Details of the X-ray structure deter-
minations and reﬁnements are provided in Table 1. Graphics
were obtained with ORTEP 3 for Windows [75]. Displace-
ment ellipsoids are drawn at the 50% probability level and H
atoms are shown as spheres of arbitrary radii. The structural
data has been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Center (No. CCDC-223113 for 1 and CCDC-223114
for 6).

Polymerization procedures
General: The pre-catalytic complexes were applied as so-
lutions (for complexes 1, 2, and 3) or as ﬁne suspensions
(ultrasonication) in methylene chloride (for complexes 4 to
10). Polymerizations were conducted at r.t. in a water bath
to ensure a constant temperature during the reaction. Poly-
merization runs were carried out at least three times to en-
sure reproducibility. The IR spectra of the poly(norbornene)s
obtained with the catalysts based on 1 to 10 showed the ab-
sence of double bond bands at 1620 to 1680 cm−1 and at
about 960 cm−1 characteristic for the trans form of double
bonds [80]. The absorption peak at about 941 cm−1 could
be assigned to the ring system of norbornene [6a, 81]. This
ensured the vinyl/addition polymerization instead of a ring-
opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). The conversion
was calculated by gravimetric analysis of the polymer.
General procedure for the homopolymerization of nor-
bornene with MAO as co-catalyst: A Schlenk-ﬂask was
charged with the norbornene solution and the MAO-solution
was added. After 1 min the solution or suspension of the
complex was added via syringe and the mixture was stirred
with a magnetic stirrer. The polymerization was stopped
through the addition of 30 ml of a 10:1 methanol/conc. HCl
mixture. The precipitated polymer was ﬁltered, washed with
methanol and dried in vacuo for 5 h.
General procedure for the homopolymerization of nor-
bornene with B(C6F5)3/AlEt3 as co-catalysts: A Schlenk-
ﬂask was charged with the norbornene solution. The solu-
tion or suspension of the complex followed by the separate
co-catalyst components [B(C6F5)3 and AlEt3] were quickly
added via syringe and the mixture was stirred with a mag-
netic stirrer. The polymerization was stopped through the ad-
dition of 40 ml of a 10:1 methanol/conc. HCl mixture. The

precipitated polymer was ﬁltered, washed with methanol and
dried in vacuo for 5 h.
From studies of a number of metal complexes which did
not show any polymerization activity with B(C6F5)3/AlEt3,
we conclude that the combination of B(C6F5)3/AlEt3 alone
is not polymerization active.
Results and Discussion
Synthesis and molecular structures of the complex pre-
catalysts
The Schiff-base ligands H2L1 and H2L2 (Scheme 2)
were synthesized in situ from salicylaldehyde with
2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol and 2-amino-1-butanol,
respectively, and
reacted
with
nickel(II) acetate
tetrahydrate to form the methanol adducts 1 and 2. The
complexes are green solids and could be crystallized
from the reaction mixture in high yields.
The molecular structure of 1 is shown in Fig. 1. A
dinuclear and centrosymmetric complex is formed by
the bridging action of the phenoxo oxygen atom be-
tween the two nickel atoms. The nickel atom has a
distorted octahedral coordination with the three donor
atoms from the Schiff-base mono-anion (HL1)−and
one phenoxo-group of the second bridging ligand ly-
ing in one (equatorial) plane. An aqua ligand and an
acetate anion occupy the two remaining (axial) coor-
dination sites. Hydrogen bonding from the aqua to the
acetate ligand on the neighboring nickel atom and to an
ethanol molecule of crystallization together with hy-
drogen bonding from the alcohol group to the acetate
ligand completes the molecular structure as demon-
strated in Fig. 1. There is no π-stacking [82] between
the phenyl rings in the crystal structure of 1. Part of the
packing is controlled by C-H···π interactions [83,84]
from C11 and C13 to the phenyl rings of neighboring
molecules. ESI-MS indicates that the dinuclear Ni2L2-
species are dominant in methanol solutions of 1 and 2,
yet, with higher nuclear Ni3L3- and Ni4L4-species also
a distinct possibility.
The complexes 4 to 10 were designed from two dif-
ferent ligand systems whose donor atoms can be eas-
ily varied by the choice of the starting materials. This
opens the possibility to synthesize a great number of
similar nickel(II) and palladium(II) complexes differ-
ing only in the donor atoms of the ligand and possibly
not in the molecular structure (Scheme 2).

formulation of the insoluble complexes 4, 5, and 7 to
10 as given in Scheme 2 is mainly based on elemental
analysis and on the analogy to the structurally eluci-
dated compound 6.
The hexadentate mono-deprotonated ligand (HL 4)−
and nickel(II) form the dinuclear complex 6 whose
structure is illustrated in Fig. 2. Both nickel atoms
have an octahedral coordination sphere with the donor
atoms from (HL4)−and a chloro ligand lying in
one (equatorial) plane. The mono-deprotonated lig-
and (HL4)−gives rise to different coordination en-
vironments of the two nickel atoms: Ni1 shows an
N2,O,Cl-coordination whereas Ni2 features an N3,Cl-
coordination. The remaining (axial) sites are occu-
pied by two methanol solvent molecules. A third
(hydrogen-bonded) chloride atom in the crystal lattice
compensates the positive charge of the dinuclear com-
plex. The pyridyl rings in the crystal structure of 6 give
rise to intermolecular π-stacking interactions [82,85 –
87]. The two different pyridyl ring planes (symmetry
relation x, y±1, z) are almost parallel with a small di-
hedral angle of 1.7◦. The ring slippage is typical [82]
with a slip angle of 18.8◦or 20.3◦(depending on which
phenyl is taken as the reference plane). This corre-
sponds to a vertical displacement between the ring cen-
troids of 1.27 ˚
A (centroid separation 3.78 ˚
A, interpla-
nar distance 3.55 or 3.58 ˚
A, respectively). In compar-
ison, these intermolecular π-stackings exhibit rather
short centroid-centroid contacts (< 3.8 ˚
A), small slip
angles (< 25◦) and vertical displacements (< 1.5 ˚
A)
which translate into a sizable overlap of the pyridyl-
plane areas [85].
Catalytic studies
The dimeric nickel(II) complexes 1 and 2 were
found active in the homopolymerization of nor-
bornene. The results of the polymerization activities
using methylalumoxane (MAO), B(C6F5)3 in combi-
nation with AlEt3 or B(C6F5)3 alone as co-catalysts are
summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 3. As a reference point
for the activity of the new pre-catalysts the Ni(salen)-
complex 3 with a similar N2,O2-coordination was
tested under the same polymerization conditions.
In comparison to the mononuclear reference sys-
tem 3 and in general [19,34 – 36, 50,51] the catalysts
based on the dinuclear nickel(II) complexes 1 and 2
show rather high polymerization activities in combi-
nation with different co-catalytic systems. The activi-
ties covered a range between 1.1·106 (1/B(C6F5)3 and
2/B(C6F5)3) to 2.3 · 107 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h (1/MAO).
Complexes 1 and 2 also revealed similar or even higher

polymerization activities than the known pre-catalyst
nickel(II) acetylacetonate [19]. We also note that com-
plexes 1 and 2 could be activated with B(C6F5)3
alone. Addition of AlEt3 further increased the con-
version and the polymerization activity. Higher ac-
tivities with the combination of B(C6F5)3 and AlEt3
can be explained by a scavenger effect of AlEt3,
the presence of alkyl transfer agents [88] or by the
formation of highly activating Al(C6F5)3. A com-
bination of B(C6F5)3 with AlEt3 (molar ratio 1:1)
undergoes a facile aryl/alkyl ligand exchange reac-
tion to give Al(C6F5)3 and BEt3 as the main prod-
ucts [31,34, 51,89]. The 19F NMR spectrum showed
the expected signals of Al(C6F5)3 at −122.3 ppm
(o-F), −152.2 ppm (p-F) and −161.7 ppm (m-F).
Also, the 19F NMR spectrum revealed the forma-
tion of heteroleptic and possibly dimeric aluminum
species of the type [AlEt3−x(C6F5)x]2 (x = 1 – 2) as
side products. A similar ligand exchange has been de-
scribed for B(C6F5)3 and AlMe3 to give Al(C6F5)3 and
BMe3 [90, 91].
GPC of the soluble polymers (see Table 2)

9.3 · 104 (1/B(C6F5)3/AlEt3) and 1.3 · 106 g·mol−1
(3/MAO) corresponding to an average chain length
between 1000 and 14000 monomer units (MNB =
94.16 g·mol−1). The poly(norbornene)s displayed a
monomodal molar mass distribution except for the
polymers from 1/MAO. The polydispersities Q are
mostly narrow and close to a value of 2 which is the

species.

General conditions: room temperature, toluene/methylene chloride solution, 30.1 mmol NB, [Ni]:[NB] = 1:1000, total volume: 40.0 ml;

pending on the metal. In the case of the palladium(II)
complexes the polymerization activities covered a nar-
row range between 2.2 · 106 (10/MAO) and 1.5 ·
107 gpolymer/mol(Pd)·h (7/MAO) with high monomer
conversions in short polymerization times of 10 sec. In
contrast the polymerization activities of the nickel(II)
complexes varied between 3.4·104 (8/MAO) and 9.8·
106 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h (4/MAO). The observed activ-
ity trends and differences are difﬁcult to explain in the
absence of a more profound knowledge of the active
species. Mechanistic investigations with MAO as a co-
catalyst are hampered by the unknown exact compo-
sition and structure of MAO [62,66,93]. Catalysts 4 –
10/MAO show no clear activity trends with respect to
variation in counter ion (CH3CO2−or Cl−) or donor
atoms of the ligands (O or S).
In order to gain additional information about the ac-
tivation process the activator was changed from MAO
to the better deﬁned co-catalyst B(C6F5)3 with or with-
Fig. 5. Activities of 4 – 10 and B(C6F5)3 with or without

out triethylaluminum (AlEt3). The results are summa-
rized in Table 4 and Fig. 5.
The new dinuclear pre-catalysts 4 to 10 could be
also activated with the co-catalytic system B(C6F5)3/

AlEt3 and the activities are similar to those ob-
served with MAO. Again the palladium(II) systems
exhibit comparative polymerization activities in a
small range between 1.3·106 (10/B(C6F5)3/AlEt3) and
2.4 · 107 gpolymer/mol(Pd)·h (7/B(C6F5)3/AlEt3). The
nickel(II) systems have again activities in a wider
range between 5.1 · 104 (8/B(C6F5)3/AlEt3) and 2.8 ·
106 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h (4/B(C6F5)3/AlEt3). The simi-
lar polymerization behavior of the dinuclear complexes
4 to 10 in combination with MAO and B(C6F5)3/AlEt3
should be the result of a similar activation process
and polymerization mechanism. Activation of the new
dinuclear complexes with B(C6F5)3 alone was only
successful in the case of the complexes 4, 5, 7, and
10. There, the polymerization activities were rather
low between 5.3 · 102 (10/B(C6F5)3) and 2.7 · 104
gpolymer/mol(metal)·h (7/B(C6F5)3).
Elaborate investigations on the activation mech-
anism
of
coordination compounds towards
nor-
bornene polymerization have been performed in the
case of [Ph3PCH2C(O)CH3]2[Pd2Cl6]/B(C6F5)3 [34]
and Pd(L)Cl2/B(C6F5)3/AlEt3 [L = Ph2P(CH2)2,3
PPh2] [51]. Multinuclear NMR studies together with
other analyses suggested the in-situ formation of PdCl2
and [Pd(L)]2+ or naked “Pd2+”, respectively, as ac-
tive species. It is evident that activation of the metal
complexes has to include an opening of the coordi-
nation sphere through (partial) ligand abstraction by
the co-catalyst. Thus, more weakly bound ligands may
promise higher activities. Of course, a compromise has
to be made in terms of the stability of the pre-catalytic
complex for preparation, handling and storage.
Solubilities of the polymers from 4 – 10/co-catalyst
were as expected from the literature [1, 19,35 – 39,52]
with only the nickel-based catalysts yielding solu-
ble polymers whereas the palladium-derived polymers
were insoluble in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene even at ele-
vated temperature. GPC data of the nickel-catalyzed
polymers gave Mn-values between 7.1 · 105 (4/MAO)
and 1.6 · 106 g·mol−1 (8/MAO) for activation with
MAO and between 2.2 · 105 (4/B(C6F5)3/AlEt3) and
3.3 · 105 g·mol−1 (4/B(C6F5)3) with the co-catalyst
system B(C6F5)3/AlEt3. This corresponds to average
chain lengths between 7500 and 17000 monomer units
with MAO and between 2300 and 3500 monomer
units with B(C6F5)3/AlEt3 (MNB = 94.16 g·mol−1).
The polymer samples displayed a monomodal molar
mass distribution with a narrow dispersity around 2
indicating
a
single-site
character
of
the
active
species [92].
Conclusion
Dinuclear
nickel(II)
and
palladium(II)
com-
plexes represent a new class of pre-catalysts for
the
vinyl/addition polymerization of norbornene.
Both the complexes and the semicarbazide- and
carbonohydrazide-based ligands can easily be pre-
pared. The new dinuclear pre-catalysts can be activated
with both MAO and B(C6F5)3/(AlEt3) as co-catalyst.
It was also possible to activate several complexes
with B(C6F5)3 alone. Rather high polymerization
activities above 107 gpolymer/mol(metal)·h could be
achieved in some cases. Polymer characterization by
GPC revealed polydispersities around Mw/Mn = 2
indicating a single-site character of the active species.
