1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts have a significant influence on their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses the preparation of a series of NiMeO mixed metal oxides with various dopants, including Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, and Ta, and examines their effects on the properties and catalytic behavior of Ni-based mixed metal oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The dopants modify the NiO lattice, leading to the formation of solid solutions and changes in the lattice constant, particle size, and surface area of the catalysts. The valence of the dopants also affects the non-stoichiometric oxygen content and the lability of the oxygen species on the catalysts, which in turn influences the selectivity and activity of the catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The literature highlights the importance of controlling the valence of the dopants to tune the catalytic properties of NiO-based catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, the literature does not discuss the challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.

1.镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯)的催化性能有显著影响。文献讨论了通过各种掺杂剂(包括Li、Mg、Al、Ga、Ti、Nb和Ta)制备NiMeO混合金属氧化物系列,并考察了它们对Ni基混合金属氧化物在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的性质和催化行为的影响。掺杂剂改变了NiO晶格,导致形成固溶体,催化剂的晶格常数、粒径和表面积发生变化。掺杂剂的价态也影响催化剂上的非化学计量氧含量和氧物种的活性,进而影响氧化脱氢反应的选择性和活性。文献强调了控制掺杂剂价态以调整NiO基催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的催化性能的重要性。然而,文献没有讨论这些催化体系在理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的挑战。
