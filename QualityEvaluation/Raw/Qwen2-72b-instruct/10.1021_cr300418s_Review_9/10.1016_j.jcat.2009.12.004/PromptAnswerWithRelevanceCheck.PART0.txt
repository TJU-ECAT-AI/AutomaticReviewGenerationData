1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The study shows that the dopants (Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb) easily insert the NiO lattice and form solid solutions, independent of the valence of the foreign species, given a similar ionic radius to Ni2+. This substitution process occurring upon the introduction of the foreign elements seems to be responsible for the increase or decrease in nickel oxides non-stoichiometry. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems are not directly addressed in the literature.

1.镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯)的催化性能有重大影响。研究表明,掺杂剂(Li、Mg、Al、Ga、Ti、Nb)容易插入NiO晶格并形成固溶体,与外来物种的价态无关,前提是它们的离子半径与Ni2+相似。在引入外来元素时发生的这一替代过程似乎对镍氧化物非化学计量的增加或减少负有责任。掺杂剂阳离子的价态越高,对所需产物的初始选择性就越高。在这些催化体系中,理论建模、过程优化以及效率、选择性和安全性平衡的关键挑战在文献中没有直接涉及。

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts have a significant influence on their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The study found that the incorporation of dopants with different valences can modify the lattice constant of the NiO structure, leading to the formation of solid solutions. The higher the valence of the dopant, the more the non-stoichiometric oxygen is reduced, which in turn affects the selectivity and activity of the catalyst. The presence of lower valence dopants increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen, while higher valence dopants reduce it. The lability of the oxygen species is also affected by the presence of different dopants, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species. The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the nature and reactivity of the different oxygen species on the catalysts, optimizing the dopant concentration and preparation method to achieve the desired electronic structure and catalytic performance, and ensuring the safety and stability of the catalysts under reaction conditions.

1.镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯)的催化性能有显著影响。研究发现,不同价态的掺杂剂的引入可以改变NiO结构的晶格常数,导致固溶体的形成。掺杂剂的价态越高,非化学计量氧的减少越多,从而影响催化剂的选择性和活性。较低价态的掺杂剂会增加非化学计量氧,而较高价态的掺杂剂会减少它。不同掺杂剂的存在也会影响氧物种的活性,高价态的掺杂剂会导致更强的氧物种。在TPIE实验中表面16O交换速率与ODH活性测试中C2H6消耗速率之间建立的线性关系证实,监测的氧物种确实参与并在这类反应中发挥着重要作用。催化剂容纳的非化学计量氧与选择性转化乙烷底物为乙烯的能力之间存在明显的相关性,随着外来阳离子价态的增加,这两个值呈反比趋势,这有力地支持了上述观点。掺杂剂阳离子的价态越高,对所需产物的初始选择性越高。在这些催化体系中,理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的关键挑战包括理解催化剂上不同氧物种的性质和反应性,优化掺杂浓度和制备方法以实现所需的电子结构和催化性能,以及确保催化剂在反应条件下的安全性和稳定性。

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts have a significant influence on their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses the effect of doping with various metals (Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, and Ta) on the properties and catalytic behavior of Ni-based mixed metal oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The dopants modify the NiO lattice, forming solid solutions and affecting the lattice constant, surface area, and reducibility of the catalysts. The valence of the dopants plays a crucial role in the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to COx. The reduction or elimination of these oxygen species favors the selective oxidation to ethylene. The key challenges in theoretical modeling include understanding the role of dopants in the catalytic behavior of these catalysts and the nature of the oxygen species involved in the reaction. Process optimization involves finding the optimal dopant concentration and preparation method to achieve high activity and selectivity. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems requires careful control of the reaction conditions and the development of highly active and selective catalysts that can operate at low temperatures and minimize the formation of by-products.

The study found that the incorporation of dopants with different valences affects the non-stoichiometry of nickel oxides, leading to changes in the electrophilic oxygen species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 on pure NiO. Lower valence dopants increase the non-stoichiometric oxygen, while higher valence dopants reduce it, enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The lability of the oxygen species is also affected, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species.

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts have a significant influence on their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses the preparation of a series of NiMeO mixed metal oxides with various dopants, including Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, and Ta, and examines their effects on the properties and catalytic behavior of Ni-based mixed metal oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The dopants modify the NiO lattice, leading to the formation of solid solutions and changes in the lattice constant, particle size, and surface area of the catalysts. The valence of the dopants also affects the non-stoichiometric oxygen content and the lability of the oxygen species on the catalysts, which in turn influences the selectivity and activity of the catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The literature highlights the importance of controlling the valence of the dopants to tune the catalytic properties of NiO-based catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, the literature does not discuss the challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.
