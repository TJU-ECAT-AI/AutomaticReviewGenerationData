1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts have a significant influence on their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses the effect of doping with various metals (Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, and Ta) on the properties and catalytic behavior of Ni-based mixed metal oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The dopants modify the NiO lattice, forming solid solutions and affecting the lattice constant, surface area, and reducibility of the catalysts. The valence of the dopants plays a crucial role in the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to COx. The reduction or elimination of these oxygen species favors the selective oxidation to ethylene. The key challenges in theoretical modeling include understanding the role of dopants in the catalytic behavior of these catalysts and the nature of the oxygen species involved in the reaction. Process optimization involves finding the optimal dopant concentration and preparation method to achieve high activity and selectivity. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems requires careful control of the reaction conditions and the development of highly active and selective catalysts that can operate at low temperatures and minimize the formation of by-products.

1.基于氧化镍的催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙基苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯)的催化性能有显著影响。文献讨论了用各种金属(锂、镁、铝、镓、钛、铌和钽)掺杂对Ni基混合金属氧化物在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的性质和催化行为的影响。掺杂剂修改了NiO晶格，形成了固溶体，影响了催化剂的晶格常数、表面积和还原性。掺杂剂的价态在形成亲电氧物种中起着关键作用，这些物种负责乙烷的完全氧化为COx。减少或消除这些氧物种有利于选择性氧化为乙烯。理论建模的关键挑战包括理解掺杂剂在这些催化剂催化行为中的作用以及参与反应的氧物种的性质。过程优化涉及寻找最佳的掺杂浓度和制备方法，以实现高活性和选择性。在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性需要仔细控制反应条件，并开发在低温下运行、最小化副产品形成的高活性和选择性催化剂。
