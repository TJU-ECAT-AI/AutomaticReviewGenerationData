          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of dopants with different valences can modify the lattice constant of the NiO structure, leading to the formation of solid solutions. The valence of the dopants plays a crucial role in the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to COx. The reduction or elimination of these oxygen species favors the selective oxidation to ethylene. Lower valence dopants increase the non-stoichiometric oxygen, while higher valence dopants reduce it, enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The lability of the oxygen species is also affected, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species. The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the nature and reactivity of the different oxygen species on the catalysts, optimizing the dopant concentration and preparation method to achieve the desired electronic structure and catalytic performance, and ensuring the safety and stability of the catalysts under reaction conditions.

          镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯)的催化性能有重大影响。不同价态的掺杂剂的引入可以改变NiO结构的晶格常数,导致固溶体的形成。掺杂剂的价态在形成亲电氧物种中起着关键作用,这些物种负责乙烷的完全氧化为COx。减少或消除这些氧物种有利于选择性氧化为乙烯。低价掺杂剂增加非化学计量氧,而高价掺杂剂减少非化学计量氧,增强选择性转化为乙烯。氧物种的活性也受到影响,高价掺杂剂导致氧物种更牢固地结合。在TPIE实验中表面16O交换速率与ODH活性测试中C2H6消耗速率之间建立的线性关系证实,监测的氧物种确实参与并在这类反应中发挥着重要作用。催化剂容纳的非化学计量氧与选择性转化乙烷底物为乙烯的能力之间存在明显的相关性,随着外来阳离子价态的增加,这两个值呈反比趋势,这有力地支持了上述观点。掺杂剂阳离子的价态越高,对所需产物的初始选择性越高。在这些催化体系中,理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的关键挑战包括理解催化剂上不同氧物种的性质和反应性,优化掺杂浓度和制备方法以实现所需的电子结构和催化性能,以及确保催化剂在反应条件下的安全性和稳定性。
