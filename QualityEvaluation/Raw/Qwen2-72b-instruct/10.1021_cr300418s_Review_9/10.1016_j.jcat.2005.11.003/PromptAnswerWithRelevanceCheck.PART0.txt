How do the preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene), and what are the key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems?

1.The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction. On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the complex reaction mechanisms, predicting the effect of dopants and vacancies on the electronic structure, optimizing the reaction conditions for maximum yield and selectivity, and ensuring the stability and safety of the catalysts under high temperature and pressure conditions.

1.镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应(如乙基苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯)的催化性能有重大影响。铌掺杂被发现能显著降低标记氧的活化能和交换速率,表明消除了非化学计量的亲电活性氧物种,这些物种负责乙烷完全氧化为CO2。两种氧化物上的乙烷ODH反应均通过Marsvan Krevelen机制进行,参与催化剂氧。然而,两种氧化物补充表面氧的途径不同,导致表面存在不同的氧物种,从而导致乙烷ODH反应中观察到的不同产物分布。在NiO上,补充通过在阳离子空位上快速解离气态氧,而较慢的掺入和扩散,从而在表面产生大量亲电氧物种。铌填充了阳离子空位,减少了可用于解离的活性位点,从而使扩散成为过程的快速步骤。因此,在催化剂表面大量存在强结合的、不易挥发的亲核氧物种,这些物种选择性地将乙烷转化为乙烯。在这些催化体系中,理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战包括理解复杂的反应机制,预测掺杂剂和空位对电子结构的影响,优化反应条件以获得最大产率和选择性,并确保催化剂在高温和高压条件下稳定和安全。
