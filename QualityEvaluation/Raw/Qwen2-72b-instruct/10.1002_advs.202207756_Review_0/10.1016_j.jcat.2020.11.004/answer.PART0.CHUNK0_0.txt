[1] "Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infras- tructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chem- icals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene [1]. Propylene is currently obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries [2]. However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehy- drogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to produc- ing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5]. The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incen- tivized development of other PDH catalysts [4], such as Ga- [612], Zn- [13], Co- [1416], V-based [17] and ZrO2 [1820] catalysts."
[2] "Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123]."
[3] "Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X- ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3- temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction [911,24]."
[4] "A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques [911,24,2628]."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to a gap between demand and supply, as propylene is traditionally obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units in refineries. The abundance of natural gas as a feedstock has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is seen as a potentially effective alternative method to produce propylene. Two commercialized PDH processes, the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with a Pt-based catalyst, have been developed. However, the high cost of Pt and health and environmental concerns associated with Cr have driven the development of alternative PDH catalysts, such as Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites, Ga speciation, and the reaction mechanism of PDH remain topics of active discussion. Various experimental techniques, including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-TPD, have been used to probe Ga speciation and identify the active site in the PDH reaction. Several Ga species have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early X-ray absorption studies suggested that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, independent of gallium loading and reducing gas used. However, alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. Hensen and coworkers first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting these species could play an active role in PDH. However, spectra were collected at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, which may not represent the catalyst state at 500 C. Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and catalyst reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio. This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis. However, FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments were conducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state, where Ga speciation could differ from the reduced sample. Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations. The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations, but the existence of these distinct sites is largely indirect, inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental characterizations, and computational investigations.

1. 丙烯在化工基础设施中扮演着核心角色，用于生产包括聚丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯氧化物和莰烯在内的广泛化学品。目前，丙烯主要作为石脑油蒸汽裂解和炼油厂流化催化裂化（FCC）装置的副产品获得。然而，由于天然气作为原料的显著增加，丙烯的供需之间出现了日益扩大的差距。丙烷脱氢（PDH）被认为是一种生产丙烯的有效替代方法，两种PDH工艺，即使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺和使用基于Pt的催化剂的Oleflex工艺，已经被商业化。然而，由于Pt的高成本和与Cr相关的健康和环境问题，这推动了其他PDH催化剂的发展，如Ga-、Zn-、Co-、V基和ZrO2催化剂。其中，Ga/H-ZSM-5长期以来被认为是一种高效的催化剂，用于烷烃的脱氢和脱氢芳构化（Cyclar工艺），然而，Ga的物种、催化活性位点的身份以及PDH反应的反应机制仍然是几十年研究中活跃讨论的话题。包括原位Ga K边X射线吸收近边结构（XANES）、原位FTIR和NH3-温度程序脱附（NH3-TPD）在内的各种实验技术已被用于研究Ga/H-ZSM-5中的Ga物种并识别PDH反应中的活性位点。根据几种实验和计算技术，提出了几种Ga物种，如Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga (OH)]2+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaH2]+和[GaH]2+，在Ga/H-ZSM-5还原后形成。早期的X射线吸收研究表明，孤立的Ga+离子是Ga/H-ZSM-5中的主要物种，与镓的负载量和所用还原气体无关，这与Schreiber等人最近的报告一致。然而，对在反应条件下获得的Ga K边XANES光谱的边移的替代解释已被提出，因为XANES光谱不足以区分Ga+和低配位Ga-烷基或氢化物物种。Hensen及其同事首先使用漫反射红外傅里叶变换光谱（DRIFTS）在还原的Ga/H-ZSM-5上识别了Ga单氢化物和二氢化物物种，表明这些物种可能在PDH中发挥活性作用。然而，他们在用H2在500°C下还原样品后在室温下收集光谱，而催化剂在室温下的状态可能无法代表500°C下的催化剂状态。最近，Phadke等人提出，单个[GaH]2+位点是PDH反应的活性中心，催化剂的活性与Ga/Al比无关。这得到了FTIR光谱和NH3-TPD结果以及热力学稳定性分析的支持。然而，这些研究中的FTIR和NH3-TPD实验是在Ga/H-ZSM-5的氧化状态下进行的，其中Ga的物种可能与还原样品的物种不同。Schreiber等人报告说，Ga+H+配对位点比单个Ga+位点和母体H-ZSM-5催化剂更活跃，这是基于反应性、定量脉冲反应和DFT计算的组合。Ga+H+配对位点和孤立Ga+物种具有不同反应性的假设在Bell和Lercher小组最近的调查中被提出，然而，这些不同位点的存在在很大程度上是间接的，从反应性数据、间接实验表征和计算研究中推断出来。
