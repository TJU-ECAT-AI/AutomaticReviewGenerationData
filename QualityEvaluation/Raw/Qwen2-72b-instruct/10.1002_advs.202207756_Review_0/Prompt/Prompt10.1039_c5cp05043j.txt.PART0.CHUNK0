The surface area and pore volume of ZSM-5 and Y zeolites are progressively reduced with the increasing number of ZnO ALD cycles. XRD and SEM characterization methods show that highly dispersed ZnO species are deposited on the internal and external surfaces of both zeolites. The ZnO species deposited on ZSM-5 are in an amorphous form while nano-crystallites of ZnO are present on Y zeolites after performing Z2 cycles of ZnO ALD. XPS and TPR characterization methods reveal that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are predominantly formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD and the ZnO clusters gradually grow larger with the increasing number of ALD cycles. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites are studied by FTIR spectra of adsorbed pyridine. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites. Similar effects are obtained on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5 except that the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. Catalytic properties of the ALD ZnO modified zeolites are evaluated in propane conversion. Introduction of ZnO species significantly improves the activities of both zeolites. Propylene is the major reaction product on ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite while high selectivities to aromatics are achieved on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5. These results suggest that ZnO species merely promote the dehydrogenation reaction while the subsequent oligomerization and cyclization reactions require Brnsted acid sites. For both zeolites the catalyst fabricated by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those fabricated by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics.
Introduction Zeolites are being extensively used as acid catalysts in petro- leum refining and petrochemical industries.1,2 Due to their large surface area, excellent reactivity and stability, unique pore structure and shape selectivity, zeolites are employed in a wide spectrum of reactions including cracking, dehydrogenation,isomerization, oligomerization, and aromatization.3 Modifica- tion of zeolites with metal cations is an effective method of improving the catalytic performance by means of adjusting the acid properties and introducing different active species.4 Particu- larly, zinc modified zeolites are effective catalysts for dehydro- genation and aromatization of light alkanes.515 Zn-containing zeolites are usually synthesized by traditional techniques such as ion exchange (IE) or incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). These wet chemistry based techniques will lead to incorporation of various Zn species into the zeolite, including isolated Zn2+ or Zn(OH)+ cations localized at the exchange positions, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n)2+ clusters, as well as bulk ZnO resulting from over-exchanges.13,14 In the IE process, the cation population that can be introduced into the zeolite is usually limited by the requirement of cation charge balance. Higher metal loading capacity can be achieved by the IWI method; however,higher Zn loading by IWI will inevitably lead to un-controlled aggregation of ZnO and blocking of the zeolite pores. Besides these aqueous solution based methods, chemical vapor deposi- tion (CVD) has also been employed to introduce Zn species into zeolites. Zn2+ ions have been incorporated into HZSM-5 by chemical reaction between zinc vapor and Brnsted acid sites (BAS) of the zeolite at high temperatures.1619 Alternatively, CVD was carried out with dimethyl zinc (DMZ) at room tem- perature and proceeded stochiometrically with respect to the number of BAS on HZSM-5; the remaining methyl groups could be removed by higher temperature reduction with hydrogen or oxidation with oxygen, leading to Zn2+ ions or ZnnOm n+ clusters.13 It was discovered that highly dispersed oxygenated zinc complexes exhibit higher activities towards propane activation than isolated Xian Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xian, Shaanxi, 710065, China.

However, CVD is a nonself-limiting process in which a continuous precursor stream is performed.20 Therefore, the CVD method is lack of precise control over the dispersion and form of active species.
Originally based on CVD, in recent years atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an effective technology to synthesize catalytic materials at atomic scale precision.2125 In an ALD process, two gaseous precursors are pulsed alternatively such that each reacts with the surface functional groups generated during the previous pulse to produce a deposition cycle.26 This unique deposition pattern effectively avoids channel blocking in porous systems and ensures excellent film uniformity on almost any substrate.2734 A large number of high surface area materials, including silica gel, zeolites, and various forms of carbon materials, have been used as substrates for ALD catalyst fabrication.2729 For example, Sree et al. fabricated ultra stable Y (USY) zeolite with ALD Al2O3, the modification led to enhanced acidity and catalytic activity of the USY zeolite.31 Vuori et al. supported iridium on H-beta zeolite by ALD, producing an active catalyst for ring opening of decalin.33 In terms of alkane conver- sion, Feng et al. deposited vanadium oxides onto the internal walls of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) by ALD and turned this nanoporous structure into a novel catalytic system named the catalytic nanolith.35 For the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of cyclohexane, the nanolith catalytic system was superior to a conventional powdered catalyst in terms of both efficiency and in reducing the over oxidation. By varying the number of ALD cycles, the structures of VOx sites could be precisely tuned. In the ODH reaction, polyvanadate sites were shown to be more active than monovanadate sites. However, numerical modeling of the reaction pathways indicated that the olefin formation rate was B3 times faster on monomeric VOx sites than on polymeric VOx.25 Both DMZ and diethyl zinc (DEZ) have been used as pre- cursors for ZnO ALD. The latter reagent is more frequently used because it has an adequate vapor pressure and is easier to handle and safer to use. The binary reaction of ZnO ALD using DEZ and water as the precursors is presented below: OH* + C2H5ZnC2H5 - OZnC2H5* + C2H6 (1) OZnC2H5* + H2O - OZnOH* + C2H6 (2) In above equations the symbol - represents the substrate and * denotes the surface species involved in the ALD reaction. The first half reaction of ZnO ALD on zeolites will proceed in a similar manner as the CVD with DMZ. Instead of higher temperature reduction or oxidation, water vapor is introduced to convert surface ethyl groups into hydroxyl groups during the second half reaction of ZnO ALD, which also gen- erates reaction sites for the next cycle of deposition. In principle,the ZnO cluster size can be precisely tailored by adjusting the number of ALD cycles.
In this work we take the advantage of ALD to produce highly dispersed ZnO species on ZSM-5 and Y zeolites. The physical and chemical properties of ALD ZnO modified zeolites are studied by techniques such as mass gain analysis, physical adsorption,scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS),
temperature pro- grammed reduction (TPR), pyridine adsorption Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (Py-IR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Their catalytic performances are evaluated in propane dehydrogenation/aromatization. The relationships between the structural and chemical properties of the active phases and the catalytic performances are analyzed. Results from this work will demonstrate the unique benefits of ALD for catalyst preparation and improve understandings on alkane conversion processes over Zn-modified zeolites.
Experimental Catalyst preparation by ALD The HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 25) and HY (SiO2/Al2O3 = 5.3) zeolites were supplied by the catalyst plant of Nankai University, China.
ALD reactions were carried out with a homemade system based on the design of Elam and George.36 Detailed descriptions on this ALD system were reported elsewhere.3739 Prior to the ALD reaction, the samples were kept in the ALD reactor at 200 1C and 0.1 Torr for 5 hours to remove the adsorbed moisture. After drying, nearly 0.2 g of the sample was weighed and held in a shallow copper container covered by a piece of stainless steel mesh. The container was inserted into the middle of the reaction chamber. The ALD reaction was carried out at 120 1C and 1.0 Torr with ultra pure nitrogen (99.999%, Xian Weiguang Gas Co., China) continuously purged through the reactor at a flow rate of 110 sccm. ALD of ZnO was performed by alternate doses of DEZ (99%, Dalian Credit Electronic Gas Co., China) and deionized water to the zeolite sample. The vapor pressures of DEZ and water were controlled at B0.1 Torr by adjusting the regulating valve of each precursor channel. The exposures of the two precursors were separated by N2 purges. Each ALD cycle includes four consecutive steps: DEZ exposure, N2 purge, H2O exposure, and N2 purge again. This sequence is named the ALD pulse sequence and is usually expressed as t1t2t3t4 where tx (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) represents the duration of each step. The pulse sequences used for modifications of the HZSM-5 and HY zeolites were 60606060 s and 100100100100 s, respec- tively. The number of ALD cycles was varied (mostly from 1 to 3) to regulate the loading and structure of ZnO supported on the zeolites. After the ALD experiments the catalysts were removed from the ALD reactor and were kept in an exsiccator. The masses of the samples were measured after they were cooled down to room temperature. The zeolites fabricated by ZnO ALD were denoted as x-c-ZnO-ZSM-5 or x-c-ZnO-Y, where x represents the number of ALD cycles.
Characterization The surface areas and pore volumes of the catalyst samples were determined by N2 physisorption technique using a Micro- meritics ASAP 2010 instrument. The samples were degassed at 250 1C for 10 h prior to adsorption experiments. The accurate content of Zn in each zeolite sample was analyzed by a Perkin Elmer 7000DV Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission Paper

Surface morphologies of the catalyst samples and distributions of the Zn element were characterized by a FEI Quanta 600 FESEM equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). XPS spectra of the catalyst samples were taken using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha instrument using the Al Ka radiation source (1468.68 eV). The XPS peaks were calibrated by the binding energy of the C1s peak at 284.6 eV.
TPR measurements were carried out using a Micromeritics AutoChem 2950 HP automated catalyst characterization system.
The samples were pretreated at 300 1C in a N2 stream and then cooled down to 50 1C. Reduction was carried out in a flow of H2/Ar (10 vol%) from 50 to 800 1C with a heating rate of 20 1C min1.
The H2 consumption was measured by the TCD.
Py-IR characterization methods were performed using a VERTEX 70v FTIR spectrometer. The catalyst samples were pressed into self-supporting disks. The sample cell was evac- uated at 400 1C for 2 h; the background spectrum was measured after the sample cell was cooled to room temperature. Pyridine vapor was introduced into the sample cell for 0.5 h at room temperature. FTIR spectra were taken after the sample cell was evacuated at elevated temperatures.
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the used catalysts were performed using a TA TGA/DTA instrument. During the mea- surements the temperature was varied from 50 to 900 1C with a heating rate of 10 1C min1 under air flow.
Catalytic performance evaluation Catalysis tests were carried out in a 4 mm i.d. fixed-bed micro- reactor made of quartz. 5070 mg of catalyst was used in each test. The exact amount of the catalyst charged to the reactor was adjusted based on the ZnO loading to make sure the same amount of zeolite (B45 mg) was used. The reactant was 5 vol% C3H8 mixed with Ar and was pushed through the reactor at a rate of 10 sccm (with a WHSV of 400 h1). The reactions were carried out in the temperature range of 400600 1C at ambient pressure. The reaction products were analyzed online using an Agilent 7820 GC equipped with a TCD and an FID detector. A PLOT-Al2O3/KCl column (50 m  0.53 mm  15 mm) was used to separate light organic products. Aromatic products were separated by an HP-5 column (30 m  0.320 mm  0.25 mm).
Results and discussion The parent HY and HZSM-5 zeolites have fairly large surface areas. The large surface area and the sub-nanometer pore struc- ture may require a long time for the ALD reaction to complete. To explore the saturation conditions of ZnO ALD on the zeolites, a series of experiments with pulse sequences of xxxx seconds were carried out, in which x was varied from 5 to 100 s. Fig. 1a presents the mass gains on the two types of zeolites with different precursor dosing times after 1-cycle ZnO ALD. For both zeolites the mass gain curves level off at large precursor exposures, which is an indication of the self-limiting surface reaction typical for ALD processes. On HZSM-5 saturation of the ALD surface reaction is almost achieved with a precursor exposure of 30 s; a longer precursor exposure of 50 s is required for saturated surface reaction on HY. Based on these results, the pulse sequence used for fabrication of ZSM-5 is 60606060 s and a pulse sequence of 100100100100 s is applied for fabrication of Y zeolite.
Fig. 1b displays the sample mass gain data versus the number of ALD cycles obtained on HZSM-5 and HY under saturated ALD reaction conditions. The distinct shapes of the mass gain curves probably reflect the different pore structures of the two types of zeolites. The 10-member-ring structure of ZSM-5 has a pore size of 0.530.56 nm; while the average diameter of the 12-member-ring channel of Y zeolite is 0.74 nm.31,40,41 The linear DEZ molecule has a diameter of 0.53 nm.42 Since the micropore size of HZSM-5 is slightly larger than the diameter of DEZ, the DEZ molecules should be able to enter the micropores of HZSM-5 and react with the hydroxyl groups on the internal surface. Each ALD reaction has a reactive sticking coefficient,which refers to the ratio of the collisions that result in a surface reaction to the total number of collisions between the precursor and the substrate. The most efficient ALD processes (such as the Fig. 1 Saturation curves of ZnO ALD performed on HZSM-5 (open circles) and on HY (solid circles) zeolites (a).

Phys., 2016, 18, 601--614 This journal is the Owner Societies 2016 ALD reactions using metal alkyls and water as the precursors) have reactive sticking coefficients on the order of 104 to 103.36 This means the DEZ molecules diffused into the pores during the first ALD cycle should have plenty of chances to react with the hydroxyls located deeper inside the microchannels rather than only to react with the hydroxyl groups near the pore openings.
After the first ALD cycle the pores on ZSM-5 may be reduced to a degree that it becomes much harder for DEZ to penetrate. There- fore it is very likely that on ZSM-5 the 2nd and subsequent cycles of ALD reaction mostly occur on the external surface. From Fig. 1b it can be noticed that B9% of mass increase is obtained on HZSM-5 after the first cycle of ZnO ALD and the mass gain increases to B16% or B22% as the number of ALD cycles is further increased to 3 or 8. The smaller increase in sample mass with the increasing number of ALD cycles is an indication of the gradually reduced available surface for ALD.
Compared to HZSM-5 the sample mass gain due to ALD of ZnO is much larger on HY. The sample mass increases steeply for the first 3 cycles of ALD and an B40% mass gain is achieved with 3 cycles of ZnO ALD. Because the micropore size of HY is much larger than the diameter of DEZ, during the first 3 cycles of ZnO ALD although the pore size is gradually reduced after each ALD cycle, the remaining clearances are sufficient for DEZ molecules to diffuse through so that the internal surfaces are still available for the ALD reaction. This stage corresponds to the initial linear mass increase on Y zeolite with the increasing number of ALD cycles. After the 3rd ALD cycle, the micropores on Y zeolite become severely blocked. DEZ molecules can no longer enter the microchannels and the ALD reaction can only occur on the external surface. With the increasing number of ALD cycles the further increase in sample mass will become much slower, similar to the situation on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5. In the meantime, with more than 3 cycles of ZnO ALD coating the moisture absorption ability of the Y zeolite is affected. The abatement of moisture absorption is more serious with more cycles of ALD coating. This means that upon exposure to air the ALD ZnO fabricated Y zeolite will absorb less moisture compared to the parent zeolite, which will lead to underestimated values of sample mass gain. As a consequence,the sample mass gain appears to stop for the Y zeolite fabri- cated by more than 3 cycles of ZnO ALD.
The elemental analysis and textural properties of ALD ZnO modified zeolites are summarized in Table 1. Comparing the wt% of Zn calculated from the sample mass gain data (assuming all forms of zinc oxides have the same chemical formula of ZnO) with those measured by ICP, the contents of incorporated Zn species measured by these two methods are generally consistent. Even with only one cycle of ALD, the loading of Zn introduced by ALD is much higher than the loading that could possibly be achieved by IE. After the modifications by ALD of ZnO, the surface areas of both zeolites are significantly reduced.
Apparently, the decreased surface area is resulted from filling of the pores by ZnO species. It is worth noting that the micropore area accounts for over 3/4 of the total surface area of HY, which means that most of the reaction sites are located at the internal surface of the Y zeolite. After 3 cycles of ZnO ALD, nearly 80% of the surface area loss is the micropore area, confirming that the ALD reactions mainly occur in the internal channels of the Y zeolite. For HZSM-5 the micropore area only accounts for less than 1/2 of the total surface area. Therefore a fairly large fraction of ZnO should be deposited on the external surface. Besides, due to the limited micropore size of ZSM-5, infiltration into the internal surface would become more difficult with the increasing number of ALD cycles. After 3 cycles of ZnO ALD, the total surface area of the modified ZSM-5 is reduced from 320 to 73 m2 g1 while the micropore area decreases from 159 to 56 m2 g1. Only 42% of the lost surface area is the micropore area, indicating that a substantial portion of ZnO is deposited on the external surface when ZSM-5 is modified by multiple cycles of ALD.
X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out to deter- mine the phase compositions of ALD ZnO modified zeolites.
XRD patterns of the parent and the ALD ZnO fabricated HZSM-5 and HY are shown in Fig. 2a and b. Generally the diffraction patterns of the original and the modified zeolites are quite similar. On both zeolites the positions of the diffraction peaks corresponding to the MFI or FAU zeolitic frameworks are almost identical before and after ZnO ALD, indicating that the ALD reaction does not change the crystal structures of the zeolites. On both zeolites the intensities of the peaks at low diffraction angles (2y = 5151) are reduced. It has been demonstrated that the reduced peak intensity at low diffraction angles is attributed to foreign species (in this case, ZnO) incorporated inside the channels of the zeolites rather than collapse of the zeolitic framework.4346 On all ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5 samples and 1c-ZnO-Y no diffraction peaks corresponding to crystalline ZnO can be identified, implying that in these samples the deposited ZnO is in an amorphous form or big crystals of ZnO do not exist.
However, on the 2-cycle and 3-cycle ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite,small peaks corresponding to [101] and [110] crystal planes of ZnO can be observed at 2y = 36.2 and 56.51. According to the scheme of the ZnO ALD reaction described in eqn (1) and (2),isolated Zn(OH)+ species are produced during the first cycle of ZnO ALD; with the increasing number of ALD cycles the oxide clusters will gradually grow larger however the ZnO domain size should not reach the nanometer scale by performing only a few cycles of ALD. These ZnO crystals are probably generated through dehydration between adjacent ZnOH sites. Because multiple ZnOH sites must be involved in the formation of ZnO crystals, the development of these ZnO nanocrystals requires a Table 1 Elemental analysis and textural properties of ALD ZnO modified zeolites Sample Zn content (wt%, ICP) Zn content (wt%, mass gain analysis)

Since the attachment of Zn species relies on the chemical reaction between DEZ and the BAS, the density of ZnOH species is determined by the concentration of the BAS. The concentration of the BAS on the HY zeolite (with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 5.3) is much higher than that on the HZSM-5 zeolite (with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 25). Therefore formation of ZnO crystals is much easier on ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite.
Based on the DebyeScherrer equation, the average sizes of the ZnO crystals are estimated to be 710 nm. Due to the very limited size of the micropores, these ZnO nanocrystals must be formed on the external surface of the Y zeolite. Since most of the ZnO is believed to be deposited inside the microchannels, these nano- crystals should not represent majority of the ZnO species deposited on the Y zeolite.
Structures and morphologies of the ALD ZnO modified zeolites are studied by SEM. Fig. 3 displays representative SEM images of the ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites. Generally,the shapes and morphologies of the ALD ZnO fabricated zeolites are very similar to those of the parent zeolites. Large aggregates of ZnO domains cannot be observed, indicating uniform distribu- tion of ZnO species on the supports. For 1 to 3 cycles of ZnO ALD modified ZSM-5 and 1-cycle ZnO ALD modified Y zeolite, the surfaces of the zeolite crystals are quite smooth (Fig. 3ad) and no feature from the oxide films can be observed. However, tiny grains of nanoparticles can be observed on the surface of Y zeolite fabricated by performing 2 or 3 cycles of ZnO ALD (Fig. 3e and f). These ZnO nanoparticles are uniformly distrib- uted on the surfaces of zeolite crystals and their average size is around 10 nm. The size of ZnO nanocrystals found in the SEM images agrees with the results derived from XRD patterns using the DebyeScherrer equation. EDX mapping analyses were per- formed on selected catalyst samples (3c-ZnO-ZSM-5 and 3c-ZnO-Y).
The signal patterns of Si, O, and Zn overlap perfectly, confirming complete and conformal coating of the zeolites by ALD ZnO (data not shown).
XPS characterization methods were carried out to give insights into the electronic states of the Zn species deposited on the zeolites. The XPS spectra of the Zn(2P3/2) region of a pure ZnO reference sample and the ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites are displayed in Fig. 4. The Zn2+ species in the ZnO nanopowder has a binding energy (BE) of 1020.77 eV. The BE of the Zn species in the ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites are considerably higher than that of the pure ZnO. The peak of Zn(2P3/2) has the highest BE when the zeolite is fabricated by only 1 cycle of ZnO ALD (1022.40 eV for 1c-ZnO-ZSM-5 and
1022.70 eV for 1c-ZnO-Y); and it gradually shifts to lower BE
with the increasing number of ALD cycles. In previous studies a high BE peak at around 1023.0 eV was assigned to isolated Zn(OH)+ due to the stronger interaction between Zinc and protonic acid sites.9 Moreover, Tamiyakul, et al. confirmed that the Zn species localized at the cation exchanged sites has a high BE of about 1023.2 eV because the lattice oxygen of the zeolite exhibited higher electronegativity than the O2 ligand in bulk ZnO.12 Based on the scheme of the ALD reaction, isolated Zn(OH)+ species are anchored to the support through the lattice oxygen of the zeolite during the first cycle of ZnO ALD; in subsequent ALD cycles Zn species are grafted through the hydroxyl groups formed in the previous deposition cycle. As a consequence highest positive shifts of the BE should be observed on the zeolites fabricated by only 1 cycle of ZnO
ALD. With the increasing number of ALD cycles, the average
size of ZnO clusters progressively grows larger and their struc- tures gradually change towards that of bulk ZnO; accordingly the BE of the Zn species gradually approaches that of the pure ZnO reference sample.
TPR profiles of the ZnO nano powder reference sample and the ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites are presented in Fig. 5. Two sets of reduction peaks can be observed for the ZnO
