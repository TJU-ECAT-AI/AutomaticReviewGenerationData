ACS CatalysisVol 11/Issue 4Article Cite Share Jump to Expand REVIEWFebruary 4, 2021 Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene with Soft Oxidants via Heterogeneous Catalysis Xiao Jiang Lohit Sharma Victor Fung Sang Jae Park Christopher W. Jones Bobby G. Sumpter Jonas Baltrusaitis Zili Wu* Open PDF Abstract Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene can be achieved using conventional, oxygen-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (O2ODHP) or via the use of soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogens/halides. The major roles of soft oxidants include inhibiting overoxidation and improving propylene selectivity, which are considered to be current challenges in O2-assisted dehydrogenation. For both CO2 and N2OODHP reactions, significant efforts have been devoted to developing redox-active (e.g., chromium, vanadate, iron, etc.), nonredox-type main group metal oxide (e.g., group IIIA, gallium), and other transition metal/metal oxide catalysts (e.g., molybdenum, palladium platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, etc.), as well as zeolite-based catalysts with adjustable acidbase properties, unique pore structures, and topologies. Metal sulfides have shown promising performance in DHP, whereas the development of suitable catalysts has lagged for SO2- or S-assisted ODHP. Recently, significant efforts have been focused on homogeneous and heterogeneous ODHP using halogens (e.g., Br2, I2, Cl2, etc.) and hydrogen halides (e.g., HCl and HBr) for the development of facile processes for C3H6 synthesis. This Review aims to provide a critical, comprehensive review of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with these soft oxidants, particularly highlighting the current state of understanding of the following factors: (i) relationships between composition, structure, and catalytic performance, (ii) effects of the support, acidity, and promoters, (iii) reaction pathway and mechanistic insights, and (iv) the various roles of soft oxidants. Theoretical and computational insights toward understanding reaction mechanisms and catalyst design principles are also covered. Future research opportunities are discussed in terms of catalyst design and synthesis, deactivation and regeneration, reaction mechanisms, and alternative approaches.

1. Introduction
Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives. (2) At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP). (3) Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation. (4) Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures. (5) Presently, oxygen (O2) has been widely used as an oxidant for ODHP. Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, (6) the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity. (1,6) Most recently, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as an outstanding catalyst for O2ODHP with high C3H6 selectivity (e.g., 79% selectivity with 14% C3H8 conversion at 490 C) and well-suppressed overoxidation. (7) To date studies have mainly focused on low-temperature activity (8) and probing possible active sites and mechanisms, including surface oxy-functionalization, peculiar kinetic features, and radical chemistry in the gas phase. (9,10) Despite potential advantages, concerns of process flammability due to the presence of O2 exist and might impair practical implementation. (5,11) To address this issue, an alternative approach is to introduce soft oxidants to replace O2 for ODHP, such as CO2, NOx, and S-containing compounds, as well as halogen/halides. Furthermore, the combination of these soft oxidants in ODHP offers avenues to directly utilize them for chemical conversion to reduce or mitigate acid-gas emissions, thereby adding environment-sustainability-energy benefits to ODHP reactions. For example, an approach of H2-free CO2 conversion through the ODHP process using renewable energy could potentially help to reduce CO2 emissions. (12) There have been several excellent reviews regarding ODHP with CO2 as an oxidant. (6,1316) Most of them have concentrated on the feasibility of utilizing CO2 as an oxidant for multiple reactions but fewer focused on the details of the ODHP reaction. Also, there has been little covered regarding the development of catalysts for other soft oxidant-assisted ODHP. In addition, the growing propylene gap between market demand and productivity and the continuously increasing concerns of environmental burden motivate the need for developing alternative approaches using soft oxidants for sustainable chemical production. All of these factors necessitate a timely analysis and summary of the literature to highlight current progress in catalyst development for alkane conversion utilizing soft oxidants. (17) Therefore, the present Review describes state-of-the-art catalysts that have been developed for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants and provides an overview of the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and catalytic performance by extrapolating the reported kinetic and characterization results. Major soft oxidants including CO2, N2O, and S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides are reviewed. Among these, CO2-/NOx-assisted ODHP reactions have been mostly studied, with significant efforts aimed at developing supported metal oxide catalysts including redox-type transition metal oxides (e.g., chromium, vanadium, and iron) (5,1820) and main group metal oxides with nonredox property (e.g., gallium). (5) Catalytic performance has been found to strongly depend on the dispersion of active species and the nature of the support. (1) Based on the variation of these aspects, the roles of CO2 and N2O also differ among catalysts. (2124) In sharp contrast to CO2 and N2O, sulfur-assisted DHP and ODHP have not been well studied in the context of active sites, structure, composition, or reaction mechanism, despite these soft oxidants being potential promoters for the reaction. Additionally, sulfur compounds, such as H2S, are a common cocontaminant in natural gas. (2527) Therefore, significant effort is needed to realize the feasibility of this chemistry. Recently, catalytic oxychlorination over metal phosphate (e.g., CrPO4 and FePO4) and rare earth metal oxides/oxychlorides (e.g., CeO2 and EuOCl) has garnered more interest, as propylene yields up to 55% have been achieved at 500 C. Oxychlorination chemistry is found to be largely correlated with the ability of catalyst to oxidize HCl to molecular Cl2.
In the present Review, we start with a thermodynamic analysis of ODHP with various soft oxidants, then endeavor to cover the progress in ODHP with each soft oxidant, with emphasis on the following aspects: (i) the relationship between composition, structure, and catalytic performance, presenting the composition-induced molecular structure and active sites of catalysts in correlation with observed kinetic behavior; (ii) the influence of the nature of the support and its acidity on the activity and selectivity; and (iii) mechanistic insights, using the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and catalytic performance in conjunction with theoretical calculations to provide an overview of the working principles of ODHP reactions for different soft oxidants. In addition, this Review underlines various roles of different soft oxidants in these reactions, such as shifting reaction equilibria, reoxidizing catalysts, removing coke, serving as cocatalyst, and possessing competitive adsorption against C3H8. A perspective on future research opportunities is also provided at the very end.
2. Thermodynamic Analysis of Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with Soft Oxidants
2.1. Thermodynamic Analysis
2.1.1. CO2ODHP
For the reaction between CO2 and propane, as listed in Table 1, isotope-labeling experiments reveal the presence of parallel-consecutive reaction networks consisting of direct dehydrogenation (eq 2-1), reverse watergas shift (eq 2-2), and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (eq 2-3). (28) As is well-known, one major advantage of O2ODHP is its thermodynamic favorability due to its exothermicity (eq 2-11). (29) However, this advantage is no longer relevant in the case of CO2ODHP because all major reactions are endothermic. One of the roles of CO2 is to shift the equilibrium of the ODHP reaction (eq 2-3) to the product side by consuming produced H2 via the RWGS (eq 2-2), thereby resulting in enhanced C3H8 conversion. (22) Meanwhile, dry reforming of propane (DRP, eq 2-4) can also occur and dominate in the same temperature range (Figure 1A). DRP is thermodynamically less restrained than dry reforming of ethane and methane. (12) Of note, since the CO2ODHP reaction is a volume-increasing process, adding inert gas such as He and N2 allows a further enhancement of the equilibrium C3H8 conversion. (30) In relation to the effect of C3H8/CO2 ratios, a high CO2 partial pressure leads to higher C3H8 conversion, yet presents a detrimental impact on C3H6 production. (30) This stems from the existing competition between DRP and CO2ODHP. Therefore, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit DRP and improve ODHP, which becomes a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for CO2ODHP. (30) Figure 1 Figure 1. Thermodynamic equilibrium plots. Equilibrium product amounts for CO2ODHP (A) and SO2ODHP (B), along with temperatures. Equilibrium calculations were performed using HSC Chemistry 6 software by utilizing a Gibbs free energy minimization algorithm. Conditions: C3H8/CO2 = 1/1, C3H8/SO2 = 1/1, and ambient pressure.

Among them, propylene decomposition (eq 2-9) is thermodynamically more favorable than propane decomposition (eq 2-6). (31) Undoubtedly, these reactions have negative impacts on activity and selectivity to the target product propylene at high temperatures in both ODHP and DHP. In addition, the decomposition reactions are one of the major causes of severe catalyst deactivation through coking, with the extent varying depending on the catalysts used. For example, the decomposition reaction (eq 2-7) dominates and causes severe deactivation in the case of FeCe solid solution catalysts, (29) while the cracking reaction (eq 2-8) may occur on precious Pt catalysts. (32,33) Coke formation (eq 2-10) is one of the major causes of deactivation of the catalysts for CO2ODHP. (34) This reaction is endothermic and not a spontaneous reaction at room temperature because of its highly positive Gibbs free energy. However, it becomes spontaneous starting from 400 C (i.e., ΔG400C = 6.5 kJ mol1), resulting in catalyst deactivation in turn. In addition, propane hydrogenolysis (32,33) and CO2 methanation (29) are also reported side reactions during CO2ODHP reaction on different catalysts, yet they are scarcely studied. These thermodynamic analyses highlight the critical role of catalysts in kinetically controlling these side reactions.
The reverse Boudouard reaction (eq 2-5) is a side reaction that has been extensively studied for CO2ODHP. Its occurrence can aid coke removal, therefore inhibiting coking and improving stability. (23) This is considered one of the positive roles of utilizing CO2 as an oxidant and is discussed in detail in section 3.5.3.
2.1.2. N2OODHP
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is also a soft oxidant that has been used widely in ODHP. Two parallel reactions are involved, including N2O decomposition to O2 and N2 (eq 2-12) and the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction (eq 2-13). (19,35,36) As listed in Table 1, these reactions are exothermic and spontaneous at room temperature. Similar to O2ODHP, this reaction route is free of thermodynamic restraint.
2.1.3. ODHP in the Presence of Sulfur-Containing Compounds
Sulfur-containing compounds can serve as either soft oxidants or promoters for ODHP reactions. SO2 is a potential oxidant for the ODHP reaction (eq 2-14), but the reaction is endothermic and not spontaneous at room temperature (Table 1). (37,38) In comparison to CO2ODHP, SO2ODHP requires less energy and becomes spontaneous at 300 C (i.e., ΔG300C = 2.1 kJ mol1), lower than that for CO2ODHP (i.e., ΔG700C = 1.9 kJ mol1). An alternative is to use S2 as an oxidant, and it can be generated/regenerated in situ with the introduction of H2S in the feed gas. (39,40) In this reaction, H2S partial oxidation to form S2 is the initial step (eq 2-15), followed by C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 with S2 being reduced to H2S (eq 2-16). Notably, the thermodynamic restraint of S2ODHP is lower than that of N2OODHP (i.e., ΔG175C = 0.4 kJ mol1). Considering the exothermicity and spontaneity of H2S partial oxidation (Table 1), the S2(H2S)ODHP reaction can readily occur in the temperature range that has been examined in the literature (400950 C). S2 can be regenerated through partial H2S oxidation to complete the reaction cycle. Inspired by the Claus Process in the industry, (41) the use of SO2 has been proposed to oxidize H2S for S recovery (eq 2-17), which does not pose a thermodynamic limit (Table 1). (42) Despite the thermodynamic feasibility of using molecular sulfur for ODHP, it presents problems because of the temperature sensitivity of sulfur polymorphs. To obtain reactive, diradical species S2, high temperatures (i.e., 648800 C) are required. (43,44) However, thermal cracking of C3H8 may occur at such high temperatures, making this reaction more challenging.
2.1.4. Halogen(X2)-Promoted ODHP and Oxyhalogenation
Halogens have been known as effective promoters for oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. (45,46) As listed in Table 1, a halogen can react with C3H8 by abstracting hydrogen to form hydrogen halide (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22), followed by regeneration of the halogen via oxidation with O2 (eqs 2-19, 2-21, and 2-23). (43) Cl2-promoted ODHP (eq 2-18) is exothermic and spontaneous at room temperature; therefore, it is free from thermodynamic restraint. Br2-promoted ODHP is slightly endothermic but still spontaneous at room temperature (eq 2-20). Despite such difference, the thermodynamic restraint is negligible, as 100% C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield can be achieved starting from 25 C (not shown here). Differently, I2-promoted ODHP is endothermic and not a spontaneous reaction at room temperature (eq 2-22). As presented in Figure 2A, the conversion and yield start to increase at 200 C, gradually rise with temperature, and ultimately reach 100% at 1000 C. Although Cl2-promoted ODHP is more thermodynamically favorable, the reaction is always fast and nonselective toward the formation of propylene, and there is a risk of explosion under some conditions. (47) On the other hand, I2-promoted ODHP suffers from limited recycling efficiency of expensive I2, hampering its industrial implementation. (47) By contrast, Br2-promoted ODHP is more feasible from a practical point of view, yet a high C3H8/Br ratio is necessary to avoid the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2. (47) As reported, the activity of the ODHP reaction in the presence of a halogen relies heavily on the ease with which the hydrogen halide is oxidized back to the halogen. (43) As presented in Figure 2B and 2C, clearly, HI oxidation is thermodynamically more favorable than the rest, rendering it an outstanding candidate among the halogens in the case of the halo-dehydrogenation reaction.

Equilibrium conversion and yield of I-promoted C3H8 dehydrogenation reaction (A) as a function of temperature; equilibrium halide (HX) conversion (B) and halogen yield (X2) (C) of halide oxidation along with temperatures. Conditions: C3H8/halide = 2/0.5, C3H8/I2 = 1/1 (stoichiometric ratio, as shown in Table 1), and ambient pressure.
An alternative is to integrate the functionalization of C3H8 and the regeneration of halogen-based compounds in one step via propane oxyhalogenation, followed by the formation of propylene through dehydrohalogenation (eqs 2-242-29). (48,49) Dehydrohalogenation requires energy input, but these reactions possess no thermodynamic restraint as a whole, as the total reaction is analogous to O2ODHP in eq 2-11. Besides, dehydrohalogenation becomes spontaneous at mild reaction temperatures, such as with HCl at 175 C (i.e., ΔG175C = 2.0 kJ mol1), with HBr at 275 C (i.e., ΔG275C = 2.1 kJ mol1), and with HI at ca. 300 C (i.e., ΔG300C = 1.1 kJ mol1). Different to halogen-promoted ODHP, the evolution of a halogen via halide oxidation should be suppressed during oxyhalogenation, especially in the gas phase reaction, as it triggers undesired reaction paths including polyhalogenation, coking, cracking, and combustion. (50) In this context, HI is less favorable among halides in oxyhalogenation of propane, whereas HCl is a better candidate. This can also be reflected from the lower values in the changes of enthalpy and Gibbs free energy (Table 1).
2.2. Comparison between ODHP Reaction with Various Soft Oxidants
For ODHP reactions with various soft oxidants discussed above, O2-/N2O-assisted ODHP, as well as Cl2-promoted ODHP and oxyhalogenation, reactions are exothermic and spontaneous, leading to no thermodynamic limit. The remaining reactions including CO2-/SO2-assisted and Br2-/I2-promoted ODHP reactions are endothermic, whereas the later reactions are thermodynamically more favorable than the former ones if the halogen regeneration reactions are taken into consideration. Between CO2- and SO2-assisted ODHP reactions, the former reaction is the least favorable, as CO2 is both thermodynamically and chemically stable.
Figure 3 compares equilibrium C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield for the cases of CO2 and SO2ODHP under their respective stoichiometric ratio, as well as those of the direct dehydrogenation reaction. As presented in Figure 3A, both SO2 and CO2ODHP exhibit higher C3H8 conversion than exhibited for direct dehydrogenation, especially for SO2ODHP, which displays a rapid increase in C3H8 conversion at low temperatures (i.e., 25200 C). Such prominence can also be reflected from the highest C3H6 yield in Figure 3B, demonstrating the promising role of SO2 as a soft oxidant for selective C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6. By contrast, CO2ODHP shows no conversion between 25 and 200 C and can only occur at 300 C and above, analogous to the DHP reaction. Although it shows a slight enhancement in C3H8 conversion between 300 and 800 C, the C3H6 yield of CO2ODHP decreases in comparison to that of DHP. High temperatures can trigger both RWGS and DRP reactions because of their endothermicity, which promotes C3H8 conversion. Yet, the initiation of these two reactions also results in production of more undesired CO as a carbonaceous product, in turn, reducing the C3H6 yield. As shown in Figure 3C, SO2ODHP also presents limited thermodynamic restraint, as it shows a similar, rapid increase in SO2 conversion, reaching the highest value at a lower temperature than CO2ODHP. Combined with the above observations, SO2ODHP is thermodynamically easier than CO2ODHP, along with limited thermodynamic restraint at low temperatures (i.e., 25200 C).

3. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with Carbon Dioxide
To verify the feasibility of CO2ODHP, early screening tests were conducted on metal oxides that are active for DHP and O2ODHP, including transition metal oxides (Fe2O3 and Cr2O3) and main-group metal oxides (Ga2O3, Al2O3, and SiO2). (51,52) Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none. For SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts, Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity (Table 2). Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acidbase property, etc.).

Of note, deactivation is rapid on individual metal oxides, especially on Ga2O3 (75% from 0.17 to 0.75 h on stream) and Cr2O3 (78% within the same time range). (52) Carbon deposition and reduction in active sites might be responsible for such rapid deactivation, the dominance of which depends on the nature of metal oxide, roles of CO2, and reaction mechanisms. Hence, unraveling the deactivation mechanisms and seeking solutions for catalyst regeneration are another area that has been extensively studied. In addition, there are other challenges to be addressed, such as the competitive adsorption between CO2 and C3H6 and elusive reaction mechanisms.
On the basis of the achievements in these areas, this section mainly covers the progress in (i) developing fundamental understanding of the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and activity with representative redox-active and nonredox metal oxide catalysts (i.e., loading-dependent evolution of active sites during reaction, support/promoter nature), (ii) catalyst deactivation and regeneration, and (iii) the roles of CO2 in affecting reaction paths, modifying catalyst surfaces, and coke removal.

3.1.1.1. Identification of Active Cr Sites and Redox Cycles
Cr Content-Dependent Evolution of Cr Sites For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. (5)Table 3 summarizes the surface density of commonly used redox-active metal oxides on supports. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+  dispersed Cr6+ oxide  microcrystalline Cr3+  crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. (76) α-Cr2O3 is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, yet inactive for catalysis because of its high resistance to reduction and oxidation. (54) Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity. Below monolayer coverage, the C3H6 yield usually increases with an increase in Cr content; but beyond this threshold, the excess redox Cr species cannot be attached with the support so that unstable Cr species may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity. (54) An analogous monolayer threshold is also known for supported VOx catalysts for the O2ODHP reaction. (77) Table 3.

Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). (55) (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both (Table 2). Diffuse reflectance UVvis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %). The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active.
Redox Cycle As shown in Figure 4, there exists a clear correlation of C3H6 yield with the number of redox sites, corroborating the important role of redox Cr species in assuring high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP. (22) However, the redox cycles are not unambiguously established. There are two major types of redox cycles that have been proposed, namely, Cr6+  Cr3+/Cr2+ and Cr3+  Cr2+. The former redox cycle is proposed on MCM-41- (Figure 5), TUD-1-, (11) and Al2O3-supported Cr catalysts, (8082) while the latter is known on Ni-promoted (56) (Figure 5) and unpromoted CrOx/SiO2. (57) On the basis of these supported Cr catalysts, one can postulate a potential correlation of the nature of the support with Cr reducibility, as well as with Cr loading-dependent dispersion. Major progress has been made in unveiling the later correlation. However, the support effect has been scarcely studied.

Copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V. Proposed redox cycles of Cr sites on Cr-MCM-41 and CrNi/SiO2 for CO2ODHP were adapted on from refs (80and81) and ref (56), respectively.
On Cr-MCM-41 with high Cr dispersion, CO2 enables the completion of the redox cycle by reoxidizing the reduced Cr(III)O6 to Cr(VI)O4, though the oxidation efficiency is not comparable to O2 (Figure 5). (58) In contrast, Michorczyk et al. reported a redox cycle of Cr3+  Cr2+ on CrOx/SiO2 below a monolayer Cr coverage (0.34 Cr nm2, see Table 3). (57) As shown in Table 2, C3H8 conversion increases with the rise of reaction temperatures, and C3H6 selectivity is higher than 94%. Meanwhile, CO2 conversion is evident, yet the values are not comparable to those of C3H8 conversion. In situ diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) spectra reveal that the reoxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ (eq 3-1) hardly occurs during regeneration, even if the catalyst is exposed to an excess of CO2. Hence, the redox-property scenario in O2ODHP (i.e., Cr6+  Cr3+/Cr2+) is unlikely replicated in CO2ODHP (eq 3-2). Given their capability to catalyze both DHP and RWGS reactions, (83) CrOx might take part in the reaction through the redox cycle of Cr3+  Cr2+ with H2, formed via RWGS (eq 3-3), as the reducing agent, followed by reoxidation of Cr2+ to Cr3+ by CO2 (eq 3-4). Of note, such a case might only happen below a monolayer coverage, because the migration of Cr3+ species to form stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow, giving rise to the further reduction of Cr3+  Cr2+.
(3-1) (3-2) (3-3) (3-4) Comprehensive reaction paths have been proposed by incorporating both redox and nonredox sites. (59) As illustrated in Figure 5, the oxidized CrOx and reduced CrOx1 sites are proposed as the major active sites responsible for C3H8 dehydrogenation. Generally, the C3H6 yield increases with the concentration of Cr6+ species, indicative of their crucial role as precursors to form active species. At the initial stage, the reduction of Cr6+ species leads to the generation of Cr2+/Cr3+ species (i.e., CrOx1), which triggers the C3H6 formation through a nonoxidative pathway. Also, the nonredox Cr3+ sites (CrOy), formed through Cr3+ oxide agglomeration, may contribute to the nonoxidative pathway, though insignificantly. Alternatively, the presence of CO2 contributes to the completion of the redox cycle, namely, CrOx  CrOx1, enabling C3H6 formation through the oxidative pathway. The presence of a redox cycle can boost the H2 consumption via RWGS and therefore promote C3H6 formation by shifting the equilibrium of the ODHP to the product side.
3.1.1.2. Effects of Support
The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity. Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.
Metal Oxides In an early work led by Ge et al., the prominent activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 has been confirmed via screening tests on Cr2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2, and Cr2O3/MCM-41 (Table 2). (51) Relatively weak metalsupport interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2. (60) In the presence of CO2, the partially oxidized Cr2O3 surface and the boundaries of Cr2O3 and SiO2, are responsible for the improved C3H6 yield. (74,75) Although high CO2 conversion can be achieved on the ZrO2-supported counterpart, its strong basicity leads to lower C3H6 selectivity but higher selectivity toward CO and CH4. (51,60,61) Competitive adsorption between CO2 and C3H8 occurs on supports with amphoteric property, such as γ-Al2O3, leading to decreased catalytic performance (Table 2), especially at higher CO2 partial pressures. (62,82) MCM-41-supported Cr catalysts exhibit comparable activity to the SiO2-supported counterpart, which is associated with its ordered mesoporous structure with large surface area and pore volume. (51) Such prominence is also evident on SBA-15 and SBA-1 (Table 2). (54) The ordered mesoporous structure and large surface area not only helps to improve Cr surface density but also the dispersion of the Cr6+ species, thereby benefiting C3H6 formation.
Because of the high activity of Ga2O3 in CO2ODHP (discussed in section 3.2.1), it has been applied as support for Cr catalysts with expectation of synergistic effect. Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr2O3/β-Ga2O3 with various loadings for CO2ODHP. (63) The CO2-promoting effect is observed on Cr6.8/β-Ga2O3 at temperatures higher than 570 C (Table 2). Adding Cr neutralizes the acid sites on β-Ga2O3, leading to coking resistance through a CO2-induced reverse Boudouard reaction.
Ordered, Mesoporous Silica (MCM-41, MSU-x, SBA-15/SBA-1, and TUD-1) As mentioned above, the redox properties and appropriate dispersion of Cr species on the surface are important for CO2ODHP. To achieve high activity and selectivity, introducing mesoporous silica as a support offers avenues to tune these factors. The materials that have been explored include MCM-41, MSU-x, SBA-15/SBA-1, and TUD-1.
MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, features well-ordered channels, controllable uniform pore size (210 nm), and large surface area, and can be incorporated by heteroatoms, such as Cr, into the wall substituting Si4+ and forming isolated active centers. (84) Direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods are effective in tuning the locations and coordination environments of the incorporated metal cations. (8486) Wang et al. have prepared Cr-incorporated MCM-41 catalysts by both DHT and TIE methods, and found different Cr species in the calcined forms. (58) DHT results in monochromate species on the wall surface of MCM-41, while TIE produces a large quantity of polychromate species other than monochromate. Despite such differences, both catalysts are reduced from Cr6+ to Cr3+ oxide clusters during reaction, which explains their analogous activity and selectivity (Table 2). X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS) spectroscopic measurements reveal the reduction of Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination in the formed monochromate species to Cr(III)O6 octahedra during the reaction, in which Cr(VI)O4 is more active than Cr(III)O6. (80,81) CO2 enables the completion of the redox cycle by participating in the reoxidation of Cr(III)O6 to Cr(VI)O4 in Cr-MCM-41 (Figure 5). In a later work, Piotr et al. have also found prominent activity and selectivity on MCM-41-supported CrOx catalysts with optimal Cr loading at 6.8 wt. % (Table 2). (64) Similarly, well-dispersed Cr species play a pivotal role in promoting the catalytic performance; yet differently, a redox cycle of Cr2+  Cr3+ is proposed (Figure 5), analogous to the scenario reported by Yun et al. (56) and Ohishi et al. (87) MSU-x features high surface area (6001000 m2 g1 and 35 nm pore size) and 3D wormlike channels, which can potentially improve the dispersion of Cr species and facilitate the diffusion of reagent molecules. (88) For these reasons, Liu et al. have prepared Cr-MSU-x catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (i.e., 120 wt. %) for CO2ODHP. (65) C3H8 conversion reaches the highest at Cr = 5 wt. % at 550 C (Table 2). At 600 C, C3H8 conversion is as high as 50%, and C3H6 selectivity is 83.5%. A Cr loading-dependent transformation of Cr sites has been evident in the calcined catalysts, such as Cr(VI) in monochromate  V(VI) in di/trichromates  crystalline/amorphous α-Cr2O3. The trade-off between active Cr(VI) and α-Cr2O3 with elevated Cr loading determines the optimized Cr loading at 5 wt. %, and coordinatively unsaturated Cr(III) ions are active sites responsible for dehydrogenation.
A comparative study, led by Zhang et al., finds that a SBA-15-supported Cr catalyst exerts better catalytic performance and stability than γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and ZrO2-supported counterparts for CO2ODHP (Table 2). (60) Such prominent activity and coking resistance are associated with the preservation of active Cr(III) species in the presence of CO2, weak metalsupport interactions, and the high surface area of the support. Similarly, SBA-1 is also a promising candidate not only because of its high surface area, narrowed pore size, and 3D channels but also due to its characteristic cubic mesoporous phase, which is mechanically more stable than materials with hexagonal mesopores. (89,90) This is valuable for industrial applications where catalyst shaping processes are necessary. Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr-SBA-1 catalysts via a direct synthesis method using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), ammonium dichromate, and tetraethyl orthosilicate as surfactant, Cr precursor, and Si source, respectively. (66) The as-prepared catalysts present characteristic 3D pore structures, though the incorporation of Cr results in limited perturbation of the structural order. The catalytic performance varies depending on the Cr/Si molar ratios and reaches optimal performance at Cr/Si = 0.04 (Table 2). The same group has also continued their work by exploring the Cr loading-dependent evolution of Cr species on Cr/SBA-1 catalysts. (59) Incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) is used to prepare the catalysts because this allows a higher density of active sites, while preserving the pore structure. Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 have been observed on Cr/SBA-15 catalysts in the calcined form, with Cr loading increasing from 1 to 15 wt. %. Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and dichromates present in all catalysts, regardless of Cr loadings; Cr5+ species exist at Cr loading below 7 wt. %; inactive α-Cr2O3 species can be detected at a Cr loadings higher than 5 wt. %. As compared in Table 2, the catalytic performance reaches maximum at Cr = 7 wt. % and barely changes with elevated Cr loadings, which is associated with the dominance of inactive α-Cr2O3 species. Similarly, activity performance is a function of well-dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ sites and the redox cycle, the formation of which stems from the rapid reduction of Cr6+ species upon contact with C3H8.
To better disperse CrOx species and facilitate mass transfer within the pores, TUD-1, with high surface area and unique 3D mesoporous network structure, has been introduced as support. (11) To ascertain the formation of CrOx with small, uniform crystals, a microwave irradiation method is used to prepare the catalysts. 5%Cr/TUD-1 exhibits higher C3H8 conversion at 24% and C3H6 selectivity at 90% at 550 C (Table 2), while good stability at 8 h on stream is observed on 7%Cr/TUD-1. High catalytic performance can be attributed to the unique 3D mesoporous structure enabling the encapsulation of CrOx particles with high dispersion.
Activated Carbons (ACs) ACs are also promising support materials because of their high surface area and abundant surface oxygen functional groups (OFGs) with tunable acidbase properties. Kutrowski et al. have introduced HNO3-activated AC with high surface area support for Cr catalysts and obtained optimal catalytic performance at Cr = 5 wt. % (Table 2). (67) Carbonyl and carboxyl species, known as respective basic and acid OFGs on the surface of AC, are identified as additional active sites in the reaction. Their gradual reduction with time on stream (TOS) is linked with the fast deactivation other than coking.
3.1.1.3. Effects of Promoter
CO2 has been proposed to participate in the redox cycles of Cr2+  Cr3+ (59,64) or Cr3+  Cr6+; (56,80,91) however, its oxidation potential is rather weak. Besides, CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx. (59) The addition of O2 in the reactants as a co-feed with CO2 has been initially proposed to overcome these issues, yet the selectivity drops. (55) An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance.
Alkali Metal Oxides Because of their basic property, alkali metal oxides have been widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions. (92) Ge et al. have prepared K-promoted Cr2O3/SiO2 with various K loadings for CO2ODHP. (51) The addition of K results in the reduction of C3H8 conversion in comparison to unpromoted Cr2O3/SiO2, though a higher C3H6 selectivity is obtained (Table 2). According to characterization results, K addition modifies the Cr2O3 surface by decreasing its redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in the drop in C3H8 conversion. Similar impacts are evident on Li-/Na-promoted Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts, except that the stability of C3H6 yield can be improved by K. (93) IR results show that a substantial part of protons in hydroxyl groups on the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 are replaced by alkali metal ions, the loss of which accounts for the drop in activity on promoted catalysts.
Transition Metals (Ru and Ni) Ru is a potential promoter because of its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation. (94,95) Jin et al. have prepared Ru-promoted Cr2O3/SiO2 and clarified the Ru loading-dependent reactivity in CO2ODHP. (68) C3H8 conversion presents a volcano-like trend that maximizes at Ru = 1 wt. % with almost doubled C3H8 conversion and improved C3H6 selectivity in comparison to the unpromoted counterpart (Table 2). A proper amount of Ru plays an important role in optimizing activity and selectivity because it can balance the RWGS and C3H6 reforming.
Ni is also a potential candidate because of its activity in CO2 activation for CO2 reforming reactions (96,97) and RWGS. (98100) Yun et al. have prepared Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalysts for CO2ODHP. (56) In the calcined form, NiO and CrOx distribute in the vicinity of one another, and the presence of Ni can affect the Cr species by converting them to nickel chromate. The Ni-promoted catalyst outperforms the unpromoted counterpart in both activity and stability (Table 2). Particularly, CO2 conversion has been significantly improved. The major role of Ni is to facilitate CO2 dissociation to CO and an adsorbed O* next to the Ni site, which can subsequently regenerate Cr3+ via reoxidation.
3.1.1.4. Innovation in Preparation Methods
Dispersion and types of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts are crucial in determining the catalytic performance, and can be generally tuned by pH, ligand effect, and surfactant. Synthetic approaches include (N0Mn+)I0 pathway, (69) metal vapor synthesis method, (70) and solgel method. (71) Efforts are also devoted to improving selectivity while preserving activity of CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, as they present outstanding C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, though CH4 is dominant (section 3.1.1.2). Synthetic methods revolve around tuning the surface acidbase properties, crystalline structure, and textural properties. Developed synthetic approaches include hydrothermal methods (61) and acidbase pairs. (101) (N0Mn+)I0 Pathway Driven by Electrostatic Driving Force Dispersion of Cr6+ species and crystallite size are sensitive to pH during the synthesis. (69) At pH < 2, Cr species are present in the forms of tri- and tetrachromates (Cr3O102 and Cr4O132, respectively), which are highly polymerized and susceptible to forming inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3; at 2 < pH < 6, the formation of smaller Cr anions, such as dichromate (Cr2O72), is favored, leading to better Cr dispersion; at pH > 8, isolated CrO4 is stable but hardly leads to high activity for CO2ODHP. To obtain highly dispersed Cr species with desired types, Baek et al. have introduced a (N0Mn+)I0 pathway to prepare MSU-x-supported Cr catalysts at pH = 4, in which N0 is a nonionic poly(ethylene oxide) surfactant, Mn+ is the metal cation, and I0 is an electrically neutral silica precursor, and the assembly process of metal cations is driven by electrostatic control. (69) Chromium(III) acetate hydroxide ((CH3CO2)7Cr3(OH)2) is used to offer both Cr3+ cations and electrostatic driving force, as well as helping to disperse the precursor molecules through the steric effect of ligands. The as-prepared catalysts present a mesopore structure resembling 3D wormhole-like holes with high surface areas (e.g., 730903 m2 g1), pore volumes (e.g., 0.711.03 cm3 g1), and narrow pore size (e.g., 3.94.5 nm). Optimal catalytic performance is achieved at Cr = 1.27 wt. %, which also outperforms the catalyst prepared by IWI with the same Cr loading (Table 2). The H2-TPR profiles reveal the presence of isolated and polymeric Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts, which are designated as hard and soft Cr6+ species, respectively, based on their reducibility. Soft Cr6+ species are crucial to achieve high catalytic performance, while hard species have a negative impact on activity. During the reaction, these soft Cr6+ species-derived coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species promote RWGS and C3H6 formation through the redox cycle of Cr3+  Cr6+.Metal Vapor Synthesis Method The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) method enables the co-condensation of metal vapor with the vapor of weakly stabilizing organic ligands during the preparation, the well-defined organometallic species or solvent-stabilized metal clusters are formed, which is conducive to prepare supported metal catalysts on a wide range of organic and inorganic support materials. (102105) On Cr-based catalysts, this method allows high Cr dispersion even at quite high loadings, particularly useful for the support with limited surface area. Botavina et al. have prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts by the MVS method with a wide range of Cr loadings, namely, 0.2510 wt. %. (70) An optimal Cr loading is obtained at 6.0 wt. % (Table 2), at which both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield have been substantially increased by 1.8- and 1.7-fold, respectively, in comparison to Cr0.25/SiO2, while the reduction of C3H6 selectivity is merely 7.3%.SolGel Method Wang et al. have prepared CrOx-doped mesoporous silica sphere (Cr/MSS) catalysts by one-pot synthesis via a solgel method, and systematically investigated the influence of adding active precursors on the morphology, pore structure, and active species, as well as their correlation with catalytic performance. (71) Generally, all synthetic procedures entail the first step of preparing a surfactant solution (CTAB and triethanolamine, TEAH3) and the second step of adding a Si source. The catalysts are categorized into three groups, namely, MSS-1, MSS-2, and MSS-3, representing adding the Cr precursor in the first step, second step, and after the second step, respectively. For Cr/MSS-2, adding the Cr precursor concurrently with the Si source exerts well-dispersed Cr species on the micelle-silica walls with the gradual generation of silica walls, and no Cr species enter the core of the silica sphere. Such a feature results in high dispersion of Cr species with more isolated chromates, enhanced medium acid sites, and well-retained pore structure of the silica sphere. Therefore, Cr/MSS-2 exhibits the highest C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, with slightly lower C3H6 selectivity among three catalysts, and also outperforms the benchmark Cr/MSS-4, prepared by IWI (Table 2).Hydrothermal Method Oliveira et al. have prepared Cr/ZrO2 via a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, a facile, time-efficient method to prepare oxides with smaller crystallites through fast nucleation. (61) The incorporation of microwave results in the formation of smaller tetragonal t-ZrO2 crystallite. At lower Cr content (i.e., 5 wt. %), m-Cr/ZrO2, prepared by the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, displays higher activity in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield than c-Cr/ZrO2, prepared by a conventional hydrothermal method, but lower C3H6 selectivity, as well as faster deactivation (Table 2). Wu et al. have investigated the temperature effects of hydrothermal treatment on the catalytic performance on CrZr bimetallic oxides, and obtained optimal activity and selectivity on the catalyst treated at 180 C (Table 2). (72) At this temperature, more Cr6+ species, a precursor of active species Cr3+/Cr2+ species, are formed, leading to the substantially enhanced activity with well-retained high selectivity.AcidBase Pair The acidbase pair concept is a self-adjusted process that has been widely used to prepare ordered, mesoporous multimetal oxides, (101) in which the pH of the desired solgel reaction is adjusted by a self-generated reaction medium between two or more inorganic species with the correct acidity. (106) Xie et al. have prepared Cr oxide-modified mesoporous ZrO2 (Cr-ZrO2) via the acidbase pair pathway. (73) The as-prepared bimetallic oxides feature mesoporous structures resembling 3D wormholes. The crystalline structure of ZrO2 shifts from a monoclinic to tetragonal, then to disordered crystals with the increased Cr content, which in turn affects the dispersion of Cr species. 7Cr-ZrO2 presents more abundant well-dispersed Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species, which are precursors for the formation of active Cr3+/Cr2+ species during reaction, thereby leading to the highest initial activity and selectivity (Table 2).
3.1.1.5. Deactivation and Regeneration
Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts. Coking is relatively easier to reverse by reoxidation; moreover, the presence of CO2 can help to remove coke in situ through a reverse Boudouard reaction or to inhibit the coking process. (73) Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable. For example, regeneration in O2 at 600 C for 5 min can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, and such recovery is repeatable after 4 cycles. (67) Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation. Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. (55) By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species. As aforementioned (section 3.1.1.4), Baek et al. have introduced a (N0Mn+)I0 pathway to prepare MSU-x-supported Cr catalysts with highly dispersed Cr species. (69) The activity can be completely recovered under simple oxidation in air at 650 C, retaining its repeatability after 6 cycles.
From a practical point of view, increasing Cr loading while preserving high dispersion is necessary to attain comparable catalytic performance that meets industrial requirements. However, the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 is inevitable at higher Cr loadings, the presence of which limits the activity and is also detrimental to stability. To overcome this issue, Botavina et al. have prepared highly dispersed CrSiO2 catalysts by direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. (21) By following the procedure of MCM-41 synthesis, the as-prepared catalysts exhibit MCM-41-type mesoporous structure with high surface area (6001000 m2 g1). Long-term tests demonstrate better stability of Cr2.0SiO2 in C3H8 conversion after 900 min on stream in the joint presence of CO2 and O2 (Figure 6A), but accompanied by a lower C3H6 yield than the other reaction conditions (Figure 6B). The improved stability originates from the trade-off between the reduced C3H6 yield and increased C2H4 yield (Table 2). Notably, a relatively well-retained yield is obtained under the condition of CO2 alone (Figure 6B). Spectroscopic studies (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy) reveal that the average oxidation state of Cr in CO2ODHP is 2+, which is lower than that (i.e., Cr3+) in the presence of co-fed O2. This is indicative of a lower probability of forming crystalline α-Cr2O3 if CO2 is the only oxidant. Apparently, the combination of the soft oxidant CO2 and well-dispersed Cr species in the 3D pore structure with high surface area is effective in avoiding fast deactivation and in prolonging the catalyst lifetime.

Changes of C3H8 conversion (A) and C3H6 yield (B) versus reaction time during ODHP and DHP reactions on Cr2.0SiO2 catalyst (T = 600 C, GHSV = 200 h1) in the as-prepared state (open symbols) and after reaction and subsequent treatment in O2 at 600 C for 6 h (solid symbols: after 58 runs): (a) C3H8: N2 = 15: 85 (green curve; solid symbol: after 5 runs), (b) C3H8: CO2: N2 = 15: 30: 55 (blue curve; solid symbol: after 8 runs), (c) C3H8: O2: N2 = 15: 3: 82 (red curves; solid symbols: after 5 runs), and (d) C3H8: CO2: O2: N2 = 15: 30: 3: 52 (orange curves; solid symbols: after 8 runs).

As discussed in section 3.1.1.2, the unique pore structure and large surface area of mesoporous support materials are effective in confining the growth of Cr species and affecting dispersion and structure of Cr species. However, the preservation of pore structure and porosity under reaction conditions is challenging. Michorczyk et al. find that the irreversible degradation of the pore structure after multiple cycles leads to decreased selectivity on Cr0.04-SBA-1. (66) An option to preserve the unique pore structure is to control the Cr loading at a lower level, however, this sacrifices the activity. Choosing proper synthetic methods to prepare catalysts provides solutions to overcome this issue. Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr/SBA-1 catalyst by IWI. (59) Compared to the Cr-SBA-1 prepared by direct synthesis method, the pore structure of IWI-prepared catalysts is preserved to a larger degree, significantly alleviating the irreversible deactivation caused by pore collapse.
3.1.2. Vanadium(V)-Based Catalysts
3.1.2.1. Identification of Active V Sites and Redox Cycle
VOx is another redox-active metal oxide that has been extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction, and the overoxidation still impairs the effort to achieve high C3H6 selectivity. Early attempts have tried to neutralize the sites for overoxidation on vanadate catalysts. Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorptiondesorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites. (107,108) Similar to CrOx, catalytic performance of VOx depends on its structure, dispersion, and interaction with the support. (1) Depending on the ratio of metal loading and surface area of support, four types of VOx species are present during reaction, including monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite. (77,109)Figure 7 illustrates the evolution of surface VOx configurations as a function of surface V density on VOx/Al2O3. Monovanadate VOx species are proposed as active sites (see Table 3 for monolayer surface density on various metal oxide supports). The oxygen of VO (vanadyl) groups of the monomeric VOx species are reported to account for propylene formation. (115) As the vanadia surface density increases, oligomeric species appear to emerge and are considered more active for propylene synthesis than the monomeric species. (77) Bulk V2O5 favors overoxidation, thus reducing C3H6 selectivity. (77,110,111) Noteworthily, there is another type of proposed active site at submonolayer V coverages, in which the bridging VO-support bond is critical for O2ODHP. (1) Its strength appears to associate to the ODHP reaction kinetics, as evidenced from the variations in apparent activation energy among vanadium catalysts supported on NbO5, SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, and TiO2. However, this scenario is scarcely reported in CO2ODHP.
Figure 7 Figure 7. Schematic illustration of surface V density-dependent configurational evolutions of VOx species on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. (77,109) Results of isothermal reduction confirm that CO2 cannot reoxidize the catalyst completely to V2O5 but is capable of oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4. (28) Redox mechanisms have been proposed on the silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+OV3+ pair via density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction network including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS. (28) As illustrated in Figure 8, V4+ plays an important role in the activation of the secondary CH bond of C3H8 (RDS) by hydrogen abstraction in both CO2ODHP and DHP routes. Yet the regeneration of active V sites differs, in which V3+ can be reoxidized through the dissociative CO2 adsorption, while the regeneration in DHP follows the path of hydrogen migration from the bridge oxygen to V3+  hydrogen migration from the vanadyl oxygen (V5+OH) to bridge oxygen  desorption of H2. In RWGS, V4+ sites are involved in H2 dissociation and water formation and desorption. CO2 dissociation also occurs on reduced V3+ sites, reoxidizing V3+ sites through oxygen abstraction. Of note, alternative redox cycles have also been known, such as the V5+  V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst. (112) Figure 8 Figure 8. Catalytic cycles for CO2ODHP (A), DHP (B), and RWGS (C) on silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+OV3+. Gibbs free energy barriers at 600 C are reported in kJ mol1 next to the reaction arrows. Underlined numbers correspond to the highest Gibbs free energy barriers of the catalytic cycle. Reproduced with the permission from ref (28). Copyright 2016 Elsevier B.V.
3.1.2.2. Effects of Support
Mesoporous silica has been introduced as support to prepare VOx catalysts with high dispersion. (1) However, these materials have long, isolated channels and inefficient mass transfer, leading to low catalytic activity. (113) Therefore, mesoporous materials with short-range, ordered mesopores with highly dispersed VOx species are desired. Xue et al. have prepared homogeneous, monodispersed 3D dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (3D dendritic MSNSs) and used them as support for VOx catalysts. (114) The catalysts have been prepared via an oilwater biphase stratification reaction system that allows the delicate control of monolayer coverage and prohibit agglomeration of V species to V2O5. The as-prepared catalyst displays higher C3H6 selectivity and comparable C3H8 conversion in comparison to other catalysts in Table 4. Both conversion and selectivity can be completely recovered after simple reoxidation in air.
