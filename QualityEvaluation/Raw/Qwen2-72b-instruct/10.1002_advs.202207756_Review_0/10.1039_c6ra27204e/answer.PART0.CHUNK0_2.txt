1.The growing demand for propylene has led to more attention being paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as the conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes cannot meet the growing demand. Gallium oxide-based catalysts have been recognized as new promising alkane dehydrogenation materials due to their unique capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency. The support effects of catalysts were also considered to be an important topic. Previous studies reported that the Ga2O3 species were dispersed on different supports including TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZSM-5, HZSM-48 and MWW zeolites for alkane dehydrogenation reaction. Many literatures verified that acidity of support evidently influenced the catalytic performance of the supported catalysts. The detailed investigations of different supports on the catalytic performances for Ga2O3-based catalysts are rarely reported, especially with SBA-15 material as support.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长使得人们更加关注丙烷催化脱氢制丙烯，因为传统的烃类蒸汽裂解和催化裂解工艺无法满足日益增长的需求。基于氧化镓的催化剂因其独特的活化烃类的能力和优异的催化效率，被公认为是新的有前景的烷烃脱氢材料。催化剂的载体效应也被认为是一个重要的课题。以前的研究报道，Ga2O3物种分散在TiO2、MgO、Al2O3、ZrO2、ZSM-5、HZSM-48和MWW沸石等不同的载体上，用于烷烃脱氢反应。许多文献证实，载体的酸性对负载催化剂的催化性能有明显影响。对于基于Ga2O3的催化剂，不同载体对其催化性能的详细研究很少被报道，特别是在SBA-15材料作为载体的情况下。
