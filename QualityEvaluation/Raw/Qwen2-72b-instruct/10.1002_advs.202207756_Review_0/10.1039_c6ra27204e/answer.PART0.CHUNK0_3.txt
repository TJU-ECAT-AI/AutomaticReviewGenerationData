1.The growing demand for propylene has led to increased attention on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as the conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes cannot meet the growing demand. Gallium oxide-based catalysts, such as Ga2O3, have been recognized as promising materials for alkane dehydrogenation due to their capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency. The support effects of catalysts, such as acidity and dispersion of Ga species, have been found to significantly influence the catalytic performance. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the effects of supports on the state of gallium species and the causes of changes in catalytic performance.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长促使人们更加关注丙烷催化脱氢制丙烯,因为传统的烃类蒸汽裂解和催化裂化工艺无法满足日益增长的需求。基于氧化镓的催化剂,如Ga2O3,因其能够活化烃类物质和具有优异的催化效率而被公认为是烷烃脱氢的有前途的材料。催化剂的载体效应,如酸性和镓物种的分散,被发现对催化性能有显著影响。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经发展,关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究为这些催化剂的当前知识做出了贡献,包括载体对镓物种状态的影响以及催化性能变化的原因。
