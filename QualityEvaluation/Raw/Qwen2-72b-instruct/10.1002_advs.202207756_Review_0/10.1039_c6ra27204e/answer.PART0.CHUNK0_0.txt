1.The growing demand for propylene has led to more attention being paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as the conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes cannot meet the increasing demand. Gallium oxide-based catalysts, such as Ga2O3, have been recognized as new promising alkane dehydrogenation materials due to their unique capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency. The support effects of catalysts have also been considered an important topic, with acidity of support influencing the catalytic performance of the supported catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has found that the commercial Ga2O3 had exceptionally high activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, and that b-Ga2O3 exhibited the highest dehydrogenation activity among all of the polymorphs due to its abundant surface acid sites. The dispersion of Ga2O3 species varied with different supports, and the effects of supports on the state of gallium species have not been fully understood, especially the causes of these changes.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长使得人们更加关注丙烷催化脱氢制丙烯，因为传统的烃类蒸汽裂解和催化裂解工艺无法满足日益增长的需求。基于氧化镓的催化剂，如Ga2O3，由于其独特的激活烃类物质的能力和优异的催化效率，已被公认为新的有前景的烷烃脱氢材料。催化剂的载体效应也被认为是一个重要的话题，载体的酸性会影响所支持催化剂的催化性能。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究发现，商业Ga2O3对乙烷脱氢制乙烯具有异常高的活性，而β-Ga2O3由于其丰富的表面酸位点，在所有多晶型中表现出最高的脱氢活性。Ga2O3物种的分散度随不同的载体而变化，载体对镓物种状态的影响尚未完全理解，特别是这些变化的原因。
