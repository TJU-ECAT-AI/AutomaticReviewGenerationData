1.The growing demand for propylene has led to increased attention on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes cannot meet the growing demand. Gallium oxide-based catalysts, including Ga/H-ZSM-5, have been recognized as promising materials for alkane dehydrogenation due to their capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has shown that the existence of strong acid sites in the catalyst can lead to more well-dispersed Ga species, which is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity, possessing the maximum well-dispersed gallium species and high dehydrogenation efficiency gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2). The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长促使人们更加关注丙烷催化脱氢制丙烯，因为传统的烃类蒸汽裂解和催化裂解工艺无法满足日益增长的需求。基于氧化镓的催化剂，包括Ga/H-ZSM-5，由于其能够激活烃类物质并具有优异的催化效率，已被公认为是烷烃脱氢的有前途的材料。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究表明，催化剂中强酸位的存在可以导致更多的分散良好的Ga物种，这对丙烷脱氢反应是有利的。5Ga2O3/ZSM-5样品表现出最高的催化活性，具有最大量的分散良好的镓物种和高脱氢效率的镓离子（Gad+阳离子，d < 2）。5Ga2O3/SBA-15催化剂表现出最高的催化稳定性。
