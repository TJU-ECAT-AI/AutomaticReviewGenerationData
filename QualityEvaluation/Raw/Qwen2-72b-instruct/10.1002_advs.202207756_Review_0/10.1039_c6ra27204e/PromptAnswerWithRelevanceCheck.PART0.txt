How has the growing demand for propylene influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and how has the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH evolved, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts?

1.The growing demand for propylene has led to more attention being paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as the conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes cannot meet the increasing demand. Gallium oxide-based catalysts, such as Ga2O3, have been recognized as new promising alkane dehydrogenation materials due to their unique capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency. The support effects of catalysts have also been considered an important topic, with acidity of support influencing the catalytic performance of the supported catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has found that the commercial Ga2O3 had exceptionally high activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, and that b-Ga2O3 exhibited the highest dehydrogenation activity among all of the polymorphs due to its abundant surface acid sites. The dispersion of Ga2O3 species varied with different supports, and the effects of supports on the state of gallium species have not been fully understood, especially the causes of these changes.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长使得人们更加关注丙烷催化脱氢制丙烯，因为传统的烃类蒸汽裂解和催化裂解工艺无法满足日益增长的需求。基于氧化镓的催化剂，如Ga2O3，由于其独特的激活烃类物质的能力和优异的催化效率，已被公认为新的有前景的烷烃脱氢材料。催化剂的载体效应也被认为是一个重要的话题，载体的酸性会影响所支持催化剂的催化性能。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究发现，商业Ga2O3对乙烷脱氢制乙烯具有异常高的活性，而β-Ga2O3由于其丰富的表面酸位点，在所有多晶型中表现出最高的脱氢活性。Ga2O3物种的分散度随不同的载体而变化，载体对镓物种状态的影响尚未完全理解，特别是这些变化的原因。

1.The growing demand for propylene has led to increased attention on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes cannot meet the growing demand. Gallium oxide-based catalysts, including Ga/H-ZSM-5, have been recognized as promising materials for alkane dehydrogenation due to their capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has shown that the existence of strong acid sites in the catalyst can lead to more well-dispersed Ga species, which is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity, possessing the maximum well-dispersed gallium species and high dehydrogenation efficiency gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2). The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长促使人们更加关注丙烷催化脱氢制丙烯，因为传统的烃类蒸汽裂解和催化裂解工艺无法满足日益增长的需求。基于氧化镓的催化剂，包括Ga/H-ZSM-5，由于其能够激活烃类物质并具有优异的催化效率，已被公认为是烷烃脱氢的有前途的材料。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究表明，催化剂中强酸位的存在可以导致更多的分散良好的Ga物种，这对丙烷脱氢反应是有利的。5Ga2O3/ZSM-5样品表现出最高的催化活性，具有最大量的分散良好的镓物种和高脱氢效率的镓离子（Gad+阳离子，d < 2）。5Ga2O3/SBA-15催化剂表现出最高的催化稳定性。

Gallium oxide-based catalysts have been recognized as new promising alkane dehydrogenation materials due to their unique capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency. The support effects of catalysts were also considered to be an important topic. Previous studies reported that the Ga2O3 species were dispersed on different supports including TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZSM-5, HZSM-48 and MWW zeolites for alkane dehydrogenation reaction. Many literatures verified that acidity of support evidently influenced the catalytic performance of the supported catalysts. The detailed investigations of different supports on the catalytic performances for Ga2O3-based catalysts are rarely reported, especially with SBA-15 material as support.
