1.The growing demand for propylene has led to more attention being paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as the conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes cannot meet the increasing demand. Gallium oxide-based catalysts have been recognized as promising materials for alkane dehydrogenation due to their unique capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency. The support effects of catalysts have also been considered important, with acidity of support influencing the catalytic performance of supported catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has found that the commercial Ga2O3 had exceptionally high activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, and that b-Ga2O3 exhibited the highest dehydrogenation activity among all of the polymorphs due to its abundant surface acid sites. The dispersion of Ga2O3 species varied with different supports, and the effects of supports on the state of gallium species have not been fully understood.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长使得人们更加关注丙烷催化脱氢制丙烯，因为传统的烃类蒸汽裂解和催化裂解过程无法满足日益增长的需求。基于氧化镓的催化剂因其独特的激活烃类物质的能力和优异的催化效率，已被公认为烷烃脱氢的有前途的材料。催化剂的载体效应也被认为是重要的，载体的酸性会影响负载型催化剂的催化性能。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究发现，商业Ga2O3在乙烷脱氢制乙烯方面具有异常高的活性，而β-Ga2O3由于其丰富的表面酸位点，在所有多晶型中表现出最高的脱氢活性。Ga2O3物种的分散度随不同载体而变化，载体对镓物种状态的影响尚未完全理解。
