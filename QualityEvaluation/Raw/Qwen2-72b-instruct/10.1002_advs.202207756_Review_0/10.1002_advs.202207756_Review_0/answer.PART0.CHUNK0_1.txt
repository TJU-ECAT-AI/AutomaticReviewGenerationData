[1] "Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene."
[2] "The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030,"
[3] "In addition to SC and FCC, several on-purpose propylene technologies have been developed to increase propylene production including propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propylene."
[4] "The high cost of Pt, as well as human health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incentivized the development of alternative PDH catalysts such as Ga-,[57, 74-79] Zn-,[62, 80, 81] Co-,[70, 71, 82] V-,[66, 83] Fe-,[72, 84-86] Zr-,[87-89] Sn-,[90] and In-based catalysts[91, 92] and nanocarbon materials."
[5] "Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing."
[6] "The dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide (on silica, alumina, and zeolites) was revealed in the patent literature in the 1970s,"
[7] "Since the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is the first step in dehydroaromatization, the ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated."
[8] "Meanwhile, the Ga speciation and the structure of active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in dehydrogenation have remained active topics of discussion since its initial discovery without clear resolution."
[9] "Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, that is, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair."
[10] "We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites."
[11] "The detailed discussion of Ga speciation and PDH mechanism will be included in the next section."

1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to meet the projected increase in demand from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030. The high cost of platinum (Pt) and environmental concerns associated with chromium (Cr) have driven the exploration of alternative PDH catalysts, such as gallium (Ga), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), vanadium (V), iron (Fe), zirconium (Zr), tin (Sn), and indium (In)-based catalysts, as well as nanocarbon materials. Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing, with the dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide on various supports recognized since the 1970s. The ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes has been well appreciated, but the exact Ga speciation and the structure of active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in dehydrogenation have remained a topic of discussion without clear resolution. Different Ga species have been proposed as the active center for PDH, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair. Recent research has shown that the Ga speciation and PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，包括丙烷脱氢(PDH)，以满足从2019年的130百万吨到2030年的191百万吨的预期需求增长。铂(Pt)的高成本和铬(Cr)的环境问题促使人们探索替代的PDH催化剂，如镓(Ga)、锌(Zn)、钴(Co)、钒(V)、铁(Fe)、锆(Zr)、锡(Sn)和铟(In)基催化剂，以及纳米碳材料。Ga基催化剂在烃加工中有着悠久的历史，自20世纪70年代以来，人们就认识到了支撑的镓氧化物在各种支撑上的脱氢芳构化活性。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化轻烃脱氢为烯烃的能力得到了广泛认可，但Ga/H-ZSM-5在脱氢中的Ga物种和活性位点的结构一直是讨论的话题，没有明确的结论。不同的Ga物种被提议为PDH的活性中心，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。最近的研究表明，Ga物种和PDH性能取决于Ga/Al比和沸石的Al分布。
