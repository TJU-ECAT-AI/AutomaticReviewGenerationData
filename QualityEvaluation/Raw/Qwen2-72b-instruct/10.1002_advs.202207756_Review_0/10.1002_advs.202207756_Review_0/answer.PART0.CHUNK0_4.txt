[1] "The high cost of Pt, as well as human health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incentivized the development of alternative PDH catalysts[8] such as Ga-,[57, 74-79] Zn-,[62, 80, 81] Co-,[70, 71, 82] V-,[66, 83] Fe-,[72, 84-86] Zr-,[87-89] Sn-,[90] and In-based catalysts[91, 92] and nanocarbon materials.[93]"
[2] "Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, that is, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair.[76, 77, 99, 100, 108, 109]"
[3] "Early studies suggested that Ga+ is the dominant species upon reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5.[99]"
[4] "However, recent investigations emphasized the importance of the framework Al pair site on the Ga speciation.[76, 77, 100]"
[5] "We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.[54, 55, 110]"
[6] "The detailed discussion of Ga speciation and PDH mechanism will be included in the next section."

1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. The high cost of platinum (Pt) and environmental concerns associated with chromium (Cr) have driven the exploration of alternative PDH catalysts, including gallium (Ga), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), vanadium (V), iron (Fe), zirconium (Zr), tin (Sn), and indium (In)-based catalysts, as well as nanocarbon materials. Among these, Ga-based catalysts have been extensively studied, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species in PDH. Early studies suggested that Ga+ is the dominant species upon reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5, but recent investigations have emphasized the importance of the framework Al pair site on the Ga speciation. The Ga speciation and PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites. The detailed discussion of Ga speciation and PDH mechanism is a subject of ongoing research.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），作为蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化等传统方法的替代。铂（Pt）的高成本和与铬（Cr）相关的环境问题促使人们探索替代的PDH催化剂，包括镓（Ga）、锌（Zn）、钴（Co）、钒（V）、铁（Fe）、锆（Zr）、锡（Sn）和铟（In）基催化剂，以及纳米碳材料。其中，Ga基催化剂得到了广泛研究，关于PDH中活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。早期研究表明，Ga+在Ga/H-ZSM-5还原后是主要物种，但最近的研究强调了框架Al对位在Ga物种上的重要性。Ga物种和PDH性能取决于Ga/Al比和沸石中Al的分布。Ga物种和PDH机制的详细讨论是正在进行的研究主题。
