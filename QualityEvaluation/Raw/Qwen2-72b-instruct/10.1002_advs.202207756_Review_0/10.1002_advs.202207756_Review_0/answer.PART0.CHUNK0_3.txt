1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the high cost of platinum (Pt) and health and environmental concerns associated with chromium (Cr). This has incentivized the exploration of alternative PDH catalysts, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-, Fe-, Zr-, Sn-, and In-based catalysts, as well as nanocarbon materials. Among these, single-site catalysts supported on silica or zeolites, such as Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, and Fe2+, have shown particular promise. Ga-based catalysts, despite having a lower turnover frequency (TOF) than Pt-based catalysts, are a promising alternative due to their significantly lower cost.
2.Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing, with gallium oxide being investigated as a cracking catalyst as early as the 1960s. The dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide on silica, alumina, and zeolites was revealed in the patent literature in the 1970s, leading to the development of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst used in the CYCLAR process for converting propane and butane to aromatics.

The Ga speciation and PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长促使人们开发新的生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），因为铂（Pt）成本高昂，而铬（Cr）则存在健康和环境问题。这促使人们探索替代的PDH催化剂，包括镓（Ga）、锌（Zn）、钴（Co）、钒（V）、铁（Fe）、锆（Zr）、锡（Sn）和铟（In）基催化剂，以及纳米碳材料。在这些催化剂中，特别是支持在二氧化硅或沸石上的单位点催化剂，如Ga+、Zn2+、Co2+和Fe2+，显示出特别的前景。尽管镓基催化剂的周转频率（TOF）低于铂基催化剂，但由于其成本显著较低，因此仍是一种有前景的替代方案。
2.镓基催化剂在烃类加工中有着悠久的历史，早在20世纪60年代，氧化镓就被研究作为裂化催化剂。20世纪70年代的专利文献揭示了支持在二氧化硅、氧化铝和沸石上的氧化镓的脱氢芳构化活性，这导致了用于将丙烷和丁烷转化为芳烃的CYCLAR工艺中使用的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的开发。由于烃类的脱氢是脱氢芳构化的第一步，Ga/H-ZSM-5将轻烷烃脱氢为烯烃的能力得到了广泛认可。然而，自其最初发现以来，Ga/H-ZSM-5在脱氢中的Ga物种和活性位点的结构一直是讨论的活跃话题，没有明确的结论。不同的Ga物种被提议作为PDH的活性中心，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。早期研究表明，Ga+是在还原Ga/H-ZSM-5后的主要物种，但最近的研究强调了框架Al对位点在Ga物种化中的重要性。Ga物种化和PDH性能取决于沸石的Ga/Al比和Al分布。
