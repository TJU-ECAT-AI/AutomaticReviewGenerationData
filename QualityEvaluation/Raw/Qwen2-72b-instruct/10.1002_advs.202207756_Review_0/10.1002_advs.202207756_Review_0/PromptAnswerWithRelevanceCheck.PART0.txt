1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to meet the projected shortfall in supply. Propylene is a key chemical used in the production of various materials, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene. The demand for propylene is expected to increase significantly, from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030. To address this demand, on-purpose propylene technologies, including PDH, have been developed. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing, with the dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide being recognized in the 1970s. Since dehydrogenation is the first step in dehydroaromatization, the ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，包括丙烷脱氢（PDH），以弥补预计的供应缺口。丙烯是生产各种材料的关键化学品，如聚丙烯、丙烯腈、环氧丙烷和莰烯。预计丙烯需求将大幅增加，从2019年的130百万吨增加到2030年的191百万吨。为了满足这一需求，开发了包括PDH在内的目的性丙烯技术。对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随着时间的推移而发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。基于镓的催化剂在烃加工中有着悠久的历史，早在20世纪70年代，就认识到了支撑镓氧化物的脱氢芳构化活性。由于脱氢是脱氢芳构化的第一步，Ga/H-ZSM-5将轻烷烃脱氢为烯烃的能力得到了充分的赞赏。然而，自其首次发现以来，Ga/H-ZSM-5在脱氢中的Ga物种和活性位点的结构一直是讨论的活跃话题，没有明确的结论。提出了不同的Ga物种作为PDH的活性中心，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。最近的研究结合了原位透射傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱、脉冲滴定研究和PDH动力学，证明Ga物种和它们的PDH性能取决于Ga/Al比率和沸石的Al分布。

不断增长的丙烯需求推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这是由于铂（Pt）的高成本和与铬（Cr）相关的健康和环境问题。这促使人们探索替代的PDH催化剂，包括镓（Ga）、锌（Zn）、钴（Co）、钒（V）、铁（Fe）、锆（Zr）、锡（Sn）和铟（In）基催化剂，以及纳米碳材料。其中，特别是Ga+、Zn2+、Co2+和Fe2+等单位点催化剂，支持在二氧化硅或沸石上，显示出前景。Ga基催化剂在烃类加工中有着悠久的历史，自20世纪60年代以来，镓氧化物就被研究作为裂化催化剂。20世纪70年代，人们认识到在二氧化硅、氧化铝和沸石等载体上支持的镓氧化物的脱氢芳构化活性，这导致了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的开发，用于将丙烷和丁烷转化为芳烃的CYCLAR工艺。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化轻烷烃脱氢为烯烃的能力得到了广泛认可，因为脱氢是脱氢芳构化的第一步。然而，自其最初发现以来，Ga/H-ZSM-5在脱氢中的Ga物种和活性位点的结构一直是持续讨论的话题，没有明确的结论。不同的Ga物种被提议为PDH的活性中心，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。早期研究表明，Ga+是Ga/H-ZSM-5还原后的主要物种，但最近的研究强调了框架Al对位点对Ga物种的重要性。Ga物种和PDH性能取决于沸石的Ga/Al比和Al分布。

1.丙烯需求的不断增长促使人们开发新的生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），因为铂（Pt）成本高昂，而铬（Cr）则存在健康和环境问题。这促使人们探索替代的PDH催化剂，包括镓（Ga）、锌（Zn）、钴（Co）、钒（V）、铁（Fe）、锆（Zr）、锡（Sn）和铟（In）基催化剂，以及纳米碳材料。在这些催化剂中，特别是支持在二氧化硅或沸石上的单位点催化剂，如Ga+、Zn2+、Co2+和Fe2+，显示出特别的前景。尽管镓基催化剂的周转频率（TOF）低于铂基催化剂，但由于其成本显著较低，因此仍是一种有前景的替代方案。
2.镓基催化剂在烃类加工中有着悠久的历史，早在20世纪60年代，氧化镓就被研究作为裂化催化剂。20世纪70年代的专利文献揭示了支持在二氧化硅、氧化铝和沸石上的氧化镓的脱氢芳构化活性，这导致了用于将丙烷和丁烷转化为芳烃的CYCLAR工艺中使用的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的开发。由于烃类的脱氢是脱氢芳构化的第一步，Ga/H-ZSM-5将轻烷烃脱氢为烯烃的能力得到了广泛认可。然而，自其最初发现以来，Ga/H-ZSM-5在脱氢中的Ga物种和活性位点的结构一直是讨论的活跃话题，没有明确的结论。不同的Ga物种被提议作为PDH的活性中心，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。早期研究表明，Ga+是在还原Ga/H-ZSM-5后的主要物种，但最近的研究强调了框架Al对位点在Ga物种化中的重要性。Ga物种化和PDH性能取决于沸石的Ga/Al比和Al分布。
