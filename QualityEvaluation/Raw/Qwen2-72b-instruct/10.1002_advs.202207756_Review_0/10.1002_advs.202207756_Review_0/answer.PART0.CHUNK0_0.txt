[1] "Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene."

1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to meet the projected shortfall in supply. Propylene is a key chemical used in the production of various materials, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene. The demand for propylene is expected to increase significantly, from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030. To address this demand, on-purpose propylene technologies, including PDH, have been developed. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing, with the dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide being recognized in the 1970s. Since dehydrogenation is the first step in dehydroaromatization, the ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated. However, the Ga speciation and the structure of active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in dehydrogenation have remained active topics of discussion since its initial discovery without clear resolution. Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair. Recent research has combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，包括丙烷脱氢（PDH），以弥补预计的供应缺口。丙烯是生产各种材料的关键化学品，如聚丙烯、丙烯腈、环氧丙烷和莰烯。预计丙烯需求将大幅增加，从2019年的130百万吨增加到2030年的191百万吨。为了满足这一需求，开发了包括PDH在内的目的性丙烯技术。对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随着时间的推移而发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。基于镓的催化剂在烃加工中有着悠久的历史，早在20世纪70年代，就认识到了支撑镓氧化物的脱氢芳构化活性。由于脱氢是脱氢芳构化的第一步，Ga/H-ZSM-5将轻烷烃脱氢为烯烃的能力得到了充分的赞赏。然而，自其首次发现以来，Ga/H-ZSM-5在脱氢中的Ga物种和活性位点的结构一直是讨论的活跃话题，没有明确的结论。提出了不同的Ga物种作为PDH的活性中心，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。最近的研究结合了原位透射傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱、脉冲滴定研究和PDH动力学，证明Ga物种和它们的PDH性能取决于Ga/Al比率和沸石的Al分布。
