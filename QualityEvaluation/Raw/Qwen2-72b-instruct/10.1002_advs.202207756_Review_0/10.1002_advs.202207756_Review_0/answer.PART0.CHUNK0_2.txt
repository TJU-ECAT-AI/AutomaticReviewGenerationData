[1] "The high cost of Pt, as well as human health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incentivized the development of alternative PDH catalysts[8] such as Ga-,[57, 74-79] Zn-,[62, 80, 81] Co-,[70, 71, 82] V-,[66, 83] Fe-,[72, 84-86] Zr-,[87-89] Sn-,[90] and In-based catalysts[91, 92] and nanocarbon materials.[93]"
[2] "Among these, single-site (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, Fe2+, etc.) supported on silica or zeolites[94-96] have shown particular promise."
[3] "Although it is still more than ten times lower than that of Pt-based catalysts, the marked difference in the cost of the two metals makes the Ga-based catalyst a promising alternative."

[5] "Gallium oxide was investigated as a cracking catalyst as early as the 1960s.[103]"
[6] "The dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide (on silica, alumina, and zeolites) was revealed in the patent literature in the 1970s,[104] which led to the development of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst used in the CYCLAR process for converting propane and butane to aromatics.[105-107]"
[7] "Since the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is the first step in dehydroaromatization, the ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated."

[12] "We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.[54, 55, 110]"

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the high cost of platinum (Pt) and health and environmental concerns associated with chromium (Cr). This has incentivized the exploration of alternative PDH catalysts, including gallium (Ga), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), vanadium (V), iron (Fe), zirconium (Zr), tin (Sn), and indium (In)-based catalysts, as well as nanocarbon materials. Among these, single-site catalysts supported on silica or zeolites, such as Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, and Fe2+, have shown promise. Ga-based catalysts, in particular, have a long history in hydrocarbon processing, with gallium oxide being investigated as a cracking catalyst since the 1960s. The dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide on various supports, including zeolites, was recognized in the 1970s, leading to the development of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst used in the CYCLAR process for converting propane and butane to aromatics. The ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated, as dehydrogenation is the first step in dehydroaromatization. However, the Ga speciation and the structure of active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in dehydrogenation have been topics of ongoing discussion since its initial discovery, without clear resolution. Different Ga species have been proposed as the active center for PDH, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair. Early studies suggested that Ga+ is the dominant species upon reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5, but recent investigations have emphasized the importance of the framework Al pair site on the Ga speciation. The Ga speciation and PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.

不断增长的丙烯需求推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这是由于铂（Pt）的高成本和与铬（Cr）相关的健康和环境问题。这促使人们探索替代的PDH催化剂，包括镓（Ga）、锌（Zn）、钴（Co）、钒（V）、铁（Fe）、锆（Zr）、锡（Sn）和铟（In）基催化剂，以及纳米碳材料。其中，特别是Ga+、Zn2+、Co2+和Fe2+等单位点催化剂，支持在二氧化硅或沸石上，显示出前景。Ga基催化剂在烃类加工中有着悠久的历史，自20世纪60年代以来，镓氧化物就被研究作为裂化催化剂。20世纪70年代，人们认识到在二氧化硅、氧化铝和沸石等载体上支持的镓氧化物的脱氢芳构化活性，这导致了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的开发，用于将丙烷和丁烷转化为芳烃的CYCLAR工艺。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化轻烷烃脱氢为烯烃的能力得到了广泛认可，因为脱氢是脱氢芳构化的第一步。然而，自其最初发现以来，Ga/H-ZSM-5在脱氢中的Ga物种和活性位点的结构一直是持续讨论的话题，没有明确的结论。不同的Ga物种被提议为PDH的活性中心，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。早期研究表明，Ga+是Ga/H-ZSM-5还原后的主要物种，但最近的研究强调了框架Al对位点对Ga物种的重要性。Ga物种和PDH性能取决于沸石的Ga/Al比和Al分布。
