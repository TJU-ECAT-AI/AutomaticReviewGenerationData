Received January 21, 1998; revised June 3, 1998; accepted June 4, 1998 Exchanged Zn cations increase propane conversion turnover rates, hydrogen formation rates, and selectivity to aromatics on H-ZSM5. In situ Zn K-edge X-ray absorption studies show that aqueous ion exchange with H-ZSM5 (Si/Al = 14.5) leads to isolated Zn2+ cations with tetrahedral symmetry. These Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and form directly from nitrate solutions during ion exchange. X-ray absorption and temperature-programmed reduction studies show that Zn2+ cations in Zn/H-ZSM5 do not reduce to zero-valent species during propane reactions at 773 K. Extrazeolitic ZnO crystals form on samples pre- pared by impregnation techniques. In contrast to exchanged Zn2+ cations, these bulk ZnO crystals reduce to Zn metal and elute from the catalyst bed as Zn vapor under typical propane aromatiza- tion conditions. Condensation reactions of (Zn2+OH)+ species with acidic OH groups appear to lead to the formation of the active Zn2+ cations interacting with two Al sites (OZn2+O). This active Zn species is supported by acid site density measurements from NH3 titration and isotopic titration of remaining Brnsted acid sites with deuterium in Zn/H-ZSM5. c 1998 Academic Press
1. INTRODUCTION
H-ZSM5 catalyzes the conversion of light alkanes to aro- matics with low selectivity because of cracking side reac- tions (17). The introduction of Zn species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions (817). These metal cations increase propane conversion rates and the selectivity to unsaturated products by increas- ing the rate of propane and propene dehydrogenation and by avoiding the preferential removal of hydrogen by trans- fer to hydrocarbon fragments to form light alkanes.
Many groups have examined the catalytic role of these Zn species during light alkane aromatization; the struc- ture and location of these Zn cations in Zn/H-ZSM5, how- ever, were not explored until recently. Structural studies of Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM5 have led to conflicting reports.

(16) showed that CO reacts on Zn/H-ZSM5 (<2 wt% Zn, Si/Al = 23) to produce equimolar amounts of CO2 and H2,suggesting that (ZnOH)+ is present.This study addresses the synthesis of Zn cation-ex- changed H-ZSM5 zeolite and the detailed characterization of the structure and location of the Zn species. The nature of Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM5 was examined by combining site titration and kinetic and isotopic methods with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Zn K-edge.
2. EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
2.1. Catalyst Preparation
Na+ ions in Na-ZSM5 (Zeochem) were replaced with
NH+
4 by contacting the Na-ZSM5 with a solution of 0.67 M NH4NO3 (Fisher, Certified ACS, >98.0%) at 353 K for 10 h. Solids were separated from the solution by filtering.
The exchange procedure was repeated three times using fresh NH4NO3 solutions to ensure complete exchange of Na cations. The residual Na content was less than 0.07 wt% by atomic absorption analysis. Catalyst samples were then dried in flowing air at 383 K for 20 h and treated in flowing dry air at 773 K for 20 h to decompose NH+ 4 to H+ and to form the acidic form of the zeolite (H-ZSM5). Three Zn/H- ZSM5 catalysts were prepared by ion exchange at 343 K for 1, 5.5, or 9 h using H-ZSM5 and a solution of Zn(NO3)2 (0.0050 M, Aldrich, >98.0%). The exchanged Zn/H-ZSM5 samples were then dried in flowing air at 383 K for 20 h and treated in flowing dry air at 773 K for 20 h. Zn/H-ZSM5 was also prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using a Zn(NO3)2 solution (0.0050 M, Aldrich, >98.0%). This im- pregnated Zn/H-ZSM5 sample was dried in flowing air at 383 K for 20 h and treated in flowing dry air at 773 K for 20 h.
2.2. Elemental Analysis
The elemental composition of all samples was ob- tained by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Galbraith 0021-9517/98 $25.00 Copyright c 1998 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved. 192
ACTIVE Zn SPECIES IN Zn/H-ZSM5 CATALYSTS 193 Laboratories). The atomic Si/Al ratio in all samples was
14.5  0.9. The Zn contents of the ion-exchanged sam-
ples were 0.62, 1.07, and 1.30 wt%, which correspond to Zn/Al atomic ratios of 0.10, 0.16, and 0.19 respectively.
The Zn content of the impregnated sample was 2.80 wt% (Zn/Al = 0.40).
2.3. In Situ Zinc K-Edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
The structure and chemical state of Zn species in Zn/H- ZSM5 samples were determined by in situ X-ray absorp- tion at the Zn K-edge, using beamline 4-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Research Laboratory (SSRL). This beamline uses an unfocused Si (220) double-crystal, parallel geome- try, upward reflecting monochromator. The intensity of the incident and transmitted X-rays was recorded using three Ar-purged ionization chambers. An accurate energy cali- bration of the X-ray spectra was achieved by measuring simultaneously data from Zn/H-ZSM5 and from a refer- ence sample (ZnO) located between the second and third ionization chambers.
X-ray absorption measurements were conducted using an in situ cell similar to that described by Clausen et al. (19). The cell consists of a quartz capillary (0.9-mm diame- ter, 0.1-mm wall thickness, 10-cm length) mounted horizon- tally into a stainless-steel base using compression fittings with graphite ferrules. Samples with 45- to 60-mesh parti- cle sizes formed a dense bed through which gas flows with negligible pressure drop. Heat was supplied by four heat cartridges mounted into a copper block with ten fins and a slit for the sample and the X-ray beam. Temperature uni- formity was ensured by measuring the temperature profile along the capillary under conditions identical to those of the in situ experiments.
Gases were introduced into the X-ray absorption cell using a portable gas handling unit and He, H2, and propane lecture bottles. Helium (Matheson, chemical pu- rity >99.995%) and propane (Matheson, chemical purity >99.5%) were purified using a water trap (Oxyclear, 5A) followedbyanoxygenindicatingtrap(Matheson,Oxisorb),both held at room temperature. Hydrogen (Matheson,chemical purity >99.99%) was purified by passing through a catalytic purifier (Matheson) and then through a water re- moval trap (Oxyclear, 5A). After purification, gas flow rates were controlled by an electronic mass flow meter (Porter Instrument Co.), and then further purified by an additional oxygen indicating trap (Matheson, Oxisorb) before enter- ing the sample cell.
Zn K-edge spectra were analyzed by setting the edge energy at the first inflection point in the edge region. The pre-edge region of the spectrum was then fitted by a straight line. A polynomial spline with seven nodes was used to des- cribe the high-energy side of the edge (1E = 101000 eV).
Both the pre-edge and post-edge functions were extrapo- lated to the absorption edge energy and the entire spectrum was normalized by the height of the resulting absorbance step at the edge. The near-edge (XANES) and extended fine-structure (EXAFS) spectra were obtained by subtract- ing the pre-edge and post-edge fitting functions from the raw absorption data.
2.4. Temperature-Programmed Reduction
Temperature-programmed reduction experiments were carried out using a Quantasorb unit (Quantachrome) mod- ified with a programmable furnace. Samples were held within a quartz cell containing a thermowell in direct con- tact with the sample bed. The samples were flushed with N2 (Matheson, chemical purity >99.998%, 50 cm3/min) at room temperature for 0.5 h before reduction. The reduction was conducted by flowing a H2/Ar mixture (21.0%, Math- eson, certified standard, 80 cm3/min) through the samples with flow rates measured by an electronic mass flowmeter (Porter Instrument Co.). The sample exit stream was passed through a molecular sieve trap (Aldrich Chemicals, 13X) to remove water before thermal conductivity measurements.
The inlet and outlet streams were passed through a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The temperature and TCD signals were recorded using Labview software. The temper- ature was increased at 10 K/min from room temperature to 1073 K. The TCD output was calibrated using a WO3 stan- dard (Aldrich, 99.99%, treated in O2 for 3 h at 973 K). H2 consumption rates were normalized by the amount of Zn present and plotted versus the measured temperature.
2.5. Measurement of Ammonia Irreversibly
Adsorbed at 383 K Ammonia titration experiments were carried out using a temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) unit consisting of a gas manifold unit connected to a quartz capillary cell followed by an on-line mass spectrometer.
Samples were charged into the capillary cell, purged with helium (Matheson, >99.999%, 100 cm3/min) at 773 K for 1 h, and cooled to 383 K. A mixture of NH3/He (0.93% NH3, Matheson, certified standard, 80 cm3/min) was passed through the sample for 0.4 h or until NH3 levels reached a constant value in the effluent stream. Once titrations were complete, He flow (100 cm3/min) for about 3 h was used to remove physisorbed NH3. Temperature-programmed des- orption is carried out by increasing the temperature from 383 to 1000 K at 15 K/min. The NH3 concentration in the effluent gas was measured continuously using a mass spec- trometer (LeyboldInficon, Model THP TS200).
2.6. Isotopic Titration of Brnsted
Acid Sites with Deuterium Isotopic titration experiments were also carried out us- ing the TPSR unit. Samples were charged into a capillary quartz cell, heated to 773 K in a flowing H2/Ar mixture
194
BISCARDI, MEITZNER, AND IGLESIA
(5% H2, Matheson, certified standard, 100 cm3/min), held isothermal for 2 h, and then cooled to 300 K. The flow was then switched to a D2/Ar mixture (5% D2, Matheson, cer- tified standard, 100 cm3/min) and the temperature was in- creased from 300 to 1073 K at 15 K/min. The H2, HD, and D2 concentrations in the effluent were measured by mass spectrometry.
2.7. Catalytic Reaction Studies
Kinetic studies on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts were performed in a gradientless recirculating reactor op- erated in the batch mode. This reactor system was used to measure the chemical composition of reaction products as a function of reaction time and reactant conversion.
The reaction mixture was circulated using a graphite gear micropump (250 cm3 min1, Cole-Parmer) that allowed differential reactor operation (<2% reactant conversion per pass).The chemical composition of reaction mixtures was ob- tained using capillary column gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (HewlettPackard 5890, HP-1 methyl-silicone column, 50 m, 0.32-mm diameter, 1.05-m film thickness). Propane (Matheson, chemical purity >99.5%) was used without further purification. Helium (Linde, chemical purity >99.995%) was purified by passage through oxygen removal (Matheson, Oxisorb) and molecu- lar sieve (13X and 5A) traps at room temperature. Helium was used as an inert diluent in most of the catalytic studies.Batch reactor data are shown as product site yields (molecules of product per Al site) or reactant turnovers (molecules of C3H8 converted per Al site) as a function of contact time. The slope of these plots gives the propane conversion turnover rate or product site-time yield. Hy- drocarbon selectivities are reported on a carbon basis as the percentage of the converted propane that appears as each reaction product. Hydrogen selectivities are reported as the percentage of the hydrogen atoms in the converted propane that appears within a given hydrocarbon product or as H2.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Effect of Zn Metal Cations on Propane
Conversion Rate and Selectivity Propane conversion turnover rates are greater on Zn/ H-ZSM5 than on H-ZSM5 (Fig. 1). When Zn cations are introduced into H-ZSM5 channels, dehydrogenated prod- ucts are produced with higher selectivity and the rate of formation of aromatics increases markedly (Table 1).
The selectivity to C6+ aromatics at similar conversions (7.68.3%) increases from 2.4% to 35.4% when Zn (1.30 wt%) is ion-exchanged into H-ZSM5. Aromatic site- time yields increase monotonically with increasing Zn con- tent (01.30 wt%) (Fig. 2).
FIG. 1.
Propane turnovers versus contact time during propane con- version on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 (773 K, 26.6 kPa C3H8, 74.7 kPa He).
The presence of Zn species leads to an increase in the rate of H2 formation. The hydrogen (H2) selectivity increases with increasing Zn content (Fig. 3). On H-ZSM5, H2 se- lectivity remains low (46%) at all conversions, but the addition of Zn (1.30 wt%) increases hydrogen selectivity (3031%) (Table 1). On all Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts, hydro- gen selectivity is independent of propane conversion.
Kinetic studies indicate that propane conversion to aromatics requires sequential dehydrogenation steps and acid-catalyzed reactions of propene intermediates (6,7).
Propane dehydrogenation reactions proceed via elemen- tary steps that involve CH bond activation and disposal of hydrogen atoms formed in these reactions. Hydrogen removal can occur via bimolecular or surface-mediated

The presence of ex- changed Zn cations increases the rate of these hydrogen re- moval steps by introducing portholes for recombinative desorption of H atoms as H2 (14). Exchanged Zn cations increase the rates of propane conversion to aromatics, of recombinative hydrogen desorption, and of incorporation of D atoms from D2 into reaction products (14).
3.2. X-ray Absorption Zn K-Edge Near-Edge Spectra
Near-edge X-ray absorption spectra at the Zn K-edge for fresh Zn/H-ZSM5 at room temperature show a sharp increase in absorbance (edge energy) at 9664 eV, caused by the excitation of Zn 1s electrons. The edge energy depends

Standard Zn compounds (Zn foil and ZnO) were used to determine the oxidation state of the Zn in Zn/H-ZSM5. The Zn K-edge energy of Zn foil (Zn0) was measured at 9659 eV and that for ZnO (Zn2+) at 9664 eV (Table 2). Near-edge spectra of fresh Zn/H-ZSM5 show that Zn species have absorption energies similar to that in ZnO, suggesting that they consist of Zn2+ cations.The normalized near-edge spectrum (30 to 60 eV from the absorption edge) of a fresh 1.07% Zn/H-ZSM5 sam- ple is shown in Fig. 4. The edge energy is not affected by mild thermal treatment (323 K in He, H2, or C3H8), but the

near-edge spectrum changes. After mild thermal treat- ments, the in situ Zn/H-ZSM5 spectrum splits into two peaks (Fig. 4). These two peaks remain after cooling the Zn/H-ZSM5 sample to room temperature in flowing gas.
A pulse of water introduced into the carrier gas restores the spectrum to that of fresh samples at room tempera- ture. Thus, these hydrationdehydration processes are re- versibleandappeartoreflectweakadsorptionofwateronto Zn species. The radial distribution function also shows an increased number of oxygen nearest neighbors consistent with water coordinated to Zn cations.
More severe thermal treatments (323773 K) in He, H2,or C3H8 lead to lower-intensity features in the near-edge region of dehydrated samples (Fig. 5), which reach a con- stant intensity at temperatures above 573 K. The intensity of these edge features decreases with temperature, but the Zn K-edge energy remains constant (9664 eV) during heat- ing in He, H2, or C3H8 (Fig. 5). Therefore, Zn species in Zn/ H-ZSM5 remain as Zn2+ and do not reduce to Zn0 dur- ing treatments in He or H2, or during catalytic reactions of
C3H8.
Zn/H-ZSM5 near-edge spectra do not resemble any of the available Zn standards (Fig. 6). After dehydration, edge features in Zn/H-ZSM5 begin to resemble Zn2+ species in ZnO/Al2O3 and ZnO/SiO2 samples.
3.3. X-ray Absorption Extended Fine Structure (EXAFS)
The extended fine structure in X-ray absorption spec- tra (EXAFS) reflects the scattering of ejected electrons by atoms near the absorber (21). The fine-structure region (>50 eV above the edge) contains information on the chem- ical identity and location (bond distances) of atoms near the

Thus, it provides local structural information that complements the coordination symmetry features de- tected in the near-edge region.
EXAFS measurements at the Zn K-edge were analyzed using ZnO and Zn foil as standards to detect the presence of ZnO, ZnOZn, and ZnZn species. Room tempera- ture spectra of fresh Zn/H-ZSM5, ZnO, and Zn foil result in the radial distribution functions shown in Fig. 7. The peak at 1.5 A in ZnO reflects the presence of oxygen nearest neighbors. Zn atoms in bulk ZnO are present in tetrahedral structures with ZnO distances of 1.95 A (23). Peaks in the EXAFS radial distributions appear at a distance shorter than true interatomic distances because the distance mea- sured is the actual distance between electron clouds, which is smaller than the distance between nuclei. Thus, the 1.5-
A peak in the radial distribution function corresponds to a true ZnO bond length of 1.95
A. A peak at 1.6
A, similar to that in ZnO, is also present in the radial distribution func- tion of fresh Zn/H-ZSM5, indicating the presence of ZnO nearest neighbors. This peak in the Zn/H-ZSM5 spectrum,however,issignificantlyhigherinmagnitudethaninthezinc oxide spectrum. The number of oxygen nearest neighbors giving rise to this peak was calculated by fitting the back Fourier transforms of the Zn/H-ZSM5 spectrum in Fig. 7.
Standard data for the fit were generated by FEFF software (Version 6.01). The fit indicates that each Zn atom in fresh Zn/H-ZSM5 has 5.4 oxygen nearest neighbors at a bond distance of 2.09

1.07% Zn/H-ZSM5 (ion-exchange), 2.80% Zn/H-ZSM5 (impregnation),

Zn/H-ZSM5 fine-structure spectra do not contain a peak at 2.3 A, which corresponds to ZnZn nearest neighbors in Zn foil, or a peak at 3.0 A corresponding to ZnZn next nearest neighbors in ZnO (Fig. 7). This suggests that the Zn in Zn/H-ZSM5 is not present as ZnO crystallites, but as isolated Zn species with no Zn next-nearest neighbors.
They are most likely at cation exchange positions inside the zeolite channels. Zeolitic Al and Si atoms do not appear as Zn neighbors in the fine structure because of unconstrained vibrations at surface cation exchange sites. EXAFS signals are sensitive to the degree of order around individual in- teratomic distances; atoms with broad distributions around their mean distance do not contribute strongly to the scat- tering spectrum (21,22).
Zn/H-ZSM5 samples synthesized by impregnation, in- stead of ion exchange, contain both exchanged Zn cations and external ZnO crystallites, which can be detected as ZnZn next nearest neighbors in the radial distribution function. Unlike ion-exchanged samples, the radial distri- bution function of Zn/H-ZSM5 prepared by impregnation

Zn/H-ZSM5 shows a peak at 3 A, similar to that for Zn next nearest neighbors in bulk ZnO (Fig. 7). Catalytic studies during propane conversion showed that Zn/H-ZSM5 prepared from ion-exchange methods are more active than those from impregnation techniques, but give identical product distributions at similar propane conversion levels (Table 3).
These X-ray absorption data suggest that impregnation techniques lead to the formation of ZnO crystallites, which have been shown to be inactive for butane conversion (24) and which reduce to Zn metal and vaporize during propane reactions at 973 K.
A comparison of the radial distribution functions of fresh Zn/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 treated in He at 773 K shows that the peak at 1.6 A decreases in intensity after this treat- ment. The number of Zn nearest neighbors decreases from
5.4 to the value of 4.1 expected for tetrahedral Zn centers
also found in ZnO (Fig. 8). This suggests that the fresh Zn/ H-ZSM5 sample has water coordinated to the Zn species

3.4. Temperature-Programmed Reduction
Bulk oxide crystallites, when present, can also be detec- ted by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). TPR studies on bulk ZnO show that ZnO crystals begin to re- duce to Zn metal and sublime around 850 K in flowing hydrogen. In contrast, Zn2+ cations in ion-exchanged Zn/ H-ZSM5 samples (0.62 and 1.07 wt%) do not reduce even at 1150 K (Fig. 9). TPR studies on 1.30% Zn/H-ZSM5 show
FIG. 10.
Temperature-programmed reduction of ZnO and 2.80% Zn/H-ZSM5 (impregnated) (80 cm3/min, 20% H2/Ar, 10 K/min). a slight reduction, suggesting that the zeolite contains a small amount of extracrystalline ZnO. The extent of reduc- tion corresponds to less than 1% of the Zn cations in this sample.
In agreement with the X-ray absorption results described previously, TPR studies also show that impregnation tech- niques lead to the formation of extracrystalline ZnO. These extracrystalline ZnO species reduce at about 850 K, as also observed for bulk ZnO (Fig. 10). Bulk ZnO is completely reduced to Zn metal (H2/Zn ratio of 0.99), while impreg- nated Zn/H-ZSM5 leads to a 0.46 H2/Zn ratio, because about 54% of the Zn is present at cation exchange sites and not reducible, and 46% is present as reducible ZnO crystallites. In contrast with exchanged Zn species, these bulk ZnO crystals reduce and elute from the bed as Zn va- por in reducing environments, such as those present during propane reactions on Zn/H-ZSM5. It appears that properly prepared Zn/H-ZSM5 samples do not lose Zn by vaporiza- tion during catalysis.
3.5. Transformation of Zn into Active Zn Species
during High-Temperature Treatment Structural zeolitic studies of several M2+ cations (i.e., Cu, Mg) prepared by ion exchange from aqueous solution sug- gest that cationic species are initially present in zeolites as (M2+OH)+ (25). Berndt et al. (16) have shown that these (M2+OH)+ are also present in 1.5% Zn/H-ZSM5 (Si/Al = 23) samples. They detected equimolar amounts of CO2 and H2 when samples were treated in CO at high tem- peratures(>673K)andsuggestedthatthisequimolardistri- bution results from CO interacting with a (ZnOH)+ species and a neighboring H+.
However, our X-ray absorption data show that (ZnOH)+ species are not thermally stable and that they undergo de- hydration, by coupling of (ZnOH)+ species with acidic OH groups to form water and a bridging Zn+2 cation,

At high Zn+2 concentrations, dehydration may also occur by cou- pling of two (ZnOH)+ species to form water and two Zn+2 cationsbridgedbyoxygen(Scheme2).TheresultsofBerndt et al. (16) can then be explained by coupling of (ZnOH)+ with OH groups at high temperatures. In the presence of CO, the desorbed water undergoes a watergas shift reac- tion with CO to form the observed CO2 and H2 products.
3.6. Titration of Brnsted and Lewis
Acid Sites with Ammonia The density of Brnsted acid sites on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H- ZSM5 sample was measured by temperature-programmed desorption of preadsorbed ammonia. After ruling out the presence of ZnO crystallites in Zn/H-ZSM5 using X-ray ab- sorption and TPR methods and suggesting that (ZnOH)+ decompose by dehydration at high temperatures, the most probableactiveZn2+structuresareshowninScheme3.One method to distinguish these two Zn species in propane con- version catalysts is to titrate residual H+ species in Zn/H- ZSM5 using a basic molecule. However, when Zn replaces protons in H-ZSM5, it forms a Lewis acid site (Zn2+ cation) and ammonia then adsorbs on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites. If Zn species I (Scheme 3) are present, the intro- duction of two Zn2+ would replace two H+, resulting in one Zn2+ per Al site; this situation would lead to an NH3/Al up- take similar to that on H-ZSM5. In contrast, if Zn species II

(Scheme 3) are present, the introduction of one Zn2+ re- places two H+, resulting in one Zn2+ per two Al sites and an NH3/Al uptake that is less than the total amount of ammo- nia adsorbed on H-ZSM5 which depends on the number of Zn2+ cations in the sample.
On H-ZSM5, 0.96 NH3 molecule was adsorbed per Al site, consistent with the expected presence of one H+ per Al site (Table 4). Ammonia adsorption measurements indicate that the introduction of Zn species into ZSM5 channels for three Zn/H-ZSM5 samples with different Zn weight load- ings (0.62, 1.07, and 1.30%) all lead to a decrease in the NH3 uptake (compared with H-ZSM5). The ratio of NH3 molecules adsorbed to Al sites decreases with increasing Zn loading (Table 4). NH3 uptakes agree with those expected from the presence of species II (H-ZSM5 uptakeZn/Al).
These NH3 data show that active Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM5 consist of Zn2+ cations interacting with two Al sites. This structure is similar to those reported by Yakerson et al.
(18) after conducting pyridine adsorption studies on Zn/
H-ZSM5.
3.7. Isotopic Titration of Brnsted
Acid Sites with Deuterium Because ammonia titrants interact with both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites in Zn/H-ZSM5 (2628), the isotopic exchange of D2 with surface hydrogens was used to mea- sure the number of protons remaining after Zn exchange

(2933). Isotopic exchange experiments using D2 were conducted on H-ZSM5 and on 1.30% Zn/H-ZSM5 by flow- ing D2 over these samples and increasing the temperature.
The number of hydrogen atoms desorbed as H2 or HD was measured by mass spectrometry. Novakova et al. (33) used infrared spectroscopy to show that during isotopic exchange with D2, deuterium replaces both protons and silanols in Y zeolite. Thus, the number of surface H atoms equals the number of Brnsted acid sites, as long as silanol groups are minority species.
On H-ZSM5, D2 dissociates and exchanges with surface hydrogen atoms between 600 and 1000 K (Fig. 11). Surface H atoms desorb from the surface as HD and H2. These HD andH2 peaks accountforthedesorptionof1.04Hatomsper Al atom, consistent with the expected presence of one H+ per Al site (Table 5). An independent calculation of the hy- drogen surface concentration, based on the disappearance of D2 rather than on the amount of hydrogen desorbed,leads to a similar value (1.09 D atoms per Al atom). The change in the gas-phase concentration of D2 was less than 15% in all experiments. As a result, calculations based on D2 consumption are less accurate that those based on the appearance of H2 and HD. Desorption as HD accounted for 84% of the total hydrogens desorbed. The amount of H2 produced is consistent with the amount expected from readsorption of the HD, suggesting that H2 is formed pri- marily from readsorption of HD and subsequent exchange

with remaining H+ species. A prexponential factor and ac- tivation energy for this isotopic titration on H-ZSM5 were determined by fitting the HD desorption peak. The shape of this desorption peak is consistent with first-order kinetics and with an activation energy of 88 kJ/mol and a prexpo- nential factor of 4.16 × 108 cm3/(Al site s) (Fig. 11).
D2OH exchange on 1.30% Zn/H-ZSM5 (Zn/Al = 0.19) occurs at lower temperatures (400600 K) than on H-ZSM5 (6001000 K) (Figs. 11 and 12). This large difference in des- orption temperatures indicates that hydrogen migration on ZSM5 surfaces is facile at these temperatures and the rate- determining step for the isotopic titration on H-ZSM5 is the dissociation of D2, which is catalyzed by Zn2+ cations.
These results are consistent with the proposed role of Zn2+ cations as portholes for hydrogen recombination, which results in higher aromatic site-time yields during propane reactions.
A prexponential factor and activation energy for the deu- terium isotopic exchange on Zn/H-ZSM5 were determined by fitting the HD desorption peak with first-order kinet- ics. The calculated activation energy is 62 kJ/mol and the

prexponential factor is 8.95 × 106 cm3/(Al site s) (Fig. 12).
The total amount of H2 desorbed from Zn/H-ZSM5 during isotopic exchange with gas-phase D2 is consistent with the amount expected from readsorption of gas-phase HD. Zn2+ cations decrease the activation energy for the hydrogen dis- sociation step, which limits both the isotopic exchange rate and the rate of propane aromatization.
As on H-ZSM5, the H species on Zn/H-ZSM5 desorbed as HD and H2 during isotopic exchange with gas-phase D2.
The number of H atoms desorbed from Zn/H-ZSM5,however, was much lower (0.63 H atom per Al site) than on H-ZSM5 (Table 5). Recalculation of hydrogen surface concentration based on the consumption of D2 rather than hydrogen desorption leads to a value of 0.61 D atom per Al site. Calculations based on the Zn loading from elemental analysis suggest that the number of hydrogen atoms des- orbed (0.63 H/Al site) is very similar to the value of 0.62 H+/Al [1 2 × (Zn/Al)] obtained when Zn2+ titrates two protonic sites during ion exchange. This Zn species was also suggested by the NH3 desorption experiments. Zn2+ cations interact with two Al sites (OZn2+O).

4. CONCLUSIONS
On H-ZSM5, propane converts to aromatic products with low selectivity and reacts predominantly to form un- desired cracking products. Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increases the rate of hy- drogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity.
In situ Zn K-edge X-ray absorption studies have shown that Zn in Zn/H-ZSM5 (Si/Al = 14.5, ion exchange) is present as isolated ZnOx species, most likely located at ze- olitic exchange sites, with about four oxygen nearest neigh- bors and without Zn next nearest neighbors. Temperature- programmed reduction studies indicate that reduction of bulk ZnO begins at 800 K, but Zn cations in Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts do not reduce at temperatures exceeding 1173 K.
These Zn ions remain as Zn2+ cations and do not reduce to zero-valent species during propane reactions at 773 K.
Extracrystalline ZnO forms on samples prepared by im- pregnation techniques. These bulk ZnO crystals appear to be ineffective as catalysts for propane conversion. In con- trast with exchanged Zn species, these bulk ZnO crystals reduce and elute from the bed as Zn vapor during propane reactions.
By analogy with other divalent metal cations, the most probable species from nitrate solution is (ZnOH)+, but this Zn species is not thermally stable. On heating, Zn/H-ZSM5 undergoes dehydration. At low Zn loadings (<1.30 wt%),(ZnOH)+ couples with a nearby OH group to form H2O,which desorbs, and a Zn2+ cation. At high Zn loadings,(ZnOH)+ may couple with another (ZnOH)+ to form H2O and two Zn2+ cations interacting with two Al sites and con- nected by bridging oxygen.Ammonia adsorption measurements indicate that the in- troduction of Zn species into ZSM5 channels leads to a decrease in the amount of NH3 adsorbed per Al site and is consistent with one Zn2+ cation replacing two protons and interacting with two Al sites. The isotopic titration of Brnsted acid sites with D2 confirms these ammonia ad- sorption measurements. A decreased amount of hydrogen species is desorbed as HD and H2 on Zn/H-ZSM5, when compared with H-ZSM5, indicating that Zn replaces pro- tons during synthesis. Calculations based on the Zn load- ing from elemental analysis suggest that the number of hydrogen atoms desorbed is in agreement with the theoret- ical value expected for Zn2+ interacting with two Al sites (OZn2+O).
