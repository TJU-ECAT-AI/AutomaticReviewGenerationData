1.The growing demand for propylene has not been directly addressed in the literature provided. However, it is mentioned that Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics, promoting the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2 and inhibiting undesired cracking reactions. The literature focuses on the physical and chemical state of Ga using in-situ X-ray absorption at the Ga K-edge. Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions.

1.虽然提供的文献没有直接提到丙烯需求增长对新生产方法开发的影响，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），但文献中提到Ga物种在H-ZSM5沸石中催化烷烃转化为芳烃过程中的脱氢步骤，促进H-原子的重组脱附为H2，同时抑制不希望发生的裂解反应。文献重点在于使用原位X射线吸收光谱在Ga K边研究Ga的物理和化学状态。新鲜催化剂中存在的Ga+3物种在770 K以下的温度下在氢预处理或丙烷反应中还原。还原的Ga以高度分散的形式存在，没有Ga最近邻，可能作为单体氢化物物种与沸石通道内的碱性氧配位。这些氢化物物种在H-ZSM5上进行丙烷脱氢环二聚化时，由于表面氢逸度的增加，被驱动释放分子氢。当样品在流动的H2中冷却至室温时，还原的Ga物种重新氧化为Ga+3，这表明活性形式的Ga仅在反应条件下存在。
