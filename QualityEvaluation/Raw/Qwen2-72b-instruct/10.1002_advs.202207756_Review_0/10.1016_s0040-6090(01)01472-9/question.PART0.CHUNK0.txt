Besides the already known dissociation of dihydrogen and molecular adsorption of CO, methane was found to be adsorbed molecularly on coordinatively unsaturated Zn ions. Adsorption 2q lowers the CH symmetry from T to C , which is reflected in activation of the v (symmetric stretching) mode and discrete 4 d 3v 1 frequency shifts of the v (antisymmetric stretching) and n (bending) modes. Co-adsorption of the above gases on ZnO having 3 4 pre-adsorbed hydrogen results, in all cases, in a bathochromic shift of the v(ZnH) band and a hypsochromic shift of the v(O H) band, which originally appear at 1710 and 3492 cm , respectively. The magnitude of these shifts depends upon the nature y1 of the co-adsorbed gas.  2001 Elsevier Science B.V . All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Stoichiometric zinc oxide has the band structure typical of an insulator material; the fully occupied 2s and 2p orbitals of the O ion constitute the valence 2y band, while the empty 4s orbitals of Zn give rise to 2q the conduction band. When excess zinc atoms are present, which often happens, ZnO becomes an n-type semiconductor. When prepared in a relatively high- surface-area form, zinc oxide finds important applica- tions in heterogeneous catalysis and in gas-sensor technology. Chemical processes for which ZnO can act as a main catalyst component include the watergas shift reaction w1x, methanol synthesis w2x, olefin hydro- genation w3x and oxidation of methane to formaldehyde w4x.
Surface phenomena responsible for catalytic activity and gas sensing ability of ZnO stem from a combination of factors which include the presence of acid (Zn ) 2q and basic (O ) surface sites, the variety of exposed 2y * Corresponding author. crystal faces (and structures), and the possibility of electron transfer from the adsorbent to the adsorbate or vice-versa. These features give rise to a complex surface chemistry which remains poorly understood, despite a large number of studies devoted to the adsorption of both single gases w515x and binary mixtures w1618x on ZnO.
Some of the difficulties in interpreting literature data concerning chemisorption on polycrystalline zinc oxide stem from a poor characterization of surface morpholo- gy. It was the aim of this work to carry out a detailed FTIR study on the adsorption and co-adsorption of several gases on well characterized ZnO microcrystals.
First, dihydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane were individually considered. Secondly, binary mixtures of these gases were investigated in order to gain further knowledge on the nature of adsorption sites and on lateral interactions between co-adsorbates.

High reso- lution electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to char- acterize crystal morphology. For infrared studies, thin self-supported wafers of ZnO were prepared and acti- vated by outgassing at 773 K for 1 h under a dynamic vacuum (residual pressure 10 torr) inside an IR cell y4 which also allowed gas dosage and low temperature IR measurements to be carried out. In order to compensate for oxygen lost during thermal activation of the wafers,at the end of the activation period, 20 torr of oxygen was dosed into the cell (still at 773 K), the sample was then cooled to room temperature and oxygen outgassed to a final pressure of 10 torr. Transmission IR spectra y4 were recorded by using a Bruker IFS 28 spectrometer working at 2 cm resolution. y1
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Sample morphology
Electron micrographs have shown that ZnO crystal- lites were prevalently hexagonal single crystals, elon- gated along the c-axis. An example is shown in Fig. 1,and further details were given elsewhere w12,14x. Indi- vidual crystals had typical dimensions of 3060 nm wide and 150300 nm long, which is consistent with the measured surface area of 10 m g . These crystals 2 y1 expose mainly the non-polar (1010) and (1120) faces of the wurtzite-type structure and have a high degree of perfection (Fig. 1) although kinks and steps do exist,mainly at rounded crystal ends.
3.2. FTIR spectra of adsorbed hydrogen
Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectra obtained after adsorp- tion of dihydrogen, at 77 K and increasing coverage, on ZnO. These spectra, which depict the characteristic features already reported in the literature w3,9,19,20x,are shown here with the main purpose of facilitating understanding of co-adsorption experiments. Briefly the spectra in Fig. 2 show, at the lowest coverage, two IR adsorption bands at 1710 and at 3492 cm which y1 correspond, respectively, to the fundamental stretching vibration of hydride (ZnH) and hydroxyl (OH) sur- face species formed upon dissociative chemisorption of the dihydrogen molecule on adjacent Zn
O
ion pairs,2q 2y which act as a Lewis acid-base couple. When coverage is increased, n(ZnH) decreases down to 1690 cmy1 while n(OH) increases up to 3512 cm . This coverage- y1 dependent frequency shift of the ZnH and OH stretch- ing bands was explained by Griffin and Yates w9x in terms of a combination of lateral interactions among neighbouring adsorbates and through solid-inductive effects.
We only remark that frequency shifts take place in discrete steps (Fig. 2). This fact supports the model of Tsyganenko et al. w21x which considers discrete geo- metrical arrangements of neighbouring adsorbates on an 52

Simultaneously, the ZnH band (1710 cm ) is displaced towards lower wavenumbers. y1 Fig. 3. FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed, at 77 K, on ZnO. The top spectrum corresponds to an equilibrium pressure of 5.33 kPa. extended wurtzite-type (1010) face, the structure of which has been discussed in detail by Duke w22x.
3.3. FTIR spectra of adsorbed CO
Fig. 3 shows the IR spectra of CO adsorbed, at 77 K and increasing equilibrium pressure, on ZnO. At the lowest coverage a single band is observed at 2190 cm . In agreement with previous reports w14,15,17x,y1 this band is assigned to the fundamental CO stretching mode of Zn CO adducts. The upward shift of 47 2q cm in relation to the free CO (2143 cm ) should be y1 y1 assigned mainly to the vibrational Stark effect induced in the CO molecule by the (axial) electric field created by the Zn ion w23x. However, a contribution from s- 2q donation from the 5s molecular orbital of CO to the cation is also likely to exist, as suggested from ultravi- olet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements w8,24x.
It should be noted that the asymmetry and broadness of the 2190 cm band can be explained in terms of y1 CO adsorption on Zn ions belonging to both (1010) 2q and (1120) faces, which have a slightly different con- figuration of coordinatively-unsatured cations w22x.
When CO equilibrium pressure is increased, the 2190 cm band undergoes a bathochromic shift down to y1 2168 cm . Similarly to the case of adsorbed hydrogen,y1 several discrete bands can be observed in the 2190 2168 cm range; they should correspond to different y1 arrangements of neighbouring adsorbed CO molecules,which are related to surface coverage, and which give 53

Effect of CO adsorption, at 77 K, on ZnO having pre-adsorbed methane: (1) adsorbed methane, (2) after co-adsorption of CO. rise to resultant lateral interaction effects of different magnitude w21,25x. Further details on this subject can be found elsewhere w14x. Note also that for high cover- age two minor peaks (marked with asterisks in Fig. 3) are seen at approximately 2180 and 2185 cm . We y1 tentatively assign these peaks to the CO stretching of Zn CO adducts formed near edges of extended pris- 2q matic faces; such adducts would have a reduced number of neighbours, and hence they would be less influenced by lateral interactions.
3.4. FTIR spectra of adsorbed methane
Fig. 4 shows that, at a low equilibrium pressure,adsorbed methane gives IR adsorption bands at 2989,2872 and 1308 cm . The 2989 cm band is assigned y1 y1 to the n (antisymmetric) CH stretching mode, which 3 appears at 3020 cm in free CH . The 2872 cm y1 y1 4 band correspond to the n (symmetric) stretching mode,1 which is IR-inactive for free CH (2914 cm ) and y1 4 becomes activated in the perturbed (adsorbed) molecule. 54

Fig. 6. Effect of methane dosage (up to 13.3 Pa) on the OH band (left) and ZnH band (right) of ZnO having pre-adsorbed hydrogen: (1) before, and (2) after methane adsorption.
The band at 1308 cm is assigned to the n bending y1 4 mode, which has a free molecule value of d(CH) s 1302 cm . It is clear that adsorption lowers the CH y1 4 point group symmetry from T to C , which renders d 3v IR-active the n mode, and brings about discrete batho- 1 cromic shifts of the CH stretching modes and a small hypsochromic shift of the n bending mode. These facts 4 suggest that methane is molecularly adsorbed, forming H CHZn adducts with coordinatively unsatured 2q 3 Zn ions. Further evidence comes from the COyCH 2q 4 co-adsorption studies discussed below.
At relatively high equilibrium pressure, additional IR adsorption peaks develop at 3000 and 2900 cm . These y1 peaks are assigned to weakly perturbed (physisorbed) methane: n and n modes, respectively. 3 1
3.5. Studies on co-adsorbed gases
When CO was dosed (at 77 K) on ZnO having pre- adsorbed methane, the characteristic bands of adsorbed CH (Section 3.4) were found to disappear. Fig. 5 shows 4 that the only IR adsorption bands remaining after CO adsorption are a sharp peak at 2168 cm , which y1 corresponds to adsorbed CO, and the characteristic bands of free methane at 3020 (n ) and at 1302 cm (n ); it y1 3 4 is thus shown that CO displaces CH from its adsorption 4 sites. Since CO is known to form surface adducts with Zn (Section 3.3) but not with O ions, this experi- 2q 2y ment proves that Zn ions are the adsorption sites for 2q methane, hence giving support to the surface adduct structure proposed in Section 3.4. Note that O ions 2y could not be discarded beforehand as possible adsorption sites for methane.
Fig. 6 shows the effect of increasing doses of meth- ane, at 77 K, on the n(ZnH) and n(OH) bands formed after pre-adsorption of hydrogen on ZnO. The n(ZnH) band, originally at 1710 cm shifts step-wise to 1696 y1 cm upon adsorption of CH . Simultaneously, the y1 4 n(OH) band undergoes a hypsochromic shift from the initial value of 3492 up to 3499 cm . These shifts y1 parallel those observed when dihydrogen was dosed on ZnO containing hydride and hydroxyl groups (Section
3.2). Note, however, that the magnitude of the maximum
shifts is smaller in the case of co-adsorbed methane.
Carbon monoxide, and ethylene, were also dosed on zinc oxide having pre-adsorbed hydrogen (spectra not shown). CO was found to cause a maximum shift of y 68 cm in the n(ZnH) band and of q32 cm in the y1 y1 n(OH) band. In the case of ethylene corresponding shifts were y67 and q42 cm , respectively. y1 The whole set of results proves that dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen affects only a small portion of sites available for coordination of other adsorbed molecules. Progressive occupation of the remaining sites by co-adsorbates gives rise to several coverage-depend- ent arrangement of co-adsorbed phases; as a result of lateral and through-solid interactions, n(ZnH) and n(OH) modes are thus affected to a extent which depends on surface coverage and on the chemical nature of the co-adsorbed phase. Further details will be given elsewhere w26x.
