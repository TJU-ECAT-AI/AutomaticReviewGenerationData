1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional methods such as steam cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the identification of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations as active sites and the role of Lewis acid sites in the dehydrogenation activity. DFT calculations and experimental studies have provided insights into the reaction mechanism on GaOx-based catalysts, although the exact nature of the active sites and the role of Gaδ+H and GaOH species in the dehydrogenation activity are still under investigation.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长促使人们开发新的生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)，作为蒸汽裂解等传统方法的替代方案。对于PDH中Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随着时间的推移而发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究为这些催化剂的当前知识做出了贡献，包括识别四面体配位不足的Ga3+阳离子作为活性位点，以及路易斯酸位点在脱氢活性中的作用。DFT计算和实验研究为GaOx基催化剂上的反应机制提供了见解，尽管活性位点的确切性质以及Gaδ+H和GaOH物种在脱氢活性中的作用仍在研究中。
