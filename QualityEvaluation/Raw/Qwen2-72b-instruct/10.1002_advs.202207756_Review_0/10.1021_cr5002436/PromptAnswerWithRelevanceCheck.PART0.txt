1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional methods such as steam cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the identification of Lewis acid sites as active centers and the role of CO2 in improving catalyst performance. However, the exact nature of the active sites and the reaction mechanism on Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under investigation.

1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional methods such as steam cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the identification of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations as the active sites for dehydrogenation activity. However, the exact nature of the active sites is still under debate, with some authors proposing the presence of Lewis acid sites, while others suggest the involvement of both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites. The role of CO2 in improving olefin yields has also been studied, with various mechanisms proposed, including the removal of acid sites, coke gasification, and hydrogen removal by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. The addition of promoters, such as potassium, has been shown to reduce coke formation and increase selectivity. The reducibility of Ga2O3 and the effect of hydrogen and steam on the catalyst's activity have also been investigated. The promotion of GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts with metals like Pt has been reported to assist hydrogen desorption and facilitate the regeneration of active sites.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)，作为传统方法如蒸汽裂解的替代。对于PDH中Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随着时间的推移而发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究为这些催化剂的当前知识做出了贡献，包括确定四面体配位不足的Ga3+阳离子作为脱氢活性位点。然而，活性位点的确切性质仍在争论中，一些作者提出存在Lewis酸位点，而另一些则建议涉及Lewis和Brnsted酸位点。关于CO2提高烯烃产率的作用也进行了研究，提出了各种机制，包括去除酸位点、焦炭气化和通过逆水煤气变换反应去除氢气。添加钾等促进剂已被证明可以减少焦炭形成并提高选择性。Ga2O3的还原性和氢气、蒸汽对催化剂活性的影响也进行了研究。据报道，Pt等金属对GaOx基脱氢催化剂的促进作用有助于氢气解吸，促进活性位点的再生。
