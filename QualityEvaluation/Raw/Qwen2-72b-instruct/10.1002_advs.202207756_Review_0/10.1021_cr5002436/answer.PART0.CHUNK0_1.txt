1.The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, shedding light on the active sites and the mechanism of the PDH reaction. However, the literature provided does not contain specific details about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts or the recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge.
