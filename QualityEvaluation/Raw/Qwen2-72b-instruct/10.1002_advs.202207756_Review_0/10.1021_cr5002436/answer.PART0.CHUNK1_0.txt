1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional methods such as steam cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the identification of Lewis acid sites as active centers and the role of CO2 in improving catalyst performance. However, the exact nature of the active sites and the reaction mechanism on Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under investigation.
