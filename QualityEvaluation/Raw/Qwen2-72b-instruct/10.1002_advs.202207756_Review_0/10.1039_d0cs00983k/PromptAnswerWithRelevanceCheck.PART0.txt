Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The growing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has identified Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, and Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了丙烷脱氢技术的快速发展。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的作用机理，尤其是活性Ga物种的性质，学术界一直存在争议。最近的研究发现，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂上Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted酸对是丙烷脱氢的活性中心。增强的Lewis酸性有利于CH键的异裂，而Brnsted酸性降低了氢消除的活化能。
