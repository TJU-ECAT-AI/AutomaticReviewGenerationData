INTRODUCTION
The global CO2 emission has increased its atmospheric concentration to 415 ppm in 2019, which has been linked to climate change and ocean acidification.1 The majority of the anthropogenic CO2 emission comes from power plants, transportation, cement and steel industries,and agriculture, among which fossil fuel-based power plants contribute to 33%40% of the total CO2 emission.1 Several strategies have been proposed to minimize CO2 emission, such as deployment of renewable (e.g., solar and wind) or nuclear energy, shift from coal to natural/shale gas (less CO2 emission per unit energy2), and CO2 capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU).1,3-5 Among them, CCSU is a promising practice that allows the continuous use of fossil fuels and meanwhile alleviates CO2 emission. In recent years, extensive efforts have been devoted to reducing the additional operating costs and energy penalty resulted from capturing and concentrating CO2, making it attractive to utilize CO2 at point sources (e.g., power plants) for the sustainable synthesis of value-added chemicals or fuels.4 Furthermore, in order to achieve a net reduction in CO2 emission, the upgrading of CO2 should avoid the utilization of molecular H2 unless it is produced from renewable sources such as those highlighted in previous studies.6-8 For both environmental and sustainability reasons, shale/natural gas has been treated as a highly appealing alternative to petroleum and coal before the large-scale application of renewable energy resources. To date, a huge reserve (ca. 16.1 quadrillion cubic feet) of shale gas has been discovered globally.9 The advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques have boosted the supply of shale gas, mainly from the US market, which is altering the global energy landscape.2,10 Although the prominent component in shale gas is methane, other light alkanes (ethane, propane, and butane) account for up to 15% hydrocarbons in shale basins and are typically under- utilized. For example, the revolution of shale gas especially in the United States has led to an ethane surplus and a record low price since 1995.11 Instead of using molecular H2, light alkanes can be used as the source of hydrogen to activate and upgrade CO2.
The emerging strategy of simultaneously upgrading the greenhouse gas CO2 and the underutilized light alkanes has demonstrated poten- tials to synthesize several important petrochemical feedstocks from the abundant CO2 and shale gas. The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant has been mentioned for the dehydrogenation of alkanes.12-15 However,fundamental understanding of actives sites or reaction mechanisms was lacking. In this Perspective, we discuss recent advances of CO2-assited dehydrogenation,aromatization,and hydroformylation reactions.
Depending on the selective bond cleavage of light alkanes, the gaseous products can be syngas (CO and H2) and olefins from the CO2-assisted dry reforming (DR, both C C and C H bond scission) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH, C H bond scission only) pathways, respec- tively.16-19 Moreover, the gaseous product stream (CO, H2, and olefins) can be further upgraded into value-added liquid products, such as aro- matics (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylenes [BTX]) via a tandem aromati- zation process20 or oxygenates via a downstream hydroformylation process using tandem reactors.21 In addition to being higher value, the aromatics and oxygenate products typically exist as liquid, which should help reduce the cost associated with product separation. Furthermore,the integration of the above catalytic processes within one reactor unit should also alleviate the risk of transportation and storage of toxic or flammable feedstocks (CO, H2, and olefins) because only CO2 and light alkanes would be used as the reactants.
In this Perspective, we will discuss recent results from our group in reacting CO2 and light alkanes to produce syngas, olefins, On Occasion of the 2020 R. H. Wilhelm Award in Chemical Reaction Engineering of AIChE

CATALYST SYNTHESIS AND
CHARACTERIZATION OF ACTIVE SITES
Supported monometallic and bimetallic catalysts for SU-CO2Et are typically synthesized with wet impregnation methods. However, such methods typically lead to a heterogeneous distribution of structures,such as size, shape, exposed facets, alloy extent, surface termination,and interface proximity. As shown in Figure 1A, other synthesis methods should also be explored to achieve an atomic-level control of uniform structures, which are not only important to identify active sites but also beneficial to minimize undesired side reactions in SU- CO2Et.
The active sites for SU-CO2Et typically range from bulk phases (e.g., metal oxide or carbide support) to nanoparticles, clusters, and even single atoms, and they may undergo dynamic restructuring under reaction conditions and thereby pose a challenge on the characteriza- tion of their electronic and geometric properties. As illustrated in Figure 1B, proper characterization techniques should be deployed according to their detection capabilities and spatial resolution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) provides structural information (e.g., phase identity,lattice parameter, crystallite size, alloy composition, and preferred facet growth) from the position, intensity, and shape of XRD peaks generated from materials with a long-range ordered structure.
Figure 1C displays the application of in situ XRD to track the structural evolution of a bimetallic catalyst (PdFe3/CeO2) under different reac- tion conditions for SU-CO2Et. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) consists of the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, mainly associated with dipole-allowed transitions) and the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS, originated from neighbor-backscat- tering in the local structure) signals. Unlike XRD, XAFS can be used to probe materials without long-range order such as small clusters or even single-atom structures. As shown in Figure 1D, in situ XANES is a useful tool to probe the oxidation state of the elements of interest by comparing the edge position against the standards (within the same ligand family) with known formal chemical states. Fitting the Fourier-transformed EXAFS signal (FT-EXAFS) (Figure 1E) provides structural information such as the coordination number, bond length,and mean-square disorder deviation. For bimetallic systems, additional correlation constraints on these parameters offer a way of validating the presence of bimetallic and metal-support bonding as well as esti- mating the particle size, shape, and bimetallic arrangement.22 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a useful technique to analyze the elemental and chemical compositions within the near- surface region. Ambient pressure XPS (AP-XPS) is an essential tool to identify the nature of the oxygen (O1s) at the metalmetal oxide interface (e.g., FeOx/Pd interface) under the reaction atmosphere and elevated temperature of SU-CO2Et (Figure 1F). In addition, certain oxygen species with unpaired electrons are highly active, entailing a transient feature that can be detected by in situ electron spin reso- nance spectroscopy (Figure 1G). Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) is widely applied for the in situ anal- ysis of surface intermediates and for determining the surface termina- tion with appropriate probe molecules (e.g., CO and N2O). For example, as illustrated in Figure 1H, DRIFTS results following CO adsorption suggest that the FeOx species interact with the Pd(111) facets of supported Pd particles, given the more suppression of its characteristic peak (1925 cm1) with the doping of FeOx species.18 Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provides direct images at the atomic scale for insights into the structural prop- erties of catalysts. Complemented with spectroscopic techniques (energy-dispersive spectroscopy [EDS] or electron energy loss spec- troscopy [EELS]), high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM is a powerful tool to reveal structural information of elemental distribu- tion, size (NPs, clusters, and even single atoms), lattice fringe, epitaxial growth, and metal-support interfaces, and so forth. As shown in Figure 1I, the presence of the Ni/FeOx interface in a FeNi/CeO2 cata- lyst is validated by the combination of HAADF and EELS. The recent advancement in the atomic-lattice-resolution environmental (S)TEM has led to unprecedented insights into the dynamic restructuring of catalysts that occurs under reaction conditions, such as metal sintering, phase transformation, oxidationreduction processes, lay- ered metal oxide encapsulation, and metaloxide interfacial behavior.
As will be discussed in the next section, the characterization tech- niques described in Figure 1 have provided important insights into the active sites and reaction mechanisms of SU-CO2Et over a variety of catalysts. 3
SIMULTANEOUS UPGRADING OF CO2
AND LIGHT ALKANES
3.1
Dry reforming to syngas or oxidative dehydrogenation to olefins Primarily driven by the consumer goods and automobile industries,the global market has witnessed a dramatic increase in the demand of light olefins (e.g., ethylene, propylene, butylene, and butadiene), the important feedstocks for the production of polymers used in plastics,resins, and fibers.25 Nowadays, thermal steam cracking of hydrocar- bons (e.g., naphtha, crude oil, and natural gas) and catalytic direct dehydrogenation (DD) of light alkanes (e.g., ethane, propane, and butane) at elevated temperatures constitute the predominant produc- tion of olefins globally. Alternative processes such as ODH with O2 have also been explored, taking advantage of the huge reserves of cheap light alkanes from the shale gas.26 Despite reduced reaction temperature and improved coking resistance compared with DD, it is still limited by low selectivity due to the overoxidation to COx species as well as heat and safety managements due to the mixture of alkanes and O2. Therefore, replacing O2 with a soft oxidant, such as CO2,offers the possibility of safer operation while simultaneously reducing 3 of 11

the greenhouse gas. For example, thermodynamic analysis suggests that CO2-ODH of C2H6 exhibits a higher equilibrium conversion than DD because of the consumption of the formed H2 via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS, H2 + CO2 ! H2O + CO) reaction.27 Although the relatively high temperatures (Figure 2A) of the CO2-ODH reaction likely increase coke deposition, the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C ! 2CO) is beneficial to eliminate the formed carbonaceous species.
It is noted that thermodynamically the C C bond of light alkanes is more readily cleaved than the C H bond. For example, the bond energy is 368 kJ mol1 for CH3 CH3 and 415 kJ mol1 for C2H5 H of ethane. Consequently, as indicated in Figure 2A, the reactions of CO2 with ethane favor the DR pathway to produce syngas (e.g., C2H6 + 2CO2 ! 4CO + 3H2) over ODH (e.g., C2H6 + CO2 ! C2H4 + CO + H2O) to produce ethylene. Thus, one of the most challenging aspects for CO2-ODH is to tune the product selectivity toward the more valuable olefins by breaking the C H bond while retaining the C C bond. The CO2-ODH strategy offers the opportunity to produce light olefins from underutilized C2C4 alkanes in shale gas while simultaneously converting CO2 to CO. If all the demand of ethylene,

4 of 11 propylene, and butylene/butadiene (7.8 × 1012 mol year1)28 is met with CO2-ODH, the process would consume approximately 15% of the total annual chemical industry CO2 emissions,29 assuming that 1 mol of olefin produced consumes 1 mol of CO2.
The CO2-assisted DR and ODH of ethane have been extensively studied over a wide range of catalysts, including monometallic, bime- tallic, and metal carbide catalysts.16-19,30-33 The effect of oxide sup- port has also been investigated over reducible and irreducible oxides for both DR34 and ODH35. Among the various catalysts, PtNi/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 have been identified as the most active and selective catalysts for DR and ODH of ethane, respectively.36 The FeNi/CeO2 catalysts have also shown promising performance for CO2-ODH of propane37,38 and butane.27,39 The development of effective CO2-ODH catalysts is still limited by the ambiguous structurefunction relationship. For example, it has been suggested that oxygen species are essential for the effective activation of the C H bond in alkanes,33,40 although it is still less understood whether and how the electronic and geometric properties of the oxygen species generated from CO2 dissociation would affect the selective cleavage of C C/C H bonds of alkanes. Using PdFe bimetallic catalysts as a case study, Xie et al.18 investigated the prop- erties of oxygen species at different interfacial sites and their roles in controlling the activity and selectivity of SU-CO2Et over bimetallic PdFex/CeO2 catalysts. As demonstrated in Figure 2B, flow reactor experiments displayed that the 1.0%Pd/CeO2 catalyst showed a high initial ethane conversion (34%) with nearly 100% selectivity to CO and was subsequently deactivated to 5% at the pseudo-steady (PS) state. The 1.4%Fe/CeO2 catalyst was nearly inactive with negligible product yield at the PS state. In contrast, bimetallic PdFe/CeO2 signif- icantly enhanced the stability (not shown here) and increased the eth- ylene yield with a selectivity of 86%. The in situ XRD measurements (Figure 1C) revealed the formation of PdFe alloy on 1.0%PdFe(1:3)/ CeO2 after reduction at 723 K. The in situ XANES (Figure 1D) results suggested that Pd in both the Pd and PdFe catalysts remained metal- lic during the reaction, whereas the oxidation state of Fe was close to FeO. The EXAFS fittings (Figure 1E) validated the presence of the Pd Fe bond on 1.0%PdFe(1:3)/CeO2, as well as a long Pd O bond at
2.24 Å, most likely associated with the Pd O Ce and/or Pd O Fe
interfacial structures. This was consistent with the positively shifted Pd 3d5/2 core level on 1.0%PdFe(1:3)/CeO2 (335.7 eV) relative to
1.0%Pd/CeO2 (335.3 eV) from the AP-XPS measurements (Figure 1F),
attributed to the electron transfer from Pd to the interfacial oxygen in the Pd O Fe bond. The HAADF and EDS images (not shown here) further confirmed the formation of the FeOx/Pd interface on the
1.0%PdFe(1:3)/CeO2
catalyst.
The
DRIFTS
of
CO
adsorption (Figure 1H) suggested the coexistence of Pd(100) and Pd(111) facets on the Pd NPs, whereas FeOx interacted preferentially with the Pd(111) facet.
These comprehensive characterization results allowed the utiliza- tion of appropriate structural models in DFT calculations to gain insights into the role of different interfacial sites in the selective cleav- age of C H/C C bonds in ethane. The DFT results showed that the presence of Pd lowered the oxygen vacancy formation energy,validating the promotion of the reducibility of CeO2. The energy pro- files (Figure 2C) and activation barriers along the DR and ODH path- ways indicated that the Pd(111) facet was favorable to break the C H, C C and even C C bonds to form CO, whereas the Fe3O3/Pd (111) sites preferred to selectively break the C H bond to form *C2H4 before its facile desorption (0.36 eV). The Bader charge analy- sis (Figure 2D) revealed electron-enriched oxygen on Fe3O3/Pd(111) compared with the electrophilic oxygen on Pd(111), which was consis- tent with the AP-XPS analysis that electron would transfer from Pd to the interfacial oxygen of Pd O Fe and was linked to the high selec- tivity to the ODH pathway. Figure 2E illustrated the role of different interfacial sites for the activation of ethane and CO2 for SU-CO2Et.
Overall, the case study of PdFex/CeO2 (Figures 1 and 2) not only expands the understanding of the nature of oxygen in determining selective cleavage of the C C/C H bonds in light alkanes but also highlights the importance of combining kinetic studies, in situ charac- terization, and theoretical calculations in establishing structure function relationships for the complex reaction pathways of SU- CO2Et.
3.2
Tandem reactions of CO2-ODH of ethane and aromatization to produce aromatics Aromatics such as BTX are typically produced via the steam cracking or catalytic reforming of naphtha and are among the most essential building blocks in the production of packaging, paints, adhesives,clothing, pharmaceuticals, and many more.41 However, the BTX sup- plies are affected by the changing energy landscape from the oil- based naphtha toward the shale-based light alkanes.42 Thus, efficient shale-based techniques are highly desirable to bridge the gap between the decreasing supply and increasing demand of BTX. One-pot dehydroaromatization (DDA) of methane and ethane to aromatics has attracted much attention, mainly with MFI-type (ZSM-5) zeolite- supported catalysts (MOx/ZSM-5, M = V, Cr, Mo, W, Re, Fe, Ga, and Zn).43,44 However, there are several challenges associated with the DDA process, including being highly endothermic, equilibrium-limited with low one-pass conversion, and rapid deactivation from coke depo- sition. Combining CO2-assisted ODH of ethane or propane with aro- matization offers an attractive alternative to produce liquid aromatics from the shale-based light alkanes with the simultaneous reduction of
CO2.20,45
Compared with the typical DDA process where coke deposition can readily occur, the CO2-assisted oxidative DDA (CO2-ODA) strat- egy is promising not only in the aspects of mitigating coke formation via the reverse Boudouard reaction but also forward-shifting the equi- librium toward liquid products by consuming H2 via the RWGS reac- tion.20 Thermodynamic analysis (Figure 3A) validated that the presence of CO2 should increase the equilibrium conversion of ethane and the amount of benzene, especially between the temperature regions of 700850 K. The production of aromatics from ethane typi- cally proceeds with either the sequential dehydrogenationoligomeri- zationaromatization (e.g., over Ga/ZSM-5) route or the hydrocarbon- 5 of 11

pool (e.g., over Mo/ZSM-5) route.46 As for the former, it has been suggested that ethylene (or propylene) production is one of the key steps to provide feedstocks for the subsequent oligomerization and cyclization reactions. Therefore, it is desirable to identify CO2-ODA catalysts containing multifunctionality to enhance both dehydrogena- tion and aromatization reactions. Experimentally, there are at least two key challenges to overcome for achieving CO2-ODA of light alkanes: (1) the catalyst must activate both CO2 and alkanes and (2) the catalyst should exhibit long-term stability in the presence of water that is produced from the concomitant RWGS reaction. Incor- poration of Ga in ZSM-5 has been reported to influence the strength of the acid sites on the zeolite, facilitate the H2/ethylene desorption,and lower the activation energy for C H bond scission.47 Modifica- tion of ZSM-5 with P has the potential to increase the hydrothermal stability,tune the acidbase properties,and decrease coke formation.48 Recently, Gomez et al.20 have synthesized and evaluated a Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8) catalyst, designated as a ZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al ratio of 30) modified by 2 wt% Ga and 0.8 wt% P, in a flow reactor for CO2-ODA of ethane (Figure 3B). Unlike unmodified Ga/ZSM-5, the Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8) catalyst showed an improvement in liquid aro- matic yield (13.5%) and an enhanced stability (Figure 3C) in the presence of CO2. Moreover, the thermogravimetric analysis results for the spent Ga/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8) catalysts after the

6 of 11 CO2-ODA reaction indicated that the presence of P reduced the coke deposition typically resulted from the side cracking reactions.
DFT calculations for the CO2-ODA of ethane over Ga/ZSM-5 (Figure 3D) revealed that the most energetically favorable mecha- nism required that ethane first dehydrogenated to C2H5Ga and H2 over the concerted BrnstedLewis acid sites. CO2 then reacted with the produced H2 to form CO and H2O via RWGS, and the C2H5Ga intermediate further dehydrogenated to C2H4, regenerating the BrnstedLewis acid pair site. The H2O that was produced from RWGS had the potential to influence the reaction mechanism by strongly adsorbing on the Ga+ site. Adding P to Ga/ZSM-5 could weaken the binding energy of H2O at the Brnsted acid site and consequently improve the hydrothermal stability of the zeolite framework. More importantly, as revealed in Figure 3E, adding P into Ga/ZSM-5 facilitated aromatics formation by lowering the H2 formation barriers. Similar experimental and theoretical approaches have also been applied for the CO2-ODA of propane over Ga/ZSM- 5/P(0.8).45 The above examples shed light on the potential for CO2- ODA of light alkanes into liquid aromatics by modifying zeolite cata- lysts with secondary elements to achieve the synergy between the CO2-assisted ODH and aromatization steps.

Reactions of CO2 and ethane for production of C3 oxygenates using tandem reactors Based on the stoichiometry of the DR of ethane, the derived H2/ CO ratio is 3/4, less than the conventional feed ratio of syngas for the FischerTropsch synthesis. In addition, the copresence of the RWGS and reverse Boudouard reactions would not only reduce the H2/CO ratio and the carbon-based selectivity of ethylene but also increase the cost for the product separation. More importantly, the transportation and storage of the toxic component of CO in syngas and flammable ethylene raise potential safety risks. Given the above

issues, it should be highly desirable to develop a strategy to further upgrade the obtained mixture of syngas and ethylene into liquid products.
Recently, Xie et al.21 proposed a strategy to insert the CO2- derived CO moiety into the ethane-derived ethylene to produce C3 oxygenates (propanal and 1-propanol) by coupling two different bime- tallic catalysts within a tandem-reactor configuration at ambient pres- sure.
The thermodynamic analysis (Figure
4A)
suggested the infeasibility of direct conversion of ethane and CO2 into propanal due to a highly positive ΔG0. Alternatively, this process can be split into two cascade steps: (1) concurrent CO2-assisted ODH and DR of eth- ane to ethylene and syngas, respectively, and (2) subsequent CO insertion via hydroformylation to produce C3 oxygenates. A tandem- reactor configuration was introduced to bridge the thermodynamic gap between the above two steps, that is, running at the respective preferred temperature regions. The equilibrium analysis indicated that,by using the products from the first reactor, the hydroformylation process in the second reactor (473 K) could yield 7% to 55% of C3 oxygenates (propanal and 1-propanol) as the first reactor is maintained within 8731273 K. More importantly, in contrast to the conventional homogenous hydroformylation process under high pres- sure, the proposed strategy would benefit from proceeding at ambient pressure.
As outlined in Figure 4B, a Fe3Ni1/CeO2 DR/ODH catalyst and a RhCox/MCM-41 hydroformylation catalyst were applied into the first and second reactors, respectively. The main product distribution (Figure 4C) from the first reactor strongly depended on the tempera- ture,with an equal molar
C2H4/CO/H2
ratio (a typical hydroformylation feed ratio) being obtained at 1023 K. Figure 4D demonstrates that the Rh1Co3/MCM-41 catalyst provided the highest yield of propanal and 1-propanol, representing the highest CO inser- tion efficiency, among all the candidates tested by applying a pure feed of C2H4, CO, and H2 for the second reactor. The highest one- pass yield of C3 oxygenates (4.7%, Figure 4E) was achieved with the combination of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (1073 K) and Rh1Co3/MCM-41 (473 K) catalysts.
The synergistic effect between Rh and Co species played a critical role in the activity and selectivity for the production of C3 oxygen- ates. The HAADF images and CO chemisorption indicated that the Rh ensembles could be reduced to 1.4 nm in the presence of Co on the high-surface-area MCM-41 substrate. The in situ XAFS results (Figure 4F) suggested that the strong interaction of CoOx with MCM- 41 was responsible for the increase of Rh dispersion, whereas the fraction of Co that formed bimetallic bond with Rh most likely pro- moted the increase in the total C3 oxygenate formation rate and 1-propanol selectivity.
DFT
calculations further validated such hypothesis using Rh(111) and Co3Rh(111) model surfaces. Compared with Rh(111), the RhCo bimetallic surface could facilitate the produc- tion of C3 oxygenates (Figure 4G), especially 1-propanol, benefiting from the stronger binding strength of oxygenate intermediates (e.g., *CH3CH2CHO and *CH3CH2CH2O). This case study provided the proof-of-principle results for simultaneously converting CO2 and light alkanes into value-added aldehydes and alcohols. 4
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
The simultaneous conversion of CO2 and light alkanes represents promising pathways to reduce CO2 while upgrading underutilized light alkanes in shale gas. Examples presented in this Perspective have demonstrated proof-of-principle results for producing syngas, olefins,aromatics, and oxygenates. However, more in-depth efforts in mecha- nistic understanding and catalyst development are needed in order to translate these promising concepts into practical applications. In this section, we will discuss future opportunities and associated challenges in this exciting research area.

Mechanistic understanding of the CO2-assisted DR and ODH pathways The case studies elucidated that distinct active sites play a crucial role in controlling the DR and ODH routes via the oxygen-assisted C H/ C C bond cleavage of light alkanes and in improving catalytic stability by resistance to coking. The activation of the C H bond in alkanes typically proceeds with the oxidative addition and σ-bond metathesis mechanisms in heterogeneous catalysis.49-52 In contrast to the C H bond activation that can occur even on a single metal atom, the C C bond activation is usually a structure-sensitive process that requires metal ensembles to maintain the transition state complex. It should be noted that, even though light olefins can be readily formed by an effi- cient C H bond activation, the ease of desorption is another key fac- tor to affect the selectivity because the C C bond could be further broken due to the interaction with the catalyst surface.
Sites active for nonselective bond cleavages are typically char- acterized by weakly bound oxygen (electron-deficient, electrophilic,high mobility) on the metal surface, whereas those for the selective cleavage of the C H bond are typically characterized by a stronger oxygen binding energy (electron-rich, nucleophilic, lattice-like). Even though the attack by nucleophilic oxygen is commonly much slower than that of the electrophilic oxygen, owing to the loss of its oxidiz- ing properties, it can still abstract hydrogen from alkanes. In the case of nucleophilic abstraction by oxygen ions, it is typically the metal cation of the catalyst that would act as the oxidizing agent. There- fore, the structural and electronic properties of both metal (ion) and oxygen species are critical not only in C H bond activation but also in the subsequent cleavage of C C and C C bonds. The features of surface oxygen atoms/ions are usually characterized by binding energy, charge density, and structure of MO complexes (adsorption on metal surfaces or surface oxide ions within the lattice), which can be tuned by altering the electronic and geometric environments at the active sites. The binding strength of the oxygen species is directly related to the choice of metal elements and can be further modified by imposing strain effect and ligand effect via the varia- tions of the coordination number and the identity of the surrounding atoms.
In addition to the metal effect on the activation of alkanes, the support effect or the metalsupport interaction also plays a

8 of 11 significant role in the activation of the other important reactant,
CO2. Compared with transition metals, metal oxides with variable
valence states have been reported to be much more active and promising to activate CO2 via redox at oxygen vacancies at which electron donation can result in an active bent CO2 configuration,leading to the cleavage of the C O bond. In addition, doping oxides with a lower-valence metal or contacting it with other active metal ensembles could make it even easier to create oxygen vacancy,which in turn provides more sites for CO2 activation.53 Another crit- ical factor is the subsequent transfer of the created surface oxygen from the support or the metalsupport interface toward the sur- face/vicinity of the metal ensembles to react with the hydrocarbon species. More in-depth understanding of the roles of active metals,oxide supports, and the metaloxide interfaces for the concerted activation of alkanes and CO2 should lead to the design of more active and selective catalysts.
4.2
Catalyst design to upgrade CO2 and alkanes into aromatics and oxygenates As shown in Figure 2E, SU-CO2Et reactions produce a mixture of gas- eous products, such as CO, H2, C2H4, CH4, and H2O. Among them, C2H4, CO, and H2 are important industrial feedstocks for further upgrading into liquid products, such as C2H4 to aromatics or C2H4 and syngas to C3 oxygenates. More efforts should be paid to develop effi- cient and multifunctional catalysts with various types of active sites to produce value-added liquid products such as aromatics (Figure 3) and oxygenates (Figure 4). For the aromatization of ethane, Ga-, Mo-, and V-modified ZSM-5 catalysts have been widely applied. Even though high initial selectivity can be achieved, these catalysts usually suffer from severe deactivation due to coke deposition and/or water inhibi- tion effect on the Brnsted acid sites. Thus, future efforts should be paid to enhance aromatics yield through the design of zeolite-based materials by introducing modifiers that are capable of improving the hydrothermal stability and the activation of CO2. The addition of P appears to be a promising method to enhance the coke and hydro- thermal resistance of the zeolites. Other dopants and promoters should be explored to further enhance the water tolerance and aro- matics selectivity. Because methane accounts for the prominent com- ponent in shale gas, it is appealing to develop catalysts that only react with C2+ light alkanes to liquid aromatics so as to purify the methane stream. Ga-based catalysts seem to be promising to achieve this goal,which have been reported to be active to DDA of ethane while inac- tive to DDA of methane.46 For the hydroformylation pathway, the yield of C3 oxygenates is limited by the selectivity due to the interference of the undesired hydrogenation of ethylene back to ethane (Figure 4D). Thus, it is criti- cal to enhance the selectivity by suppressing the hydrogenation path- way,which exhibits different structure sensitivity from hydroformylation and typically occurs on larger metal nanoparticles,while hydroformylation prefers to occur on smaller metal ensembles and even single atoms. Rh, Co, and Ir are among the most commonly used metals for heterogeneous hydroformylation catalysis. It should be promising to enhance the yield of C3 oxygenates by depositing ultrafine clusters or single-atom (alloy) onto large-surface-area sub- strates,such as (N-doped) graphene,mesoporous materials (e.g., MCM-41 and SBA-15), metalorganic framework (MOF), and MAXenes. Reducible metal oxide supports (e.g., CeO2, ZrO2, and TiO2) may not only act as a carrier but also regulate the electronic properties of metal sites via the metalsupport interaction, which would modulate the binding strength to C2H4 and CO and in turn affect the activity and selectivity. Moreover, different from the pure feed mixture for the conventional hydroformylation reaction, the feed from the reactions of CO2 and alkanes also contains water vapor,which may compete with the reactants on active sites and lead to the decrease of activity. Thus, catalysts with hydrophobic properties should be explored.
By understanding the kinetic response of the hydroformylation catalyst to the reactants (e.g., C2H4, CO, and H2) in the second reac- tor, the feed ratio can be tuned accordingly in the first reactor to fur- ther improve the yield of the C3 oxygenates. It has been reported that the formation rate of propanal in heterogeneous hydroformylation typically increases with the partial pressure of C2H4 and H2 (namely
[C2H4]
and
[H2])
while decreases with
[CO],
such as rpropanal / [C2H4]1[H2]0.5[CO]1.54 Thus, it should be beneficial to enrich C2H4 and H2 but reduce CO in the first reactor-derived C2H4/ CO/H2 mixture for the second reactor as outlined in Figure 3B. Alter- natively, it is also highly desirable to develop catalysts that can reverse the reaction order of [CO] to zero or even positive, which should make the hydroformylation reactions more tolerant to the C2H4/CO/ H2 ratio. As such, a preferred catalyst should weaken the CO binding while strengthen the C2H4 binding. Dual-site catalysts are worthy to be explored in which C2H4 activation and CO adsorption and insertion may be spatially separated.
4.3
Integration of catalyst synthesis, in situ characterization, and DFT calculations It remains challenging to identify the active sites and reaction mecha- nisms for the simultaneous activation of light alkanes and CO2. One of the main reasons is that supported materials in the form of powder or pellets, obtained from the conventional incipient wetness method,are commonly used for these reactions, which usually render non- uniform structures spanning in size (nanoparticle/cluster/single atom),compositions (mixed composites/random or ordered alloy/coreshell),surface morphology (highly/low-coordinated facets), chemical states (metallic/oxidized), and so forth. More advanced synthesis methods,such as those listed in Figure 1A, should be explored to produce cata- lysts with a more uniform distribution of electronic and geometric structures. For example, as listed in Figure 1A, atomic layer deposition is among the most suitable approach with an atomic precision to pre- pare a well-defined metal oxide/metal interface; the strong electronic adsorption and pulsing thermal-shock methods are more appropriate to obtain a uniform alloy/coreshell structure;the galvanic 9 of 11

replacement method is worthy to be attempted to synthesize the single-atom alloy catalysts.
Furthermore, catalyst structures can be further modified by the reaction environment, such as in the presence of complex mixtures of reactants and products in CO2-assited DR and ODH of alkanes, which further hinders the identification of the active sites. Therefore, it is important to combine advanced synthesis methods with in situ char- acterization techniques those with proper spatial and time resolutions to determine the electronic, structural, and compositional properties of active sites under reaction conditions. Some of the commonly used in situ characterization techniques are listed in Figure 1, but more should be explored.
Theoretical studies, such as DFT calculations and molecule dynamics simulations, should be closely coupled with synthesis and in situ characterization to ensure that the theoretical models contain the relevant electronic and structural properties under reaction condi- tions. Such close integration is critical to obtain accurate correlation between theoretical insights and experimentally measured catalytic performance on well-defined catalysts.
Furthermore,machine learning-assisted and artificial intelligence-assisted calculations should also be explored to efficiently facilitate the catalyst development pro- cesses for enhancing the concerted activation of CO2 and alkanes and their subsequent upgrading reactions.
