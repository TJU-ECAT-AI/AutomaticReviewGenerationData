1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has become a major industrial process. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the identification of isolated Ga3+ species as the active sites for propylene production. However, the debate about the active Ga species continues, with some studies suggesting that the active sites are not isolated Ga3+ species but rather Ga clusters or GaOx species. Despite this, the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts remain highly active and selective for PDH, with high propylene yields and stability. The ongoing research on these catalysts aims to further improve their performance and understand the reaction mechanism.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这已成为一个主要的工业过程。对于PDH的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随着时间的推移而发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究为这些催化剂的当前知识做出了贡献，包括确定孤立的Ga3+物种是丙烯生产中的活性位点。然而，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续，一些研究认为活性位点不是孤立的Ga3+物种，而是Ga簇或GaOx物种。尽管如此，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂仍然具有高活性和选择性，具有高丙烯产量和稳定性。对这些催化剂的持续研究旨在进一步提高其性能并理解反应机制。
