[1] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
[2] "The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale."
[3] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
[4] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
[5] "Historically, a bifunctional Ga/H-ZSM-5 material has been applied as a catalyst for the commercial process for propane aromatization, developed jointly by UOP and BP as the Cyclar Process."
[6] "Sattler et al. reported a Pt-promoted Ga/γ-Al2O3 species (Pt3Ga/γ-Al2O3) as a highly promising catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, which showed remarkably high activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."
[7] "Further investigations by Searles et al. showed that a Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalyst, featuring a highly dispersed GaxPt alloy structure, had a long-term stability evident in unchanged propene selectivity (>99%) over the course of a 20 h DDH reaction."
[8] "Cybulskis et al. reported that the preparation strategy could greatly influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts."
[9] "Shao et al. established an optimal Ga loading of 5 wt%, reporting an initial propene yield on different supports that followed the trend: Ga/H-ZSM-5 (48%) > Ga/γ-Al2O3 (43%) > Ga/SBA-15 (28%) > Ga/SiO2 (9%)."
[10] "Schreiber et al. further verified the active sites for MFI supported Ga catalysts with moderate acidity, reporting an optimal Ga/Al ratio of 0.5, which enhanced the dehydrogenation rate."
[11] "DFT calculations indicated that the generated LewisBrnsted acid pair is much more active than an isolated Ga+, due to the large increase in Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the BAS, which facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation."
[12] "The BAS also significantly reduces the activation barrier for H2 elimination by recombination with a hydride."

1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the fall in propane price resulting from the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. The production of renewable green propane is an emerging sector that can be used as a feedstock for PDH, satisfying many principles of green chemistry. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for PDH to be considered a viable process in the future.
2.The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Historically, a bifunctional Ga/H-ZSM-5 material was applied as a catalyst for propane aromatization. Recent research has shown that Pt-promoted Ga/γ-Al2O3 species (Pt3Ga/γ-Al2O3) are highly promising catalysts for PDH, with high activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalysts with a highly dispersed GaxPt alloy structure have also been reported to have long-term stability and unchanged propene selectivity. The preparation strategy can greatly influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts. An optimal Ga loading of 5 wt% has been established, with an initial propene yield on different supports following the trend: Ga/H-ZSM-5 > Ga/γ-Al2O3 > Ga/SBA-15 > Ga/SiO2. An optimal Ga/Al ratio of 0.5 has been reported to enhance the dehydrogenation rate. DFT calculations have indicated that the generated LewisBrnsted acid pair is much more active than an isolated Ga+, due to the large increase in Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the BAS, which facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation. The BAS also significantly reduces the activation barrier for H2 elimination by recombination with a hydride. The ongoing debate about active Ga species has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这是由于在北美发现大量页岩气储备导致丙烷价格下跌。绿色丙烷的生产是一个新兴的行业，可以作为PDH的原料，满足绿色化学的许多原则。开发活性、选择性和稳定的催化剂对于PDH在未来被视为可行的过程至关重要。
2.对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解随着时间的推移而发展。历史上，一种双功能的Ga/H-ZSM-5材料被用作丙烷芳构化的催化剂。最近的研究表明，Pt促进的Ga/γ-Al2O3物种（Pt3Ga/γ-Al2O3）是PDH的非常有前景的催化剂，具有高活性、选择性和长期稳定性。Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2催化剂具有高度分散的GaxPt合金结构，也被报道具有长期稳定性和不变的丙烯选择性。制备策略可以极大地影响Ga/SiO2催化剂的结构。已确定5 wt%的Ga负载量是最佳的，不同载体上的初始丙烯产率趋势为：Ga/H-ZSM-5 > Ga/γ-Al2O3 > Ga/SBA-15 > Ga/SiO2。已报告Ga/Al比率为0.5可以增强脱氢速率。DFT计算表明，生成的LewisBrnsted酸对比孤立的Ga+活性更高，因为Ga+被BAS质子化后Lewis酸性大幅增加，促进了异裂CH键的活化。BAS还显著降低了H2消除的活化能，通过与氢化物的重组。关于活性Ga物种的持续争论有助于我们对这些催化剂的当前了解。
