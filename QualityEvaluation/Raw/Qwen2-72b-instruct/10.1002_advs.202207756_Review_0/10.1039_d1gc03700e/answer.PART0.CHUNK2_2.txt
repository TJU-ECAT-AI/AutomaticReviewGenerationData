1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has gained significant attention due to its efficiency and potential for sustainable production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debates about the active Ga species. Early studies suggested that isolated Ga3+ ions were the active sites, while later research pointed to Ga2O3 clusters or Ga-OH species as the key components for catalytic activity. Recent findings have contributed to our current knowledge by highlighting the importance of the Ga species' dispersion and the role of the support in stabilizing the active sites. Additionally, the use of in situ spectroscopic techniques has provided insights into the dynamic nature of the Ga species during the reaction, revealing that the active sites can change over time and that the catalyst's performance can be influenced by the reaction conditions.
