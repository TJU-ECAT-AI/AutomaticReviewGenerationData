[2] "The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."
[3] "Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field and to date there are several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH) (Sattler,2 2013), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2) (Atanga,3 2018) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2) (Carrero,4 2014 and Shi,5 2018)."
[4] "The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 to identify over-arching themes and common rules for catalyst design."
[5] "We do not try to capture aspects of reaction design and engineering, which itself is a vibrant field of research."
[6] "We attempt to compare the performance of catalysts in the different sub-reactions by calculating a space time yield (STY), (measured in molC3H6 kgcat1 h1), which is based on the initial activity of the catalysts."
[7] "Additionally, we emphasise the environmental and industrial perspectives of each reaction and the prospects for industrial application."
[8] "The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation."
[9] "Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant."
[10] "This is summarised in Table 1, which compares steam cracking, MTO (from coal and natural gas) and dehydrogenation."
[11] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
[12] "Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane."
[13] "Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum and the propane production industry has responded accordingly."
[14] "The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale."
[15] "TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year."
[16] "Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year."
[17] "The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation."
[18] "While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity."
[19] "Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel16 as well as glycerol17 and other substrates.18"
[20] "With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this."
[21] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
[22] "However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield."
[23] "These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review."
[24] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
[25] "Historically, a bifunctional Ga/H-ZSM-5 material has been applied as a catalyst for the commercial process for propane aromatization, developed jointly by UOP and BP as the Cyclar Process."
[26] "More recently, the Dow FCDh process was developed which uses a PtGa based catalyst."
[27] "Gallium oxide (GaOx)-based catalysts have been the subject of intensive research as candidate catalysts and/or supports for the DDH reaction."
[28] "This is because Ga is another non-noble metallic element known to catalyse the dehydrogenation of propane, usually through oxidic, tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ species, which are considered to be active sites for CH activation."
[29] "However, several surface gallium species (e.g., Ga2O3, GaO+ and Gan+) can exist and are considered active constituents exhibiting different performance for the DDH reaction."
[30] "Furthermore, the types of surface Ga species present are dependent on the identity of the support, Ga loading, as well as the preparation method."
[31] "Numerous studies have shown that Ga2O3 dispersed on TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, H-ZSM-5, ZSM-8 and MWW zeolites display distinctly different catalytic properties for alkane dehydrogenation."
[32] "Sattler et al. reported a Pt-promoted Ga/γ-Al2O3 species (Pt3Ga/γ-Al2O3) as a highly promising catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, which showed remarkably high activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."
[33] "For catalysts containing both Ga and a low amount of Pt (0.1 wt%), the observed conversion was close to the equilibrium value, 55% at 620 C with the addition of Pt as a promoter facilitating recombination of hydrogen atoms into H2."
[34] "By modulating the support acidity further with a K-dopant, the resultant Pt3GaK/γ-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated enhanced stability, displaying a propane conversion of 31.1% and a selectivity for propene of 92.6% after approximately 150 cycles or 14 days of operation."
[35] "The authors postulated the main active site for CH activation was Ga3+ embedded within the γ-Al2O3 framework."
[36] "Further investigations by Searles et al. showed that a Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalyst, featuring a highly dispersed GaxPt alloy structure, had a long-term stability evident in unchanged propene selectivity (>99%) over the course of a 20 h DDH reaction."
[37] "Both the moderate surface acidity of the support and good dispersion of the generated gallium single-sites proved beneficial."
[38] "Additionally, the monometallic Ga3+/SiO2 catalyst also displayed minimal deactivation over a 20 h DDH reaction, retaining a high propene selectivity (94%) throughout."
[39] "A comparative approach to study the effect of the support acidity was taken by Szeto et al. through which marked differences were observed in the reactivity of silica and alumina supported Ga catalysts."
[40] "An initial conversion and selectivity of 24% and 79%, respectively, were reported for Ga/Al2O3."
[41] "The STY was 5.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 5, entry 4)."
[42] "On the other hand, the Ga/SiO2 catalyst was reported to have low activity (8% conversion initially) and moderately high selectivity to propene (90%) under identical testing conditions."
[43] "This highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate support for different active centres."
[44] "Cybulskis et al. reported that the preparation strategy could greatly influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts."
[45] "Utilizing a pH-controlled incipient-wetness impregnation method the resultant catalyst contained a high proportion of isolated Lewis acidic Ga3+ sites dispersed on SiO2, with the ability to activate hydrocarbon CH bonds with up to 99% selectivity through a non-redox pathway at 550 C."
[46] "A variety of spectroscopic characterisation methods further verified isolated four-coordinate Ga3+O centres as catalytically relevant sites in these Ga/SiO2 catalysts."
[47] "Meanwhile the Gaδ+H and Gaδ+O species, which were identified as spectators, remained stable in inert and reductive atmospheres from room temperature to 550 C, before reversibly decomposing in the presence of C3H6 under reaction conditions to regenerate the Lewis acidic Ga3+O centres."
[48] "Other supports (H-ZSM-5, SBA-15, γ-Al2O3 and SiO2) and the effect of Ga loading have also been investigated."
[49] "Shao et al. established an optimal Ga loading of 5 wt%, reporting an initial propene yield on different supports that followed the trend: Ga/H-ZSM-5 (48%) > Ga/γ-Al2O3 (43%) > Ga/SBA-15 (28%) > Ga/SiO2 (9%)."
[50] "This was attributed to differences in surface acidity between supports, with strong acid sites largely determining the dispersion of Ga species, as well as inducing adverse side reactions."
[51] "Zeolite supports can in principle hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules due to their unique framework and channel structure, which are beneficial to the catalytic stability."
[52] "Consequently, it was found that the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst displayed the highest initial activity but lowest stability."
[53] "Factors such as the highest specific surface area and lowest acidity were associated with the superior catalytic stability of the Ga/SBA-15 catalyst over the 30 h DDH reaction at 620 C."
[54] "Further improvements reported by Kim et al. explored the catalytic function of Ga-based catalysts supported on bulk and hierarchical MFI-type zeolites, where Ga was used in place of Al."
[55] "Catalytic testing at 600 C revealed substantial activity, selectivity and stability improvements in hierarchical Ga/MFI relative to the corresponding bulk Ga/MFI catalyst."
[56] "The authors hypothesized that the enhanced activity and selectivity of the hierarchical catalysts arose from their quasi-2D structure and lower surface acidity."
[57] "Generally, it is accepted that lowering the surface acidity can further enhance the catalytic performance of a DDH catalyst."
[58] "The addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) reduces Brnsted and increases Lewis acid sites in the preparation Ga/MFI catalysts, which resulted in improved performance."
[59] "When compared to a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, the Ga/MFI catalyst, although less selective, was more stable and retained the moderate propene selectivity over the 12 h DDH reaction."
[60] "Acidity characterization techniques confirmed a high concentration of strong Lewis acid sites and a reduction in the concentration of Brnsted acid sites in the Ga-MFI catalyst."
[61] "Schreiber et al. further verified the active sites for MFI supported Ga catalysts with moderate acidity, reporting an optimal Ga/Al ratio of 0.5, which enhanced the dehydrogenation rate."
[62] "The authors attributed high Ga/Al ratios (>0.5) with the formation of additional GaxOy clusters which negatively affected the dehydrogenation rate and thus catalytic performance."
[63] "Therefore, for Ga/MFI zeolites a synergy between Ga+ species and a Brnsted acid site (BAS) (optimised to one Ga+ per BAS) exists forming a LewisBrnsted acid pair during the dehydrogenation of propane."
[64] "DFT calculations indicated that the generated LewisBrnsted acid pair is much more active than an isolated Ga+, due to the large increase in Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the BAS, which facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation."
[65] "The BAS also significantly reduces the activation barrier for H2 elimination by recombination with a hydride."
[66] "This was in agreement with findings by Phadke et al."
[67] "Using a different approach, Raman et al. reported the synthesis of GaRh supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions."
[68] "A correlation between alloy composition and specific activity was observed with Ga125Rh exhibiting STYs of 5.0 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1."
[69] "Bauer et al. reported that an alternative liquid metal solution, Ga37Pt/Al2O3, exhibited propane conversion as low as 350 C."
[70] "The GaPt alloy melts at temperatures between 270 C and 330 C.20 At 400 C and 450 C, selectivity to propene was ca. 95% and 90%, respectively and activity was attributed to isolated Pt atoms in the supported liquid GaPt alloy."

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），作为传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解的替代方案。发现活性和选择性催化剂是开发这些目的技术的核心。丙烷脱氢的研究是一个不断增长的领域，目前有几篇关于直接脱氢（DDH）、二氧化碳软氧化（ODH-CO2）和氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）的综述文章。本文的范围是批判性地回顾DDH、ODH-CO2和ODH-O2的文献，以确定催化剂设计的总体主题和共同规则。我们不试图捕捉反应设计和工程的方面，这本身是一个充满活力的研究领域。我们试图通过计算空间时间产率（STY）（以molC3H6 kgcat1 h1为单位）来比较不同子反应中催化剂的性能，这是基于催化剂的初始活性。此外，我们强调了每个反应的环境和工业视角以及工业应用的前景。不同现有丙烯生产技术的环境和经济方面在审查基于脱氢的较新技术的可行性时是重要的考虑因素。绿色化学原则，如原子经济性、有毒化学品的使用和原料的可再生性，尤其相关。直接丙烷脱氢与SC和MTO基准相比，在绿色化学的许多原则方面令人满意：它是高度原子经济的，不使用有毒反应物（或产生有毒副产品），原则上可以利用可再生原料。然而，在实践中，只有当反应能够有效运行，具有最小的副产品和最大产量时，脱氢才是一种理想的丙烯生产方式。这些因素受催化剂选择的支配，这是当前综述的主要焦点。开发活性、选择性和稳定的催化剂对于脱氢在近期和长期未来被视为可行的过程至关重要。
2.历史上，一种双功能的Ga/H-ZSM-5材料被用作催化剂，用于由UOP和BP联合开发的商业丙烷芳构化过程，即Cyclar工艺。最近，开发了Dow FCDh工艺，使用了基于PtGa的催化剂。氧化镓（GaOx）基催化剂一直是丙烷脱氢（DDH）候选催化剂和/或支持物的密集研究主题。这是因为Ga是另一种非贵金属元素，已知通过氧化、四面体配位的Ga3+物种催化丙烷脱氢，这些物种被认为是CH活化的活性位点。然而，几种表面镓物种（例如，Ga2O3、GaO+和Gan+）可以存在，并被认为是DDH反应中表现出不同性能的活性成分。此外，表面Ga物种的类型取决于支持物的身份、Ga负载量以及制备方法。大量研究表明，分散在TiO2、MgO、Al2O3、ZrO2、H-ZSM-5、ZSM-8和MWW沸石上的Ga2O3在烷烃脱氢中显示出明显不同的催化性能。Sattler等人报道了一种Pt促进的Ga/γ-Al2O3物种（Pt3Ga/γ-Al2O3），作为丙烷脱氢的极具前景的催化剂，显示出极高的活性、选择性和长期稳定性。对于含有Ga和少量Pt（0.1 wt%）的催化剂，观察到的转化率接近平衡值，620 C时为55%，添加Pt作为促进剂有助于氢原子重组为H2。通过进一步调节支持物酸度的K掺杂剂，得到的Pt3GaK/γ-Al2O3催化剂表现出增强的稳定性，在大约150个循环或14天的操作后，丙烷转化率为31.1%，丙烯选择性为92.6%。作者推测CH活化的主活性位点是嵌入在γ-Al2O3框架中的Ga3+。Searles等人进一步研究显示，Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2催化剂具有长期稳定性，其特征是在20 h DDH反应过程中丙烯选择性（>99%）不变。支持物的适度表面酸性和生成的镓单点的良好分散性被证明是有益的。此外，单金属Ga3+/SiO2催化剂在相同的测试条件下，在20 h DDH反应中也表现出最小的失活，整个过程中保持了较高的丙烯选择性（94%）。Szeto等人采取了一种比较方法来研究支持物酸度的影响，观察到硅酸盐和氧化铝支持的Ga催化剂的反应性存在明显差异。据报道，Ga/Al2O3的初始转化率和选择性分别为24%和79%。STY为5.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。另一方面，Ga/SiO2催化剂在相同的测试条件下，初始转化率低（8%），丙烯选择性适度高（90%）。这突出了为不同的活性中心选择适当支持物的重要性。Cybulskis等人报告说，制备策略可以极大地影响Ga/SiO2催化剂的结构。利用pH控制的初始湿性浸渍方法，得到的催化剂含有大量分散在SiO2上的孤立Lewis酸性Ga3+位点，具有通过非氧化途径在550 C下活化碳氢化合物CH键的能力，选择性高达99%。各种光谱表征方法进一步验证了这些Ga/SiO2催化剂中孤立的四配位Ga3+O中心作为催化相关位点。同时，被鉴定为旁观者的Gaδ+H和Gaδ+O物种在室温至550 C的惰性和还原气氛中保持稳定，在反应条件下与C3H6存在下可逆分解，再生Lewis酸性Ga3+O中心。还研究了其他支持物（H-ZSM-5、SBA-15、γ-Al2O3和SiO2）以及Ga负载量的影响。Shao等人确定了5 wt%的最优Ga负载量，在不同支持物上报告的初始丙烯产率趋势为：Ga/H-ZSM-5（48%）> Ga/γ-Al2O3（43%）> Ga/SBA-15（28%）> Ga/SiO2（9%）。这归因于支持物之间的酸度差异，强酸位点在很大程度上决定了Ga物种的分散，以及诱导不利的副反应。沸石支持物原则上可以阻止大碳氢化合物分子的形成，因为它们独特的框架和通道结构有利于催化稳定性。因此，发现Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有最高的初始活性，但稳定性最低。与在620 C下30 h DDH反应中Ga/SBA-15催化剂的优越催化稳定性相关的因素，如最高比表面积和最低酸度。Kim等人进一步改进，研究了基于块状和分级MFI型沸石的Ga基催化剂的催化功能，其中Ga取代了Al。在600 C下进行的催化测试显示，分级Ga/MFI相对于相应的块状Ga/MFI催化剂，在活性、选择性和稳定性方面有显著改善。作者推测，分级催化剂的增强活性和选择性源于它们的准二维结构和较低的表面酸度。通常认为，降低表面酸度可以进一步提高DDH催化剂的催化性能。在制备Ga/MFI催化剂时，添加3-巯基丙基三甲氧基硅烷（MPS）减少了Brnsted酸位点，增加了Lewis酸位点，从而提高了性能。与CrOx/Al2O3催化剂相比，Ga/MFI催化剂虽然选择性较低，但稳定性更好，在12 h DDH反应中保持了适度的丙烯选择性。酸性表征技术证实了Ga-MFI催化剂中强Lewis酸位点的高浓度和Brnsted酸位点浓度的降低。Schreiber等人进一步验证了具有适度酸度的MFI支持的Ga催化剂的活性位点，报告了0.5的最优Ga/Al比，这增强了脱氢速率。作者将高Ga/Al比（>0.5）归因于额外GaxOy簇的形成，这负面影响了脱氢速率，从而影响了催化性能。因此，对于Ga/MFI沸石，Ga+物种和Brnsted酸位点（BAS）之间存在协同作用（优化为每个BAS一个Ga+），在丙烷脱氢过程中形成Lewis-Brnsted酸对。DFT计算表明，生成的Lewis-Brnsted酸对比孤立的Ga+活性更高，因为BAS对Ga+的质子化导致Lewis酸性大幅增加，促进了CH键的异裂。BAS还显著降低了氢气通过与氢化物重组消除的活化能。这与Phadke等人的发现一致。使用不同的方法，Raman等人报告了GaRh支持的催化活性液态金属溶液的合成。观察到合金组成与特定活性之间的相关性，Ga125Rh的STY为5.0 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1。Bauer等人报告说，另一种液态金属溶液Ga37Pt/Al2O3在低至350 C的温度下表现出丙烷转化。GaPt合金在270 C至330 C之间熔化。在400 C和450 C时，丙烯的选择性分别为95%和90%，活性归因于液态GaPt合金中孤立的Pt原子。
