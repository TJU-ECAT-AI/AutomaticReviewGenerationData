1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has gained increased interest due to the fall in propane price resulting from the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Historically, a bifunctional Ga/H-ZSM-5 material has been applied as a catalyst for the commercial process for propane aromatization. Recent research has shown that a Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalyst, featuring a highly dispersed GaxPt alloy structure, has long-term stability and high propene selectivity. The preparation strategy for Ga/SiO2 catalysts can greatly influence their structure. Utilizing a pH-controlled incipient-wetness impregnation method results in a catalyst with a high proportion of isolated Lewis acidic Ga3+ sites dispersed on SiO2, which can activate hydrocarbon CH bonds with up to 99% selectivity through a non-redox pathway at 550 C. Spectroscopic characterization methods have verified isolated four-coordinate Ga3+O centers as catalytically relevant sites in these Ga/SiO2 catalysts. Meanwhile, the Gaδ+H and Gaδ+O species, which were identified as spectators, remain stable in inert and reductive atmospheres from room temperature to 550 C, before reversibly decomposing in the presence of C3H6 under reaction conditions to regenerate the Lewis acidic Ga3+O centers.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），由于在北美发现了大量的页岩气储备，丙烷价格下跌，PDH引起了越来越多的兴趣。对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解随着时间的推移而演变。历史上，一种双功能的Ga/H-ZSM-5材料已被用作丙烷芳构化商业过程的催化剂。最近的研究表明，Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2催化剂，具有高度分散的GaxPt合金结构，具有长期稳定性和高丙烯选择性。Ga/SiO2催化剂的制备策略可以极大地影响其结构。利用pH控制的初始湿性浸渍方法，得到的催化剂含有大量分散在SiO2上的Lewis酸性Ga3+位点，能够在550 C下通过非氧化还原途径以高达99%的选择性激活碳氢化合物CH键。各种光谱表征方法进一步证实了这些Ga/SiO2催化剂中孤立的四配位Ga3+O中心是催化相关的位点。同时，被鉴定为旁观者的Gaδ+H和Gaδ+O物种，在室温至550 C的惰性和还原性气氛中保持稳定，在反应条件下，在C3H6的存在下可逆分解，以再生Lewis酸性Ga3+O中心。
