1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has become a major industrial process. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the identification of isolated Ga3+ species as the active sites for propylene production. However, the debate about the active Ga species continues, with some studies suggesting that Ga2O3 clusters may also play a role. Despite this, the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts remain one of the most active and selective catalysts for PDH, with high propylene yields and stability.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这已成为一个主要的工业过程。对于PDH中Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随着时间的推移而发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究发现为这些催化剂的当前知识做出了贡献，包括确定孤立的Ga3+物种是丙烯生产中的活性位点。然而，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续，一些研究表明Ga2O3簇也可能发挥作用。尽管如此，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂仍然是PDH中最活跃和最具选择性的催化剂之一，具有高丙烯产量和稳定性。
