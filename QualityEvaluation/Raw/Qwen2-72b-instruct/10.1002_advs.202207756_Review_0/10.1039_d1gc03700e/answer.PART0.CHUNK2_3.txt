1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has become a significant route for propylene production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Early studies suggested that isolated Ga3+ ions were the active sites, while later research pointed to Ga2O3 clusters or Ga-OH groups as the active species. Recent findings have contributed to our current knowledge by providing insights into the role of Ga species in the PDH reaction mechanism and the importance of the interaction between Ga and the H-ZSM-5 support. These studies have helped to clarify the active sites and reaction pathways, leading to the development of more efficient and selective PDH catalysts.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这已成为丙烯生产的重要途径。对于PDH的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随着时间的推移而发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。早期的研究表明，孤立的Ga3+离子是活性位点，而后来的研究指出Ga2O3簇或Ga-OH基团是活性物种。最近的研究发现为我们的现有知识做出了贡献，通过提供关于Ga物种在PDH反应机制中的作用以及Ga与H-ZSM-5载体之间相互作用的重要性方面的见解。这些研究有助于澄清活性位点和反应途径，从而开发出更高效和选择性的PDH催化剂。
