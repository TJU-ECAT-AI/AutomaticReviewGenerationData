1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the fall in propane price resulting from the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. The production of renewable green propane, which can be used as a feedstock for PDH, is an emerging sector that is already being operated on a large scale. Direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry, including high atom economy, no use of toxic reactants, and the potential to utilize renewable feedstocks. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the near- and long-term future.
2.The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Historically, a bifunctional Ga/H-ZSM-5 material has been applied as a catalyst for the commercial process for propane aromatization. Recent research has shown that a Pt-promoted Ga/γ-Al2O3 species (Pt3Ga/γ-Al2O3) is a highly promising catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, displaying high activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. Further investigations have demonstrated that a Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalyst, featuring a highly dispersed GaxPt alloy structure, has long-term stability with unchanged propene selectivity. The preparation strategy can greatly influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts. Studies have established an optimal Ga loading of 5 wt% for different supports, with the initial propene yield following the trend: Ga/H-ZSM-5 (48%) > Ga/γ-Al2O3 (43%) > Ga/SBA-15 (28%) > Ga/SiO2 (9%). Research has verified the active sites for MFI supported Ga catalysts with moderate acidity, reporting an optimal Ga/Al ratio of 0.5, which enhances the dehydrogenation rate. DFT calculations have indicated that the generated Lewis-Brnsted acid pair is much more active than an isolated Ga+, due to the large increase in Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site (BAS), which facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation. The BAS also significantly reduces the activation barrier for H2 elimination by recombination with a hydride.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长促使人们开发新的生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这主要是由于在北美发现大量页岩气储备导致丙烷价格下跌。绿色丙烷（也称为生物丙烷和生物液化石油气）的生产是一个新兴的领域，已经在大规模运营。直接丙烷脱氢在绿色化学方面满足了许多原则，与SC和MTO基准相比，它具有高原子经济性，不使用有毒反应物（或不产生有毒副产品），并且原则上可以利用可再生原料。开发活性、选择性和稳定的催化剂对于脱氢在近期和长期未来被视为可行的过程至关重要。
2.对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解随着时间的推移而发展。历史上，一种双功能Ga/H-ZSM-5材料已被用作丙烷芳构化商业过程的催化剂，该过程由UOP和BP联合开发。最近的研究表明，Pt促进的Ga/γ-Al2O3物种（Pt3Ga/γ-Al2O3）是丙烷脱氢的极具前景的催化剂，显示出高活性、选择性和长期稳定性。进一步的研究表明，Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2催化剂，具有高度分散的GaxPt合金结构，在20小时的DDH反应中表现出不变的丙烯选择性（>99%）的长期稳定性。Cybulskis等人报告说，制备策略可以极大地影响Ga/SiO2催化剂的结构。研究表明，不同载体的最优Ga负载量为5 wt%，初始丙烯产率的趋势为：Ga/H-ZSM-5（48%）> Ga/γ-Al2O3（43%）> Ga/SBA-15（28%）> Ga/SiO2（9%）。Schreiber等人进一步验证了具有适度酸性的MFI支撑Ga催化剂的活性位点，报告了0.5的最优Ga/Al比，这增强了脱氢速率。DFT计算表明，生成的Lewis-Brnsted酸对比孤立的Ga+更活跃，这是由于BAS对Ga+的质子化导致Lewis酸性大幅增加，从而促进了杂裂CH键的活化。BAS还显著降低了H2消除的活化能垒，通过与氢化物的重组。
