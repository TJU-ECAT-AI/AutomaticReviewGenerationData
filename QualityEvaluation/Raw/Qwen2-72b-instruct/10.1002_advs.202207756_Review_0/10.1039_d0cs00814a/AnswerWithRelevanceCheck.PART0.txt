          [1] "The active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs.102 The [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolyti- cally activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1. This LewisBrnsted acid pair turned out to be far more active than an isolated Ga+, which can be attributed to the increasing Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site which promotes heterolytic CH bond activation (Fig. 18h). Besides, the Brnsted acid site prominently detruncates the activation barrier for H2 elimina- tion which is considerably high for the isolated Ga+ because the proton originates from an alkyl CH bond with the simulta- neous elimination of propene."
          [1] "Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene,propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
          [2] "In the past few years, increasing technologies for propylene production have been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the FischerTropsch-to-olefins process."
          [3] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."
          [4] "The development of dehydrogenation technologies and catalysts urge us to review the progress in recent years."

          [4] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

          [8] "The high activity of b-Ga2O3 is due to its monoclinic structure, where Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron, which can provide a large number of weak acid sites."
          [9] "Recently, Sattler et al. reported trace Pt modified GaOx as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. They found that the promoter of Pt helps in facilitating hydrogen desorption and recovering the gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species."
          [1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products.1 Conventional propylene pro- duction processes involve fluid catalytic cracking, and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, with the rapid consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands. Therefore,the development of highly efficient propylene production technologies is of vital importance, both scientifically and economically.2 In the past few years, increasing technologies for propylene production have been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the FischerTropsch-to-olefins process (Fig. 1a and b). Especially, PDH technology is considered to Cite this: Chem. Soc.

          [2] "In addition to metals and metal oxides, the modern green chemical industry has made urgent and strict demands for environmentally and economically friendly catalysts, which has seriously restricted the large scale applications of conventional metal-based catalysts, especially pre- cious metal and toxic metal oxides. Alternative carbon-based materials and carbides and nitrides have been investigated widely."
          [3] "Although it is generally accepted that numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydro- genation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective. In the propane dehydrogenation system, it is of vital importance to understand the relationship between active-site motifs and unique catalytic behaviors,including dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechan- isms, which can shine a light on precise catalyst design. In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deac- tivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."

          The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has received extensive attention in recent years. The Dow Chemical Company forecasted that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035. The development of dehydrogenation technologies and catalysts has been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the FischerTropsch-to-olefins process. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over the years. The active sites of Ga have been debated and strongly affected by the types of supports, preparation methods, and loading amounts. Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. Recently, Sattler et al. reported trace Pt modified GaOx as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. DFT calculations predict that Zrcus cations in the lattice of ZrO2 lower the activation barrier of H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8 by 0.76 eV in comparison with their saturated counterparts. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the rapid consumption of fossil energy and the inability of traditional propylene production methods to meet increasing demands. PDH technology is considered a promising method for propylene production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about active Ga species. DFT calculations have shown that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 involves the loss of hydrogen to form hydroxyl groups, but the desorption step of adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3. Efforts to improve the activity of GaOx-based catalysts have included doping to increase the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, and the use of trace Pt as a promoter to facilitate hydrogen desorption and recover gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species. H2 pretreatment can also promote the formation of more active GaH species. However, GaOx-based catalysts suffer from significant sintering during continuous regeneration operations, so controlled regeneration is desired to recover their performance. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has identified [GaH]2+ ions together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site as the active sites in the case of Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites. This has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.
