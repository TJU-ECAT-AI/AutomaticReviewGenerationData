1.The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has received extensive attention in recent years. The Dow Chemical Company forecasted that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035. The development of dehydrogenation technologies and catalysts has been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the FischerTropsch-to-olefins process.
2.The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over the years. The active sites of Ga have been debated and strongly affected by the types of supports, preparation methods, and loading amounts. Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. Recently, Sattler et al. reported trace Pt modified GaOx as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. DFT calculations predict that Zrcus cations in the lattice of ZrO2 lower the activation barrier of H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8 by 0.76 eV in comparison with their saturated counterparts.

1.丙烯是庞大的石化产品的重要组成部分，包括聚丙烯、丙烯氧化物、丙烯腈等。近年来，丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为一种直接生产丙烯的工业技术，受到了广泛关注。道化学公司2016年发布预测，到2035年，丙烯需求将以每年2%至3%的平均速度增长，预计2016年至2035年间将超过生产能力。脱氢技术的发展和催化剂的开发促使我们回顾近年来的进展。
2.多年来，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH反应中得到了研究。然而，镓的活性位点一直存在争议，受载体类型、制备方法和负载量的强烈影响。研究表明，Ga2O3的活性位点是未配位Ga3+提供的路易斯酸位点。最近，Sattler等人报道了微量Pt改性的GaOx作为丙烷脱氢的有效催化剂。DFT计算预测，与饱和对应物（2 eV与1.24 eV）相比，ZrO2晶格中的Zrcus阳离子降低了H2和C3H6从C3H8形成时的活化能垒0.76 eV。
