1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is an industrial technology for direct propylene production. Despite the progress in dehydrogenation technologies, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging. The challenges and perspectives of PDH over heterogeneous catalysts are also proposed for further development.
2.The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. The DFT calculation on Ga2O3(100) shows that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 is first caused by the loss of one hydrogen of the propane molecule to form a propyl group and a hydroxyl group, and then the removal of b-H to form another hydroxyl group. However, the difficulty of the desorption step of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3. Recent research has shown that trace Pt modified GaOx can be used as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The promoter of Pt helps in facilitating hydrogen desorption and recovering the gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species. In addition, H2 pretreatment can promote the formation of GaH species, which are more active than H+ sites and Ga+ sites.

1.丙烯是包括聚丙烯、丙烯氧化物、丙烯腈等在内的大量石化产品的重要组成部分。近年来，丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为一种直接生产丙烯的工业技术，受到了广泛关注。
2.尽管脱氢技术取得了进展，但在异质催化剂表面有效吸附/活化丙烷并随后脱附丙烯仍然存在科学挑战。关于异质催化剂上的PDH，也提出了进一步发展的挑战和前景。
3.Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂对PDH的理解随时间而发展。DFT计算表明，丙烷在Ga2O3(100)表面的活化首先是由丙烷分子失去一个氢原子形成丙基和羟基引起的，然后是b-H的去除形成另一个羟基。然而，吸附氢原子的脱附步骤的难度限制了Ga2O3的活性。最近的研究表明，微量Pt改性的GaOx可用作丙烷脱氢的有效催化剂。Pt促进剂有助于促进氢脱附和恢复镓氢化物和/或氢氧化物物种。此外，H2预处理可以促进GaH物种的形成，这些物种比H+位点和Ga+位点更活跃。
