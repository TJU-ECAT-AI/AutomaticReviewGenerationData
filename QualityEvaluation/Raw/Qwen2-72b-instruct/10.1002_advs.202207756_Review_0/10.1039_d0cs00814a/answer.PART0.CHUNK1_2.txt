[1] "The active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs."
[2] "The [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolyti- cally activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1."
[3] "This LewisBrnsted acid pair turned out to be far more active than an isolated Ga+, which can be attributed to the increasing Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site which promotes heterolytic CH bond activation."

1.The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has identified that the active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice are Lewis-Brnsted acid pairs. The [GaH]2+ ion, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolytically activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier. This Lewis-Brnsted acid pair is found to be far more active than an isolated Ga+, due to the increasing Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site, which promotes heterolytic CH bond activation.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用，人们对活性Ga物种的理解一直在发展，存在持续的争论。最近的研究发现，在Ga/H-ZSM-5中，含有中等数量的四面体铝的晶格中的PDH活性位点是Lewis-Brnsted酸对。[GaH]2+离子与Brnsted酸位点的基本框架氧一起，以非常低的内在焓垒异裂活化丙烷CH键。这种Lewis-Brnsted酸对的活性远高于孤立的Ga+，这是由于Ga+被Brnsted酸位点质子化后Lewis酸性增强，促进了CH键的异裂活化。
