[1] "The main forms of deactivation are shown in Fig. 12a."
[2] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability:73 kd = (ln[(1  Xfinal)/Xfinal]  ln[(1  Xinitial)/Xinitial])/t (6) where Xinitial represents the conversion measured in the initial period, Xfinal represents the conversion measured in the final period of an experiment, and t is the reaction time (h). kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
[3] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
[4] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the cata- lytic performance."
[5] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
[6] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports,metals and treatments (Fig. 12b)."
[7] "In the following sections, we Fig. 12 The deactivation and inhibition strategies over Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts."
[8] "The main deactivation phenomena are shown."
[9] "The approaches for inhibiting deactivation are shown and divided after the different modification stages of supports, metal particles and treatment."
[10] "3.1.3.1 Coke formation"
[11] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke.133,134 Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
[12] "As shown above,the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsatu- rated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
[13] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations.134 Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
[14] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
[15] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classi- fied into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
[16] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
[17] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
[18] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure.133 Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
[19] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
[20] "Additionally, tuning the supports acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
[21] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
[22] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
[23] "3.1.3.1.2 Geometric separation."
[24] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
[25] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH.44 The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
[26] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke (Fig. 13a and b)."
[27] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC inter- actions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
[28] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%.45,135 In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH).136"
[29] "3.1.3.1.3 Electron richness."
[30] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
[31] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogena- tion and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
[32] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS) (Fig. 13c),42 alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates,which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
[33] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics,and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
[34] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 13d).42 In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity,which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to Pt atoms.72"
[35] "3.1.3.1.4 Poisoning acid sites."
[36] "In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules."
[37] "Another approach has been the use of non-acidic supports that lead to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports."
[38] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area,outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
[39] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation;therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
[40] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support (Fig. 13e), where the samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity (Fig. 13f),137 because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
[41] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
[42] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021 Chem. Soc. Rev., 2021, 50, 33153354  3335 Chem Soc Rev Review Article Published on 25 January 2021. Downloaded by University of California - Santa Barbara on 5/16/2021 10:10:53 PM."
[43] "View Article Online and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
[44] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
[45] "3.1.3.1.5 Co-feeding streams."
[46] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2,can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
[47] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy- drogenated coke precursors on the surface (Fig. 13g).138 More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio (Fig. 13h)."
[48] "Several explanations are suggested:(i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
[49] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method,where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts.139"
[50] "3.1.3.1.6 Enhancing oxygen mobility."
[51] "The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."
[52] "As one of the most significant rare earth oxides, ceria has been widely employed."
[53] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced.140 DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
[54] "3.1.3.1.7 Coke transfer."
[55] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
[56] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent (Fig. 13i)."
[57] "Consequentially, the coke amount was signifi- cantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show.72 Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
[58] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
[59] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
[60] "3.1.3.2 Catalyst sintering"
[61] "3.1.3.2.1 Sintering mechanism."
[62] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
[63] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
[64] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
[65] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering,which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
[66] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller parti- cles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow.141 Fig. 13 Anti-coking strategies over Pt-based catalysts."

[107] "The decrease in exposed surface Pt should be caused by the formation of PtSn interactions in a scenario in which partially reduced Sn species interact with the external surfaces of the Pt clusters."
[108] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@ MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
[109] "3.1.3.3 Other deactivation."
[110] "Regenerating catalysts under oxi- dizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
[111] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural trans- formation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles.144 Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface.63 However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
[112] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
[113] "Although many efforts have been made,further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."

1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the identification of [GaH]2+ ions together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site as the active sites in the case of Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites. The [GaH]2+ ions, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolytically activate a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1. This LewisBrnsted acid pair turned out to be far more active than an isolated Ga+, which can be attributed to the increasing Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site which promotes heterolytic CH bond activation.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随着时间的推移而演变，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究发现为这些催化剂的当前知识做出了贡献，包括在ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种的情况下，[GaH]2+离子与Brnsted-酸位点的基本框架氧一起被鉴定为活性位点。[GaH]2+离子与Brnsted-酸位点的基本框架氧一起，以非常低的内在焓垒(56 kJ mol1)异裂活化丙烷CH键。这种Lewis-Brnsted酸对比孤立的Ga+更活跃，这可以归因于Brnsted酸位点对Ga+的质子化导致的Lewis酸性增加，从而促进了异裂CH键的活化。
