[1] "Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene,propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
[2] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."
[3] "In the past few years, increasing technologies for propylene production have been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the FischerTropsch-to-olefins process."
[4] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
[5] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
[6] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been studied for PDH reaction for years. However, the active sites of Ga have been debated and strongly affected by the types of supports, preparation methods, and loading amounts."
[7] "Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+."
[8] "The high activity of b-Ga2O3 is due to its monoclinic structure, where Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron, which can provide a large number of weak acid sites."
[9] "Recently, Sattler et al. reported trace Pt modified GaOx as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. They found that the promoter of Pt helps in facilitating hydrogen desorption and recovering the gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species."

1.The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as it is considered one of the most promising methods for direct propylene production. The Dow Chemical Company forecasted that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035. PDH technology has received extensive attention in recent years due to its ability to produce only propylene, not a hybrid product, and the development of hydraulic fracturing technology has made the feedstock cheaper and plentiful.
2.The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over the years, with ongoing debate about active Ga species. Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+, and the high activity of b-Ga2O3 is due to its monoclinic structure, where Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron, which can provide a large number of weak acid sites. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the finding that trace Pt modified GaOx can be an efficient catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, with the promoter of Pt helping in facilitating hydrogen desorption and recovering the gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)，因为它被认为是直接生产丙烯最有前景的方法之一。陶氏化学公司预测，到2035年，丙烯需求将以每年2%至3%的平均速度增长，预计2016年至2035年间需求将超过生产能力。近年来，PDH技术因其仅生产丙烯而非混合产品的能力而受到广泛关注，而水力压裂技术的发展使原料更便宜、更丰富。
2.对于PDH，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解多年来一直在发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。研究表明，Ga2O3的活性位点是通过不饱和Ga3+提供的路易斯酸位点，而b-Ga2O3的高活性是由于其单斜结构，其中Ga3+离子均匀分布在八面体和四面体上，可以提供大量的弱酸位点。最近的研究发现为这些催化剂的当前知识做出了贡献，包括发现微量Pt改性的GaOx可以作为丙烷脱氢的有效催化剂，Pt促进剂有助于促进氢解吸和恢复镓氢化物和/或氢氧化物物种。
