1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has identified [GaH]2+ ions together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site as the active sites in the case of Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites. This has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)，作为传统蒸汽裂解的替代方法。对于PDH中Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随着时间的推移而发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究已经确定了在ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种的情况下，[GaH]2+离子与Brnsted酸位点的基本框架氧一起作为活性位点。这为当前对这些催化剂的理解做出了贡献。
