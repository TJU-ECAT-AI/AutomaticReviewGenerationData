[1] "The active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs.102 The [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolyti- cally activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1. This LewisBrnsted acid pair turned out to be far more active than an isolated Ga+, which can be attributed to the increasing Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site which promotes heterolytic CH bond activation (Fig. 18h). Besides, the Brnsted acid site prominently detruncates the activation barrier for H2 elimina- tion which is considerably high for the isolated Ga+ because the proton originates from an alkyl CH bond with the simulta- neous elimination of propene."

1.The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved to identify Lewis-Brnsted acid pairs as the active sites, specifically the [GaH]2+ ion paired with a basic framework oxygen from the Brnsted-acid site. This pair heterolytically activates a propane CH bond with a low enthalpy barrier, making it more active than isolated Ga+. The Brnsted acid site also significantly lowers the barrier for H2 elimination.

1.对于PDH反应，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解已经发展到识别Lewis-Brnsted酸对作为活性位点，特别是[GaH]2+离子与来自Brnsted酸位点的基本骨架氧配对。这对异裂活化丙烷CH键具有低焓垒，使其比孤立的Ga+更活跃。Brnsted酸位点还显著降低了H2消除的能垒。
