Introduction The catalytic dehydrogenation of short-chain hydrocarbons such as light alkanes is an effective way to increase the value of light alkane streams from fossil-based sources.
Dehydrogenation is of renewed interest due to the large availability of new feed- stocks derived from hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations [1].
Among this family of reactions,propane dehydrogenation
(PDH)
is of particular interest,since propylene is a crucial feedstock for polymer production [2].
Total propylene consumption was 83 mil- lion tons in 2013 and the global demand is forecast to grow at a
CAGR
of
4.8%
during 20132018 [3].
Oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH)
of propane is an alternate way to produce propylene.
In this scenario,an oxidative gas
(O2
or
CO2)
is co-fed with propane.
This process has several advan- tages,such as being exothermic and offering no thermodynamic limitations.
However,this approach is faced with problematic Corresponding author.

The most extensively studied catalysts involve Mo/V/Ce based oxides [47].
An array of alternate catalysts also continue to be explored,such as metallic alloy (i.e., CuAl) catalysts [8] and intermetallic (i.e., CuSn, CuFeAl) fibers [9].
Several reviews focus on discussing
ODH
approaches in detail [1012].
Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited process that requires relatively high tempera- ture and low pressure conditions to obtain a high yield of propylene.
The main issues associated with
PDH
under such conditions are undesired thermal cracking of the feedstock and products (produc- ing short-chain hydrocarbons) as well as coke formation,which blocks active sites and causes rapid catalyst deactivation [13].
Currently,commercial industrial
PDH
processes are based on Cr [14,15] (CATOFIN from
CB&I
Lummus) and Ptcatalysts [1618] (Oleflex from
UOP)
catalysts.
However,these catalytic systems are impacted by rapid deactivation due to coke formation and com- petitive
C
C
bond cracking,which causes loss of propylene yield.
Hence,a periodic catalyst regeneration step is important in the above-mentioned industrial operations [19].
Many efforts have been made in improving the catalytic performance,including the addition of a second metal such as Sn, In,or Ga into Pt-based catalysts [2030],or the modification of Cr-catalysts with alkali http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apcata.2015.03.020

Meanwhile,other parallel investigations were devoted to systems involving MoOx [35], VOx [36,37],and Zn2+ [38].
However,improved
PDH
catalysts are continuously sought.
Recently,
PDH
catalysts involving group
IIIA
metal oxides have attracted attention.
It has been reported that supported Ga2O3 and bulk Ga2O3 show promising catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation [3941]. However,the nature of the active site in Ga2O3 is still unclear,in part because of its structural complex- ity and the co-existence of several polymorphs of Ga2O3 in mixed oxide materials.
Also,the reducibility of Ga2O3 strongly depends on its interaction with the support material as well as the potential presence of metals such as Pt [42] and Pd [43].
A
proposed reaction mechanism involves heterolytic dissociation,in which Hadsorbs on a Ga+ site (gallium hydride) and a C3H7+ carbocation bonds with a neighboring
O
atom to form a gallium alkoxide [44].
Supported In2O3 as a catalyst in presence of weak oxidative gases (i.e.,
CO2,
N2O)
was also investigated,and was found to be of interest as a potential new
PDH
catalyst [4548].
The authors proposed that reduced metallic indium at the catalyst surface was the active site due to observation of an induction period.
However,to the best of our knowledge,there are no reports investigating binary In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxide catalysts for
PDH.
Since each single oxide component exhibited some activity,we hypothesized that the mixed InGa oxide catalysts could show interesting
PDH
properties different from the two individual oxide catalysts.
To this end,in this work we have prepared a series of mixed InGa oxides and evaluated them in detail for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane.
The structural properties of these mixed-oxide catalysts were also elucidated via charac- terization by a range of techniques including X-ray diffraction
(XRD),
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS),
X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS),
N2-physisorption,temperature-programmed desorption
(TPD)
of
NH3,
temperature-programmed reduction
(TPR)
with
H2,
and elemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy
(ICP-OES).
The deposited carbonaceous species were examined by thermogravimetric anal- ysis
(TGA)
and Raman spectroscopy.
The resulting mixed-metal oxides exhibit a considerably higher activity in terms of propane conversion than previously reported mixed In2O3Al2O3,as well as compared to -Ga2O3,on both a catalyst mass basis and surface area basis.
The origin of this behavior is discussed.

Experimental
2.1.
Catalyst preparation
A
series of binary In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxides was synthesized by an alcoholic co-precipitation method [49].
In a typical syn- thesis,specific amounts of the indium and gallium precursors (nitrate hydrate, SigmaAldrich,
99.9%)
at different molar ratios were dissolved in ethanol (Alfa-Aesar,95%).
Then,a mixture con- taining concentrated aqueous ammonia (SigmaAldrich,28 wt%) and ethanol (1:1 in volume) was added dropwise to the precursor solution until no further precipitation occurred (pH
8.5).
After aging for 1 h while stirring at 250 rpm at room temperature,the mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 6000 rpm.
Then the recov- ered,precipitated gel was dried at
70 C
overnight.
Finally,the obtained sample was calcined in air at
600 C
for 6 h.
The result- ing InGa binary oxides are labeled as IGx-y,where x and y denote the molar ratio of In2O3/Ga2O3 in the catalyst (e.g.,
IG10-90
denotes a material with In and Ga in a
10:90
ratio).
2.2.
Catalyst characterization N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms were measured with a Tristar
II
3020 apparatus from Micromeritics.
The samples were degassed and preheated at
110 C
under vacuum on a Schlenk line for 12 h before the measurements.
The specific surface area (by the
BET
method),pore volume (by T-plot method),and the average pore size (by the
BJH
method) were obtained with the software of the apparatus.
Elemental analysis for indium and gallium within the catalysts was performed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy
(ICP-OES)
by
ALS
Global.
X-ray diffraction
(XRD)
measurements were performed on a PANalytical Xpert Pro X-ray diffractometer operating with Ni- filtered Cu
K
radiation (0.154187 nm),with generator settings of 45 kV,40 mA,a scanning step size of
0.008,
and scanning regions of
6802.
The reducibility of catalysts was assessed with H2 temperature- programmed reduction
(H2-TPR)
in a flow-type fixed bed reactor using an Autochem
II
Chemisorption Analyzer from Micromerit- ics.
A
mixture of 10 vol% H2/Ar was used as the reducing gas with a total flow rate of 30 sccm.
About 100 mg sample was heated from room temperature to
900 C
at a heating rate of 5 C/min after being pretreated at
150 C
for 1 h in Ar gas flow (50 sccm).
The reducing gas was cooled by a cold trap filled with a mixture of acetone and liquid nitrogen to remove the water generated from reduction of catalyst.
The reduc- tion signal was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector
(TCD).
The surface acidity was assessed by temperature-programmed desorption of
NH3 (NH3-TPD)
at ambient pressure with the above-mentioned equipment.
About 100 mg  sample was pre- heated to
500 C
with a ramp of 10 C/min and maintained for 1 h,followed by cooling to
120 C
under He flow (25 sccm).
Then sufficient
NH3 (5
vol% in He,30 sccm,2 h) was injected until a saturated sample was obtained,followed by purging with He (25 sccm) for 1 h.
After obtaining a stable baseline,the sample was heated to
700 C
at a rate of 10 C/min.
The des- orbed NH3 was detected by a thermal conductivity detector
(TCD).
Raman spectroscopy was performed using a Thermo Nico- let Almega
XR
Dispersive Raman Spectrometer,equipped with confocal optics before the spectrometer entrance,and a
CCD
detec- tor.
A
microscope was used to focus the excitation laser beam (488 nm) with a laser power of 15 mW on the sample and to collect the Raman signal in the backscattered direction.
The acquisition time was 30 s and 30 spectra were recorded for each sample.
Moreover,each sample was analyzed by collecting data at 35 points to eliminate the effects of the heterogeneity of the sample.
Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA)
was carried out by using Net- zsch
STA
409
TGA-DSC.
About 30 mg  sample was loaded in a pan.
Then it was heated from
20 C
to
900 C
in air with flow rate of 90 mL/min.
XPS
analysis was carried out using Thermo K-Alpha spectrom- eter employing a monochromatic Al
K
X-ray source.
Pressures near 5 × 108 Torr were observed in the analytical chamber dur- ing surface analysis.
