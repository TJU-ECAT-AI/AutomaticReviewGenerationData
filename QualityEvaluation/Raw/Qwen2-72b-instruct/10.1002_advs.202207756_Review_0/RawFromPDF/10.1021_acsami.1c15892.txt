Abstract
Propane nonoxidative dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising route to produce propylene with the development of shale gas exploration technology. Co-based catalysts with low cost and low toxicity could activate C–H effectively, but they suffer from deactivation with coke formation. In this work, a catalyst formed by incorporating highly dispersed Co sites into a Silicalite-1 zeolite framework (Co-Silicalite-1) is synthesized by a hydrothermal protocol in the presence of ammonia, which exhibits superior propane dehydrogenation catalytic performance with 0.0946 mmol C3H6·s–1·gCo–1 and propylene selectivity higher than 98.5%. It also shows outstanding catalytic stability and coking resistance in a 3560 min time-on-stream. Combined characterization results demonstrate that the tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ site serves as the PDH catalytic active site, which is stabilized by Si–O units of the zeolite framework. Incorporation of Co sites into the zeolite framework could avoid the reduction of Co species to metallic Co. Moreover, the catalytic performance is improved by the enhanced propane adsorption and propylene desorption.

1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important raw chemicals for the production of polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, propylene epoxide, and acrylic acid. (1−3) Traditional propylene production routes including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, however, could not meet the increasing demand for propylene. In recent years, more and more technologies for propylene production have been widely investigated, such as propane dehydrogenation, methanol-to-olefin (MTO), Fischer–Tropsch-to-olefin (FTO), and olefin cracking processes (OCPs). (4,5) Especially, accompanied by the cheap and abundant propane feedstock based on the development of shale gas exploration technology, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most promising processes to manufacture propylene. Correspondingly, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene via oxidative or nonoxidative routes is attracting more and more attention.
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane has been the subject of intensive research efforts owing to its high single-pass conversion of propane and the suppression of catalyst coking. Recently, hexagonal boron nitride (2,6) and borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) (7) have been reported to show superior propane oxidative dehydrogenation catalytic performance with high propylene selectivity and low CO2 formation. Nevertheless, the highly exothermic nature of the ODH process also brings about great challenges in heat recovery and process safety control. On the other hand, propane nonoxidative dehydrogenation (PDH) could avoid most of the issues associated with ODH. Conventional PDH catalysts, such as supported Pt (8−12) and Cr-based (13−16) catalysts, have been mostly investigated with highly catalytic performance. However, owing to the high cost, easy agglomeration of Pt, and the environmentally unfriendly nature of Cr catalysts, earth-abundant and environmentally friendly metal/metal oxides (M/MOx, M = V, Ga, Zr, In, Zn, Fe, Mo, and Co), (16−29) carbon materials, (30,31) transition-metal carbides, (32,33) and nitrides (2) are subsequently widely investigated since they achieve much lower propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and catalytic stability for PDH. Hence, it is urgent to develop highly active, selective as well as coke-resistant PDH catalysts.
Due to its earth abundance and low toxicity, Co-based catalysts have been studied to activate C–H effectively. (29,34) Subsequently, Co/SiO2, (28,35,36) (28,35,36) CoAl2O4, (37) and Co/ZSM-5 (38,39) have been investigated over PDH correspondingly. Tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species on oxide supports acting as Lewis acidic sites are proposed as corresponding PDH active sites, (37) while metallic Co0 species could be responsible for the cracking of C3H8 to C2H4, CH4, and coke. Recently, γ-Al2O3 sheet-stabilized isolated Co2+  (26) and Co confined Si-β (27) have been reported for PDH with high performance. Isolated tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ sites and metallic Co particles are considered to be the corresponding PDH active sites, respectively. Nevertheless, the corresponding propane conversion reduced to ∼80% of the initial activity after several hours of catalysis on stream, while the propylene selectivity was around 92–97%. Further thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of the spent catalyst demonstrates the existence of coke. The corresponding catalytic performance is even worse in the case of the catalyst with supported Co nanoparticles, which is due to the reduction of the CoOx nanoparticles/cluster to form unstable metallic Co0 species. Metallic Co0 could be further transformed to CoCx, which could facilitate coke formation. Therefore, it is still necessary to develop a Co-based catalyst for PDH with high activity and better stability.
Zeolites have been studied as excellent supports to stabilize transition-metal active sites for their unique pore structure, high adsorption capacity, and strong acid sites. (40,41) Hence, it is worthwhile considering whether Co active sites could be stabilized by combining with Si–O units of the zeolite framework to form Si–O–Co units.
In this work, highly dispersed Co sites are incorporated into the Silicalite-1 zeolite framework (named Co-Silicalite-1) successfully with the assistance of NH3·H2O via facile hydrothermal synthesis. The incorporation of Co into the zeolite framework suppresses the reduction and carbonization of CoOx species, resulting in the highly stable Co active sites. The application of NH3 during the hydrothermal synthesis process would facilitate Co sites to implant into the zeolite framework. Compared with catalysts harvested from the traditional hydrothermal synthesis process without introducing NH3·H2O (named CoOx@Silicalite-1) and incipient wetness impregnation (named Co3O4/Silicalite-1 and Co3O4/ZSM-5), Co-Silicalite-1 exhibits superior catalytic performance with 0.0946 mmol C3H6·s–1·gCo–1 and propylene selectivity higher than 98.5% over PDH. Moreover, with Co sites implanted into the zeolite framework, the coke deposition is obviously inhibited over Co-Silicalite-1 with stable catalytic performance in 3560 min time-on-stream. The chemical state and coordination environment of Co sites have been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), nitrogen physisorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectrum (UV/vis), Raman spectrum, X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS), infrared spectrum, and X-ray absorption (XAS). The isolated, tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ site is stabilized by Si–O units (Si–O–Co) of the zeolite framework, which serves as the stable active site for PDH.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Catalyst Preparation
Co-Silicalite-1 was synthesized via regulating conventional hydrothermal synthesis with the introduction of NH3·H2O. TEOS and Co(NO3)2·6H2O were used as silicon and cobalt sources, and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (25 wt %) was used as the structure-directing agent (SDA). NH3·H2O was used as a stabilizer to combine with Co2+ and inhibit the precipitation of Co(OH)2. The starting gel with a molar composition of 1.0 SiO2:0.016 Co:0.40 TPAOH:0.096 NH3:40 H2O was crystallized in a Teflon-lined autoclave under rotation (100 rpm) at 170 °C for 4 days. The product was recovered by filtration, drying, and calcination (550 °C) to obtain Co-Silicalite-1.
For comparison, CoOx@Silicalite-1 was synthesized in a similar procedure as Co-Silicalite-1 without the introduction of NH3·H2O. Silicalite-1 was synthesized similarly without the introduction of Co species. ZSM-5 (Si/Al2O3 = 27) was purchased from Nankai University Catalyst Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China).
Co3O4/Silicalite-1 and Co3O4/ZSM-5 were prepared by the conventional incipient wetness impregnation method using aqueous solutions of Co(NO3)2·6H2O over Silicalite-1 and HZSM-5 supports, respectively. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 80 °C in air overnight and further calcined at 550 °C for 6 h in air. The calcined samples were denoted Co3O4/Silicalite-1 and Co3O4/ZSM-5.
2.2. Catalyst Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation and a nickel filter in the 2θ angle range from 5 to 80° at 35 kV and 25 mA. Inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was performed on an iCAP-7000 Plus series spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher). Nitrogen physisorption was carried out on an ASAP 2020 (Micrometrics) instrument at 77 K after outgassing the samples for 6 h under a vacuum at 300 °C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was recorded over a Hitachi S-4800 microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded by a FEI Talos F200S G2 at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV/vis) were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2400PC spectrophotometer using a BaSO4 plate as a reference. UV-Raman spectra were recorded on a UV-RAMAN100 Raman spectrometer made by Beijing Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd. A 244 nm line of a LEXEL laser of a He–Ge laser was used as the excitation source. TG analysis was conducted on an STA 449C Jupiter (NETZSCH, Germany) at the rate of 10 °C·min–1 in air for coke measurement.
XPS spectra were obtained on an ESCAlab250xi electron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with monochromatic 150 WAl Kα radiation, and the reported binding energies were calibrated against the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.
Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectra were collected under the fluorescence mode on the beamline SXRMB, Canadian Light Source. The spectrum of a Co foil was measured to calibrate the photon energy. The collected data were analyzed by the IFEFFIT software package following the standard protocol. (42)
The temperature-programmed experiments were tested on an AutoChem II 2920 instrument (Micrometrics) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. In a typical NH3-TPD experiment, 100 mg of sample was pretreated in a helium stream (30 mL·min–1) at 550 °C for 1 h. The adsorption of NH3 was carried out at 50 °C for 1 h, followed by purging with helium at 100 °C for 2 h to remove physisorbed NH3 from the catalyst surface. The TPD profile was recorded at a heating rate of 5 °C·min–1 from 100 to 550 °C. For the C3H8-TPD and C3H6-TPD, 100 mg of each sample was pretreated at 600 °C for 1 h under 30 mL·min–1 5% H2/Ar and then cooled to 50 °C; then, the sample was exposed under C3H8 or C3H6 flow (30 mL·min–1) for 30 min until saturation, followed by purging with He for 30 min to remove physisorbed C3H8 or C3H6. The temperature was then ramped to 600 °C at 10 °C·min–1 and held for 1 h until complete desorption of C3H8 or C3H6. As for H2-TPR, typically, 100 mg of the sample was pretreated in He (30 mL·min–1) at 300 °C for 60 min followed by cooling down to 50 °C; then, the sample was reduced in a flow of 10 vol % H2/Ar mixture (50 mL·min–1) from 50 to 850 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1.
The infrared (IR) spectra were collected on a Nicolet Nexus iS-50 FT-IR spectrometer at a spectral resolution of 2 cm–1. For pyridine spectra measurement (1000–4000 cm–1), it was recorded as follows: a self-supported wafer (9.6 mg·cm–1 thickness and 2 cm in diameter) was set in a quartz IR cell sealed with CaF2 windows connected with a vacuum system. After the sample was evacuated at 450 °C for 1 h, pyridine adsorption was carried out by exposing the wafer to pyridine vapor (1.3 kPa) at 25 °C for 20 min. The physisorbed and chemisorbed pyridine was then removed by evacuation at different temperatures (50–200 °C) for 0.5 h. All spectra were collected at room temperature.
2.3. Catalytic Performance Evaluation
Catalytic performance evaluation was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a quartz tubular fixed-bed reactor with 7 mm inner diameter and 63 cm length. A mixture of 100 mg of catalysts and 500 mg of quartz sand of 40–60 mesh was loaded in the reactor. The catalyst bed temperature was measured by a thermocouple centered axially inside the reactor. Before the reaction, the catalyst was pretreated with 20 mL·min–1 5% H2/Ar at 600 °C for 2 h; then, the temperature was decreased to 550 °C, and 20 mL·min–1 5% C3H8/Ar and 20 mL·min–1 5% H2/Ar were introduced. The reaction products were analyzed by an online GC-2014 (Shimazu, Japan) equipped with a FID detector to detect hydrocarbons and a TCD detector to detect hydrogen. The carbon balance calculated from the ratio of the sum of the reaction products to educts was over 97% for all catalysts tested during the reaction process. The propane conversion (conv. (C3H8)), propylene selectivity (sel. (C3H6)), propylene yield (yield (C3H6)), deactivation parameter, and turnover frequency (TOFCo) were calculated according to the following equations (4,26)

where [C3H8]in and [C3H8]out represent the propane concentration in the inlet and outlet gas flows, respectively, and [C3H6] is the propylene concentration in the outlet gas flow. Xend is the conversion at the end of the reaction, Xin is the initial conversion, nin (C3H8) is the total number of C3H8 in the feeding gases, t is the reaction time, and NCo is the number of Co atoms in the catalyst. If the coke weights to reacted C3H8 moles are calculated, the contribution of coke is less than 0.05% in all catalysts. Hence, the effect of coke over the evaluation of catalytic performance is ignored.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Characterization of Co-Based Zeolite Catalysts
Four kinds of Co-based zeolite catalysts—Co-Silicalite-1, CoOx@Silicalite-1, Co3O4/Silicalite-1, and Co3O4/ZSM-5—are prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and incipient wetness impregnation. The Co loadings over all Co-based zeolite catalysts are similar with about 1.57–1.79 wt % based on the ICP-OES results shown in Table 1. The structural differences over prepared catalysts are investigated with various characterizations as follows.

The crystal structure of all catalysts is examined by XRD, as shown in Figure 1A. The characteristic diffraction peaks of the MFI zeolite structure are observed for all catalysts, without any obvious Co3O4 diffraction peak (PDF#43-1003). It suggests that Co species are highly dispersed in the catalysts. The detailed textural properties of all of the prepared catalysts are summarized in Table 1. It is found that the BET surface areas of Co-Silicalite-1, CoOx@Silicalite-1, and Co3O4/Silicalite-1 are similar with a high surface area of ∼370 m2·g–1, which is higher than that of commercial ZSM-5 and Co3O4/ZSM-5 catalysts (∼280 m2·g–1). In addition, it is noted that all samples have a similar microporous volume (∼0.100 cm3·g–1), while the mesoporous volume of Co-Silicalite-1 (0.356 cm3·g–1) is higher than the other samples. Further N2 physisorption of an adsorption branch shows a typical type IV isotherm over Co-Silicalite-1, compared with that of other samples with an adsorption branch of type I isotherm for microporous materials (Figure 1B), which could be ascribed to the secondary particles piled pore over Co-Silicalite-1 based on the subsequent SEM characterization result in Figure 3.

The catalyst acidity is characterized by NH3-TPD, as shown in Figure 2. It could be found that ZSM-5 shows obvious desorption peaks around 220 and 420 °C, which correspond to the fact that NH3 strongly adsorbed on the weak acid sites and strong acid sites of ZSM-5 from the Brønsted acid sites of Si–O(H)–Al species, respectively. (43,44) After introducing Co to form Co3O4/ZSM-5, the corresponding intensity of 420 °C over Co3O4/ZSM-5 decreases compared with ZSM-5. Further quantitative analysis of acid sites indicates that Co3O4/ZSM-5 (0.673 mmol NH3·g–1) has lower acid sites compared with the parent ZSM-5 (0.726 mmol NH3·g–1) (Table 1), which demonstrates that the introduction of Co sites prefers to exchange the strong Brønsted acid protons of Si–O(H)–Al over ZSM-5. In addition, as for Co-Silicalite-1, CoOx@Silicalite-1, and Co3O4/Silicalite-1 catalysts, it could be found that the corresponding acid sites are rather weak compared with ZSM-5 and Co3O4/ZSM-5 due to the lack of Al sites, while the corresponding acid sites over the series of Silicalite-1 samples are on the order of Co-Silicalite-1 (0.178 mmol NH3·g–1) > Co3O4/Silicalite-1 (0.085 mmol NH3·g–1) ≫ CoOx@Silicalite-1 (0.028 mmol NH3·g–1) (Table 1); the existence of weak acid sites over Co-Silicalite-1 and Co3O4/Silicalite-1 could be in the form of Lewis acid at Co2+ sites, which is demonstrated by the Py-IR characterization result shown later.

Figure 3A–D shows the SEM images of prepared samples. It is found that Co-Silicalite-1, CoOx@Silicalite-1, and Co3O4/Silicalite-1 present a uniform size of about 150–200 nm compared with that of 100–200 nm for Co3O4/ZSM-5. Moreover, it could be found that some small particles in Co-Silicalite-1 are bulged in the surface compared with the flat surfaces of CoOx@Silicalite-1 and Co3O4/Silicalite-1; the bulged particles could further generate mesoporous volume with the secondary particles’ stacking pore correspondingly, as characterized by the N2 physisorption result shown above. Further TEM characterization result (Figure 3E,F) indicates that no obvious Co nanoparticles appear over Co-Silicalite-1 and CoOx@Silicalite-1, while obvious Co oxide nanoparticles disperse on the Co3O4/Silicalite-1 and Co3O4/ZSM-5 catalysts (Figure 3G,H), which demonstrates that Co sites over Co-Silicalite-1 and CoOx@Silicalite-1 are highly dispersive.

3.2. Catalytic Performance of PDH over Co-Based Zeolite Catalysts
Firstly, the catalytic activity at different temperatures from 500 to 650 °C for Co-Silicalite-1 is shown in Figure S1; it could be found that with the increased temperature from 500 to 650 °C, the propane conversion increases from 5.5 to 40.8% at time 0 min, while the catalytic stabilities including propane conversion and propylene selectivity at 600 and 650 °C are obviously lower than that at 500 and 550 °C during the 2 h time-on-stream, which may result from the thermal cracking of propane and the generation of coke correspondingly. Hence, the reaction temperature of 550 °C is adopted for the investigation of the PDH reaction. Figure 4 and Table 2 show the catalytic performance of PDH at 550 °C over various catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. As contrast, a blank experiment with quartz sand and Silicalite-1 zeolite shows no catalytic activity over PDH. On the other hand, CoOx@Silicalite-1 without introducing NH3 during the hydrothermal synthesis process shows a rather low propane conversion (5.5%) and propylene selectivity (77.1%). In addition, Co3O4/Silicalite-1 via conventional incipient wetness impregnation presents a propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 16.6 and 93.1%, respectively. While the propane conversion and propylene selectivity over Co-Silicalite-1 are 20.0 and 99.3%, respectively. In comparison, ZSM-5 and Co3O4/ZSM-5 were also prepared and evaluated over PDH, and it was found that the propane conversion values over ZSM-5 and Co3O4/ZSM-5 are 23.5 and 20.3%, while the corresponding propylene selectivities are 19.1 and 66.3%, respectively. The main byproducts include ethylene, ethane, and methane. The low propylene selectivity over ZSM-5 and Co3O4/ZSM-5 samples could be ascribed to the existence of strong Brønsted acid sites from Si–O(H)–Al species, which could accelerate the propane cracking to C2H4/CH4 and promote the formation of coke deposition simultaneously. To further quantify the catalytic performance of various catalysts, the corresponding specific reaction yield rate of propylene normalized by Co content is calculated, which decreases on the order of Co-Silicalite-1 (0.0946 mmol C3H6·s–1·gCo–1) > Co3O4/ZSM-5 (0.0608 mmol C3H6·s–1·gCo–1) > Co3O4/Silicalite-1 (0.0593 mmol C3H6·s–1·gCo–1) > CoOx@Silicalite-1 (0.0177 mmol C3H6·s–1·gCo–1), demonstrating the superior catalytic performance of Co-Silicalite-1 for PDH. In addition, based on further catalyst stability evaluation result with 1040 min time-on-stream, it is found that Co-Silicalite-1 has the lowest deactivation rate constant with 0.00065 h–1 in comparison with those of the other Co-based catalysts, demonstrating its superior catalytic stability for PDH.

In addition, the intrinsic catalytic activities of various catalysts and apparent activation energies (45) over PDH are evaluated in a kinetic-controlled regime (propane conversion < 20%) via regulating the space velocity between 500 and 600 °C, as shown in Figure 5. The absence of heat and external mass transfer limitations is confirmed by combining the Mears criterion calculation and changing gas flow rates but constant contact time (constant W/F ratio) experimentally (Figure S2A,B and Table S1). Moreover, internal mass transfer limitations can be neglected because the estimated Thiele modulus is significantly less than 1 and has different catalyst particles experimentally (Table S2 and Figure S2C). (33,46) In addition, assuming that all cobalt atoms are active sites, the TOF of Co-Silicalilite-1 at 550 °C is the highest with 21.0 h–1 over all of the catalysts (Figure 5A), demonstrating the best catalytic performance of Co-Silicalilite-1 among all tested catalysts. On the other hand, the corresponding apparent activation energy (Ea) is provided in Figure 5B, and it could be found that the apparent activation energy (Ea) of the Co-Silicalite-1 catalyst is 146.8 kJ·mol–1, which is lower than that of Co3O4/Silicalite-1 (164.6 kJ·mol–1) and CoOx@Silicalite-1 (186.4 kJ·mol–1). It is also noted that the Ea of Co-Silicalite-1 is higher than that of Co3O4/ZSM-5 (126.2 kJ·mol–1), which could be explained by the combined effect of cracking strong acid sites and dehydrogenation of Co sites over Co3O4/ZSM-5, leading to easier activation of propane. The Ea of Co-Silicalite-1 is lower than that of the previously reported Co/Al2O3-HT catalyst. (26)

3.3. Nature of Co Active Sites
To reveal the nature of improved catalytic performance of Co-Silicalite-1, various characterizations are employed to investigate the corresponding Co active sites over various Co-based zeolite catalysts. First, the redox properties of all catalysts are investigated by H2-TPR, as shown in Figure 6A. No obvious H2 reduction signal is observed on the fresh Co-Silicalite-1 catalyst even when the temperature is increased to 850 °C, suggesting that the Co site is difficult to be reduced. It could be ascribed to the incorporation of Co sites into the zeolite framework, which results in the generation of Si–O–Co groups to stabilize Co sites from being reduced. On the other hand, as for CoOx@Silicalite-1, Co3O4/Silicalite-1, and Co3O4/ZSM-5, obvious H2 reduction bands are observed at 733, 326, and 460 °C, respectively, which could be ascribed to the reduction of CoOx species correspondingly. (38,47) The higher reduction temperature over CoOx@Silicalite-1 and Co3O4/ZSM-5 compared with Co3O4/Silicalite-1 could be explained by the encapsulation of CoOx species inside the CoOx@Silicalite-1 pore and the stronger interaction between Co sites and Brønsted acid sites of Si–O(H)–Al over Co3O4/ZSM-5, respectively, making the corresponding CoOx species more difficult to be reduced.

UV–vis and UV-Raman spectra are further used to investigate the nature of Co species in Co-zeolite samples, and corresponding characterization results are shown in Figure 6B,C. In the UV–vis profiles of Figure 6B, ZSM-5 shows obvious adsorption bands at about 210 and 280 nm, similar to the UV–vis spectrum of Silicalite-1 (Figure S3), corresponding to the structure of MFI. (48) After introducing Co sites, the MFI characteristic band at 280 nm is blue-shifted to 260 nm over all of the Co-zeolite samples. As for Co-Silicalite-1, it is noted that the absorption bands at approximately 520, 590, and 650 nm appear, which are ascribed to the ν3 (4A2 → 4T1(P)) transition characteristic of the pseudo-tetrahedral Co2+ species, indicating the existence of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ in the zeolite framework. (26,27,49−53) Nevertheless, as for Co3O4/Silicalite-1, a weak peak at 520 nm is observed, indicating that merely part of the Co2+ species exists over Co3O4/Silicalite-1, and obvious broad adsorption bands appear at 396, 420, and 720 nm, which are assigned to CoOx oligomers and the ligand-metal charge transfer of O2– → Co2+ and O2– → Co3+ in spinal Co3O4, (26,27,49,50) respectively, indicating that mainly Co3O4 species exists over Co3O4/Silicalite-1. There are only adsorption bands appearing at ∼420 and 720 nm over the Co3O4/ZSM-5 catalyst, indicating the dominance of Co3O4 species for Co3O4/ZSM-5. In addition, a broad band at 330–480 nm and a weak band at 570 nm appear over CoOx@Silicalite-1, which could be assigned to CoOx oligomers and the little Co2+ being implanted into the zeolite framework, respectively. (49) Additionally, further UV-Raman characterization results of Co-based zeolite catalysts are shown in Figure 6C, in addition to the characteristic bands of the MFI structure at 380 and 808 cm–1; Co3O4/Silicalite-1 and Co3O4/ZSM-5 are dominated by Co3O4 species with the characteristic bands at 465, 521, 613, and 680 cm–1, (54,55) while no obvious Co3O4 adsorption bands are observed over Co-Silicalite-1 and CoOx@Silicalite-1, which could be ascribed to the implantation of Co sites into the zeolite framework over Co-Silicalite-1 and the encapsulation of CoOx inside the CoOx@Silicalite-1 pore, in accordance with previous H2-TPR and UV–vis characterization results. The Raman band at 1083 cm–1 is assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibrations of the framework Coδ+–O–Si or Alδ+–O–Si species. (56) Moreover, an obvious band at 1166 cm–1 appears over Co-Silicalite-1, indicating that the Co atoms are incorporated into the framework of zeolites successfully, which are tightly coordinated in the framework of Co-Silicalite-1. (57,58)
The above H2-TPR, UV–vis, and UV-Raman characterization results demonstrate collaboratively that Co sites mainly exist in the form of a framework tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ over Co-Silicalite-1, in comparison with Co3O4 species over Co3O4/Silicalite-1 and Co3O4/ZSM-5 catalysts as well as CoOx over CoOx@Silicalite-1 catalysts, respectively.
The chemical state at the surface of the catalyst is studied by Co 2p XPS, as shown in Figure 6D. It could be found that the subshell binding energy of Co 2p3/2 of Co3O4/Silicalite-1 is about 780.0 eV, and further deconvolution peak fitting results show that the proportion of Co2+/Co3+ over Co 2p3/2 is 42/58 (Tables S1 and 3), demonstrating that Co3+ species dominate the Co3O4/Silicalite-1 catalyst’s surface. (26) Nevertheless, the subshell binding energy of Co 2p3/2 over the Co-Silicalite-1 catalyst surface is 781.5 eV, indicating that the Co species mainly exists as a Co2+ state. (59) Further peak deconvolution results show that the proportion of Co2+/Co3+ over the Co-Silicalite-1 surface is 100/0 (Table 3), demonstrating that tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ dominates over the Co-Silicalite-1 catalyst surface, in accordance with the above UV–vis and UV-Raman characterization results. In addition, it is worth noting that the surface Co contents are 1.62 and 1.75 wt % on Co-Silicalite-1 and Co3O4/Silicalite-1, respectively. The surface concentrations of Co are close to the bulk Co concentrations, indicating the corresponding high dispersion of Co species.

The chemical state and coordination environment of cobalt in the Co-Silicalite-1 catalyst before and after PDH catalysis are further studied by the X-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), as shown in Figure 7. The spectra of cobalt foil, CoO, and Co3O4 are also presented as the references. In the XANES of Co K-edge, the Co K-edge patterns of Co-Silicalite-1 before and after the reaction are close to the CoO but far from the Co3O4 reference. A shoulder is observed at 7717.7 eV, as marked by the red dashed line in Figure 7A. This value matches with the energy value of tetrahedrally coordinated Co(II) at 7717.3 eV in the literature. (26,60,61) This result suggests that Co sites are present in the form of Co(II) in the catalyst. Moreover, a pre-edge peak at 7709.4 eV is also observed in the Co-Silicalite-1 catalyst before and after PDH catalysis, which is another signal to determine the chemical state of Co in the catalysts. It has been reported that the pre-edge peak of Co3+ is higher than 7710.0 eV, while the pre-edge peak of Co2+ was 7709–7710.0 eV. (26,28,61) The pre-edge observed at 7709.4 eV hints that Co is present in the form of Co2+. It is also noticed that the energy values of the pre-edge and the absorption edge are the same for the catalyst before and after the PDH reaction (red and blue spectra in Figure 7A, respectively). Thus, the Co sites in the catalyst before and after the catalysis are tetrahedrally coordinated Co(II), as revealed from XANES, which is in accordance with previously discussed UV–vis, UV-Raman, and XPS results.

The coordination environment of Co of the Co-Silicalite-1 catalyst is further studied by Fourier transformed EXAFS of Co K-edge before and after catalysis. Both Fourier transformed spectra are presented without phase correction in Figure 7B. In other words, the coordination pathway as shown in Figure 7B is usually about 0.3–0.5 Å shorter than the actual distance due to phase correction. The Fourier transform moduli are limited to the first shell of neighbors (up to R = 6.0 Å), and the corresponding fits for both catalysts are summarized in Table 4. A first shell Co–O coordination with the distance of 1.99 Å is obtained over Co-Silicalite-1. The corresponding coordination number (CN) is 4.34, which is lower than the average number of the spinel Co3O4 phase, (26,28) indicating that the tetracoordinated Co2+ species dominates over the Co-Silicalite-1 catalyst. Notably, the signals of the Co–Co shells in metallic Co or cobalt oxide are undetectable due to the isolated Co2+ sites over Co-Silicalite-1. Thus, the formation of metallic Co is excluded in the catalyst after catalysis, which is consistent with the previous TPR result. Moreover, the corresponding Co–O pathway (Figure 7B) and the Co–O coordination numbers (Table 4) remain almost unchanged after 1040 min of the PDH reaction, indicating that the Co2+ sites are stable during the PDH reaction.

The surface functional groups of the catalysts are studied by the IR spectrum in the region of the hydroxyl stretching vibration of Silicalite-1, Co-Silicalite-1, and Co3O4/Silicalite-1 catalysts (Figure 8). All of the spectra have been normalized at 1880 cm–1. As for Silicalite-1, two absorption bands appear at 3741 and 3500 cm–1, due to the isolated external terminal silanol and the hydrogen-bonded silanol nests, respectively. (62) When Co is introduced over Co-Silicalite-1 and Co3O4/Silicalite-1, a new absorption band appears at 3678 cm–1, which could be ascribed to the presence of Co–OH sites or the Si–OH adjacent to tetrahedral Co(II) species correspondingly, (49) which could be considered as a proof that Co sites have been incorporated into the framework successfully. In addition, it is worth noting that the intensity of 3678 cm–1 over Co-Silicalite-1 is obviously higher than that of Co3O4/Silicalite-1, indicating that much more Co sites incorporated into the zeolite framework over Co-Silicalite-1. Besides, the IR spectra of Co-Silicalite-1 with adsorbed pyridine in the range of pyridine ring-stretching modes after desorption at various temperatures present an obviously higher intensity of the band at 1445 cm–1 (assigned to the Lewis acid sites (63,64)) compared to that of Co3O4/Silicalite-1 (Figure 9A). Furthermore, the semiquantitative analysis of the strength of Lewis acidity (64) demonstrates that Co-Silicalite-1 indeed possesses a stronger Lewis acidity than that of Co3O4/Silicalite-1 (Figure 9B). The above IR characterization results indicate that tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ acting as Lewis acidic sites are corresponding PDH active sites, in accordance with a previous literature report. (37)

According to the above systemic characterizations, it is confirmed that tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ sites are incorporated into the Silicalite-1 framework successfully over Co-Silicalite-1, which is different from CoOx@Silicalite-1, Co3O4/Silicalite-1, and Co3O4/ZSM-5 catalysts with mainly extraframework CoOx or Co3O4 species, indicating that the introduction of ammonia during the hydrothermal protocol is essential for Co2+ sites incorporated into the Silicalite-1 framework. The introduction of ammonia would combine Co2+ to generate the Co(NH3)62+ complex and suppress the generation of Co(OH)2 precipitation correspondingly, further facilitating Co2+ sites’ incorporation into the zeolite framework, which is in accordance with the literature report of the introduction of EDTA to the complex Fe ion and further facilitate Fe-ion incorporation into the Silicalite-1 framework over FeS-1-EDTA. (65)
Moreover, the catalytic performance including conversion and selectivity could be influenced by the corresponding adsorption/desorption behavior of propane and propylene on the surface. It is generally accepted that the adsorption of propane would increase the residence time, facilitating the reaction, and further coke deposition is formed by over-reaction of the propylene. (65) Correspondingly, C3H8-TPD and C3H6-TPD experiments over various catalysts are investigated, as shown in Figure 10. From the C3H8-TPD results in Figure 10A, it could be found that only one propane desorption peak appears over Co-Silicalite-1 (112 °C), CoOx@Silicalite-1 (94 °C), and ZSM-5 (215 °C), while two propane desorption peaks appear at 94 and 345 °C over Co3O4/Silicalite-1, and three propane desorption peaks appear at 94, 240, and 345 °C over Co3O4/ZSM-5. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that three major propane desorption temperature peaks at about 100, 220, and 330 °C could be ascribed to the different propane desorption sites with Co2+, Brønsted sites of Si–O(H)–Al and Co3O4, respectively. From previous characterization results, it can be confirmed that Co2+ species is the main active site over PDH. Hence, the corresponding propane desorption peak at about 100 °C would have a positive correlation with the conversion of propane to propylene. It could be found that the desorption peak temperature over Co-Silicalite-1 (112 °C) is higher than that of CoOx@Silicalite-1 (94 °C), Co3O4/Silicalite-1 (94 °C), and Co3O4/ZSM-5 (94 °C). Besides, further semiquantitative analysis of the propane desorption capacity at about 100 °C can be presented on the order of Co-Silicalite-1 (1.75 mmol C3H8·gcat–1) > Co3O4/Silicalite-1 (0.77 mmol C3H8·gcat–1) > Co3O4/ZSM-5 (0.53 mmol C3H8·gcat–1) > CoOx@Silicalite-1 (0.48 mmol C3H8·gcat–1), which indicates that Co-Silicalite-1 has the highest propane adsorption capacity (Table 5). The higher propane desorption temperature and propane desorption capacity over Co-Silicalite-1 (112 °C) would facilitate the adsorption and activation of propane in PDH correspondingly. As for C3H6-TPD (Figure 10B), it is found that only one slight propylene desorption peak is observed over Co-Silicalite-1, CoOx@Silicalite-1, and Co3O4/Silicalite-1, and the corresponding propylene desorption temperature decreases on the order of Co3O4/Silicalite-1 (143 °C) > Co-Silicalite-1 (113 °C) > CoOx@Silicalite-1 (89 °C). Nevertheless, three strong propylene desorption peaks at 179, 218, and 267 °C are observed over Co3O4/ZSM-5 and ZSM-5 catalysts, which mainly come from the strong interaction between propylene and the strong Brønsted acid sites from ZSM-5. The lower propylene desorption temperature over Co-Silicalite-1 would inhibit the over-reaction of the propylene to generate byproducts and coke, while the higher propylene adsorption capacity over ZSM-5 and Co3O4/ZSM-5 could be beneficial for the conversion of C3H6 to coke, decreasing the C3H6 selectivity correspondingly, in accordance with later Raman/TG results.

3.4. Characterization of the Spent Catalyst
Based on the above investigation, it is confirmed that Co-Silicalite-1 has better catalytic performance and catalyst stability over PDH and corresponding Co sites mainly exist in the form of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ in the zeolite framework. To further figure out the correlation of catalyst activity and structure, various catalysts after 1040 min time-on-stream are analyzed by systematic characterizations. The XRD patterns (Figure S4) show that the MFI zeolite structure of the used catalysts is well preserved after the reaction, and no obvious Co oxides (PDF#43-1003) are observed. Figure 11 shows the TEM images of the samples after the reaction, and it could be found that the morphologies of Co-Silicalite-1 and CoOx@Silicalite-1 keep unchanged after the reaction compared with the fresh sample, and no obvious Co particles and coke appear. However, coke appears obviously over Co3O4/Silicalite-1 catalysts after the PDH reaction and some Co species nanoparticles migrate to the coke surface, indicating that Co species over Co3O4/Silicalite-1 are not that stable, in accordance with previous H2-TPR characterization results with a rather low H2 reduction temperature (Figure 6A); the reduction of Co3O4 to a lower chemical state Co or even metallic Co0 species would result in generating coke more easily over PDH. To further investigate the coke after reaction over various Co-based zeolite catalysts, UV-Raman and TG analyses are used to characterize correspondingly, as shown in Figure 12. From UV-Raman profiles of the used catalysts (Figure 12A), new bands appear at 1591 and 1351 cm–1 compared with fresh samples, corresponding to coke deposition and the C–H bending vibration of coke species, (66) respectively. Further quantitative analysis of the coke content based on the intensity of S1591/S380 is performed (Figure 12D), and it is found that the intensity of S1591/S380 over Co-Silicalite-1 is the lowest (2.14), indicating its low coke amount compared with other catalysts. Moreover, further quantitative analysis of coke with TG shows that the coke content over Co-Silicalite-1 is 2.04%, which is much lower than that of CoOx@Silicalite-1 (3.11%), Co3O4/Silicalite-1 (4.83%), and Co3O4/ZSM-5 (6.12%), in accordance with previous Raman analysis results. In addition, it is worth noting that the main weight loss temperature peak over Co-Silicalite-1 (265 °C) is obviously lower than that of the other catalysts (Figure 12C). The lower coke content and the lower weight loss temperature over Co-Silicalite-1 make it a high-performance and long-term-stable catalyst over PDH.

In addition, various characterizations including H2-TPR, XPS, and XAS are used to further investigate the state of Co species after the reaction. From the H2-TPR characterization results of catalysts after the reaction (Figure S5), it could be seen that no obvious H2 reduction peak is observed over Co-Silicalite-1-used, indicating that the Co species over Co-Silicalite-1 is superstable. On the other hand, the H2 reduction peak over Co3O4/Silicalite-1-used and Co3O4/ZSM-5-used disappears compared with that of the fresh catalysts, indicating that Co species is reduced and unstable during the reaction, while the H2 reduction peak of CoOx@Silicalite-1 keeps unchanged at ∼720 °C before and after the reaction, which could be due to the lower reaction temperature. Figure 13 and Table 3 show the XPS characterization results of Co-Silicalite-1 and Co3O4/Silicalite-1 after the reaction, and it could be seen that the surface Co content of Co-Silicalite-1-used decreases after the PDH reaction compared with that of fresh Co-Silicalite-1, which could be ascribed to the adsorption of organic propane and/or propylene or the slight coke during the PDH reaction covering the catalyst surface. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the surface Co content over Co3O4/Silicalite-1-used increases to 1.90 wt % compared to 1.75 wt % of fresh Co3O4/Silicalite-1, which could be explained from the fact that the reduction of Co3O4 species inside the zeolite pore further migrates to the catalyst surface, which is demonstrated by previous TEM characterization results (Figure 11C). In addition, it could be found that the proportion of Co2+/Co3+ over the Co-Silicalite-1-used surface keeps unchanged with 100/0 compared with that of fresh Co-Silicalite-1, demonstrating the unchanged Co2+ state before and after the PDH reaction. Nevertheless, the proportion of Co2+/Co3+ over Co3O4/Silicalite-1-used becomes 45/55 compared with 42/58 for fresh Co3O4/Silicalite-1, indicating that part of the Co3+ species is reduced during PDH correspondingly (Table 3). Further EXAFS characterization results in Figure 7 and Table 4 indicate that the bulk Co2+ species over Co-Silicalite-1-used remains almost unchanged compared with fresh Co-Silicalite-1. The above characterization results demonstrate that Co2+ species over Co-Silicalite-1 is superstable during PDH.
Figure 13
Figure 13. XPS Co 2p profiles of Co-Silicalite-1-used and Co3O4/Silicalite-1-used catalysts after the PDH reaction.
Furthermore, the magnet is used to check whether Co sites over various catalysts have changed after the PDH reaction, and the corresponding pictures with the magnet are shown in Figure S6. It could be found that all of the fresh catalysts are nonmagnetic. Nevertheless, it could be found that Co3O4/Silicalite-1-used and Co3O4/ZSM-5-used catalysts via the incipient wetness impregnation method show obvious magnetism after the PDH reaction, indicating that the state of Co sites has changed after the PDH reaction. On the other hand, Co-Silicalite-1-used and CoOx@Silicalite-1 catalysts via hydrothermal synthesis still show nonmagnetism, demonstrating the unchanged and superstable Co sites.
3.5. Reaction Mechanism
According to previous investigation, it is confirmed that tetracoordinated Co2+ species, as the active sites for PDH, are very stable and could not be reduced to Co0 even at 850 °C over Co-Silicalite-1. Besides, it is reported that transition-metal complexes could abstract H• from alkanes to make alkyl radicals by a proton coupled electron transfer or hydrogen atom-transfer mechanism. (15,29,67,68) Hence, a nonredox heterolytic mechanism over tetracoordinated Co2+ species is proposed over PDH, as shown in Scheme 1a. First, tetracoordinated Co2+ would adsorb and activate propane via abstracting H• by the O atom adjacent to the Lewis Co site acting as the Brønsted base, (29,69) to form cobalt propyl transition intermediate TS1 (Co(II)–CH3CH2CH2•). Then, cobalt propyl species undergoes β-H elimination to form the cobalt propene transition intermediate TS2 (Co(II)–CH3CHCH2). Then, the subsequent release of propene forms the cobalt hydride species TS3. Afterward, H2 is formed and the catalytic cycle is completed according to proton transfer from TS3 to form a dihydrogen adduct TS4 (Co(H2)). Moreover, it is worth noting that the state of Co2+ keeps unchanged during the whole catalytic process. In addition, as for side reactions, the existence of Brønsted acid sites from Si–O(H)–Al over ZSM-5 or Co/ZSM-5 would result in the formation of byproducts C2H4/CH4 via cracking of propane (Scheme 1b). In addition, the existence of metallic Co0 could accelerate the formation of coke (Scheme 1c).

3.6. Catalyst Stability and Performance Comparison
To further investigate the time-on-stream stability of Co-Silicalite-1, the corresponding catalytic result is shown in Figure 14A. It is surprising to find that that the catalytic performance of Co-Silicalite-1 is stable and not deactivated obviously with propylene selectivity higher than 98.5% during 3560 min time-on-stream, which is owing to its superstable Co2+ active sites over Co-Silicalite-1. The TOF value of the Co-Silicalite-1 catalyst reaches 21 h–1 over PDH at 550 °C, and it is much higher than the previously reported Co-based catalysts and other non-noble metals Sn, Zn, Ga, and Fe containing zeolite (Figure 14B and Table S4). Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the Co-Silicalite-1 catalyst is also the highest, with higher than 98.5%.

4. Conclusions
In summary, an efficient and nonprecious metal catalyst for propane dehydrogenation is prepared over Co-Silicalite-1 via facile hydrothermal synthesis with the assistance of NH3·H2O. The Co-Silicalite-1 exhibits superior catalytic performance and coke resistance over PDH with 0.0946 mmol of C3H6·s–1·gCo–1 and propylene selectivity higher than 98.5% in comparison with CoOx@Silicalite-1 without introducing NH3·H2O, conventional Co3O4/Silicalite-1, and Co3O4/ZSM-5 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. According to systematic characterization, tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+, as an active site responsible for PDH, is incorporated into the zeolite framework successfully over Co-Silicalite-1. The Co2+ sites stabilized by framework Si–O–Co units could prevent the reduction of Co species and coke formation. This work affords a new strategy to synthesize high-performance Co-based zeolite catalysts over PDH, and the excellent catalyst activity and stability of Co-Silicalite-1 could meet the potential industrial application in the dehydrogenation of propane.
