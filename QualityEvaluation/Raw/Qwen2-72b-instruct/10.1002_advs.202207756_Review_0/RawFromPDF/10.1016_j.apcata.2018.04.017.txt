Abstract 
Nanocarbon is an important metal-free catalyst for various applications including oxidative 
dehydrogenation and direct dehydrogenation reactions. The surface oxygen-containing groups of 
nanocarbon are regarded as active sites in oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. However, the active sites for 
direct dehydrogenation are still not totally clear. Herein, multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are 
activated by different oxidation processes and thermal treatments, and used as effective catalysts for direct 
dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The physicochemical properties of the oxidized MWCNTs are 
characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, N2 sorption, Raman, TGA, TPD-MS and XPS techniques. It is revealed 
that the concentrations of the oxygen-containing groups could be well controlled by sequential acid 
oxidation and thermal treatment. The activities of these nanocarbon catalysts exhibit a good linear 
dependence on the number of carbonyl/quinone groups, confirming the active sites are C=O groups on the 
surface of the MWCNTs.

1. Introduction 
Propylene is an important chemical intermediate in petrochemical industry, which is usually used in the 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

production of a number of chemicals such as epoxypropane, acrylonitrile and polypropylene [1, 2]. Over the 
past few decades, propylene is mainly sourced from fluid-catalytic-cracking and steam cracking [3]. 
However, these methods cannot satisfy the ever-increasing demand of propylene. The catalytic conversion of 
propane into propylene has thus particularly drawn much attention and been regarded as one of the most 
promising ways for propylene production since it is economical to covert the low-value propane to 
high-value propylene. The supported Pt and CrOx catalysts have been used as active catalysts in 
dehydrogenation reactions [4-7]. However, some questions such as catalyst deactivation, the high price of Pt, 
and the toxicity of Cr species hinder their wide application. So, the development of new efficient, low-cost 
and environmental-friendly catalyst systems for dehydrogenation reactions is of great significance. 
Nanocarbon materials, such as nanodiamond, carbon nanotube and mesoporous carbon, are regarded as 
the promising metal-free catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis [8-10]. From an environmental point of view, 
nanocarbon catalysts enable a clean disposal by combustion after a certain life-time, making them attractive 
alternatives to noble metal or metal oxide catalysts for a more sustainable catalytic reaction. Also, 
nanocarbon catalysts exhibit many advantages such as large surface area, rich porous structure and tunable 
functional groups. To date, many efforts have been dedicated to dramatically scale-up the utilization of 
nanocarbon materials in various applications, such as supercapacitor [11], dye-sensitized solar cell [12,13] 
and electrocatalytic water splitting [14,15], and the functional groups and structure properties of the 
nanocarbon catalysts could significantly affect the catalytic performance. It has been demonstrated that the 
nanocarbons (e.g. carbon nanotubes, nanodiomand and ordered mesoporous carbon) are highly active for 
oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (ODH), and the oxygen-containing groups played important roles in the 
activation of C-H bonds [16-18]. Very recently, several groups found that nanocarbons were active catalysts 
for direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. For instance, Zhao et al. [19, 20] reported that the 
nitrogen-doped carbon materials exhibited high catalytic performance for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
4 
 
to styrene. While, our group [21-23] found that the ordered mesoporous carbons could be used as promising 
PDH catalysts, exhibiting higher activity and longer stability than the industrial catalysts. However, the 
active sites of nanocarbon catalysts for the direct PDH reaction have not been clearly certified due to the 
lack of fundamental understanding of the surface properties of the nanocarbons at high temperature. It 
remains a great challenge to look for a convincing evidence to demonstrate the active sites of nanocarbon 
catalysts for PDH reaction. 
Herein, to evaluate the above considerations, the pristine multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were 
oxidized by HNO3 and H2SO4 and used as the catalyst for PDH. The contents of the surface 
oxygen-containing groups of MWCNTs were successfully adjusted by different acid oxidation and thermal 
treatments. The experimental results revealed that the activities of the nanocarbon catalysts were strongly 
affected by the oxidation process, and the oxidized MWCNTs showed higher catalytic performance than the 
pristine MWCNTs. The oxygen-containing groups especially carbonyl (C=O) groups played important roles 
in PDH reaction.  
 
2. Experimental section 
2.1 Materials and sample preparation. 
The MWCNTs (GT-350; diameter, 12-15 nm; length, 0.5-5 μm) were supplied by Shandong Dazhan Nano 
Materials Co., Ltd. Concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4 were purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Chemical Co. All 
chemicals were used as received without further purification. 
Weakly oxidized MWCNTs: 2 g of raw MWCNTs was stirred with 200 mL of 65% HNO3 in a 500 mL 
round-bottom flask at room temperature for 2 h. Then, the mixture was slowly dropped into plenty of water 
(Vmixture/Vwater = 1:10) under ice-bath. Afterwards, the diluted mixture was filtrated and washed with 
excessive deionized water until the pH ≈ 7. The resulting sample was dried at 120 oC overnight, and denoted 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

as wo-MWCNTs. 
Mildly oxidized MWCNTs: 2 g of raw MWCNTs was stirred with 200 mL of 65% HNO3 in a 500 mL 
round-bottom flask at 75 oC for 5 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the mixture was slowly 
dropped into plenty of water (Vmixture/Vwater = 1:10) under ice-bath. Then, the diluted mixture was filtrated 
and washed with excessive deionized water until the pH ≈ 7. The resulting sample was dried at 120 oC 
overnight, and denoted as mo-MWCNTs. 
Strongly oxidized MWCNTs: 2 g of raw MWCNTs was stirred with 50 mL of 65% HNO3 and 150 mL of 
98% H2SO4 in a 500 mL round-bottom flask at 75 oC for 5 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the 
mixture was slowly dropped into plenty of water (Vmixture/Vwater = 1:10) under ice-bath. Then, the diluted 
mixture was filtrated and washed with excessive deionized water until the pH ≈ 7. The resulting sample was 
dried at 120 oC overnight, and denoted as so-MWCNTs. Note: many NO2 and SO2 would be produced 
during the oxidation process. 
  Thermally treated so-MWCNTs: Thermal treatment of so-MWCNTs was performed under a nitrogen flow 
(60 mL min-1) at 400, 600 and 900 oC for 2 h, respectively, with a heating rate of 10 oC min-1. After that, the 
sample was cooled down to room temperature without further treatments, and denoted as so-MWCNTs-400, 
so-MWCNTs-600 and so-MWCNTs-900, respectively. 
 
2.2 Sample characterization. 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained 
from Joel JSM7500F at 5.0 kV and Jeol JEM-2100F at 200 kV, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
patterns were recorded on a Brucker D8 Focus diffractometer with monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation 
(incident wavelength λ = 0.15418 nm). N2 adsorption-desorption experiments were performed on a 
Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer at 77 K. Before the measurement, every sample was 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
6 
 
degassed at 200 oC overnight. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was performed on a TA SDT Q600 
instrument at a ramping rate of 10 oC min-1 using α-Al2O3 as the reference. Temperature-programmed 
desorption-mass spectrometer (TPD-MS) experiments were tested in He with 10 oC min-1 from ambient 
temperature to 1000 oC. 0.1 g sample was degassed at 300 oC for 1 h prior to the measurement, and the 
product gases were analyzed by an online mass spectrometer (Shimadzu MS-QP2010 SE). X-ray 
photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD (delay line detector) spectrometer 
equipped with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). Before the tests, all the oxidized 
MWCNTs were pretreated in N2 at 400 oC for 1 h. The O 1s spectra were deconvoluted into three Gaussian 
peaks. And every spectrum was determined by C 1s (284.8 eV). 
 
2.3 Catalytic tests 
  The PDH reactions were tested on a fixed-bed quartz reactor packed with 0.2 g catalyst at various 
temperatures from 300 to 600 oC under atmospheric pressure. Before the tests, all the nanocarbons were 
treated in N2 flow at 400 oC for 2 h. The reaction gases consist of 5 vol% propane balanced with nitrogen at 
a typical gas flow rate of 6000 mL h-1 gcat-1. The reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas 
chromatograph (SP-6890) with a flame ionization detector (FID). And the type of the column is GDX-01. 
Experiments with blanks showed that the reaction rates were negligible without carbon catalyst. C3H8 
conversion and C3H6 selectivity expressed on mol% carbon atom basis were calculated as follows:

3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Catalyst characterization 
The oxidized MWCNTs were obtained by different acid oxidation of commercial MWCNTs. During the 
oxidation process, a number of defects and oxygen functional groups can be introduced onto the surface of 
the MWCNTs [24]. Fig. 1 presents the SEM and TEM images of the raw MWCNTs and oxidized MWCNTs. 
From Fig. 1a-c, it can be seen that the as-received MWCNTs present a typical tubular structure with a width 
of 8-12 nm. While, the high-resolution TEM images reveal that the morphologies of the MWCNTs samples 
are maintained after oxidation, and only a few of amorphous carbons can be observed on the surface of the 
so-MWCNTs (Fig. 1d-g). This can be attributed to the formation of hydrophilic carboxylic groups and 
defects on the surface of the MWCNTs [25, 26]. Furthermore, the structure integrities and the morphologies 
of the oxidized MWCNTs samples are similar to the raw MWCNTs (Fig. S1), suggesting that the oxidized 
process does not significantly destroy the microstructure of the MWCNTs.

mo-MWCNTs (f), and so-MWCNTs (g). 
 
  The XRD patterns of the raw, wo-, mo- and so-MWCNTs are shown in Fig. 2. It can be clearly observed 
that all the samples show two characteristic peaks at 2θ = 26.1 and 43.1o, corresponding to the (002) and 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
8 
 
(100) graphitic diffraction peaks, respectively [27]. Obviously, the characteristic peaks of the oxidized 
MWCNTs are similar to those of the raw MWCNTs, indicating that the graphene layers of these oxidized 
MWCNTs are almost intact after oxidization by strong acid.

To further investigate the effect of oxidation process on the MWCNTs’ structure, Raman spectroscopy is 
selected to characterize these four samples (Fig. 3). Clearly, all the samples consist of two prominent bands, 
namely D (~1340 cm-1) and G (~1570 cm-1) bands. The G-band is characterized in-plane tangential 
stretching of the carbon-carbon bonds in graphene sheets, whereas the D-band is typical for the disordered 
part on the surface of the carbon materials [13, 28]. And the intensity ratios of D-band to G-band (ID/IG) can 
be used to characterize the graphitization degree of the carbon materials. The higher of ID/IG value indicates 
the more defects, vacancies or amorphous carbon on the CNTs walls, whereas a lower ID/IG suggests less 
disorder in the graphitic plane. As depicted in Fig. 3, the ID/IG values of the raw, wo-, mo- and so-MWCNTs 
are 1.21, 1.22, 1.28 and 1.32, respectively, suggesting a progressive increase of the defects of the MWCNTs. 
This may be caused by a number of oxygen-containing groups introducing onto the MWCNTs walls after 
sequential acid oxidation process [29].

The porosities of the oxidized MWCNTs are investigated by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis (Fig. 4 and 
Fig. S2), and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. From Fig. 4, the isotherms of all the 
samples are identified as type II according to the IUPAC classification [30]. The amount adsorbed increases 
gradually as the relative pressure increases. When the relative pressure is greater than 0.9, a very strong 
increase of N2-adsorbed volume can be observed, which is characteristic of the presence of many 
macropores [31]. It represents unrestricted monolaye-multilayer adsorption, and suggests a macroporous 
material whose pores and voids communicate with the surface of the particles [32]. Noticeably, all the 
samples exhibit well-defined hysteresis loops of Type H3, indicating the materials comprised of aggregates 
of plate-like particles [30, 32]. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of wo-MWCNTs (387 m2/g) are 
similar to that of the raw MWCNTs (393 m2/g), suggesting that almost no structural changes during the 
weak oxidation process. While the surface areas of mo-MWCNTs and so-MWCNTs are decreased obviously. 
Similar results were reported on the oxidized CNTs that tended to form many oxygen-containing groups on 
the surface of the MWCNTs [33, 34]. During the oxidation process, many oxygen-containing groups would 
be introduced onto the surface of MWCNTs. Even though the oxidative treatments are known to open a 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
10 
 
large fraction of the nanotube ends, some of the tubes remain partially or totally blocked by surface 
functional groups and structural defects [34, 35]. After thermal treatment, the surface areas of the 600 and 
900 oC-calcined so-MWCNTs samples are a little higher than that of the so-MWCNTs. This is probably due 
to the decomposition of some oxygen-containing groups of the so-MWCNTs, increasing the surface areas 
and pore volumes.

The TG curves of the nanocarbons are shown in Fig. 5, and all the samples are tested in N2 with a heating 
rate of 10 oC min-1. From Fig. 5a, the raw MWCNTs shows only 3.3% weight loss from room temperature to 
900 oC. And the TG curve of wo-MWCNTs is similar to that of raw MWCNTs, indicating that HNO3 has 
little influence on the surface of the MWCNTs at low temperature. While, the weight losses of 
mo-MWCNTs and so-MWCNTs are 15.3 and 35.8% from 30 to 900 oC, respectively, which are much higher 
than that of raw MWCNTs and wo-MWCNTs. The thermal degradations of the oxidized MWCNTs are a 
multistage process [29, 36, 37]. Noticeably, the weight losses of mo-MWCNTs and so-MWCNTs are much 
higher than those of raw MWCNTs and wo-WMCNTs, indicating that numerous oxygen-containing groups 
are successfully attracted on the surface of the MWCNTs. Furthermore, the TGA experiments of these 
samples in air were also tested (Fig. S3). It is shown that the antioxidant capacity of the samples decreases 
with the oxidation degree rise, especially for so-MWCNTs. The thermal decomposition of so-MWCNTs can 
be completed at 634 oC, about 30 oC lower than that of the raw MWCNTs, due to the presence of a large 
amount of oxygen functional groups in so-MWCNTs. Noticeably, the TG curves of all the samples are 
similar to the corresponding curves in Fig. 5a when the temperature is blow 400 oC, corresponding to the 
decomposition of the carboxylic group and lactone groups. 
The TG curves of the so-MWCNTs pretreated at different temperatures (400, 600 and 900 oC) are shown 
in Fig. 5b. The weight loss of 400 oC-calcined so-MWCNTs starts at 300 oC. While the TG curves of 600 
and 900 oC-calcined so-MWCNTs show almost no weight loss before 600 oC, demonstrating that the 
low-temperature-decomposition groups on the nanocabon surface are almost decomposed by thermal 
treatment [38, 39]. At higher temperature range (over 600 oC), the TG curves of 400 and 600 oC-calcined 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
12 
 
so-MWCNTs are similar to each other (inset), indicating the existence of similar amounts of quinone and 
carbonyl groups. Furthermore, no obvious weight loss can be observed in 900 oC-calcined so-MWCNTs, 
probably caused by the decomposition of most of the oxygen-containing groups after 900 oC calcination.

Fig. 6 depicts the TPD-MS profiles of raw, wo-, mo-, and so-MWCNTs, and the corresponding 
parameters are listed in Table S1 and S2. From Fig. 6a and b, it can be observed that the intensities of CO 
and CO2 desorption peaks of these samples follow: so-MWCNTs > mo-MWCNTs > wo-MWCNTs > raw 
MWCNTs, suggesting that a large number of oxygen-containing groups are successfully introduced onto the 
surface of the CNTs by sequential acid oxidation. It was reported that the CO desorption mainly resulted 
from the phenol, carboxylic anhydride, and quinone/carbonyl species, whereas the CO2 desorption was 
attributed to the carboxylic anhydride at lower temperatures and lactones at higher temperatures [40, 41]. 
Herein, the CO desorption peaks can be deconvoluted into five peaks, corresponding to carboxylic groups 
(peak #1), carboxylic anhydrides (peak #2), phenols (peak #3), and carbonyls/quinones (peak #4 and #5) [40, 
41]. The CO2 desorption peaks can be fitted into five peaks, corresponding to strong acidic (peak *1 and *2) 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
13 
 
and less acidic (peak *3), carboxylic groups/carboxylic anhydrides (peak *4), and lactones (peak *5) [42, 
43]. As to the raw MWCNTs, the signals of the CO and CO2 desorption peaks are so weak, suggesting the 
presence of a small number of oxygen functional groups in the raw MWCNTs. After oxygenation, the CO 
and CO2 desorption signals increase sharply, demonstrating many oxygen-containing groups are introduced 
onto the oxidized MWCNTs surface. These results are consistent with the TGA results in Fig. 5. 
To further investigate the changes of the surface oxygen-containing groups of the so-MWCNTs after 
different-temperature treatment, the TPD-MS techniques were performed (Fig. 6c and d). As mentioned 
above, the CO and CO2 peaks in the TPD spectra of the so-MWCNTs sample can be deconvoluted into five 
peaks. Differently, the 600 and 900 oC-calcined so-MWCNTs samples exhibit no signal before 600 oC, 
indicating that many oxygen-containing groups including carboxylic anhydrides, carboxylic groups and 
phenols are decomposed after high-temperature calcination. The higher temperature peaks (peak #4, #5 and 
*5) of the 600 oC-calcined so-MWCNTs sample are similar to those of the 400 oC-calcined sample, 
indicating the presence of a number of the carbonyls/quinone groups in the so-MWCNTs after 600 
oC-calcination. As to the 900 oC-calcined so-MWCNTs, no desorption peaks can be observed in the CO2 
evolution curve, and only a small peak #5 can be observed in the CO evolution, demonstrating that most of 
oxygen functional groups are wiped out after 900 oC-calcination.

The XPS spectra of the raw, wo-, mo-, and so-MWCNTs are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S4. From the 
general survey spectrum of these samples (Fig. S4), we can see that C and O are the only two elements 
which can be detected on the surface of MWCNTs. Especially, no signal of heteroatoms such as N and S can 
be observed, indicating the absence of heteroatoms in the activated MWCNTs. The surface atomic contents

of O element are 2.3, 2.4, 4.0 and 9.9% for raw, wo-, mo-, and so-MWCNTs samples, respectively. 
Obviously, the values of O content are progressively increased after oxidation process, indicating that a lot 
of oxygen-containing groups are successfully introduced onto the surface of the MWCNTs. Fig. 7 shows the 
high resolution XPS O1s spectra of these four samples. And all the XPS spectra can be fitted into three main 
peaks, corresponding to quinone/carbonyl groups (O1, 531.2–531.5 eV), C-O-C and C-OH groups (O2, 
532.5–533.6 eV), and adsorbed water (O3, 533.9–535.6) [44, 45]. Noticeably, the O concentration increases 
sharply after sequential acid oxidation, typically for C=O, e.g. 0.36, 0.43, 0.90, 2.19% for raw, wo-, mo- and 
so-MWCNTs, respectively. This suggests that the acid oxidation processes can effectively introduce 
oxygen-containing groups onto the MWCNTs surface [46, 47].

3.2 Catalytic activity 
Previous reports have indicated that the nanocarbons are active for direct dehydrogenation of propane to 
propylene (Table S3). However, there has been no systematic study about the active sites for direct PDH 
reaction so far. To study the catalytic active sites of the nanocarbons in direct PDH reaction, the propane 
dehydrogenation tests were carried out at low propane conversion (lower than 15%). Fig. 8 shows the 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
16 
 
catalytic activity and stability of the nanocarbons in propane dehydrogenation reaction. In addition to 
propylene being the target product, methane, ethane and ethylene are also formed over all the MWCNTs 
catalysts. In PDH reaction, two unwanted side and secondary reactions can occur, hydrogenolysis and 
cracking: In hydrogenolysis, the addition of hydrogen into C-C bond results in the formation of two smaller 
alkanes; catalytic cracking results in radical intermediates, which rearrange into an alkane and an alkene [3]. 
These two side reactions lead to lower propylene selectivity. As shown in Fig. 8a, the initial catalytic activity 
of the oxidized MWCNTs increases with the increasing of the oxidation degree, exhibiting a progressive 
enhancement of the propane conversion. And the so-MWCNTs sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity 
with the propane conversion of 11.0% at 600 oC, which is much higher than that of raw MWCNTs (0.4%), 
wo-MWCNTs (2.8%) and mo-MWCNTs (7.6%). Noticeably, the selectivity of all the oxidized MWCNTs 
decreases with the reaction temperature rise, especially at high temperature range (over 550 oC). This is 
caused by the secondary reactions such as cracking and hydrogenolysis increasingly occurring at high 
reaction temperature [3]. The catalytic stabilities of the oxidized MWCNTs were also investigated (Fig. 8b), 
and the reaction temperature was kept at 600 oC. It is shown that the catalytic activities of the samples 
decrease obviously at the first one hour. Then, all the samples show a stable catalytic performance during the 
last time. Noticeably, the catalyst stability obeys the following order: mo-MWCNTs > so-MWCNTs > 
wo-MWCNTs. And the final propane conversion of so-MWCNTs is about three times higher than that of 
wo-MWCNTs. This is presumably caused by the increasing of the oxygen-containing groups. 
The catalytic activity and selectivity of the so-MWCNTs after different temperature treatments are shown 
in Fig. 8c and d. It can be observed that the so-MWCNTs shows decreased catalytic activity with the 
calcination temperature rise. Specifically, the propane conversion of so-MWCNTs-600 is 9.5%, which is a 
little lower than that of the uncalcined so-MWCNTs. While the so-MWCNTs-900 shows lower catalytic 
activity than raw MWCNTs and so-MWCNTs-600, with the initial propane conversion of 6.4%. However, 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
17 
 
the so-MWCNTs exhibits enhanced propylene selectivity with the elevated calcination temperature, e.g., the 
propylene selectivity of 86.8, 90.8 and 92.0% for uncalcined so-MWCNTs, so-MWCNTs-600 and 
so-MWCNTs-900, respectively. Moreover, the so-MWCNTs-900 exhibits the highest stability with almost 
no conversion decrease after 1 h reaction. Previous studies reported that the presences of carboxylic acid 
groups on nanocarbons might bring the subsequent deep cracking or prevent propylene desorption, resulting 
in the lower propylene selectivity [21-23]. The so-MWCNTs possess high content of carboxylic acid groups 
(as shown in Fig. 6), and thus, exhibiting low propylene selectivity. After calcination at 600 and 900 oC, 
most of the carboxylic acid groups would be decomposed. Furthermore, the surface area and pore volume of 
so-MWCNTs are improved after calcination (as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1), and the high porous structure 
favors the transmission of propylene and can improve the propylene releasing from the pore system [22]. So, 
the so-MWCNTs-600 and so-MWCNTs-900 show higher propylene selectivity than so-MWCNTs.

3.3 Discussion 
  Previous study reported that the nanocarbons containing a large number of oxygen-containing groups 
exhibited high catalytic activity in PDH reactions [19-23]. For instance, Zhao et al. [19, 20] prepared 
N-doped nanocarbons and used for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, exhibiting enhanced 
catalytic activity, and the outstanding catalytic performance was attributed to the C=O groups and surface 
defects. Liu et al. [21] synthesized OMCs based on organic-organic self-assembly method and found that the 
sample exhibited high catalytic activity and stability in PDH. Lately, Liu et al. [23] found that oxidized 
OMCs exhibited higher catalytic performance than the pristine ones, demonstrating the importance of the 
oxygen-containing groups. However, the identification and quantification the active sites of the nanocarbons 
in the PDH reaction have not been clearly certified due to the complex surface structure and coexistence of 
different kinds of functional groups in the carbon materials. And systematic study of the surface properties 
of the nanocarbons at high temperature (over 600 oC) is still a great challenge.  
In this work, the MWCNTs were oxidized by concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4. The oxygen-containing 
groups were successfully introduced and adjusted by the oxidation processes and thermal treatments. After 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
19 
 
treated at 400 oC, the main oxygen-containing groups in so-MWCNTs are lactone, phenol, anhydride, 
quinone and carbonyl groups [36]. After treated at 600 oC, the main oxygen-containing groups are quinone 
and carbonyl groups. When the calcination temperature is up to 900 oC, only a small number of quinone and 
carbonyl groups are attached onto the MWCNTs. As shown in Fig. 5, the weight losses of the oxidized 
MWCNTs increase with the oxidized degree, demonstrating a continuous increase of the oxygen-containing 
groups. And the antioxidant abilities of the oxidized MWCNTs decreased with extent of the oxidation degree, 
further confirming the increase of the surface oxygen-containing groups. Also, the XPS spectra of the raw 
MWCNTs and oxidized MWCNTs (Fig. 7 and Fig. S4) illustrate that the oxygen-containing groups 
progressively increase after sequential acid oxidation, e.g., the C=O groups are 0.36, 0.43, 0.90, 2.19% for 
raw, wo-, mo- and so-MWCNTs, respectively. To selectively reduce some kinds of the oxygen-containing 
groups, the so-MWCNTs were calcined at 600 and 900 oC for 2 h. From Fig. 6, the TPD-MS results suggest 
that the 900 oC-calcined MWCNTs possess the lowest oxygen-containing groups with almost no CO2 signals. 
While the so-MWCNTs-600 possesses similar CO desorption signals at high temperature range. These 
results illustrate that the concentration and distribution of the oxygen-containing groups can be controlled by 
different oxidation processes and thermal treatments [36-38]. 
To further understand the effect of the C=O groups in the catalyst performance, the linear relationship 
between the PDH activities (propylene formation rates) and the contents of oxygen-containing groups are 
correlated (Fig. 9). Fig. 9a shows the propylene formation rates versus the amount of the carbonyl groups 
calculated from the XPS analysis. It is shown that the propylene formation rates exhibit a good linear 
relation (R2 = 0.9981) with the contents of the C=O groups, indicating that the C=O groups are the active 
sites. This also suggests that amounts of the oxygen-containing groups can be adjusted by the controlled 
oxidation processes.  
Fig. 9b shows the relation between PDH activity and the amount of carbonyl groups calculated from the 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
20 
 
TPD-MS results. It is shown that the carbonyl group amounts exhibit a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9788) 
with the propylene formation rate. This result is in good accordance with the XPS analysis, and further 
demonstrates the active sites of the carbonyl groups. As reported previously, the C=O groups are regarded as 
the main active sites for ODH reactions [16-18, 48]. This conclusion can also be suitable for the PDH 
reaction, where the C=O groups act as the main active sites. In the dehydrogenation of propane, C=O 
activates propane as the electron donor. Propylene is produced and hydroxyl groups (C-OH) remain as 
intermediates. The reaction cycle is closed by the thermal decomposition of C-OH to C=O and molecular 
hydrogen, which is thermodynamically favorable at high temperature [49].

  The Arrhenius plots of the oxidized MWCNTs (ln r versus 1/T) are shown in Fig. 10, and the resultant 
apparent activation energy (Ea) are shown in Table 1. Noticeably, the Ea of the oxidized MWCNTs decrease 
with the extent of oxidation treatments, e.g., wo-, mo-, so-MWCNTs are about 75.8, 55.8 and 44.3 kJ/mol. 
This could be attributed to the enhanced oxygen-containing groups. During the oxidation process, many 
oxygen-containing groups (such as lactone, phenol, anhydride, quinone and carbonyl groups) are introduced 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
21 
 
onto the surface of so-MWCNTs, which could act as the active sites to decrease the Ea. After treated at 600 
and 900 oC, many oxygen-containing groups such as lactone, phenol and anhydride are decomposed. So, the 
main oxygen-containing groups in so-MWCNTs-600 and so-MWCNTs-900 are carbonyl groups. 
Correspondingly, the Ea values of the 600 and 900 oC-calcined so-MWCNTs are similar to each other with 
72.7 and 75.3 kJ/mol to so-MWCNTs-600 and so-MWCNTs-900, respectively. This result confirms that the 
active sites in so-MWCNTs-600 and so-MWCNTs-900 are carbonyl groups [48]. As shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 
6, some oxygen-containing groups including carboxylic, lactone, phenol and anhydride groups are 
decomposed after high-temperature calcination (over 600 oC), leaving a number of C=O groups, and the 
contents of C=O groups can be adjusted by the controlled calcination process. From Fig. 9, the propane 
formation rates exhibit a good linear relation with the amounts of the C=O groups. Considering these 
information, it can be concluded that the main active sties on the MWCNTs are the C=O groups over the 
PDH reaction.

3. Conclusions 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
22 
 
  Oxidized MWCNTs with different amounts of oxygen functional groups were successfully controlled by 
sequential acid oxidation and thermal treatment. The oxidized MWCNTs were used as the model catalysts 
for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, exhibiting higher catalytic activity than raw MWCNTs. 
The oxidation process and thermal treatment would significantly affect the oxygen-containing groups of the 
nanocarbons, thus affecting their catalytic performance. And the amount of carbonyl/quinones groups shows 
a good linear relation to the initial propylene formation rate, confirming that the carbonyl/quinones groups 
are the active sites in the PDH reactions. This study provides a direct evidence of the active sites for the 
carbon catalysts in PDH, suggesting that nanocarbon materials containing abundant oxygen-containing 
groups can be used as promising catalysts in PDH reaction.
