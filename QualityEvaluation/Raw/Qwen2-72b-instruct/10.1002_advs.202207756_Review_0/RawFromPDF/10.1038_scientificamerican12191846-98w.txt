THE VAUDOIS TEACHER. 
BY J. G. WHITTIER. 
" Oh, lady fair, these silks of mine 
Are beautiful and rare-
The richest web of the Indian loom, 
Which beauty's self might wear;-
And those pearls as pure' as thine OWll fair 
neck 
With whose radiant light they vie ;-
I have brought them with me a weary way, 
Will my gentle lady buy ? 
And the lady smiled on the worn old man 
Through the dark and clustering curls 
Which veiled her brow, as she bent to view 
His silks and glistening pearls; 
And she placed their price in the old man's 
hand, 
And lightly turned away ;-
But she paRsed at the wanderer's earnest 
call, 
" 
Stay, gentle lady, stay! 
" Oh, lady fair, I have yet a gem, 
Which a purer lustre flings 
Than the diamond flash of the jeweled crown 
On the lofty brow of kings? 
A wonderful pearl of exceeding price, 
Whose virtue shall not decay ; 
Whose light shall be a spell to thee, 
And a blessing on the ""ay !" 
The lady glanced at the mirroring steel 
Where her form of grace was seen, 
Where her eyes shone clear and her dark 
locks waved 
Their clasping pearls between; 
"Bring forth that pearl &i 
exceeding worth, 
Thou traveller gray and old ; 
And name the price of thy precious gem, 
And my pages shall count thy gold." 
The cloud went off the pilgrim's brow, 
As a small and meagre book, 
Uncha8ed with gold or diamond gem, 
From his folding robe he took; 
"Here, lady, is the pearl of price­
May it prove ai much to thee. 
Na.y-keep thy gold-I ask it not, 
For the word of God is free 1" 
The hoary traveller went his way­
But the gift he left behind 
Had its pure and perfect work 
On that high-born maiden'S mind; 
And she hath turned from the pride of sin 
To the lowliness of truth, 
And given her human heart to God 
In its beautiful hour of youth. 
And she hath left the grey old halls, 
Where all evil faith had power, 
The courtly knights of her fa ther's train, 
And the maio 
ens of her bower; 
And she hath gone to the Vaudois vales, 
By lordly feet untrod, 
Where the poor and needy of earth are rich 
In the perfect love of God. 
Better late than n ever. 
We acknowledge oursehes inexcusable in 
not having before mentioned the fact that our 
friend Gould; the conducter of Adams 
and 
Co's Express, and who was on board the At­
lantic at the time of the 
disaster, was by 
his 
bold enerl:'Y, tact and good fortune, among 
the first who reached the shore. 
And after 
having buffeted the icy surf, instead of repair­
ing like others to the neighboring house to 
warm his bruised and half frozen limbs, Mr. 
Gould 
t
oo k his position waist deep in 
water, wlaere he remained till he had saved 
the lives of about tÞenty persons. 
He also 
saved a vast amount of the money and proper­
ty entrusted to .his care by brokers and otheri. 
We are happy to learn that his noble conduct 
on that occasion has been noticed by several 
disinterested individuals in Boston, who will 
tender to Mr. G. a suitable token of their re­
gard for his exertions on that trying occasion. 
ÙCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. 
'Wlntl Carriages on the Prairies. 
A Mr: Thomas of Independence, Mo., has 
invented a sailing wagon with which he haΥ 
been successfully navigating the prairies.­
The inventor is said to have run about, with a 
light breeze, at the rate of eight miles an hour 
and he has reached twenty! 
The wagon 
has a wheel twelve feet in diameter, and one 
foot broad. 
It is ship rigged, cal'l'ies ballast, 
may be made of any si2;e, and the inventor 
guarantees to run a line of them, for passen­
gers or 
frieght, between Independence and 
Bent's Fort, thence to Santa Fe. 
We have no doubt of the practicahility of 
travelling by the' p.ower of the wind, on the 
level prairies, but in our opinion this might 
be effected with most advantage by the use 
of large kites with 
. 
guiding lines. 
By this 
mode 3
tendency of the wind to overturn the 
carriage-is wholly avoided, and the carriage 
would press more lightly on the earth. 
A Silent Ea 
.. 
thquake. 
Many persons in Havanna assert that at the 
time of the hurricane at Cuba and Key West, 
il'i addition to the tempest of wind and water, 
they distinctly felt a violent convulsion of the 
earth, like the heaving of an earthquake,.­
The results of the storm seem to confirm this 
assertion 
The little island 9f San Pe, off' 
Key 
West, on which the light house stood, disap­
peared in the storm, taking "",ith it the light 
house. 
What is very remarkable, is that the 
soundings off Key West arechanged. 
Where 
were shallows, now is deep water, and where 
was deep water now are shallows. 
This is 
the uniform mode in which conTulsions of the 
earth seem to act. 
1I11l1tal'Y Facilities. 
It is reported that the English Government 
is preparing to avail itself of the railroad f;cil­
ities of locomotion, for military operations:­
All the regular troops in the kingdom are to 
be concentrated, and stationed at three differΦ 
ent points, from which by the now numerous 
railroads, a part or tlae whole military force 
can be suddenly thrown upon any section of 
coast orcQuntry as oCC!\I!ion may require.-­
Uucle Sam has not yΧt got his'llet work quite 
perfect for such military movements: but the 
work Is in fair progress.

The Speakllg Auto_aton. 
Mr. Faber, like many 
other genius., is 
more successful in the exhibition of his mech­
anism in Europe than in this country. 
An 
English paper speaking of the automaton says; 
"The Automaton can plainly, at the will of 
the casual spectator, speak any sentence or 
words, in any langu:l.ge, sing, whisper, laugh, 
&c. 
; the organs of articulation are formed of 
caoutchouc-exactly resembling those apper­
taing to humanity-and by means of keys, and 
a bellows (for the 
lungs,) obstacles which 
have hitherto appeared insurmountable have 
been conquered." 
----
MadelOp at last. 
Mr. Thomas Harding, of Pyle, Eng., about 
fifty years ago, paid his addresses to Miss Mary 
Austen, but discontinued his attentions on ac­
count of some slight misunderstanding. 
This 
same couple have been recently married, how­
ever, the gentleman aged 69, and the lady 71 
years. IV 
e tender them our congratulations. 
New German paper. 
The editor of the German paper recently 
started in B6ston, promises to furnish his rea­
ders with' Kreigs-und, Freidensberichete, Na­
chrichten von Hunger, Pestilentz, Hochzeits­
und Sterbefallen, Liebesgeschichten, Zucht­
polizeigcrichtsberichtsbericete, 
Congressma­
crichlen and Luckenbissa.' 
It must be a va­
luable .paper. 
Loss of: tlae North Atneriea. 
The BjΪitish steam ehip North America was 
wrecked near Mount Desert, Me. on the 25th 
ult., in a manner strikingly similar to that of 
the destruction of the Atlantic 
She parted 
her steam box, and came to anchor; but drag­
ged her anchors and drifted upon the rocks, 
and soon went to pieces. Passengers all saved. 
Largo Casting. 
A bed-plate for making plate glass, and in­
tended for the Albany Glass Company, wΫs

New Haven Canal RaHroad. 
It is stated in the New Haven papers that 
the Canal Railroad has been located, that the 
grading will be commenced this week, and 
that there is not the least doubt of the speedy 
eompletion of the work. 
The Hartford peo­
ple will be compelled, in self defence, to ex­
tend a branch to meet this road at Plainville. 
Patrlotlsll1 and Generosity. 
Many of 
the cities and large towns from 
which the citizens have volunteered for the 
war, have made up large and generous contri­
butions of money and extra clothing for the 
use and comfort of the patriotic volunteers.­
This is right, whether the war is right or not 
right 
C08Jnophonography. 
It is stated in a Boston paper that Professor 
Gouraud has invented a system by which a 
person may write" with mathematical exact­
ness the pronunciatioll. of any language in the 
world." 
He has given the science the title 
above expressed, bu.t whic.h we cannot affbrd 
to repeat. 
Lehman'S Balloon. 
Mr, Lehman, who ascended a few days since 
in a balloon from New Orleanil, descended 
about 23 miles distant, after having been in 
the ail' 32 minutes; but in descending the bal­
loon came in contact with a fire kindled by the 
negroes of the plantation, by which the gas 
took fire and the balloon was consumed. 
The CalJlbridge Tclescope . 
The object glass for the great Cambridge 
Equatorial al'l'ived last week from Munich.­

ter and its focal length about 25 feet. 
It is said 
to have cost $13,000, 
Growing Cotton. 
A Southern planter has been sowing Ψndigo 
and cotton together. 
Perhaps he contem­
plates raising blue cotton; and should he wa­
ter the plants with nitric acid, he would prob­
ably raise gun cotton-if any. 
"ThanklglvlhgDaTOIl Sunday." 
Under this caption many of our exchanges 
have stated that the Governor of Tennessee 
has app.inted the last day of the present year 
as a day of 
thanksgiving. 
We 
cannot see 
what that has to do with Sunday, as the 31s1 
of December .happens to be on Thursday. 
The Patriotic Children. 
A son of ex-President Van Buren acted as 
aid to Gen. Taylor, at the siege of Monterey; 
a son of Henry Clay is Lieut. Colonel of II reg­
iment of Kentucky volunteers, and a son of 
Daniel Webster is captain of a company of vol­
unteers in the same service. 
A Great Blow-out. 
During one of the late gales, the ,Ωaters of
