Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) was investigated over unconventional catalysts, i.e. bin-
ary La2O3-ZrO2 and Y2O3-ZrO2 materials with or without tiny amounts (0.005 or 0.05 wt.%) of Ru in form
of nanoparticles with the size of about 1.1 nm. The results of catalytic tests and catalyst characterization
with complementary techniques enabled us to conclude that coordinatively unsaturated zirconium
cations (Zrcus) and neighboring lattice oxygen are catalytically active sites responsible for C3H6 formation.
Supported Ru species contribute to a minor extent to PDH but promote generation of Zrcus sites upon cat-
alyst reductive treatment or in situ under PDH conditions. The concentration of Zrcus sites can also be
increased through doping of ZrO2 with La2O3 or Y2O3 with the latter being a more efﬁcient dopant.
High activity, selectivity, and durability of our catalysts were veriﬁed by comparing their performance
under industrially relevant conditions with that of a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material in a
series of 60 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 C.

1. Introduction
Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly
used in polymer production [1]. The most common processes for
synthesis of this oleﬁn are steam cracking of naphtha and ﬂuidized
catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions [2]. Since they cannot
match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other pro-
cesses have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale pro-
duction, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well
as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3,4]. The latter
process is performed over supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts
[4–6]. Cr-containing compounds are, however, toxic and lead to
health and environmental concerns. On the other hand, Pt-based
catalysts are environmentally friendly. To ensure high dispersion
of Pt species, which is important for high activity and selectivity,
such catalysts, however, have to be treated under chlorine atmo-
sphere after removal of carbon deposits [5]. High price of Pt is
another shortcoming of Pt-based catalysts.
Stimulated
by
the
drawbacks
mentioned
above,
various
research groups in both industry and academia have attempted
to improve available commercial catalysts or to develop suitable
alternatives. Among the latter materials, those containing sup-
ported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identiﬁed to be the
most suitable candidates [5–15]. Isolated ions of Zn2+, Co2+, or
Fe2+ on the surface of SiO2 were also reported to be active in the
PDH reaction [16–18].
In our recent short communications, we introduced alternative
type of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, which have typically
been used as supports, i.e. Al2O3 [19] and ZrO2 promoted with
La2O3 [20]. In comparison with usually applied supported materi-
als, surface defects such as coordinatively unsaturated surface
metal cations (Alcus or Zrcus) were suggested to play an important
role in alkane dehydrogenation over the above unconventional cat-
alysts. We also reported that PDH activity of ZrO2 promoted with
La2O3 could be increased after depositing hydrogenation-active
metals such as Ru, Cu, Ni, and Co [20]. The metals were not
assumed to be directly responsible for the increase in the activity
but helped to increase the concentration of Zrcus sites through
reaction-induced reduction of ZrO2. Further comprehensive studies
are required to prove the dehydrogenation role of Zrcus and to
understand how its concentration can be tuned to affect the cata-
lyst activity.
From a structural viewpoint, such surface sites are located at
anion vacancies. The latter can be created upon doping of ZrO2
with oxides of metal with oxidation state of lower than 4+ as a
result of charge compensation [21]. It is also well known that

the ability of dopants for the substitution of Zr cations and forma-
tion of homogeneous binary solid solutions strongly depend on
the ionic radius of dopant metal cation, which should be close to
that of Zr4+ (0.79 Å). Not only the radius but also the kind of
dopant inﬂuence structural and mechanical properties of zirconia
as well as the concentration of oxygen vacancies [22]. Concentra-
tion of such defect sites and, therefore that of Zrcus sites, can also
be increased through high-temperature reduction of zirconia, e.g.
by H2. The higher the reduction temperature, the higher the num-
ber of oxygen vacancies [23]. Reducibility of ZrO2 can also be
improved when depositing hydrogenation-active metals on the
surface of zirconia. As documented in several previous studies
[24–26], the role of supported metals was to dissociate gaseous
hydrogen to highly reactive atomic hydrogen species. The latter
can leave the metal surface and spillover onto the support surface,
where they react with lattice oxygen yielding water and anion
vacancies [27,28].
In comparison with our previous short communication [20], the
purpose of the current work was to elucidate the fundamentals of
propane dehydrogenation over ZrO2-based catalysts, which are
required for tailored catalyst design. In particular, we focused on
(i) the kind of catalytically active sites as well as (ii) factors affect-
ing their formation and, in particular, activity. To investigate the
effect of dopant on catalytic activity, ZrO2 was promoted by either
La2O3 or Y2O3. In addition, these both binary oxides were impreg-
nated with tiny amounts (0.005 or 0.05 wt.%) of Ru in form of well-
deﬁned (about 1.1 nm in diameter) Ru nanoparticles. In situ UV–vis
analysis was used to monitor the effects of promoter and reduction
conditions on formation of anion vacancies (indirectly Zrcus sites).
Their concentration as a function of the type of dopant, the pres-
ence of Ru, and reduction temperature in an H2 ﬂow was deter-
mined from O2-pulse titration experiments in the temporal
analysis of product (TAP) reactor. Catalytic tests were performed
after different reduction treatments to correlate the activity with
the amount of Zrcus sites in the samples. Finally, the catalysts were
tested under alternating C3H8 and O2 feeds in the temperature
range from 550 to 625 C to check their activity, selectivity, and
durability in comparison with an industrially relevant K-CrOx/
Al2O3 material.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
RuCl3nH2O (37.2 wt.% Ru, Merck), ethylene glycol (99.8%,
Aldrich), NaOH (99%, Merck), acetone (>99%, Roth), toluene
(99.99%, Acros), and ethanol (absolute, J.T. Baker) were used for
synthesis of Ru nanoparticles (Ru NP) as described in Ref. [29]. Cat-
alysts were synthesized by impregnation of commercial supports
(LaZrOx (ZrO2 doped with 10 wt.% La2O3, MelChemicals) and YZrOx
(ZrO2 doped with 8 wt.% Y2O3, MelChemicals)) with colloidal solu-
tion of Ru NP. The samples were denoted according to the weight
percentage
of
ruthenium:
0.005Ru/LaZrOx,
0.005Ru/YZrOx,
0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx. They were calcined in ﬂowing
air directly before starting catalytic tests.
A reference catalyst (K-CrOx/Al2O3) was prepared according to
the protocol described in a patent of Süd-Chemie [30]. KOH (Mer-
ck), CrO3 (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), and Al2O3 (Saint-Gobain NorPro)
were used as starting materials. Brieﬂy, two aqueous solutions
with the required amounts of CrO3 and KOH were separately pre-
pared and then mixed together. Hereafter, Al2O3 was impregnated
with the resulting solution. The catalyst precursor was dried at
120 C overnight and ﬁnally calcined at 760 C for 4 h. The nominal
concentration of Cr2O3 and K2O in the resulting catalyst was 19.7
and 0.93 wt.%, respectively.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Speciﬁc surface areas (SBET) of the samples were determined
from nitrogen physisorption experiments at 77 K using a Belsorp
mini II setup (Bel Japan). Desorption isotherms were evaluated
according to the BET method.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a
Theta/Theta diffractometer X’Pert Pro (Panalytical) with Cu Ka
radiation (a = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) and an X’Celerator RTMS
detector. Phase composition of the samples was determined using
the program suite WinXPOW (Stoe & Cie) with inclusion of the
powder diffraction ﬁle PDF2 of the international center for diffrac-
tion data.
Transmission electron microscopy (JEM-ARM200F, E = 200 kV)
was used to determine size distribution of Ru NP after their depo-
sition from ethylene glycol solution onto copper grid.
Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-
OES, Varian 715-ES) was applied to ascertain Ru concentration.
In situ UV–vis measurements were carried out using an Avantes
spectrometer (AvaSpec-2048-USB2-RM) equipped with a high-
temperature reﬂection UV–vis probe, an Ava-Light-DH-S-BAL
deuterium-halogen light source, and a CCD array detector. The
probe consisting of six radiating optical ﬁbers and one reading ﬁber
was threaded through the furnace to face the wall of the quartz
tube reactor at the position where the catalyst (250 mg) was
located [31]. Before recording UV–vis spectra, the sample was
heated up to a certain temperature (550, 600, or 650 C) in Ar
and then treated in 20 vol.% O2 in Ar ﬂow for 1 h. After the oxida-
tive treatment, the catalyst was purged with Ar followed by treat-
ment in an H2 ﬂow (57 vol.% H2 in Ar) for 1 h. UV–vis spectra were
recorded in the range from 225 to 800 nm every 1 min during the
reduction stage. Barium sulfate (99.998%, Aldrich) was used as a
white standard.
For visualizing the progress of reduction process, a relative
reﬂectance (Rrel) was deﬁned as the ratio of the reﬂectance of sam-
ple treated in H2 to that of the fully oxidized one as given in Eq. (1).
From this relative reﬂectance, we calculated the relative Kubelka-
Munk function F(Rrel) according to Eq. (2).

The concentration of anion vacancies in the catalysts reduced at
550, 600, or 650 C was determined by O2-pulse experiments per-
formed at 550 C in the temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor
[32,33]. The catalyst (50 mg, particle size: 250–710 mm) was placed
in a quartz-tube microreactor between two layers of quartz (parti-
cle size: 250–350 mm). Before starting transient experiments, the
catalyst was treated in the following way. It was initially heated
in an O2 ﬂow (10 ml/min) up to 550 C with a heating rate of
10 K/min. Hereafter, the catalyst was either ﬂushed with N2 at
550 C for 5 min, or further heated in N2 ﬂow (10 ml/min) up to
600 or 650 C. At 550, 600, or 650 C it was exposed to an H2 ﬂow
(57 vol.% H2 in N2) for 1 h. After ﬁnishing the reductive treatment,
the catalyst was either cooled down to 550 C (for reduction at 600
and 650 C) during evacuation to ca. 70 Pa or directly evacuated
(for reduction at 550 C). Then it was exposed to high vacuum of
approximately 105 Pa.
The pulse experiments were performed using an O2:Ar = 1:1
mixture. Ar (5.0) and O2 (4.5) were applied without additional
puriﬁcation. The pulsing was continued until no changes were
observed in the intensity of O2 pulses during the last 30–40 pulses.
Such experiment was repeated at least 3 times for each reduction

temperature. The amount of oxygen consumed was quantiﬁed
from signals at AMUs 32 (O2) and 40 (Ar) recorded with a quadru-
pole mass spectrometer (HAL RC 301 Hiden Analytical).
2.3. Catalytic testing
All catalytic tests were performed at 1 bar in an in-house devel-
oped setup consisting of 15 continuous-ﬂow ﬁxed-bed tubular
reactors made of quartz. The rate of propene formation was deter-
mined from the amount of propene formed at a degree of propane
conversion below 10% (Eq. (3)). In a ﬁrst series of tests, the cata-
lysts (40 mg) were heated in an N2 ﬂow up to 550 C followed by
feeding air for 1 h. Hereafter, they were purged with N2 for
15 min and then exposed to a ﬂow (20 ml/min in total) of C3H8
(40 vol.% C3H8) in N2.

To investigate the effect of reduction treatment on catalyst
activity, another series of tests was performed as follows. After
the above oxidative treatment, the catalysts (40 mg) were reduced
in a ﬂow of 57 vol.% H2 in N2 at different temperatures (550, 575,
600, 625, and 650 C) and then tested for their PDH activity at
550 C with a total ﬂow of C3H8-N2 mixture (40 vol.% C3H8) of
20 ml/min. All tests in this series were performed with the same
sample for each catalyst. First the catalysts were reduced at
550 C. After the corresponding PDH test at 550 C, the catalysts
were reoxidized at 550 C and then reduced at another tempera-
ture followed by performing PDH at 550 C and reoxidation at
the same temperature. The order of reduction temperature in the
series was 550, 575, 600, 625, and 650, and again 550 C.
To determine an apparent activation energy of propene forma-
tion, the rate of propene formation was measured at 525, 550, 575,
600, and 625 C. The catalysts (40 mg) were heated in an N2 ﬂow
up to 525 C and then calcined in an air ﬂow for 1 h. After ﬂushing
with N2 for 15 min, they were treated in an H2 ﬂow (57 vol.% H2 in
N2) for 1 h and again purged with N2. Hereafter, the catalysts were
exposed to a ﬂow of C3H8-N2 mixture (40 vol.% C3H8) and the rate
of propene formation was measured. In a next step, the catalysts
were treated as described above but at 550, 575, 600, or 625 C,
where the rate was also measured. To achieve propane conversion
below 10% at each temperature, the total ﬂow of the reaction feed
was adjusted to 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 ml/min for 525, 550, 575,
600, and 625 C respectively. Another series of tests was similarly
carried out but the reductive H2-treatment was always performed
at 625 C before measuring the rates of propene formation
between 525 and 625 C. The rate is reported after 150 s on stream.
To benchmark our catalysts, we compared their performance
with that of K-CrOx/Al2O3 (reference material) in 60 PDH/regener-
ation cycles at 550, 600, and 625 C using total ﬂow of C3H8-N2
mixture of 10, 40, and 60 ml/min, respectively. In these experi-
ments, the amount of each catalyst sample was 300 mg. Before
the ﬁrst PDH stage all catalysts were calcined in a ﬂow of air at
550 C for 1 h. The PDH and regeneration stages continued for 30
and 15 min, respectively, and were separated by purging with N2
for 15 min. The regeneration stage was performed in ﬂowing air
at the PDH temperature.
The feed components and the reaction products were analyzed
by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890) equipped with
PLOT/Q (for CO2), AL/S (for hydrocarbons), and Molsieve 5 (for
H2, O2, N2, and CO) columns as well as with ﬂame ionization and
thermal conductivity detectors.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic materials and their characterization
The speciﬁc surface areas (SBET) of bare LaZrOx and YZrOx were
determined to be 84.2 and 73.9 m2/g, respectively. According to
X-ray diffraction analysis, these materials were exclusively com-
posed of the tetragonal phase (Fig. S1 in the Supporting Informa-
tion (SI)). No reﬂexes of crystalline La2O3 or Y2O3 were detected.
Thus, in agreement with previous studies [34,35], doping of ZrO2
with La2O3 or Y2O3 leads to stabilization of ZrO2 in the tetragonal
phase due to creation of oxygen vacancies in the structure of
ZrO2 [36].
The
0.005Ru/LaZrOx,
0.005Ru/YZrOx,
0.05Ru/LaZrOx,
and
0.05Ru/YZrOx catalysts were prepared by impregnation of LaZrOx
or YZrOx with a colloidal solution of Ru NP with an average diam-
eter of 1.1 nm. TEM image and size distribution of Ru NP deposited
from ethylene glycol solution onto copper grid are shown in Fig. S2
in SI. As proven in our previous study with Rh/Al2O3 also possess-
ing tiny amount of Rh, the NP size does not signiﬁcantly change
after their deposition on supports and even after approximately
180 h on stream in partial oxidation of methane at 800 C
[29,37]. The concentration of Ru determined by ICP analysis in
0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx was found to be 0.06 wt.% and
0.03 wt.% respectively. The samples 0.005Ru/LaZrOx and 0.005Ru/
YZrOx contain too low amount of Ru to be precisely determined.
3.2. Formation of Zrcus sites and quantifying their concentration
Formation of oxygen vacancies upon catalyst reduction in H2
was monitored by in situ UV–vis analysis. In order to avoid any
contribution of electron transitions related to Ru to the UV–vis
spectrum of zirconia, we used bare LaZrOx and YZrOx. The samples
were initially heated in air to a certain reaction temperature (550,
600, or 650 C) and tempered for 1 h. Hereafter, the air ﬂow was
replaced by an H2 ﬂow (57 vol.% H2 in Ar). Since neither reaction
temperature nor position of UV–vis ﬁber was changed in this
experiment,
the
obtained
UV–vis
spectra
represent
solely
reaction-induced changes of the catalysts. For an illustration of
such changes, temporal evolution in F(Rrel) of LaZrOx and YZrOx
at 550 C is given in Fig. 1. The corresponding results at 600 and
650 C are shown in Fig. S3 in SI. A band with a maximum at
around 420 nm rose up during H2 treatment upon increasing time
on stream. Such changes in the UV–vis spectra should be related to
formation of oxygen vacancies. According to Gionco et al. [38], cre-
ation of oxygen vacancies leads to the appearance of several tran-
sition energy levels of 3.5–3.8 eV above the valence band of ZrO2.
Electron transitions from these levels into the conduction band
are accompanied by optical absorption in the visible light thresh-
old. This results in a change of catalyst color from white to grey,
as we actually observed in our experiments. Thus, we can safely
conclude that oxygen vacancies and accordingly Zrcus sites are
formed upon H2 treatment of LaZrOx and YZrOx. The rate of their
formation increased with treatment temperature and was higher
for the latter catalyst as can be concluded from the temporal pro-
ﬁles of F(Rrel) at 420 nm at 550, 600, and 650 C in Fig. 1(c) and (d).
Since UV–vis spectroscopy cannot be used for quantifying the
concentration of anion vacancies, we performed O2-multipulse
experiments at 550 C in the TAP reactor with LaZrOx, YZrOx,
0.05Ru/LaZrOx, and 0.05Ru/YZrOx reduced at 550, 600, or 650 C.
The concentration of anion vacancies was calculated from the
amount of O2 consumed under the assumption that one O2 mole-
cule ﬁlls two vacancies. For the regular tetragonal ZrO2, removal
of one oxygen from the bulk results in creation of 4 Zrcus. However,
the coordination of lattice oxygen changes when considering cor-
284

ners, steps, and surface that makes it difﬁcult to determine how
many Zrcus sites are really created upon reductive catalyst treat-
ment. Thus, the concentration of anion vacancies should be consid-
ered as semi-quantitative measure of Zrcus.
Fig. 2 shows the effect of catalyst composition and reduction
temperature on the concentration of anion vacancies. As expected
from in situ UV–vis and catalytic tests, the concentration increased
with an increase in the temperature, at which the catalysts were
treated in H2. Bare YZrOx has about two times higher concentration
of such sites than LaZrOx, while the difference practically disap-
pears for the corresponding materials with Ru NP. The Ru-
containing catalysts possess, however, around 100 times higher
number of anion vacancies compared with bare YZrOx and LaZrOx.
For checking whether large oxygen consumption over 0.05Ru/
LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx can be explained by oxidation of Ru to
RuO2, we performed a control O2 titration test with 0.05Ru/Al
(60 wt.%)-Si(40 wt.%)Ox (non-reducible support) possessing the
same Ru nanoparticles as the ZrO2-based catalysts. Only around
6.6  1017 O atoms were consumed per one gram of 0.05Ru/Al
(60)-Si(40)Ox reduced at 550 C. This amount is equal to approxi-
mately 10% of the amount required for complete conversion of
Ru to RuO2 and is close to the number of surface Ru atoms. It is also
signiﬁcantly lower than 5  1018 and 7  1018 O atoms consumed per
one gram of 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx respectively. Thus,
such high oxygen consumption over the latter materials should
be related to reﬁlling oxygen vacancies of ZrO2. This phenomenon
(support over-reduction in the presence of supported metals) has
frequently been described in the literature for low noble metal
loadings (0.01–1 wt.%) [39–43]. We cannot, however exclude that
bulk oxygen vacancies were also titrated in these experiments
owing to high oxygen mobility within ZrO2 lattice. As previously
reported in Ref. [44], bulk oxygen diffusion in ZrO2 occurs between
300 and 450 C, i.e. at lower temperatures than 550 C in our O2
titration tests.
3.3. Kinetics of propane dehydrogenation
To compare the catalyst PDH activity, we determined the initial
(after 150 s on stream, Fig. S4 in SI) rate of propene formation at
550 C at a degree of propane conversion below 10%. The tests were
performed with both oxidized and reduced samples for elucidating
the effect of catalyst treatment (oxidative vs. reductive) on its PDH
activity. Irrespective of the treatment and catalyst composition,
propene was formed with selectivity between 98 and 99%. The
main side products were CH4, C2H4, and C2H6. Table 1 shows the
rate of propene formation over oxidized catalysts. One can see that
all YZrOx-based catalysts are more active than their LaZrOx-based
counterparts. It is also obvious that the presence of Ru increases
catalytic activity. However, the increase is not directly proportional
to the metal loading and depends on the kind of second metal in
the binary ZrO2-based catalysts. Possible fundamental origins of
the effects of ZrO2 promoter and the presence of Ru on catalyst
PDH activity are discussed in Section 3.4 under consideration of
characterization data presented in Section 3.1.
The effect of reductive catalyst treatment on the rate of propene
formation was studied in a series of PDH tests at 550 C with the
catalysts reduced at different temperatures before the PDH reac-
tion. When comparing the rates obtained over LaZrOx-based cata-
lysts oxidized (Table 1) or reduced at 550 C (Fig. 3), one can
conclude that the latter materials showed up to approximately
two times higher activity. The positive effect of reductive treat-
ment is signiﬁcantly less pronounced for the YZrOx-based catalysts.
As in case of oxidized catalysts, the presence of supported Ru NP
also improved the activity of reduced catalysts.

Another important observation from Fig. 3 is the inﬂuence of
temperature of catalyst reductive treatment on the rate of propene
formation measured at 550 C. For bare LaZrOx and YZrOx, the rate
augmented with increasing reduction temperature. This effect
must be related to an increase in the concentration of catalytically
active sites, which were formed on the surface of LaZrOx and YZrOx
during their reduction at high temperatures. Compared to the Ru-
free binary materials, the activity of the 0.005Ru/LaZrOx and
0.005Ru/YZrOx catalysts only slightly increased, whereas the activ-
ity
of
the
0.05Ru/LaZrOx
and
0.05Ru/YZrOx
catalysts
even
decreased (Fig. 3) with an increase in reduction temperature.
The following explanation suggests that such behavior of the
latter materials cannot be due to irreversible catalyst deactivation
caused by reduction at high temperature. As described in Sec-
tion 2.3, the reduction temperature was increased from 550 to
650 C with steps of 25 K, while the catalyst sample was not
exchanged but oxidatively regenerated at 550 C after testing
PDH at the same temperature. For checking catalyst stability, we
performed a control PDH test with a reduction step at 550 C after
completing PDH tests with the same sample, which had been
reduced at higher temperatures (up to 650 C). It is seen in Fig. 3
(open symbols) that the high-temperature treatment did not sig-
niﬁcantly inﬂuence initial (after ﬁrst reduction of fresh sample at
550 C) catalyst activity.
To check whether and how Ru NP inﬂuence propane dehydro-
genation kinetics, we also determined apparent activation energy
(Ea) of propene formation in two series of catalytic tests performed
between 525 C and 625 C. It is worth noting that propane conver-
sion without any catalyst (blank activity) was only 0.2 and 1.6% at
550 and 625 C respectively thus even with the latter value being
well below about 10% in the presence of catalyst. In a ﬁrst series,
the catalysts were reduced at a certain reaction temperature in
H2 before measuring the rate of propene formation at the same
temperature. The obtained Arrhenius plots are shown in Fig. 4
(closed symbols). For all samples, we obtained a linear dependence
of ln(r(C3H6)) on 1/T in the 525–575 C range. No deviation from
the Arrhenius plot for LaZrOx and YZrOx was observed at higher
temperatures (600 C), but the slope of the Arrhenius plot for
0.005Ru/LaZrOx and 0.005Ru/YZrOx between 575 C and 625 C
was lower than between 525 C and 575 C (Fig. 4(b)). Even a
decrease in the rate of propene formation was observed for
0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx when the reaction temperature
was increased from 600 to 625 C (Fig. 4(c)). Any mass transport
limitations can be excluded as a possible reason for the nonlinear-
ity of ln(r(C3H6)) on 1/T dependence observed for Ru-containing
catalysts above 575 C because LaZrOx and YZrOx showed higher
activity but followed the same Arrhenius dependence between
525 C and 625 C. The unusual high-temperature behavior of Ru-
containing catalysts is supposed to be associated with the effect

of reductive treatment on the concentration of PDH active sites
(see Section 3.4).
We now analyze the Arrhenius plots in Fig. 4 (closed symbols)
for the temperature range between 525 C and 575 C, i.e. where
a linear dependence was obtained. For this temperature range an
apparent activation energy (Ea) was determined for each catalyst
studied (Table 1). Two important conclusions can be drawn: (i)
the Ea values for Ru-containing samples were lower than for bare
binary oxides and (ii) all YZrOx-based catalysts have lower Ea than
their LaZrOx-based counterparts. It should be, however, mentioned
that these values do not correspond to the PDH reaction exclu-
sively according to the below reasoning. As seen in Fig. 3, the rate
of propene formation at 550 C could be increased when the cata-
lysts had been reduced at higher temperatures in H2 probably due
to an increased concentration of active sites created upon the cat-
alyst reduction. For the catalysts that were reduced at PDH temper-
ature, the determined Ea values should additionally include the
energy required for formation of active sites during reductive
treatment.
To exclude the effect of reduction temperature on the formation
of such sites, we performed additional tests at different reaction
temperatures but with the catalysts, which had always been
reduced at 625 C, i.e. the highest reaction temperature. In this
case, the concentration of PDH active sites does not depend on
reaction temperature and so determined Ea should be related to
the PDH reaction only. Arrhenius plots for all catalysts reduced at
625 C are shown in Fig. 4 (open symbols). In comparison with
the test described above (catalyst reduction at PDH temperature),
a linear dependence between ln(r(C3H6)) on 1/T was obtained for
both bare LaZrOx and YZrOx as well as 0.005Ru/LaZrOx and
0.005Ru/YZrOx catalysts in the whole temperature range (525–
625 C). However, irrespective of the type of catalyst reductive
treatment, the rate of propene formation over 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and
0.05Ru/YZrOx followed an Arrhenius dependence between 525
and 575 C and practically did not change with a further increase
in temperature. Such unusual high-temperature behavior might
be due to over-reduction of the samples in situ under reaction con-
ditions thus resulting in a change of the intrinsic activity of PDH
active sites or their concentration (see Section 3.4).
The acquired Ea values for LaZrOx, YZrOx, 0.005Ru/LaZrOx, and
0.005Ru/YZrOx are given in Table 1. They are lower than those
determined for the same catalysts but reduced at PDH tempera-
ture, because they do not include the energy required for genera-
tion of PDH active sites in the latter case. Moreover, the Ea values
for LaZrOx and YZrOx became very close to those for 0.005Ru/
LaZrOx and 0.005Ru/YZrOx (approximately 170 and 150 kJ/mol
respectively). This strongly suggests that Ru NP are not the main
catalytically active sites.

3.4. Active sites for propane dehydrogenation and factors affecting
their concentration
On the basis of the above results and our previous study [20], as
well as under consideration of literature data on alkane dehydro-
genation
over
CrOx-
[45–47]
and
GaOx-containing
catalysts
[48,49], we put forward that a PDH active site consists of Zrcus
and neighboring lattice oxygen (Fig. 5(a)). Such pair is responsible
for breaking C–H bond in C3H8 resulting in the formation of surface
Zrcus-C3H7 and O–H species. After the elimination of the b-
hydrogen in the former species, gas-phase C3H6 and H2 are formed
and the active site is regenerated.
Concentration of Zrcus sites was proven to rise upon doping of
ZrO2 with Y2O3 or La2O3, with the former being a more efﬁcient
promoter (Fig. 2(a) and (b)). Such sites are also generated when
ZrO2-based catalysts are reduced in H2 before the PDH reaction.
Supporting tiny amounts of Ru on the surface of YZrOx and LaZrOx
affected catalyst reducibility particularly at low temperatures
(Fig. 2). The supported metal catalyzes this process due to its abil-
ity for H2 activation followed by removal of lattice oxygen in form
of water with a simultaneous formation of Zrcus sites. However,
when designing new catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, one should
avoid their over-reduction under PDH conditions or upon reductive
catalyst treatment. As seen in Fig. 3, high-temperature reduction of
0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx results in a decrease in their high
PDH activity. Such behavior can also be obtained when performing
PDH reaction above 575 C, where catalyst over-reduction occurs
in situ by propane, propene, or hydrogen (Fig. 4(c)). We have three
general suggestions for interpreting the effect of catalyst over-
reduction on PDH activity. As mentioned above, both Zrcus and
neighboring surface lattice oxygen are a part of the PDH active site
(Fig. 5(a)). Concentration of the latter species will, however,
decline with an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction; thus,
C3H8 dehydrogenation will be hindered. Alternatively, the intrinsic
activity of Zrcus sites may change with an increase in their unsatu-
ration degree, which depends on the amount of oxygen removed
from the catalyst. These two options are indirectly supported by
the following discussion. To estimate an apparent degree of surface
reduction (degree of removal of surface lattice oxygen), we used
the number of lattice oxygen in the most stable (101) face of
tetragonal zirconia and the concentration of anion vacancies
shown in Fig. 2. The obtained values are summarized in Table 2.
For bare YZrOx and LaZrOx, the highest degree achieved after cata-
lyst reduction at 650 C was lower than 1%, while the correspond-
ing values for 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx were 11 and 13%
respectively. The reduction degree of these catalysts treated at
600 C in H2 was 3.2 and 6.4% and signiﬁcantly higher than those
for bare YZrOx and LaZrOx. The high reduction degree of 0.05Ru/
LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx may be a reason for a change in the slope
in the corresponding Arrhenius plots above 575 C.
Another possible explanation of the abnormal Arrhenius depen-
dence of Ru-containing catalysts can be related to high oxygen
mobility in the lattice of zirconia. When a certain surface reduction
degree is achieved, bulk lattice oxygen diffuses to the surface and
ﬁlls surface oxygen vacancies. As a consequence, the concentration
of surface Zrcus sites decreases (Fig. 5(b)). The higher the reduction
temperature and degree, the greater is the oxygen mobility [50].
3.5. Practical relevance of ZrO2-based catalysts
To check practical relevance of our catalysts, we performed
additional tests consisting of 60 PDH/regeneration cycles under
industrially relevant degrees of propane conversion. The regenera-
tion stage consisted of oxidation in air for 15 min followed by
ﬂushing with N2 for 15 min. No reductive catalyst treatment was
carried out. K-CrOx/Al2O3 was also investigated under the same
conditions as a reference material. For all catalysts tested, weight
hourly space velocity (WHSV) with respect to propane was 1.57,
6.29, and 9.43 h1 at 550, 600, and 625 C respectively. The cata-
lysts were initially tested at 550 C (20 cycles) followed by an
increase in temperature to 600 C for the next 20 cycles. Hereafter,
10 cycles were again carried out at 550 C and ﬁnally the catalysts
were tested at 625 C (10 cycles). The selectivity toward propene
was higher than 85% for all catalysts during the whole experiment.
Time-on-stream proﬁles of propene yield in the ﬁrst catalytic
cycle at each reaction temperature are shown in Fig. 6. The corre-
sponding data for all cycles at each temperature are shown in
Fig. S5 in SI. The yield over all LaZrOx-catalysts continuously
increased with rising time on stream at 550 C and passed over a
maximum after ﬁrst 10 min in case of YZrOx-based catalysts. Such
increase conﬁrms in situ reduction of samples under reaction con-
ditions and therefore formation of Zrcus sites.
For LaZrOx-based catalysts, the presence of Ru inﬂuenced the
extent of propene yield increase, which was most pronounced for
0.05Ru/LaZrOx. For all samples, the yield at higher temperatures
(600 C and 625 C) passed through a maximum or continuously
decreased with time on stream. The decrease is due to catalyst
deactivation caused by blocking of catalytically active sites by car-
bon deposits formed from propene. The catalysts completely

restored their performance after oxidative regeneration at reaction
temperature (Fig. S5 in SI).
To compare the catalysts in terms of propene production, we
determined an overall amount of propene (mC3H6) produced in
each PDH cycle. To this end, we integrated the time-on-stream pro-
ﬁles of propene yield under consideration of WHSV. The obtained
mC3H6 values for all 60 PDH cycles are given in Fig. 7. All catalysts
showed good durability from cycle to cycle at 550 C. The amount
of propene produced over K-CrOx/Al2O3 was only slightly higher
than that over YZrOx-based catalysts, which performed similar to
each other irrespective of Ru loading. LaZrOx-based samples
yielded noticeably lower propene amount, which was positively
affected by Ru presence. As expected the mC3H6 values at 600 C
are signiﬁcantly higher than at 550 C. Again, K-CrOx/Al2O3 showed
the highest average productivity. However, the difference with
respect to ZrO2-based catalysts became less pronounced. This is
due to different activation/deactivation kinetics of the catalysts,
with K-CrOx/Al2O3 and 0.05Ru/YZrOx showing the highest deacti-
vation rate (Fig. 6(b)). All catalysts did not practically change their
productivity within 20 PDH cycles at 600 C and in the following 10
PDH cycles at 550 C performed after the tests at 600 C.
The amount of propene produced within one PDH cycles could
be further increased when the PDH reaction was performed at
625 C (Fig. 7) but only over LaZrOx and 0.005Ru/LaZrOx, since they
were least deactivating. These catalysts performed superior to K-
CrOx/Al2O3. The catalysts with 0.05 wt.% Ru produced the lowest
propene amount, which even slightly decreased from cycle to
cycle. This is probably related to over-reduction of these catalysts
under PDH conditions, i.e. some irreversible changes in the struc-
ture/morphology of binary oxides might happen under alternating
dehydrogenation/reoxidation cycles.
In summary, ZrO2-based catalysts showed both high activity
and durability in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, which
were similar to those of a K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material. The
obtained knowledge about the nature of active sites provides fun-
damentals for further improving PDH performance by a proper cat-
alyst
design.
Nevertheless,
deep
understanding
of
factors
governing the kinetics of C3H8 activation, formation of side prod-
ucts and, in particular, catalyst deactivation is still required. This
is topic of continuing research in our group.
4. Conclusions
In this study we demonstrated that unconventional ZrO2-based
materials are active and durable for non-oxidative propane dehy-
drogenation and perform similar to a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3
reference material. Their catalytic behavior was established to
depend strongly on the type of dopant, the presence and concen-
tration of Ru on their surface, as well as the temperature of reduc-
tive treatment. All these factors inﬂuence concentration of Zrcus,
which together with neighboring lattice oxygen participate in acti-

vating C–H bond in C3H8 to yield C3H6. In comparison with La2O3,
Y2O3 was found to be a more efﬁcient promoter for ZrO2 in terms of
generation of Zrcus sites and accordingly PDH activity. Reductive
treatment of the catalysts in an H2 ﬂow at high temperatures sig-
niﬁcantly increases catalytic activity due to creation of Zrcus sites.
The presence of Ru on the surface of ZrO2-based materials acceler-
ates reduction of ZrO2 thus also yielding such sites. However, to
ensure high PDH activity, catalyst over-reduction should be
avoided because it either results in a drop in the concentration of
surface lattice oxygen also playing an active role in propane activa-
tion, or favors oxygen diffusion from the bulk to ﬁll surface anion
vacancies thus decreasing the concentration of Zrcus sites.
