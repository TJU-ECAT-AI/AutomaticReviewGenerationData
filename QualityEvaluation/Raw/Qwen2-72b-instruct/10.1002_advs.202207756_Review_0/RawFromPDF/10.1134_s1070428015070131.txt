Abstract—1-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-[(triphenyl-λ5-phosphanylidene)hydrazinylidene]ethanone reacted with 
4-aryl(hetaryl)-2,4-dioxobutanoic acids to give 2-{2-[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]hydrazinyl}-4-
aryl(hetaryl)-4-oxobut-2-enoic acids which were shown to exist in solution as mixtures of Z- and E-isomeric 
enehydrazine tautomers. The products underwent cyclization to 3-{[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]-
hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(hetaryl)furan-2(3H)-ones.

Chemical transformations of 3-hydrazinylidene-
(imino)furan-2(3H)-ones afforded a variety of com-
pounds [1–10], including those possessing biological 
activity [11–15]. Introduction of a pharmacophoric 
adamantyl fragment [16–19] into molecules of 3-hy-
drazinylidenefuran-2(3H)-ones extends the potential of 
these compounds as biologically active substances. 
Cyclization of 4-aryl-2-(2-methylidenehydrazinyl)-4-
oxobut-2-enoic acids by the action of aliphatic carbox-
ylic acid anhydrides [20–22] is one of the most con-
venient methods of synthesis of 5-aryl-3-hydrazinyli-
denefuran-2(3H)-ones containing various substituents 
in the hydrazine moiety. The initial acids can be pre-
pared by reaction of (triphenyl-λ5-phosphanylidene)-
hydrazones (phosphazenes) with 4-aryl-2,4-dioxobuta-
noic acid derivatives [13].  
We have synthesized 3-{[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-
2-oxoethylidene]hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(hetaryl)fur-
an-2(3H)-ones by cyclization of 2-hydrazinyl deriva-
tives of 4-aryl(hetaryl)-4-oxobut-2-enoic acids contain-
ing a pharmacophoric adamantyl fragment. By reaction 
of 2,4-dioxobutanoic acids 1a–1e with an equimolar 
amount of triphenylphosphazenes 2a and 2b in anhy-
drous toluene we obtained 2-{2-[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-
yl)-2-oxoethylidene]hydrazinyl}-4-aryl(hetaryl)-4-
oxobut-2-enoic acids 3a–3f in good yields (Scheme 1).  
Acids 3a–3f were isolated as yellow crystalline 
substances. They showed in the IR spectra absorption 
bands in the regions 3124–3290 (NH), 1703–1723 
(C=O, acid), 1662–1678 (AdC=O), and 1583– 
1638 cm–1 C4=O, C=C, C=N). The reduced carbonyl 
stretching vibration frequencies suggest formation of 
strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the Z isomers 
of 3a–3f. 
According to the 1H NMR data, compounds 3a–3f 
in DMSO-d6 exist as mixtures of Z- and E-isomeric 
enehydrazine tautomers A–C, structure A prevailing 
(36–64%). Unlike structurally related compounds  
[13, 20–26], no β-ketohydrazone tautomers of 3a–3f 
were detected. Structure A displayed in the 1H NMR 
spectrum a multiplet at δ 1.62–2.48 ppm from protons 
in the adamantyl substituent, a singlet at δ 6.24– 
6.88 ppm from the vinylic proton, a multiplet at  
δ 7.04–8.03 ppm from aromatic (heteroaromatic) pro-
tons, and singlets at δ 7.77–8.06 (CH=N) and 12.46–
13.42 ppm (NH). Isomer B (25–56%) was character-
ized by singlets due to vinylic proton at δ 6.43– 
7.03 ppm, N=CH proton at δ 7.72–8.15 ppm, and NH 
proton at δ 14.77–15.58 ppm. The corresponding 
signals of isomer C (6–13%) were observed at 6.51–
7.11, 7.31–7.75, and 10.88–11.94 ppm, respectively.

1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(het-
aryl)furan-2(3H)-ones 4a–4f as orange crystalline sub-
stances. Their IR spectra contained absorption bands 
due to stretching vibrations of the C2=O carbonyl 
group in the furan ring (1790–1857 cm–1), adamantoyl 
carbonyl (1672–1692 cm–1), and C=C and C=N bonds 
(1584–1631 cm–1). In the 1H NMR spectra of 4a–4f, 
adamantyl protons appeared as a multiplet at δ 1.69–
2.39 ppm, the 4-H proton in the furan ring resonated as 
a singlet at δ 6.82–7.20 ppm, aromatic proton signals 
were located at δ 6.60–7.99 ppm, and the CH=N 
proton gave a singlet at δ 7.91–8.15 ppm.  
The proposed synthetic route to furan-2(3H)-ones 
4a–4f is of preparative significance, and it ensures 
high yield of the products. The direct reaction of  
5-arylfuran-2,3-diones with triphenylphosphazenes 
derived from diazo ketones is accompanied by anoma-
lous diaza-Wittig reaction involving the lactone 
carbonyl group with formation of 2-hydrazinylidene 
derivatives despite the presence of a ketone carbonyl 
group in the initial heterocycle [27–29]. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
The IR spectra were recorded on an FSM-1202 
spectrometer (Russia) from samples dispersed in 
mineral oil. The 1H NMR spectra were measured on  
a Varian Mercury Plus-300 spectrometer at 300 MHz 
using DMSO-d6 as solvent and hexamethyldisiloxane 
as internal standard. The purity of the isolated com-
pounds was checked, and the progress of reactions was 
monitored, by TLC on Sorbfil PTSKh P-A-UF-254 
plates using diethyl ether–benzene–acetone (10 : 9 : 1) 
and ethyl acetate–hexane (5 : 1) as eluents; spots were 
detected under UV light. The elemental analyses were 
obtained on a LECO 932 CNH(S) analyzer. 
Acids 3a–3f (general procedure). A suspension of 
0.01 mol of acid 1a–1e and 0.01 mol of triphenylphos-
phazene 2a or 2b in 30–40 mL of anhydrous toluene 
was stirred at 20–25°C until complete dissolution of 
the reactants. The resulting solution was cooled to  
0–5°C, and the precipitate was filtered off and recrys-
tallized from acetonitrile.
