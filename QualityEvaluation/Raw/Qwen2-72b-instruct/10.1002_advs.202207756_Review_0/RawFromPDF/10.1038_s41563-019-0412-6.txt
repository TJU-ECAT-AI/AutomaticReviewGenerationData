O
ne frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous 
materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in 
the desired framework or extraframework position1–4. For 
instance, in the case of zeolites containing pores and/or cavities of 
different dimensions, it is clear that locating the active sites selec-
tively in one specific type of pore or cavity is a fundamental chal-
lenge with important implications for their catalytic application, due 
to differences in geometric and confinement effects. For instance, 
attempts have been reported to preferentially locate framework 
Al atoms in the intersectional sites or within the 10MR channels 
of ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite)5–7. However, when functional metals, 
such as Pt or Pd, have been introduced by including the metal pre-
cursor during the synthesis or through interzeolite transformations, 
nanoparticles of 1–2 nm instead of subnanometric metal species 
(single atoms or clusters) have been obtained within the MFI zeo-
lite8–11. As far as we know, the metal particles show random distribu-
tion within the zeolite crystallites. From the materials and catalysis 
point of view, the following challenges remain unsolved: (1) to gen-
erate stable subnanometric metal species within the zeolite crystal-
lites, (2) to stabilize them regioselectively within the 10MR channels 
and (3) to achieve the above goals with purely siliceous MFI zeolite 
and to avoid the presence of acid sites in the final material. Note 
that if these three objectives were achieved a very regular distribu-
tion of metal clusters of about 0.5 nm would be obtained, that is 
with the diameter of the 10MR channels, which would be highly 
stable against Ostwald ripening sintering, even at high temperature 
(>550 °C) under a reductive atmosphere12,13. This type of material 
should open new possibilities for a number of catalytic applications, 
including the very relevant activation of alkanes14–17.
It has been demonstrated that subnanometric Pt clusters show 
higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for propane dehydrogena-
tion reaction18. However, when Pt clusters are supported on solid 
carriers with open structures, these Pt clusters may suffer fast 
deactivation, and the subsequent regeneration–reaction cycles will 
lead to severe sintering of Pt. Therefore, if regular Pt clusters can 
be regioselectively generated within the 10MR channels of a purely 
siliceous MFI zeolite, the resultant catalyst should present not only 
high activity, but also an improved stability when working under 
high-temperature conditions.
To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of 
Pt-MFI materials. The starting hypothesis was that the template 
molecules (TPA+OH−) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence 
limiting the access of Pt species to this position. Considering the 
larger space in the sinusoidal channels versus the straight channels, 
Pt species may preferentially be located in the sinusoidal channels. 
A controllable amount of K+ is introduced to compensate the silanol 
groups, and to stabilize the subnanometric Pt species19–21. Finally, 
atomically dispersed Sn species can also be introduced to electroni-
cally modify the Pt clusters to increase propylene selectivity for the 
propane dehydrogenation reaction.
Encapsulation of Pt particles in MFI zeolite
As illustrated in Fig. 1a,b, by a one-pot synthesis strategy, Pt spe-
cies can be encapsulated into purely siliceous MFI zeolite with a Pt 
loading of about 0.4 wt% (Supplementary Table 1). All the Pt-zeolite 
materials with different chemical compositions show typical 
X-ray diffraction patterns of MFI zeolite (Supplementary Fig. 1). 
Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has 
significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species. As 
shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of 3–5 nm in 
the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnano-
metric Pt clusters of about 0.4–0.7 nm are the dominant species in 
the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3). To investigate the 
role of K, we first characterized the as-synthesized, non-calcined, 
Regioselective generation and reactivity control 
of subnanometric platinum clusters in zeolites for 
high-temperature catalysis

Subnanometric metal species (single atoms and clusters) have been demonstrated to be unique compared with their nanopar-
ticulate counterparts. However, the poor stabilization of subnanometric metal species towards sintering at high temperature 
(>500 °C) under oxidative or reductive reaction conditions limits their catalytic application. Zeolites can serve as an ideal sup-
port to stabilize subnanometric metal catalysts, but it is challenging to localize subnanometric metal species on specific sites 
and modulate their reactivity. We have achieved a very high preference for localization of highly stable subnanometric Pt and 
PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite, as revealed by atomically resolved electron microscopy 
combining high-angle annular dark-field and integrated differential phase contrast imaging techniques. These catalysts show 
very high stability, selectivity and activity for the industrially important dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene. This 
stabilization strategy could be extended to other crystalline porous materials.

Pt-zeolite samples (K-Pt@MFI-SDA and Pt@MFI-SDA), obtained 
in the presence and absence of K, by electron microscopy. As shown 
in Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5, only atomically dispersed Pt species 
are detected in both as-synthesized samples, as confirmed by image 
simulation (Supplementary Fig. 6). Herein, to identify the location of 
Pt atoms in Pt@MFI-SDA and K-Pt@MFI-SDA, we have employed a 
combination of high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scan-
ning transmission electron microscopy (HR HAADF-STEM) and 
integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) imaging techniques to 
simultaneously visualize both Pt atoms and the zeolite structure with 
atomic resolution22,23. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, by corre-
lating the HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC images, it can be deduced 
that most Pt atoms are located in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI 
zeolite structure, whereas a far smaller number are found in the 
straight pore channels or at the intersectional voids. This regioselec-
tive distribution of Pt species may be caused by the occupation of the 
intersectional voids by the template (TPA+), as well as by the avail-
ability of larger spaces in the sinusoidal channels compared with the 
straight channels (Supplementary Fig. 7)24–26. The characteristics of 
the location of Pt atoms described above are the same when the syn-
thesis is carried out in the presence of K+ (K-Pt@MFI-SDA sample), 
 
indicating that K+ does not play a relevant role in the encapsula-
tion of atomically dispersed Pt species during the hydrothermal 
synthesis. This conclusion is also confirmed from characteriza-
tion by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 8 and 
Supplementary Table 2). A short-distance contribution at about 
2.0 Å can be ascribed to Pt–O/N bonding, while the contribution of 
Pt–Pt bonding is not observed in either sample.
A subsequent calcination in air at 600 °C to remove the organic 
template in the as-synthesized Pt-MFI materials gives rise to the for-
mation of Pt nanoparticles in the K-free Pt@MFI-air sample, indi-
cating the migration and subsequent sintering of Pt (Supplementary 
Fig. 9). However, as presented in Supplementary Fig. 10, Pt remains 
atomically dispersed after calcination in air in the K-Pt@MFI-air 
sample. Interestingly, its location within the 10MR sinusoidal chan-
nels remains almost unchanged when compared with the as-synthe-
sized K-Pt@MFI-SDA sample. A main contribution at about 2.0 Å, 
corresponding to Pt–O bonding, is observed in the extended X-ray 
absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum of the K-Pt@MFI-air 
sample (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 3), while 
a typical Pt–Pt bonding at about 2.7 Å is observed in the K-free Pt@
MFI-air sample. The results from STEM-iDPC imaging and X-ray

absorption spectroscopy indicate that the role of K is related to the 
stabilization of Pt atoms during the calcination process, avoiding 
their sintering into Pt nanoparticles19,20.
As shown in Supplementary Fig. 12, the number of –OH groups 
in the K-free Pt-zeolite samples measured by infrared spectroscopy 
decreased significantly after the introduction of K+ (ref. 27). A plau-
sible explanation is that the –OH groups in the K-free zeolite are 
replaced by –O−K+ species. Furthermore, the –O−K+ species can 
interact with the positively charged Pt species by forming stabilized 
–O–Pt species during the high-temperature calcination in air. If the 
K+ in the K-Pt@MFI-air sample was exchanged for NH4
+, Pt atoms 
sintered into Pt nanoparticles in the subsequent calcination at 600 °C 
in air and reduction treatment by H2 at 600 °C (Supplementary Fig. 13 
 
and Supplementary Fig. 14).
Most interestingly, when the K-containing K-Pt@MFI-air sam-
ple was reduced in H2 at 600 °C, Pt atoms turned into subnano-
metric clusters, as shown in Fig. 1d. The low white-line intensity 
in the Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) 
spectrum of the K-Pt@MFI sample (Fig. 2a) indicates the presence 
of metallic Pt after the H2 reduction treatment. The coordination 
number of first-shell Pt–Pt (NPt–Pt) bonding for the K-Pt@MFI sam-
ple is about 6.6 (Table 1), corresponding to an average size of about 
0.9 nm (Fig. 1h)28. Considering that the average size of Pt clusters 
and Pt nanoparticles is about 0.55 nm and about 2 nm respectively, 
then about 80% of Pt atoms should be located in the internal space 
of MFI crystallites as subnanometric clusters while about 20% of 
Pt atoms exist as Pt nanoparticles (according to the following sim-
ple estimation: 80% × 0.55 + 20% × 2 ≈ 0.85 nm). In the case of the 
K-free Pt@MFI sample, the first-shell NPt–Pt is about 10.6, corre-
sponding to an average size of 4–5 nm, as shown in Fig. 1g.
Determination of the location of subnanometric Pt clusters
Considering the structure of MFI zeolite, one can expect that sub-
nanometric encapsulated Pt clusters may distribute in different 
locations (including the straight channels, intersectional voids and 
sinusoidal channels). Therefore, we have analysed the HR HAADF-
STEM results in further detail. For the K-Pt@MFI sample, as dis-
played in Fig. 3a,c, 0.4–0.6 nm Pt clusters can be clearly observed 
as high-intensity areas along the [010] direction, while the 10MR 
straight channels appear as low-intensity pores. Corresponding HR 
HAADF-STEM images in greyscale are shown in Supplementary 
Fig. 17. However, due to the weak contrast of the zeolite framework 
and its sensitivity to the electron beam, the detailed structure of the 
MFI zeolite is not well revealed in the HR HAADF-STEM image. 
By using the newly developed iDPC technique, the atomic struc-
ture of the MFI zeolite can be recorded simultaneously with the HR 
HAADF-STEM image under low-dose conditions (Fig. 3b)22,23. As 
presented in Fig. 3d, the detailed structure of the MFI zeolite can be 
clearly identified in the iDPC image, even the 5 R units in the frame-
work. Since HR HAADF-STEM imaging is more sensitive to heavy

elements (Pt in this work), and the structural information of the 
zeolite framework is finely captured by iDPC imaging, the precise 
location of subnanometric Pt clusters can be reliably identified by 
correlating the paired images. The results demonstrate that Pt clus-
ters of 0.4–0.6 nm are preferentially located in the sinusoidal chan-
nels (see more images in Supplementary Figs. 18–22). The location 
of Pt clusters has also been confirmed by STEM-iDPC imaging on 
a zeolite crystallite with the tilted-[010] orientation (see Fig. 3e–h), 
showing that the subnanometric Pt clusters overlap with the sinu-
soidal channels.
Synthesis of bimetallic PtSn@MFI
Following the same synthesis procedure, a second metal component 
such as Sn can be introduced together with Pt. Similar to the situa-
tion observed before, after calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free 
PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles (Supplementary 
Fig. 23) while the Pt species in the K-PtSn@MFI sample remain 
atomically dispersed (Supplementary Fig. 24), as in the as-synthe-
sized K-PtSn@MFI-SDA sample (Supplementary Fig. 25). After 
reduction by H2 at 600 °C, large Pt nanoparticles are formed in the 
PtSn@MFI sample (Fig. 1e,i and Supplementary Fig. 26), while sub-
nanometric Pt clusters (~0.5 nm) are formed in the K-PtSn@MFI 
sample (Fig. 1f,j and Supplementary Fig. 27).
According to the XANES results (Fig. 2a), Pt species also exist 
in the metallic state in the PtSn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples. 
 
As shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, the K-free PtSn@MFI has a 
first-shell NPt–Pt of about 10.7, corresponding to Pt nanoparticles 
of 4–5 nm, while a first-shell NPt–Pt of about 6.4 is found for the 
K-PtSn@MFI sample, corresponding to an average size of about 
0.9 nm. These results further confirm the critical role of K+ in stabi-
lizing subnanometric Pt species18–20.
Following the same approach, we have studied the location 
of subnanometric Pt and Sn species in the K-PtSn@MFI sample 
by paired HR HAADF-STEM (Supplementary Fig. 28 images in 
greyscale) and iDPC imaging. As can be seen in Fig. 3i–p, subnano-
metric Pt and Sn species are also located in the 10MR sinusoidal 
channels of the MFI zeolite (see additional images in Supplementary 
Figs. 29–33). The oxidation state of Sn in the unreduced K-PtSn@
MFI-air sample is determined to be Sn iv. After reduction by H2, a 
decrease in the white-line intensity and a redshift of the spectrum 
is observed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample. As shown in Fig. 2c, the 
shape of the XANES spectra of the reduced K-PtSn@MFI does not 
resemble either Sn metal or SnO, suggesting a possible formation of 
SnO4 − x species. This can also be supported by the reduction in the 
first-shell intensity of |FT| (Fig. 2d), indicating the loss of neigh-
bouring oxygen. The idea that Sn species are well dispersed within 
the K-PtSn@MFI sample is supported by the EXAFS spectrum, 
since no additional higher shells are observed. Furthermore, we 
have found that the EXAFS spectrum of K-PtSn@MFI is different 
from that of Sn-Beta, indicating that Sn exists as an extraframework 
species (Supplementary Fig. 35)29,30.
The interaction between Pt and Sn in the K-PtSn@MFI sample 
 
has been investigated by CO infrared spectroscopy. As can be 
seen in Supplementary Fig. 36, the CO adsorption bands at 1,887 
and 1,719 cm−1 can only be observed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample, 
indicating that the introduction of Sn can modulate the electronic 
structure of Pt clusters. These bands are probably related to the for-
mation of bimetallic PtSn species31.
As shown in Fig. 3q–t, the simulated images with Pt or Sn clusters 
located in the sinusoidal channels are consistent with the experi-
mental images. According to our simulation results (Supplementary 
Figs. 37 and 38), it is possible to differentiate single Pt and Sn atoms 
from the zeolite framework. Indeed, we have observed a few singly 
dispersed atoms (Pt or Sn) in both K-Sn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI 
samples (Supplementary Figs. 39 and 40). Considering the average 
particle size obtained from the EXAFS results, the number of sin-
gly dispersed Pt atoms in the K-Pt@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples 
should be low and Pt should mainly exist as subnanometric clusters 
(Supplementary Fig. 41).
Determination of the Pt and Sn distributions in K-PtSn@MFI
As displayed in Fig. 4a–f, K, Sn and Pt are homogeneously distrib-
uted in the K-PtSn@MFI sample according to the X-ray energy 
dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) mapping. However, due to the res-
olution limitation, it is not possible to determine the relative spatial 
relationship between Sn and Pt. To overcome the limitation of XEDS 
on such beam-sensitive samples, we have attempted, on the basis of 
the imaging simulation results (Supplementary Figs. 42–44), to dis-
criminate Pt and Sn distributions by a k-means clustering analysis 
of the HR HAADF-STEM images (see Supplementary Information 
for details). As shown in Fig. 4g–i, subnanometric Pt and Sn species 
can be identified according to their different contrasts in the HR 
HAADF-STEM images. Then, in the image depicting the distribu-
tion of the Pt and Sn species (Fig. 4h) after k-means clustering, it is 
possible to pick out the Pt and Sn species that are in contact, simply 
by selecting those that fall at a distance shorter than 0.1 nm in Fig. 4h.

This distance threshold was selected on the basis of the first-shell 
Sn–O distance found in the EXAFS analysis. As a result, it is possible 
to estimate the presence of bimetallic PtSn clusters in the K-PtSn@
MFI sample that are made up of two neighbouring Pt and Sn units 
rather than alloyed clusters, as shown in Fig. 4h. The statistical 
 
analysis shows that about 40% of the subnanometric metal clusters 
automatically detected in the experimental image of Fig. 4g fall at a 
distance below 0.1 nm. It should be noted that this is a rough esti-
mate, since the image analysis is based on two-dimensional projec-
tion images. This may result in an overestimation of the fraction of 
bimetallic clusters, since Pt and Sn at different depths may overlap 
in the STEM image. The complexity of the experimental images also

tallic clusters due to the difficulty of discriminating single Pt atoms 
and Sn clusters, as illustrated in Supplementary Figs. 42 and 43.
Additionally, in the experimental HR HAADF-STEM images 
of the K-PtSn@MFI sample, we have found areas showing inten-
sity profiles similar to those observed in simulation results 
(Supplementary Fig. 45). The formation of such a subnanomet-
ric Pt–SnOx interfacial structure can explain the absence of Pt–Sn 
bonding in the EXAFS results, since Pt and Sn are not in the form of 
conventional PtSn alloy nanoparticles32–35.
Catalytic studies of Pt-zeolite materials
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was chosen as a 
model reaction to test the reactivity and stability of Pt particles 
or clusters encapsulated in pure-silica MFI zeolite. As can be seen 
in Fig. 5a, Pt@MFI was initially active but a fast deactivation was 
observed. Therefore, regeneration of the deactivated sample was 
carried out by a calcination treatment in air at 600 °C followed by 
a subsequent reduction by H2 at 600 °C. However, fast deactivation 
was still observed in the second and third cycles (Supplementary 
Figs. 46 and 47). Agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles was observed 
with the used Pt@MFI catalyst after three catalytic cycles 
(Supplementary Fig. 48). When Sn was introduced as a promotor, 
the resultant PtSn@MFI showed a significantly enhanced activity 
and selectivity (Fig. 5b), in consistence with previous works on sup-
ported PtSn catalysts36,37. However, the PtSn@MFI catalyst also suf-
fered severe deactivation during the regeneration–reaction cycles. 
As displayed in Supplementary Figs. 49 and 50, the PtSn@MFI 
catalyst only showed about one-third of its initial reactivity in the 
third cycle, which is caused by the sintering of Pt (Supplementary 
Fig. 51). Furthermore, a high initial activity was observed with the 
K-Pt@MFI sample, indicating the high reactivity of subnanometric 
Pt clusters (Fig. 5c). However, large quantities of cracking products 
(methane, ethylene and ethane) were formed, and the K-Pt@MFI 
catalyst also suffered a fast deactivation due to the coke formation. 
Interestingly, as demonstrated in Supplementary Figs. 52–54, the 
reactivity of the deactivated K-Pt@MFI catalyst can be fully recov-
ered by at least three cycles of calcination–reduction treatment, and 
the subnanometric Pt clusters remain stable during these processes.
According to the above results, by the combination of K and 
Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced. Indeed, 
as shown in Fig. 5d, the K-PtSn@MFI sample shows high reac-
tivity under the same reaction conditions as used before. More 
importantly, the selectivity to propylene at the initial stage is 
already quite high (~90%) and the lifetime of the catalyst is signif-
icantly extended. It should be noted that the K-Sn@MFI sample

without Pt is not active for this reaction, indicating that Sn only 
modulates the reactivity of Pt. The high catalytic performance of 
K-PtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reaction–regen-
eration cycles without obvious deactivation (see Supplementary 
Figs. 55 and 56). The size and spatial location of the subnano-
metric Pt clusters are preserved after reaction, which is con-
firmed by EXAFS and electron microscopy characterizations 
(Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Figs. 57–61). The Pt 
clusters in the K-PtSn@MFI sample remain subnanometric even 
after oxidation–reduction treatment at 700 °C (Supplementary 
Figs. 62 and 63). The reactivity and recyclability of different 
Pt-zeolite catalysts has been compared in terms of initial turnover 
frequency, mass activity and deactivation rate (Supplementary 
Table 5 and Supplementary Figs. 64 and 65). These results clearly 
demonstrate that subnanometric PtSn clusters confined in the 
10MR channels are a highly stable and selective catalyst for the 
propane dehydrogenation reaction.
For comparison, a reference K-PtSn/MFI sample with the same 
chemical composition as the K-PtSn@MFI sample was also prepared 
by conventional incipient wetness impregnation (Supplementary 
Fig. 66), containing well dispersed Pt particles of 0.4–1.2 nm. The 
STEM-iDPC images show that Pt species appear in several types of 
position in the MFI zeolite, including the sinusoidal channels and 
straight channels as well as the intersectional void (Supplementary 
Figs. 67 and 68). As shown in Supplementary Figs. 69 and 70, the 
K-PtSn/MFI sample presented a fast deactivation during the pro-
pane dehydrogenation reaction, and its reactivity declined after 
each regeneration treatment. Large Pt nanoparticles are formed 
in the used K-PtSn/MFI catalyst after three catalytic cycles 
(Supplementary Fig. 71), indicating the advantage of K-PtSn@MFI 
catalyst with regioselective location of subnanometric Pt clusters in 
sinusoidal channels.
Outlook
The concept of regioselective localization of extraframework metal 
species demonstrated in this work can be extended to other crys-
talline porous materials, including both metal–organic frameworks 
and zeolites. Moreover, the use of two complementary STEM-
based techniques (HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC) can be a general 
approach for studying the position of metal species in heteroge-
neous metal catalysts at atomic level.

Methods
One-pot synthesis of MFI zeolites with encapsulation of Pt. Synthesis of 
Pt@MFI material (Pt nanoparticles encapsulated in purely siliceous MFI). Pt 
nanoparticles encapsulated in MFI zeolite were prepared by a one-pot synthesis. 
First, a tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) solution was prepared by 
mixing 8.12 g of K-free TPAOH solution (40 wt%, from Alfa-Aesar, product 
code 17456.22) and 20.1 g of distilled water at room temperature. Then, 8.24 g 
tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was hydrolysed with the TPAOH solution at room 
temperature for 6 h under stirring (500 r.p.m.). The resultant solution was divided 
into two parts with the same weight. To each portion of the solution, 80 μl H2PtCl6 
aqueous (0.38 mol l−1) and 150 μl of ethylenediamine were added with stirring 
for 10 min. The resultant yellow solution was then transferred to Teflon-lined 
autoclaves and heated in an electric oven at 175 °C for 96 h under static conditions. 
The amount of Pt in the final product is 0.43 wt%. After the hydrothermal process, 
the solid product was isolated by filtration and washed with distilled water and 
acetone and then dried at 60 °C. Then the solid sample was calcined under an air 
flow at 560 °C for 8 h and then at 600 °C for 2 h.
Synthesis of PtSn@MFI material (PtSn nanoparticles encapsulated in purely siliceous 
MFI). Bimetallic PtSn nanoparticles encapsulated in MFI zeolite were prepared 
by a one-pot synthesis. Firstly, a TPAOH solution was prepared by mixing 8.12 g 
of K-free TPAOH (40 wt%, from Alfa-Aesar, product code 17456.22) and 20.1 g 
of distilled water at room temperature. Then, 8.24 g TEOS was hydrolysed with 
TPAOH at room temperature for 6 h under stirring (500 r.p.m.). The resultant 
solution was divided into two parts of equal weight. To each portion of the 
solution, 80 μl of aqueous H2PtCl6 (0.38 mol l−1), 28 mg of SnCl4 and 150 μl of 
ethylenediamine were added with stirring for 10 min. The resultant yellow solution 
was then transferred to Teflon-lined autoclaves and heated in an electric oven 
at 175 °C for 96 h under static conditions. The amounts of Pt and Sn in the final 
product were 0.44 wt% and 1.0 wt%, respectively. After the hydrothermal process, 
the solid product was isolated by filtration and washed with distilled water and 
acetone and then dried at 60 °C. Then the solid sample was calcined under air flow 
at 560 °C for 8 h and then at 600 °C for 2 h.
Synthesis of K-Pt@MFI (K-promoted Pt clusters encapsulated in purely siliceous 
MFI). K-promoted Pt clusters encapsulated in MFI zeolite were prepared by a 
one-pot synthesis. First, a TPAOH solution was prepared by mixing 5.0 g of K-free 
TPAOH solution (40 wt%, from Alfa-Aesar, product code 17456.22) and 6.24 g 
of TPAOH solution (20 wt%, from Sigma-Aldrich, containing ~0.6 wt% of K, 
product code 254533–100 G) and 17.0 g of distilled water at room temperature. 
Then, 8.24 g TEOS were hydrolysed with the TPAOH solution at room temperature 
for 6 h under stirring (500 r.p.m.). The resultant solution was divided into two 
parts of equal weight. To each portion of the solution, 80 μl of aqueous H2PtCl6 
(0.38 mol l−1) and 150 μl of ethylenediamine were added and stirred for 10 min. 
The resultant yellow solution was then transferred to Teflon-lined autoclaves and 
heated in an electric oven at 175 °C for 96 h under static conditions. The amounts 
of Pt and K in the final product were 0.42 wt% and 0.6 wt%, respectively. After the 
hydrothermal process, the solid product was isolated by filtration and washed with 
distilled water and acetone and then dried at 60 °C. Then the solid sample was 
calcined under air flow at 560 °C for 8 h and then at 600 °C for 2 h.
Synthesis of K-PtSn@MFI (K-promoted PtSn bimetallic clusters encapsulated in 
purely siliceous MFI). K-promoted PtSn bimetallic clusters encapsulated in MFI 
zeolite were prepared by a one-pot synthesis. First, a TPAOH solution was prepared 
by mixing 5.0 g K-free TPAOH solution (40 wt%, from Alfa-Aesar without 
K, product code 17456.22) and 6.24 g TPAOH (20 wt% from Sigma-Aldrich, 
containing ~0.6 wt% of K, product code 254533–100 G) and 17.0 g of distilled water 
at room temperature. Then, 8.24 g TEOS was hydrolysed with the TPAOH solution 
at room temperature for 6 h with stirring (500 r.p.m.). The resultant solution was 
divided into two parts with equal weight. To each portion of the solution, 80 μl of 
aqueous H2PtCl6 (0.38 mol l−1), 50 mg of SnCl4 5H2O and 150 μl of ethylenediamine 
were added to the above solution and the mixture stirred for 10 min. The resultant 
yellow solution was then transferred to Teflon-lined autoclaves and heated in an 
electric oven at 175 °C for 96 h under static conditions. The amounts of Pt, Sn and 
K in the final product were 0.42 wt%, 0.9 wt% and 0.65 wt%, respectively. After 
the hydrothermal process, the solid product was isolated by filtration and washed 
with distilled water and acetone and then dried at 60 °C. Then the solid sample was 
calcined under air flow at 560 °C for 8 h and then at 600 °C for 2 h.
Synthesis of K-PtSn/MFI by conventional incipient wetness impregnation. First, 
a K-promoted purely siliceous MFI support was prepared. 5.0 g K-free TPAOH 
solution (40 wt%, from Alfa-Aesar without K, product code 17456.22) and 6.24 g 
TPAOH (20 wt% from Sigma-Aldrich containing ~0.6 wt% of K, product code 
254533–100 G) and 17.0 g of distilled water at room temperature. Then, 8.24 g 
TEOS were hydrolysed with the TPAOH solution at room temperature for 6 h with 
stirring (500 r.p.m.). The resultant solution was divided into two parts with equal 
weight and then transferred to Teflon-lined autoclaves and heated in an electric 
oven at 175 °C for 96 h under static conditions. After the hydrothermal process, 
the solid product was isolated by filtration and washed with distilled water and 
acetone and then dried at 60 °C. Then the solid sample was calcined under air flow 
at 560 °C for 8 h and then at 600 °C for 2 h.
Taking this K-MFI as support, Pt and Sn together with ethylenediamine 
are introduced into the K-MFI support by conventional incipient wetness 
impregnation. The amounts of Pt and Sn are the same as for the K-PtSn@MFI 
sample prepared by one-pot synthesis.
Characterization. Powder X-ray diffraction was performed with a HTPhilips 
X’Pert MPD diffractometer equipped with a PW3050 goniometer using Cu Kα 
radiation and a multisampling handler.
Samples for electron microscopy studies were prepared by dropping the 
suspension of the solid samples in CH2Cl2 directly onto holey-carbon-coated 
copper grids. Electron microscopy measurements were performed using two 
types of microscope. A non-corrected JEOL 2100 F microscope operating at 
200 kV in both transmission (TEM) and scanning transmission modes (STEM) 
was used to record HAADF, Z-contrast, images at low resolution. HR HAADF-
STEM and STEM-iDPC imaging was performed on a double-aberration-
corrected, monochromated, FEI Titan3 Themis 60–300 microscope working at 
300 kV. The last technique, iDPC imaging, provides in this microscope atomically 
resolved images in which the contrasts are related to the atomic number of the 
elements under the beam, instead of the roughly Z2-dependent contrasts obtained 
in HAADF-STEM images. By using a four-segment detector, this technique 
allows imaging light elements, such as O, in the presence of heavier ones (Si, 
Z = 14) under very low-electron-dose conditions, a key aspect in the atomic-scale 
structural analysis of zeolites, which are very sensitive to electron beams. In 
particular, 2048 × 2048 HAADFiDPC image pairs were recorded simultaneously 
using a convergence angle of 18.6 mrad and a camera length of 91 mm. This 
configuration allowed us to optimize the collection of the signals on the HAADF 
and FEI DF4 detectors. To limit the damage by the electron beam, a fast image-
recording protocol was used by combining a beam current of 30 pA, a 2.5 μs dwell 
time and an automated fine-tuning alignment of A1 and C1 using the OptiSTEM 
software. To obtain images with good quality, the beam current and image 
acquisition time should be optimized according to the stability of the sample 
under the beam.
The microscope was also used to perform chemical mapping at medium 
magnifications (approximately 100k to 200k) by STEM-XEDS using the 
high-efficiency SuperX G2 detection system equipped in the microscope, 
which integrates four windowless detectors surrounding the sample and high-
performance signal-processing hardware. STEM-XEDS was used to map the spatial 
distribution of both metallic (Sn, Pt, K) and non-metallic elements (Si, O). For 
this nanoanalytical experiment, the beam current was increased to 100 pA and the 
dwell time to 128 μs to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio. Then, the elemental 
maps were background subtracted and smoothed by 3 pixel × 3 pixel averaging.
To determine the spatial distribution of the metallic species within the zeolite 
framework, a specific methodology for the digital analysis of the experimental 
images has been developed and coded in a home-made MATLAB script. First, 
to improve the signal-to-noise, the HR HAADF-STEM images were denoised 
by combining the Anscombe transform and undecimated wavelet transforms38. 
Then, a user-independent, fully automated, segmentation of image contrasts by 
clustering techniques (k-means method) was applied to recognize and classify 
the metallic entities, which is a requirement to guarantee statistically meaningful 
and unbiased results.
To support the k-means clustering analysis and interpretation of the details 
of the experimental images, HR HAADF-STEM image simulation was carried 
out using TEMSIM software39. The complex structural models used as input in 
these simulations were built using the Rhodius software developed at UCA40. To 
approach the experimental imaging conditions as closely as possible, a mixture of 
Poisson and white Gaussian noise was added to the simulated images. Then, the 
same methodology as used to analyse the experimental images was applied to the 
deliberately noise-corrupted simulated images.
X-ray absorption experiments at the Pt (11,564 eV) LIII and Sn (29,200 eV) 
K edges were performed in the ALBA synchrotron41. The beam was 
monochromatized using Si(111) and (311) double crystals, respectively; harmonic 
rejection was performed using Rh-coated Si mirrors. The spectra were collected in 
transmission (Pt LIII-edge) and fluorescence (Sn K-edge) modes by means of the 
ionization chambers filled with appropriate gases (Pt LIII edge, 95% N2 + 5% Kr for 
I0 (ionization chamber 0, located before the sample) and 17.1% N2 + 82.9% Kr for 
I1 (ionization chamber 1, located after the sample); Sn K edge, 89.4% N2 + 10.6% 
Kr for I0 and 100% Kr for I1) and a fluorescence solid-state detector. Samples in 
the form of self-supported pellets of optimized thickness were located inside 
an in-house-built multipurpose cell described by Guilera et al. allowing in situ 
experiments42. Several scans were acquired at each measurement step to ensure 
spectral reproducibility and good signal-to-noise ratio. The data reduction and 
extraction of the χ(k) function were performed using the Athena code43. EXAFS 
data analysis was performed using the Artemis software43. Phase and amplitudes 
were calculated with the FEFF6 code. The values of E0 (inflection point in the first 
derivative of XANES spectra) used for data alignment taken from the literature 
were the following: 29,200 eV for Sn metal, 29,201 eV for SnO, 29,204 eV for SnO2 
and 11,564 eV for Pt metal.

Infrared spectra of adsorbed CO on Pt-zeolite and Sn-zeolite samples were 
recorded at room temperature with a Nexus 8700 FT infrared spectrometer using a 
deuterated triglycine sulphate detector acquiring at 4 cm−1 resolution. An infrared 
cell allowing in situ treatments in controlled atmospheres and temperatures from 
25 °C to 500 °C was connected to a vacuum system with gas dosing facility. For 
infrared studies the samples were pressed into self-supported wafers and pretreated 
in H2 flow at 450 °C for 2 h followed by vacuum treatment (10–5 mbar). After 
activation the samples were cooled to 25 °C under dynamic vacuum conditions 
followed by CO dosing at increasing pressure (0.4–8.5 mbar). Infrared spectra were 
recorded after each dosage of CO.
The dispersion of Pt in Pt-zeolite materials was estimated from CO adsorption 
using the double-isotherm method on Quantachrome Autosorb-1C equipment44,45. 
Before adsorption, the samples (200–300 mg) were reduced in situ in flowing 
pure H2 (25 ml min−1) at 600 °C for 1 h with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 from room 
temperature to 600 °C. After the reduction treatment, the samples were degassed 
at 1.33 Pa for 2 h at 600 °C and then cooled to about 40 °C. Then pure CO was 
admitted and the first adsorption isotherm (that is, the total CO uptake) was 
measured. After evacuation at 25 °C, the second isotherm (that is, the reversible 
CO uptake) was measured. The amount of chemisorbed CO was then obtained 
by subtracting the two isotherms. The pressure range studied was 0.5–11 × 104 Pa. 
The dispersion of Pt (D) was calculated from the amount of irreversibly adsorbed 
CO assuming a stoichiometry of Pt/CO = 1. The mean particle size (d) of Pt was 
determined from chemisorption data assuming spherical geometry for the metal 
particle according to the procedure. Equations used for calculation of metal 
dispersion and metal particle size are shown below.

Catalytic studies of Pt-zeolite materials for propane dehydrogenation reactions. 
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was chosen as a model reaction to 
test the reactivity and stability of Pt particles or clusters encapsulated in pure-silica 
MFI zeolite. The reaction was performed with a fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric 
pressure using N2–propane as feed gas at 600 °C. The products were analysed using a 
gas chromatograph that can detect cracking products (methane, ethene and ethane), 
propylene, C4, C5 and aromatics. Before reaction, the catalyst was reduced by H2 flow 
(35 ml min−1) at 600 °C for 1 h with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature 
to 600 °C. After the reduction pretreatment, the atmosphere was changed to reaction 
feed gas (5 ml min−1 of propane and 16 ml min−1 of N2 as balance gas). After the 
propane dehydrogenation test, the sample was cooled to about 100 °C and began to 
be regenerated by calcination in air at 600 °C for 2 h with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 
from about 100 °C to 600 °C. After calcination in air, the sample was cooled to about 
100 °C again and then reduced by H2 at 600 °C for 1 h with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 
from about 100 °C to 600 °C before the second cycle of the propane dehydrogenation 
reaction. After the second cycle of propane dehydrogenation, the sample was cooled 
to about 100 °C and began to be regenerated by calcination in air at 600 °C for 2 h 
with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 from about 100 °C to 600 °C. After calcination in air, 
the sample was cooled to about 100 °C again and then reduced by H2 at 600 °C for 1 h 
with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 from about 100 °C to 600 °C before the third cycle of 
the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
