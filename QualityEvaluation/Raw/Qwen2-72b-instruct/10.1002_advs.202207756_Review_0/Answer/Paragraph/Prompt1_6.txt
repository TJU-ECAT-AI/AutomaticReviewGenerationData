PDH, alongside methanol-to-olefins (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins processes, addresses the limitations of traditional methods. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, central to PDH, have seen evolving understanding, with active Ga species debated. Recent research highlights [GaH]2+ ions paired with a basic framework oxygen as critical active sites, offering insights into the catalyst's mechanism. This knowledge advances the field, guiding catalyst design and optimization for efficient propylene production.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00814a"},
{"DOC": "The rise in propylene demand has highlighted propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a vital production method, alongside traditional techniques. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, known for their hydrocarbon activation and high efficiency, are pivotal in PDH. The debate over active Ga species persists, with recent studies indicating that strong acid sites in the catalyst enhance Ga dispersion, crucial for PDH. The 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst, with well-dispersed gallium and high dehydrogenation efficiency, is the most active. Support effects on catalytic performance, including the dispersion of Ga2O3 species, are a significant research area, requiring detailed investigation to understand their impact on gallium species and activity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c6ra27204e"},

{"DOC": "Propylene demand growth has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an alternative to conventional methods, bolstered by lower propane prices due to North American shale gas. PDH aligns with green chemistry, offering high atom economy and potential for renewable feedstocks. Developing active, selective, and stable catalysts is crucial for PDH's viability. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, central to propane aromatization, are in scientific debate over active Ga species. Recent research highlights promising catalysts with high activity and stability. Preparation strategies and optimal Ga loadings are key for enhanced dehydrogenation rates. DFT calculations suggest Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs are more active than isolated Ga+, facilitating CH bond activation and reducing H2 elimination barriers.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},
{"DOC": "Renewed interest in PDH for propylene production, driven by high demand and low propane costs, highlights Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts' effectiveness due to their high stability and selectivity. The debate over active Ga species involves Bell's single [GaH]2+ sites versus Schreiber's Ga+H+ pair sites, with recent research favoring the latter. Phadke's findings suggest that Ga species associated with Al-pairs are more effective in catalyzing propane and butane dehydrogenation than isolated Ga species, indicating a mechanism difference between propane and ethane dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1sc05866e"},
{"DOC": "Rising propylene demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative to steam cracking. The Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH have been a subject of debate, particularly regarding the active Ga species. Recent studies pinpoint coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations as crucial for dehydrogenation activity, although the exact nature of active sites is still under discussion. Research has also shown that CO2 can boost olefin yields and that promoter addition, such as potassium, reduces coke formation and increases selectivity. The effects of hydrogen and steam on catalyst activity and the benefits of promoting GaOx-based catalysts with metals like Pt for hydrogen desorption and active site regeneration have been explored.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"}
