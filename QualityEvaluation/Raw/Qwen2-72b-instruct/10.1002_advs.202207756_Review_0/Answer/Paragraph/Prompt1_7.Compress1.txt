{"DOC": "The increasing demand for propylene, a key chemical used in various industries, has widened the gap between supply and demand, as it is traditionally produced as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units. The abundance of natural gas has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a viable alternative, with two commercial processes, Catofin using CrOx/Al2O3 and Oleflex using Pt-based catalysts. Due to the high cost of Pt and environmental concerns with Cr, research has focused on alternative PDH catalysts, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Ga/H-ZSM-5 is recognized for its efficiency in dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism remain debated. Experimental techniques have been employed to probe Ga speciation, with proposed Ga species including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early studies suggested isolated Ga+ ions as the main species, but alternative interpretations propose low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. Recent research by Phadke et al. supports single [GaH]2+ sites as active centers for PDH, independent of Ga/Al ratio, while Schreiber et al. reported Ga+H+ paired sites as more active than single Ga+ sites.

{"DOC": "The increasing demand for propylene, a key chemical used in various industries, has widened the gap between supply and demand, as it's traditionally produced as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units. The abundance of natural gas has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a viable alternative, with two commercial processes using CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-based catalysts. Due to the high cost of Pt and environmental concerns with Cr, alternative PDH catalysts like Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 have been developed.
