{"DOC": "Propylene, a critical chemical for industries like polypropylene and acrylonitrile production, faces a widening supply-demand gap due to its traditional production as a by-product and the increasing use of natural gas. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) emerges as a viable alternative, with Catofin and Oleflex processes using CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-based catalysts, respectively. Concerns over Pt's cost and Cr's health impacts have spurred research into alternative PDH catalysts, including Ga/H-ZSM-5, recognized for its efficiency in dehydrogenation. However, the identity of catalytic active sites and the PDH reaction mechanism remain debated. Studies suggest various Ga species, with isolated Ga+ ions initially proposed as the main active species. Recent findings propose single [GaH]2+ sites as active centers, independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by thermodynamic stability analysis. The existence of distinct Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species with different reactivities is inferred from indirect data, indicating ongoing scientific inquiry.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},

{"DOC": "The surge in propylene demand, projected to grow at 2-3% annually until 2035, has spurred the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a key production method. PDH, alongside methanol-to-olefins (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins processes, has emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional methods. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research identifies [GaH]2+ ions with a basic framework oxygen as the active sites, distinguishing them from isolated Ga+. Studies show that the active site in Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. Recent findings include the efficiency of trace Pt-modified GaOx catalysts for PDH, where Pt facilitates hydrogen desorption and recovers gallium hydride and hydroxide species.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00814a"},
{"DOC": "Rising propylene demand highlights PDH as a key production method, with Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts showing promise due to their hydrocarbon activation and catalytic efficiency. The debate over active Ga species continues, with findings suggesting that strong acid sites promote well-dispersed Ga species, enhancing PDH activity. Notably, 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 exhibits the highest activity due to its well-dispersed gallium species and high dehydrogenation efficiency, while 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 shows superior stability. The influence of supports on the dispersion of Ga2O3 species and gallium states remains an area of ongoing investigation.", "Doi": "10.1039/c6ra27204e"},

{"DOC": "Propylene demand's rise has catalyzed interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), bolstered by lower propane prices from North American shale gas. PDH, highly atom-economic and non-toxic, can use renewable feedstocks, aligning with green chemistry. Developing active, selective, and stable catalysts is pivotal for PDH's future. Ga/H-ZSM-5, historically used in propane aromatization, is central to debates on active Ga species. Recent studies highlight Pt3Ga/γ-Al2O3 and Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 as promising catalysts, with high activity and stability. Catalyst structure is influenced by preparation strategy, with optimal Ga loading and Ga/Al ratios enhancing dehydrogenation.
