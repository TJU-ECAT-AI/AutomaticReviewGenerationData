Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites play a crucial role by catalyzing dehydrogenation steps, promoting H2 formation and inhibiting cracking. Ga+3 species reduce to a dispersed hydride form without Ga nearest neighbors during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions below 770 K. These hydride species release H2 under high surface hydrogen fugacities during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5.

Propylene, a vital chemical for polypropylene and other materials, benefits from PDH, which uses Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The catalyst's active Ga species, a topic of ongoing debate, includes Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair. Ga-based catalysts have been in use since the 1970s for hydrocarbon processing, with Ga/H-ZSM-5's ability to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes well-documented.

{"DOC": "Growing propylene demand has widened the supply-demand gap, as it's traditionally produced as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and FCC units. The abundance of natural gas feedstock has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an emerging alternative, with commercialized processes like Catofin using CrOx/Al2O3 and Oleflex with Pt-based catalysts. Due to Pt's high cost and Cr's health and environmental concerns, alternative PDH catalysts are being developed, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Ga/H-ZSM-5 is recognized for its efficiency in dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization, but the identity of active sites and PDH reaction mechanism remain debated. Experimental techniques have been employed to probe Ga speciation, with proposed Ga species including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early studies suggested Ga+ ions as the main species, but alternative interpretations propose low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. Ga monohydride and dihydride species have been identified, suggesting an active role in PDH. Recent studies propose [GaH]2+ as active centers, independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by spectroscopic and thermodynamic analysis.

Concerns over Pt cost and Cr toxicity have spurred development of alternative PDH catalysts, notably Ga/H-ZSM-5 for dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes. The identity of catalytic active sites and PDH reaction mechanism remain contentious. Experimental techniques such as in-situ Ga K edge XANES, ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-TPD have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5. Proposed Ga species include Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early studies suggested Ga+ ions as the main species, independent of gallium loading and reducing gas. Ga monohydride and dihydride species were identified by Hensen and coworkers, while Phadke et al. proposed [GaH]2+ as the active center for PDH, independent of Ga/Al ratio. Schreiber et al. reported Ga+H+ paired sites as more active than single Ga+ sites or H-ZSM-5, based on reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations. The existence of distinct active sites remains largely inferred from reactivity data and computational investigations.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},
