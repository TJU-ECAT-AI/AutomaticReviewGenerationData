{"DOC": "The surge in propylene demand has fostered the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), bolstered by lower propane costs from North American shale gas (Quote 1). PDH exemplifies green chemistry principles, boasting high atom economy and potential for renewable feedstocks (Quote 3). Catalyst development is pivotal for PDH's success (Quote 4). Ga/H-ZSM-5, historically used in propane aromatization (Quote 5), is central to an ongoing debate on active Ga species. Recent studies highlight Pt3Ga/γ-Al2O3 (Quote 6) and Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 (Quote 7) as high-performing catalysts. Preparation methods significantly affect Ga/SiO2 catalyst structure (Quote 8), while optimal Ga loading and Ga/Al ratios enhance dehydrogenation (Quotes 9 and 10). DFT calculations underscore the superior activity of LewisBrnsted acid pairs over isolated Ga+ (Quote 11).", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},
{"DOC": "Renewed interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for propylene production, driven by high demand and low propane costs, has highlighted Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The debate over active Ga species involves single [GaH]2+ sites and Ga+H+ pair sites. Recent research by Phadke et al. reveals that Ga species associated with Al-pairs catalyze propane and butane dehydrogenation, while isolated Ga species are inactive, indicating a mechanism difference between propane and ethane dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1sc05866e"},
{"DOC": "Rising propylene demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative to steam cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations recognized as active sites for dehydrogenation, though their nature remains a topic of debate. Recent studies highlight the role of CO2 in boosting olefin yields and the benefits of promoters like potassium in reducing coke formation and enhancing selectivity. The impact of hydrogen and steam on catalyst activity, along with the role of metal promoters in hydrogen desorption and active site regeneration, has also been explored.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"}
