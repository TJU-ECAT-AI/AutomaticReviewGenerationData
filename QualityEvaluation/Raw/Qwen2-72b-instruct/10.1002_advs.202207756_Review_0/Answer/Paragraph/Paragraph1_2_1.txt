    The escalating demand for propylene, forecasted to reach 191 megatons by 2030 and projected to grow at 2-3% annually until 2035, has catalyzed the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a pivotal production method [\[10.1002/advs.202207756_0\], \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]]. PDH, alongside methanol-to-olefins (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins processes, has emerged as an alternative to conventional methods [\[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]]. Central to PDH are Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, whose active Ga species have been a subject of ongoing debate [\[10.1002/advs.202207756_0\], \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]]. Recent studies highlight [GaH]2+ ions and a basic framework oxygen as critical active sites, distinguishing them from isolated Ga+ ions due to enhanced Lewis acidity upon protonation, which facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation and H2 elimination [\[10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012\], \[10.1039/d0cs00983k\]]. Trace Pt modification of GaOx has been reported to improve catalyst efficiency by facilitating hydrogen desorption and recovering gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species [\[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]]. The active site of Ga2O3 is identified as the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ [\[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]]. These findings contribute to our evolving understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH [\[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]].

    The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with a focus on coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations as key active species [\[10.1021/cr5002436\], \[10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012\]]. The nature of active sites remains a topic of debate [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. Research indicates that CO2 can enhance olefin yields and that promoters like potassium reduce coke formation and increase selectivity [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. The reducibility of Ga2O3 and the role of metal promoters in hydrogen desorption and active site regeneration have also been explored [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]].

    Rising propylene demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative to steam cracking [\[10.1006/jcat.1993.1079\], \[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. Central to PDH is the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, whose active Ga species have been a subject of scientific debate [\[10.1006/jcat.1993.1079\], \[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. Recent studies pinpoint coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations as key dehydrogenation sites [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. Research also highlights the role of CO2 in boosting olefin yields and the impact of promoters in reducing coke formation and enhancing selectivity [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. The reducibility of Ga2O3 and the effects of hydrogen and steam on catalyst activity have been explored, with metal promoters aiding in hydrogen desorption and active site regeneration [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]].

Recent studies confirm that Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs act as active sites for propane dehydrogenation [\[10.1039/d0cs00814a\], \[10.1039/c6ra27204e\]]. Enhanced Lewis acidity aids CH bond activation, and Brnsted acidity lowers the barrier for hydrogen elimination, addressing the ongoing debate [\[10.1039/d0cs00814a\], \[10.1039/c6ra27204e\]].

    Growing propylene demand has driven the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) methods [\[10.1006/jcat.1993.1079\], \[10.1021/cr5002436\]].

Studies reveal that Ga+3 species reduce to form hydride species under hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions, releasing H2 during dehydrocyclodimerization under high surface hydrogen fugacities [\[10.1006/jcat.1993.1079\]]. Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 at room temperature in H2, indicating that active Ga forms are present only under reaction conditions [\[10.1006/jcat.1993.1079\]].

    Increased propylene demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a key production method [\[10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012\], \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]]. Recent studies on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH have identified [GaH]2+ and a basic framework oxygen at the Brnsted-acid site as active sites [\[10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012\], \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]]. These findings advance our knowledge amidst ongoing debates about active Ga species [\[10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012\], \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]].

    Rising propylene demand has spurred the adoption of PDH technologies [\[10.1039/d0cs00814a\], \[10.1039/c6ra27204e\]]. The Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH have been a subject of debate, particularly over the active Ga species [\[10.1039/d0cs00814a\], \[10.1039/c6ra27204e\]]. Recent studies confirm that Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs act as active sites for propane dehydrogenation [\[10.1039/d0cs00814a\], \[10.1039/c6ra27204e\]]. Enhanced Lewis acidity aids CH bond activation, and Brnsted acidity lowers the barrier for hydrogen elimination, addressing the ongoing debate [\[10.1039/d0cs00814a\], \[10.1039/c6ra27204e\]].

    Growing propylene demand has driven the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) methods [\[10.1006/jcat.1993.1079\], \[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites are pivotal, catalyzing dehydrogenation, promoting H2 formation, and inhibiting cracking [\[10.1006/jcat.1993.1079\], \[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. Studies reveal that Ga+3 species reduce to form hydride species under hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions, releasing H2 during dehydrocyclodimerization under high surface hydrogen fugacities [\[10.1006/jcat.1993.1079\]]. Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 at room temperature in H2, indicating that active Ga forms are present only under reaction conditions [\[10.1006/jcat.1993.1079\]].

    Propylene demand's surge has catalyzed the expansion of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology [\[10.1039/c6ra27204e\], \[10.1039/d2nr02208g\]]. The Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH have been a subject of debate, with a focus on active Ga species [\[10.1039/c6ra27204e\], \[10.1039/d2nr02208g\]]. Recent studies pinpoint [GaH]2+ and a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site as critical for PDH reactions [\[10.1039/c6ra27204e\], \[10.1039/d2nr02208g\]]. These findings enrich our knowledge of these catalysts [\[10.1039/c6ra27204e\], \[10.1039/d2nr02208g\
