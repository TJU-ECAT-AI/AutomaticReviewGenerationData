{"DOC": "Rising propylene demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an eco-friendly alternative to conventional methods, bolstered by lower propane costs due to North American shale gas discoveries. PDH adheres to green chemistry principles, offering high atom economy and renewable feedstock potential. Developing active, selective, and stable catalysts is pivotal for PDH's future. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, historically used in propane aromatization, are central to scientific debates on active Ga species. Recent studies highlight promising catalysts like Pt3Ga/γ-Al2O3 and Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2, showcasing high activity, selectivity, and stability. Optimal Ga loading and preparation strategies for Ga/SiO2 catalysts significantly impact propene yield. DFT calculations reveal that LewisBrnsted acid pairs are more active than isolated Ga+, facilitating CH bond activation and H2 elimination, advancing our understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},
{"DOC": "Renewed interest in PDH for propylene production, driven by global demand and low propane costs from shale gas, highlights the importance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, known for their high stability and selectivity. The debate on active Ga species involves single [GaH]2+ sites versus Ga+H+ pair sites. Recent research by Phadke suggests Ga species associated with Al-pairs are more effective in catalyzing propane and butane dehydrogenation, indicating possible mechanism differences between propane and ethane dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1sc05866e"},
{"DOC": "Rising propylene demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative to steam cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, focusing on coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations as active sites, though their nature remains debated. Research shows CO2 enhances olefin yields, and promoters like potassium reduce coke formation and increase selectivity. Studies on Ga2O3 reducibility and the effects of hydrogen and steam on catalyst activity have advanced our knowledge. Promoting GaOx-based catalysts with metals such as Pt aids in hydrogen desorption and active site regeneration.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"}
