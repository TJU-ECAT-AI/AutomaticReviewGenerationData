Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites are crucial, catalyzing dehydrogenation steps, promoting H2 formation, and inhibiting cracking. Ga+3 species reduce to a monomeric hydride form at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions, driven by high surface hydrogen fugacities. Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 at room temperature in flowing H2, indicating active forms exist only under reaction conditions.

Propylene, a vital chemical for products like polypropylene and acrylonitrile, sees its production augmented by PDH. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, with a history in hydrocarbon processing, are central to PDH, but the active Ga species remains a topic of debate. Proposed active centers include Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair, with recent research highlighting the influence of Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions on PDH performance.", "Doi": "10.1002/advs.202207756_0"},
{"DOC": "The increasing demand for propylene, traditionally a by-product of naphtha steam cracking and FCC units, has widened the demand-supply gap, exacerbated by the rise in natural gas feedstock. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is emerging as an effective alternative, with commercialized processes like Catofin and Oleflex using CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-based catalysts, respectively. Due to Pt's high cost and Cr's health and environmental concerns, alternative PDH catalysts, notably Ga/H-ZSM-5, are being developed. Ga/H-ZSM-5 is efficient for dehydrogenation but the identity of active sites and the PDH reaction mechanism are contentious. Studies using techniques like in-situ Ga K edge XANES, ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-TPD have explored Ga speciation, proposing various Ga species post-reduction. Early X-ray absorption studies suggest isolated Ga+ ions as the main species, but alternative interpretations propose low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. Ga monohydride and dihydride species have been identified, potentially active in PDH, but their state at room temperature may not represent high-temperature conditions. Recent findings propose single [GaH]2+ sites as active centers, independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by FTIR, NH3-TPD, and thermodynamic analysis. However, these experiments were conducted on the oxidized state, possibly differing from the reduced sample. Ga+H+ paired sites have been reported as more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst, based on reactivity, pulse reactions, and DFT calculations. The debate on distinct active sites continues, largely inferred from reactivity data, indirect characterizations, and computational studies.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},
