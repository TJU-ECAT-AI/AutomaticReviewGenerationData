{"DOC": "The increasing demand for propylene, a key chemical used in various industries, has widened the gap between supply and demand, as it is traditionally produced as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units. The abundance of natural gas as a feedstock has further exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a viable alternative for propylene production, with two commercialized processes using CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-based catalysts. However, concerns over Pt cost and Cr toxicity have spurred the development of alternative PDH catalysts, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Ga/H-ZSM-5 is recognized for its efficiency in dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of PDH remain topics of active discussion. Experimental techniques have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5, revealing various proposed Ga species. The debate continues over whether isolated Ga+ ions, Ga monohydride, dihydride species, or [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for PDH, with recent studies suggesting that catalyst reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio.

{"DOC": "The increasing demand for propylene, traditionally a by-product of naphtha steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, has widened the supply-demand gap, exacerbated by the shift to natural gas feedstocks. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is emerging as a viable alternative, with commercialized processes like Catofin (CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst) and Oleflex (Pt-based catalyst). Due to Pt's high cost and Cr's health and environmental concerns, research has turned to alternative PDH catalysts, notably Ga/H-ZSM-5. Despite its efficiency in dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization, the identity of active sites and the PDH reaction mechanism in Ga/H-ZSM-5 remain contentious. Studies using techniques like XANES, FTIR, and NH3-TPD have proposed various Ga species, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early X-ray absorption studies suggested Ga+ as the main species, but interpretations of XANES spectra have been debated. Ga monohydride and dihydride species have been identified, potentially active in PDH, but their state at room temperature may not reflect the catalyst's active state. Recent findings propose [GaH]2+ as the active center, independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by FTIR, NH3-TPD, and thermodynamic analysis.
