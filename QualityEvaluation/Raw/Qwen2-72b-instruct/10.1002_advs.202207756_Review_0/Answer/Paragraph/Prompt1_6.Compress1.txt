The abundance of natural gas has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a viable alternative for propylene production, with two commercial processes, Catofin and Oleflex, using CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-based catalysts respectively. However, concerns over Pt cost and Cr toxicity have spurred the development of alternative PDH catalysts, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Ga/H-ZSM-5 is recognized for its efficiency in dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites and the PDH reaction mechanism remain debated. Experimental techniques like XANES, FTIR, and NH3-TPD have been employed to probe Ga speciation, with proposed Ga species including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early studies suggested Ga+ as the main species, but alternative interpretations propose low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. Ga monohydride and dihydride species have been identified on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, suggesting their potential role in PDH. Recent studies propose [GaH]2+ as the active center, independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by FTIR, NH3-TPD, and thermodynamic analysis. However, the existence of distinct Ga+H+ paired sites and isolated Ga+ species with different reactivities is largely inferred from indirect data.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},
