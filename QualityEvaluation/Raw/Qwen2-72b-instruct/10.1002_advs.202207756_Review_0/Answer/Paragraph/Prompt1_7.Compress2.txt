Recent studies suggest that coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation, although the debate continues. Research has also explored the enhancement of olefin yields with CO2 and the reduction of coke formation and increase in selectivity through promoters like potassium. Studies on Ga2O3 reducibility and the impact of hydrogen and steam on catalyst activity have been conducted, with metal promoters assisting in hydrogen desorption and active site regeneration.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"}
