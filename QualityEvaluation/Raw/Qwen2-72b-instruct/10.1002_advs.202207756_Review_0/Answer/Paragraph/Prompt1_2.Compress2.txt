{"DOC": "Increased propylene demand led to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts as a key component. An ongoing debate on the active Ga species persists, informed by recent research that advances our understanding of these catalysts, reflecting the evolving propylene production landscape.", "Doi": "10.1039/d2nr02208g"},
{"DOC": "Increased propylene demand and lower propane prices, due to North American shale gas discoveries, have propelled propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative to traditional methods. PDH is aligned with green chemistry principles, offering high atom economy and potential use of renewable feedstocks. The success of PDH is contingent on the development of active, selective, and stable catalysts. Historically, Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been crucial in commercial PDH processes. Recent research highlights the promise of Pt-promoted Ga/γ-Al2O3 and Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalysts, showing high activity, selectivity, and stability. Preparation methods significantly influence Ga/SiO2 catalyst structure, and optimal Ga loading enhances propene yield. Moderate acidity in MFI-supported Ga catalysts improves dehydrogenation rates. DFT calculations reveal the enhanced activity of Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs over isolated Ga+. The BAS reduces activation barriers for H2 elimination. The production of renewable green propane is an emerging sector, demonstrating the potential for sustainable propylene production.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},
{"DOC": "Renewed interest in PDH for propylene production, driven by demand and low propane costs, highlights Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts' pivotal role due to their high stability and selectivity. The debate on active Ga species involves single [GaH]2+ sites and Ga+H+ pair sites. Recent research by Phadke et al. reveals that Ga species associated with Al-pairs catalyze propane and butane dehydrogenation, with isolated Ga species inactive for propane but active for ethane dehydrogenation, suggesting distinct mechanisms for propane dehydrogenation with In-CHA catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1sc05866e"},
{"DOC": "Rising propylene demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative to steam cracking. The Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH have been a subject of debate, with recent research identifying coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations as active sites for dehydrogenation. Theories on the nature of these sites, involving Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, remain under discussion. Studies have shown that CO2 can enhance olefin yields, while promoters like potassium reduce coke formation and increase selectivity. The reducibility of Ga2O3 and the effect of hydrogen and steam on catalyst activity have been explored, with metal promoters such as Pt aiding hydrogen desorption and active site regeneration.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"}
