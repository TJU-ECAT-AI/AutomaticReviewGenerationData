PDH boasts high atom economy, avoids toxic reactants, and can use renewable feedstocks (Quote 3). A stable, active catalyst is key for PDH's success (Quote 4). Ga/H-ZSM-5, historically used in propane aromatization (Quote 5), has evolved with promising catalysts like Pt-promoted Ga/γ-Al2O3 and Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2, showing high activity and stability (Quotes 6-7). Optimal Ga loading and Ga/Al ratios have been identified to enhance dehydrogenation rates (Quotes 9-10).", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},
{"DOC": "Renewed interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for propylene production is driven by growing demand and low propane costs from shale gas. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, pivotal for their high stability and selectivity, have sparked a debate over active Ga species. Recent research suggests Ga species associated with Al-pairs catalyze propane and butane dehydrogenation more effectively than isolated Ga species, indicating possible mechanism differences between propane and ethane dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1sc05866e"},
{"DOC": "Rising propylene demand led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative to steam cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH evolved, with a debate on active Ga species. Recent research identified coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations as active sites, though the exact nature remains debated. Studies suggest CO2's role in enhancing olefin yields and the impact of promoters like potassium in reducing coke formation and increasing selectivity. The reducibility of Ga2O3 and the effect of hydrogen and steam on catalyst activity were explored, with metal promoters aiding hydrogen desorption and active site regeneration.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"}
