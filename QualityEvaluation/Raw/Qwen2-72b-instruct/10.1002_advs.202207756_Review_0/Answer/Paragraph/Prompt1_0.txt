{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an alternative to traditional methods, bolstered by lower propane prices due to North American shale gas discoveries. PDH aligns with green chemistry principles, offering high atom economy and potential use of renewable feedstocks. An active, selective, and stable catalyst is crucial for PDH's viability. Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been historically used in commercial propane aromatization, and recent research has identified promising Ga-based catalysts for PDH, highlighting the influence of preparation strategies on catalyst structure and optimal Ga loadings and Ga/Al ratios to enhance dehydrogenation rates. DFT calculations suggest that Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs are more active than isolated Ga+ ions, and the role of the Brønsted acid site in reducing activation barriers for H2 elimination has been noted.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},
{"DOC": "Renewed interest in PDH for propylene production, driven by demand and low propane costs, highlights the importance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, known for their stability and selectivity. The debate on active Ga species involves single [GaH]2+ sites and Ga+H+ pair sites. Recent findings suggest Ga species associated with Al-pairs catalyze propane and butane dehydrogenation, while isolated Ga species do not, indicating possible mechanism differences between propane and ethane dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1sc05866e"},
{"DOC": "Rising propylene demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative to steam cracking. The Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH have sparked debate, particularly over the active Ga species. Recent studies highlight coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations as crucial for dehydrogenation activity. Research also shows CO2's role in enhancing olefin yields and the benefits of promoters like potassium in reducing coke formation and increasing selectivity. The reducibility of Ga2O3 and the effects of hydrogen and steam on catalyst activity have been explored, with metal promoters aiding hydrogen desorption and active site regeneration.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"}
