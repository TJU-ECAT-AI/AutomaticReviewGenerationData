{"DOC": "The rise in propylene demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an alternative to conventional methods, bolstered by lower propane prices due to North American shale gas discoveries. PDH aligns with green chemistry principles, offering high atom economy and avoiding toxic reactants. The success of PDH depends on the development of active, selective, and stable catalysts. Ga/H-ZSM-5 has historically been used in propane aromatization, and recent studies have identified promising Ga-based catalysts for PDH, such as Pt3Ga/γ-Al2O3 and Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2, which exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability. Preparation methods influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts, and optimal Ga loading and Ga/Al ratios enhance dehydrogenation rates. DFT calculations reveal that Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs are more active than isolated Ga+, and the Brønsted acid site reduces activation barriers for H2 elimination.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},
{"DOC": "Renewed interest in PDH for propylene production, driven by global demand and low propane costs from shale gas, highlights the importance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, known for their high stability and selectivity. The debate over active Ga species includes Bell's single [GaH]2+ sites and Schreiber's Ga+H+ pair sites, with recent research supporting both. Phadke's findings suggest that Ga species associated with Al-pairs catalyze propane and butane dehydrogenation, indicating possible mechanism differences between propane and ethane dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1sc05866e"},
{"DOC": "Rising propylene demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative to steam cracking. Recent research identifies coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations as crucial for dehydrogenation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, amid ongoing debate over active Ga species. Studies on CO2's role in boosting olefin yields and the effect of promoters like potassium in reducing coke formation and increasing selectivity have advanced our understanding. The reducibility of Ga2O3 and the influence of hydrogen and steam on catalyst activity have also been explored. Promoting GaOx-based catalysts with metals such as Pt aids in hydrogen desorption and active site regeneration.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"}
