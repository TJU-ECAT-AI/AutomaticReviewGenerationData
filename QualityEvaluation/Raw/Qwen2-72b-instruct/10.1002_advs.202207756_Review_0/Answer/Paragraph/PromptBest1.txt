The escalating demand for propylene, forecasted to grow at 2-3% annually until 2035, has catalyzed the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a pivotal production method \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]. PDH, alongside methanol-to-olefins (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins processes, offers an alternative to conventional methods. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, crucial for PDH, have seen evolving understanding, with active Ga species a subject of debate. Recent studies highlight [GaH]2+ ions and basic framework oxygen as active sites, more active than isolated Ga+ due to enhanced Lewis acidity \[10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012\]. Trace Pt modification further improves catalyst efficiency by facilitating hydrogen desorption and gallium species recovery \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]. The active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be Lewis-Brnsted acid pairs, with [GaH]2+ and a basic framework oxygen heterolytically activating a propane CH bond with a low intrinsic enthalpy barrier \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]. The Brnsted acid site prominently detruncates the activation barrier for H2 elimination \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]. Propylene is a vital building block for petrochemicals, and PDH is an industrial technology for direct propylene production receiving extensive attention \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]. The Dow Chemical Company forecasted that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, expected to exceed production capacity \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]. PDH technology is considered one of the most promising propylene production methods, producing only propylene \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]. With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates containing a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]. The Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been studied for PDH reaction for years, with the active sites of Ga debated and strongly affected by the types of supports, preparation methods, and loading amounts \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]. Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]. The high activity of b-Ga2O3 is due to its monoclinic structure, where Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron, providing a large number of weak acid sites \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\]. Recently, Sattler et al. reported trace Pt modified GaOx as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, with Pt promoting hydrogen desorption and recovering gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species \[10.1039/d0cs00814a\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in PDH technology, particularly the evolving understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, have opened new avenues for research and development. Future directions might focus on optimizing the preparation methods and support types to enhance the dispersion and stability of Ga species, aiming for higher catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The role of promoters like Pt in facilitating hydrogen desorption and gallium species recovery suggests potential for developing bimetallic catalysts that could further improve PDH efficiency. Moreover, the exploration of alternative Ga-based catalysts with enhanced stability and activity under industrial conditions could be a promising area for future research. The development of in situ characterization techniques to monitor the dynamic changes in Ga species under reaction conditions could provide deeper insights into the active sites and reaction mechanisms, guiding the design of more efficient PDH catalysts. Lastly, the integration of PDH processes with renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind, could lead to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly production of propylene, aligning with the principles of green chemistry.
