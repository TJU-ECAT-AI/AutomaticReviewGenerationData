Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers an alternative production method, with two commercial processes using CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-based catalysts.

{"DOC": "The escalating demand for propylene, forecasted by The Dow Chemical Company to grow at 2-3% annually until 2035, has spurred the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a key production method. PDH, alongside methanol-to-olefins (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins processes, has emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional propylene production. The Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, central to PDH, have been a subject of ongoing scientific debate regarding the active Ga species. Recent studies suggest that [GaH]2+ ions in conjunction with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site are the active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with medium tetrahedral aluminum content. This Lewis-Brnsted acid pair is more active than isolated Ga+, due to enhanced Lewis acidity upon protonation, which facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation. The Brnsted acid site also significantly reduces the barrier for H2 elimination. Trace Pt modification of GaOx has been reported to improve catalyst efficiency by facilitating hydrogen desorption and recovering gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species. DFT calculations reveal that Zrcus cations in ZrO2 lower the activation barrier for H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8. These findings contribute to our evolving understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00814a"},

{"DOC": "The increasing demand for propylene, a key chemical used in the production of various products, has widened the gap between supply and demand, as it is traditionally obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units. The abundance of natural gas as a feedstock has further exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a viable alternative for propylene production, with two commercialized processes using CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-based catalysts. However, concerns over the high cost of Pt and the health and environmental impacts of Cr have spurred the development of alternative PDH catalysts, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized for its efficiency in dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of PDH remain subjects of active debate. Experimental techniques have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5, with various Ga species proposed. Early studies suggested isolated Ga+ ions as the main species, but alternative interpretations have been proposed, indicating the complexity of understanding Ga species under reaction conditions. Recent research has suggested the role of Ga monohydride and dihydride species, as well as single [GaH]2+ sites, in PDH, with catalyst reactivity independent of Ga/Al ratio.
