Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers an alternative, with commercialized processes like Catofin using CrOx/Al2O3 and Oleflex with Pt catalysts. Due to Pt's high cost and Cr's health risks, research has turned to Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Ga/H-ZSM-5 is efficient for dehydrogenation, but the active Ga species in PDH is debated. Techniques like XANES, FTIR, and NH3-TPD have been used to identify Ga species, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early studies suggested Ga+ as the main species, but interpretations vary. Ga monohydride and dihydride species have been proposed, with [GaH]2+ suggested as the active center.

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has spurred the development of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has gained significant attention. The Dow Chemical Company's forecast predicts a 2-3% annual growth in propylene demand by 2035, potentially outpacing production capacity. PDH, alongside methanol-to-olefins (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins processes, has emerged as a key technology. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, central to PDH, have been a subject of ongoing scientific debate regarding the active Ga species. Recent studies suggest that [GaH]2+ ions paired with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site are the active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with medium tetrahedral aluminum content. This Lewis-Brnsted acid pair is more active than isolated Ga+, due to enhanced Lewis acidity upon protonation, which facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation. The Brnsted acid site also significantly reduces the barrier for H2 elimination. Ga2O3's active site is identified as the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. Trace Pt modification of GaOx has been reported to improve catalytic efficiency for propane dehydrogenation by facilitating hydrogen desorption and recovering gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species.

{"DOC": "The increasing demand for propylene, traditionally a by-product of naphtha steam cracking and FCC in refineries, has widened the demand-supply gap, exacerbated by the rise in natural gas feedstock. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is emerging as an effective alternative, with commercialized processes using CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-based catalysts. Concerns over Pt cost and Cr toxicity have spurred development of alternative PDH catalysts, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2.
