However, it is mentioned that Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics, promoting the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2 and inhibiting undesired cracking reactions. The literature focuses on the physical and chemical state of Ga using in-situ X-ray absorption at the Ga K-edge, showing that Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.1993.1079"},
{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to meet the projected shortfall in supply. Propylene is a key chemical used in the production of various materials, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene. The demand for propylene is expected to increase significantly, from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030. To address this demand, on-purpose propylene technologies, including PDH, have been developed. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing, with the dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide being recognized in the 1970s. Since dehydrogenation is the first step in dehydroaromatization, the ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated. However, the Ga speciation and the structure of active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in dehydrogenation have remained active topics of discussion since its initial discovery without clear resolution. Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair. Recent research has combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.", "Doi": "10.1002/advs.202207756_0"},
{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to a gap between demand and supply, as propylene is traditionally obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units in refineries. The abundance of natural gas as a feedstock has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is seen as a potentially effective alternative method to produce propylene. Two commercialized PDH processes are the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with a Pt-based catalyst. However, the high cost of Pt and health and environmental concerns associated with Cr have driven the development of alternative PDH catalysts, such as Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of PDH remain topics of active discussion. Various experimental techniques, including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), have been used to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in PDH. A number of Ga species have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early X-ray absorption studies suggested that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, independent of gallium loading and reducing gas, consistent with a recent report. However, alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. Hensen and coworkers first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting these species could play an active role in PDH. However, spectra were collected at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, which may not represent the catalyst state at 500 C. Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for PDH, and catalyst reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by FTIR spectroscopic, NH3-TPD results, and thermodynamic stability analysis. However, FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments were conducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state, where Ga speciation could differ from the reduced sample. Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations. The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations, but the existence of these distinct sites is largely indirect, inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental characterizations, and computational investigations.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has received extensive attention in recent years. The Dow Chemical Company forecasted that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035. The development of dehydrogenation technologies and catalysts has been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the FischerTropsch-to-olefins process. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over the years. The active sites of Ga have been debated and strongly affected by the types of supports, preparation methods, and loading amounts. Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. Recently, Sattler et al. reported trace Pt modified GaOx as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. DFT calculations predict that Zrcus cations in the lattice of ZrO2 lower the activation barrier of H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8 by 0.76 eV in comparison with their saturated counterparts. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the rapid consumption of fossil energy and the inability of traditional propylene production methods to meet increasing demands. PDH technology is considered a promising method for propylene production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about active Ga species. DFT calculations have shown that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 involves the loss of hydrogen to form hydroxyl groups, but the desorption step of adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3. Efforts to improve the activity of GaOx-based catalysts have included doping to increase the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, and the use of trace Pt as a promoter to facilitate hydrogen desorption and recover gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species. H2 pretreatment can also promote the formation of more active GaH species. However, GaOx-based catalysts suffer from significant sintering during continuous regeneration operations, so controlled regeneration is desired to recover their performance. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species.

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to increased attention on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes cannot meet the growing demand. Gallium oxide-based catalysts, including Ga/H-ZSM-5, have been recognized as promising materials for alkane dehydrogenation due to their capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has shown that the existence of strong acid sites in the catalyst can lead to more well-dispersed Ga species, which is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity, possessing the maximum well-dispersed gallium species and high dehydrogenation efficiency gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2). The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability. The support effects of catalysts were also considered to be an important topic. Previous studies reported that the Ga2O3 species were dispersed on different supports including TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZSM-5, HZSM-48 and MWW zeolites for alkane dehydrogenation reaction. Many literatures verified that acidity of support evidently influenced the catalytic performance of the supported catalysts. The detailed investigations of different supports on the catalytic performances for Ga2O3-based catalysts are rarely reported, especially with SBA-15 material as support. The dispersion of Ga2O3 species varied with different supports, and the effects of supports on the state of gallium species have not been fully understood, especially the causes of these changes.", "Doi": "10.1039/c6ra27204e"},

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review. The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},
{"DOC": "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-5 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well: among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation. Bell and coworkers believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory. Phadke et al. have pointed out that Ga-exchanged species associated with Al-pairs in Ga/H-MFI catalyze both propane and butane dehydrogenation while isolated Ga species did not. They found, however, that both Ga species exhibited similar properties for ethane dehydrogenation. It is thus possible that the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation with the In-CHA catalyst is different from that of ethane dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1sc05866e"},

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the identification of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations as the active sites for dehydrogenation activity. However, the exact nature of the active sites is still under debate, with some authors proposing the presence of Lewis acid sites, while others suggest the involvement of both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites. The role of CO2 in improving olefin yields has also been studied, with various mechanisms proposed, including the removal of acid sites, coke gasification, and hydrogen removal by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. The addition of promoters, such as potassium, has been shown to reduce coke formation and increase selectivity. The reducibility of Ga2O3 and the effect of hydrogen and steam on the catalyst's activity have also been investigated.

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to increased attention on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes cannot meet the growing demand. Gallium oxide-based catalysts, including Ga/H-ZSM-5, have been recognized as promising materials for alkane dehydrogenation due to their capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has shown that the existence of strong acid sites in the catalyst can lead to more well-dispersed Ga species, which is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity, possessing the maximum well-dispersed gallium species and high dehydrogenation efficiency gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2). The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability. The support effects of catalysts were also considered to be an important topic. Previous studies reported that the Ga2O3 species were dispersed on different supports including TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZSM-5, HZSM-48 and MWW zeolites for alkane dehydrogenation reaction. Many literatures verified that acidity of support evidently influenced the catalytic performance of the supported catalysts. The detailed investigations of different supports on the catalytic performances for Ga2O3-based catalysts are rarely reported, especially with SBA-15 material as support.

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review. The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},
{"DOC": "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-5 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well: among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation. Bell and coworkers believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory.

The literature focuses on the physical and chemical state of Ga using in-situ X-ray absorption at the Ga K-edge, showing that Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.1993.1079"},

Propylene is a key chemical used in the production of various materials, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene. The demand for propylene is expected to increase significantly, from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030. To address this demand, on-purpose propylene technologies, including PDH, have been developed. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing, with the dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide being recognized in the 1970s. Since dehydrogenation is the first step in dehydroaromatization, the ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated.

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to a gap between demand and supply, as propylene is traditionally obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units in refineries. The abundance of natural gas as a feedstock has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is seen as a potentially effective alternative method to produce propylene. Two commercialized PDH processes are the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with a Pt-based catalyst. However, the high cost of Pt and health and environmental concerns associated with Cr have driven the development of alternative PDH catalysts, such as Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of PDH remain topics of active discussion. Various experimental techniques, including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), have been used to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in PDH. A number of Ga species have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early X-ray absorption studies suggested that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, independent of gallium loading and reducing gas, consistent with a recent report. However, alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. Hensen and coworkers first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting these species could play an active role in PDH. However, spectra were collected at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, which may not represent the catalyst state at 500 C. Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for PDH, and catalyst reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by FTIR spectroscopic, NH3-TPD results, and thermodynamic stability analysis. However, FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments were conducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state, where Ga speciation could differ from the reduced sample. Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations. The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations, but the existence of these distinct sites is largely indirect, inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental characterizations, and computational investigations.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has received extensive attention in recent years. The Dow Chemical Company forecasted that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035. The development of dehydrogenation technologies and catalysts has been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the FischerTropsch-to-olefins process. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over the years. The active sites of Ga have been debated and strongly affected by the types of supports, preparation methods, and loading amounts. Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. Recently, Sattler et al. reported trace Pt modified GaOx as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. DFT calculations predict that Zrcus cations in the lattice of ZrO2 lower the activation barrier of H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8 by 0.76 eV in comparison with their saturated counterparts. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the rapid consumption of fossil energy and the inability of traditional propylene production methods to meet increasing demands. PDH technology is considered a promising method for propylene production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about active Ga species. DFT calculations have shown that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 involves the loss of hydrogen to form hydroxyl groups, but the desorption step of adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3. Efforts to improve the activity of GaOx-based catalysts have included doping to increase the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, and the use of trace Pt as a promoter to facilitate hydrogen desorption and recover gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species. H2 pretreatment can also promote the formation of more active GaH species. However, GaOx-based catalysts suffer from significant sintering during continuous regeneration operations, so controlled regeneration is desired to recover their performance.

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has received extensive attention in recent years. The Dow Chemical Company forecasted that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035. The development of dehydrogenation technologies and catalysts has been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the FischerTropsch-to-olefins process. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over the years. The active sites of Ga have been debated and strongly affected by the types of supports, preparation methods, and loading amounts. Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. Recently, Sattler et al. reported trace Pt modified GaOx as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. DFT calculations predict that Zrcus cations in the lattice of ZrO2 lower the activation barrier of H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8 by 0.76 eV in comparison with their saturated counterparts. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the rapid consumption of fossil energy and the inability of traditional propylene production methods to meet increasing demands. PDH technology is considered a promising method for propylene production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about active Ga species. DFT calculations have shown that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 involves the loss of hydrogen to form hydroxyl groups, but the desorption step of adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3. Efforts to improve the activity of GaOx-based catalysts have included doping to increase the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, and the use of trace Pt as a promoter to facilitate hydrogen desorption and recover gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species. H2 pretreatment can also promote the formation of more active GaH species. However, GaOx-based catalysts suffer from significant sintering during continuous regeneration operations, so controlled regeneration is desired to recover their performance. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species.

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to increased attention on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes cannot meet the growing demand. Gallium oxide-based catalysts, including Ga/H-ZSM-5, have been recognized as promising materials for alkane dehydrogenation due to their capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has shown that the existence of strong acid sites in the catalyst can lead to more well-dispersed Ga species, which is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity, possessing the maximum well-dispersed gallium species and high dehydrogenation efficiency gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2). The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability. The support effects of catalysts were also considered to be an important topic. Previous studies reported that the Ga2O3 species were dispersed on different supports including TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZSM-5, HZSM-48 and MWW zeolites for alkane dehydrogenation reaction.

The detailed investigations of different supports on the catalytic performances for Ga2O3-based catalysts are rarely reported, especially with SBA-15 material as support.

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review. The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},

The literature focuses on the physical and chemical state of Ga using in-situ X-ray absorption at the Ga K-edge, showing that Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.1993.1079"},
{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to meet the projected shortfall in supply. Propylene is a key chemical used in the production of various materials, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene. The demand for propylene is expected to increase significantly, from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030. To address this demand, on-purpose propylene technologies, including PDH, have been developed. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing, with the dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide being recognized in the 1970s. Since dehydrogenation is the first step in dehydroaromatization, the ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated. However, the Ga speciation and the structure of active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in dehydrogenation have remained active topics of discussion since its initial discovery without clear resolution. Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair. Recent research has combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.", "Doi": "10.1002/advs.202207756_0"},
{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to a gap between demand and supply, as propylene is traditionally obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units in refineries. The abundance of natural gas as a feedstock has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is seen as a potentially effective alternative method to produce propylene. Two commercialized PDH processes are the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with a Pt-based catalyst. However, the high cost of Pt and health and environmental concerns associated with Cr have driven the development of alternative PDH catalysts, such as Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of PDH remain topics of active discussion. Various experimental techniques, including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), have been used to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in PDH. A number of Ga species have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early X-ray absorption studies suggested that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, independent of gallium loading and reducing gas, consistent with a recent report. However, alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. Hensen and coworkers first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting these species could play an active role in PDH. However, spectra were collected at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, which may not represent the catalyst state at 500 C. Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for PDH, and catalyst reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by FTIR spectroscopic, NH3-TPD results, and thermodynamic stability analysis.

Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing, with the dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide being recognized in the 1970s. Since dehydrogenation is the first step in dehydroaromatization, the ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated. However, the Ga speciation and the structure of active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in dehydrogenation have remained active topics of discussion since its initial discovery without clear resolution. Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair. Recent research has combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.", "Doi": "10.1002/advs.202207756_0"},
{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to a gap between demand and supply, as propylene is traditionally obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units in refineries. The abundance of natural gas as a feedstock has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is seen as a potentially effective alternative method to produce propylene. Two commercialized PDH processes are the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with a Pt-based catalyst. However, the high cost of Pt and health and environmental concerns associated with Cr have driven the development of alternative PDH catalysts, such as Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of PDH remain topics of active discussion. Various experimental techniques, including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), have been used to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in PDH. A number of Ga species have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early X-ray absorption studies suggested that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, independent of gallium loading and reducing gas, consistent with a recent report. However, alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. Hensen and coworkers first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting these species could play an active role in PDH. However, spectra were collected at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, which may not represent the catalyst state at 500 C. Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for PDH, and catalyst reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by FTIR spectroscopic, NH3-TPD results, and thermodynamic stability analysis. However, FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments were conducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state, where Ga speciation could differ from the reduced sample. Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations. The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations, but the existence of these distinct sites is largely indirect, inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental characterizations, and computational investigations.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has received extensive attention in recent years. The Dow Chemical Company forecasted that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035. The development of dehydrogenation technologies and catalysts has been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the FischerTropsch-to-olefins process. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over the years. The active sites of Ga have been debated and strongly affected by the types of supports, preparation methods, and loading amounts. Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. Recently, Sattler et al. reported trace Pt modified GaOx as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. DFT calculations predict that Zrcus cations in the lattice of ZrO2 lower the activation barrier of H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8 by 0.76 eV in comparison with their saturated counterparts. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the rapid consumption of fossil energy and the inability of traditional propylene production methods to meet increasing demands. PDH technology is considered a promising method for propylene production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about active Ga species. DFT calculations have shown that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 involves the loss of hydrogen to form hydroxyl groups, but the desorption step of adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3. Efforts to improve the activity of GaOx-based catalysts have included doping to increase the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, and the use of trace Pt as a promoter to facilitate hydrogen desorption and recover gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species. H2 pretreatment can also promote the formation of more active GaH species. However, GaOx-based catalysts suffer from significant sintering during continuous regeneration operations, so controlled regeneration is desired to recover their performance. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has shown that the existence of strong acid sites in the catalyst can lead to more well-dispersed Ga species, which is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity, possessing the maximum well-dispersed gallium species and high dehydrogenation efficiency gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2). The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability. The support effects of catalysts were also considered to be an important topic. Previous studies reported that the Ga2O3 species were dispersed on different supports including TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZSM-5, HZSM-48 and MWW zeolites for alkane dehydrogenation reaction.

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review. The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},

However, it is mentioned that Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics, promoting the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2 and inhibiting undesired cracking reactions. The literature focuses on the physical and chemical state of Ga using in-situ X-ray absorption at the Ga K-edge, showing that Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.1993.1079"},

The addition of promoters, such as potassium, has been shown to reduce coke formation and increase selectivity. The reducibility of Ga2O3 and the effect of hydrogen and steam on the catalyst's activity have also been investigated.

However, it is mentioned that Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics, promoting the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2 and inhibiting undesired cracking reactions. The literature focuses on the physical and chemical state of Ga using in-situ X-ray absorption at the Ga K-edge, showing that Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.1993.1079"},
{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to meet the projected shortfall in supply. Propylene is a key chemical used in the production of various materials, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene. The demand for propylene is expected to increase significantly, from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030. To address this demand, on-purpose propylene technologies, including PDH, have been developed. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing, with the dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide being recognized in the 1970s. Since dehydrogenation is the first step in dehydroaromatization, the ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated. However, the Ga speciation and the structure of active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in dehydrogenation have remained active topics of discussion since its initial discovery without clear resolution. Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair. Recent research has combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.", "Doi": "10.1002/advs.202207756_0"},
{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to a gap between demand and supply, as propylene is traditionally obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units in refineries. The abundance of natural gas as a feedstock has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is seen as a potentially effective alternative method to produce propylene. Two commercialized PDH processes are the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with a Pt-based catalyst. However, the high cost of Pt and health and environmental concerns associated with Cr have driven the development of alternative PDH catalysts, such as Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of PDH remain topics of active discussion. Various experimental techniques, including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), have been used to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in PDH. A number of Ga species have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early X-ray absorption studies suggested that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, independent of gallium loading and reducing gas, consistent with a recent report. However, alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. Hensen and coworkers first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting these species could play an active role in PDH. However, spectra were collected at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, which may not represent the catalyst state at 500 C. Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for PDH, and catalyst reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by FTIR spectroscopic, NH3-TPD results, and thermodynamic stability analysis. However, FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments were conducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state, where Ga speciation could differ from the reduced sample. Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations. The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations, but the existence of these distinct sites is largely indirect, inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental characterizations, and computational investigations.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},

The development of dehydrogenation technologies and catalysts has been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the FischerTropsch-to-olefins process. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over the years. The active sites of Ga have been debated and strongly affected by the types of supports, preparation methods, and loading amounts. Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. Recently, Sattler et al. reported trace Pt modified GaOx as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. DFT calculations predict that Zrcus cations in the lattice of ZrO2 lower the activation barrier of H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8 by 0.76 eV in comparison with their saturated counterparts. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the rapid consumption of fossil energy and the inability of traditional propylene production methods to meet increasing demands. PDH technology is considered a promising method for propylene production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about active Ga species. DFT calculations have shown that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 involves the loss of hydrogen to form hydroxyl groups, but the desorption step of adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3. Efforts to improve the activity of GaOx-based catalysts have included doping to increase the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, and the use of trace Pt as a promoter to facilitate hydrogen desorption and recover gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species. H2 pretreatment can also promote the formation of more active GaH species.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has shown that the existence of strong acid sites in the catalyst can lead to more well-dispersed Ga species, which is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review. The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},

Bell and coworkers believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory.

Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review. The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},
{"DOC": "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-5 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well: among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation. Bell and coworkers believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory.

However, it is mentioned that Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics, promoting the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2 and inhibiting undesired cracking reactions. The literature focuses on the physical and chemical state of Ga using in-situ X-ray absorption at the Ga K-edge, showing that Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5.

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to meet the projected shortfall in supply. Propylene is a key chemical used in the production of various materials, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene. The demand for propylene is expected to increase significantly, from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030. To address this demand, on-purpose propylene technologies, including PDH, have been developed. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing, with the dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide being recognized in the 1970s. Since dehydrogenation is the first step in dehydroaromatization, the ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated. However, the Ga speciation and the structure of active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in dehydrogenation have remained active topics of discussion since its initial discovery without clear resolution. Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair. Recent research has combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.", "Doi": "10.1002/advs.202207756_0"},
{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to a gap between demand and supply, as propylene is traditionally obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units in refineries. The abundance of natural gas as a feedstock has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is seen as a potentially effective alternative method to produce propylene. Two commercialized PDH processes are the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with a Pt-based catalyst. However, the high cost of Pt and health and environmental concerns associated with Cr have driven the development of alternative PDH catalysts, such as Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of PDH remain topics of active discussion. Various experimental techniques, including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), have been used to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in PDH. A number of Ga species have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early X-ray absorption studies suggested that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, independent of gallium loading and reducing gas, consistent with a recent report. However, alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. Hensen and coworkers first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting these species could play an active role in PDH. However, spectra were collected at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, which may not represent the catalyst state at 500 C. Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for PDH, and catalyst reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by FTIR spectroscopic, NH3-TPD results, and thermodynamic stability analysis. However, FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments were conducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state, where Ga speciation could differ from the reduced sample. Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations. The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations, but the existence of these distinct sites is largely indirect, inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental characterizations, and computational investigations.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},

Recent research has shown that the existence of strong acid sites in the catalyst can lead to more well-dispersed Ga species, which is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability. The support effects of catalysts were also considered to be an important topic. Previous studies reported that the Ga2O3 species were dispersed on different supports including TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZSM-5, HZSM-48 and MWW zeolites for alkane dehydrogenation reaction.

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has identified [GaH]2+ ions together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site as the active sites in the case of Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites. This has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00814a"},
{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to increased attention on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes cannot meet the growing demand. Gallium oxide-based catalysts, including Ga/H-ZSM-5, have been recognized as promising materials for alkane dehydrogenation due to their capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has shown that the existence of strong acid sites in the catalyst can lead to more well-dispersed Ga species, which is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity, possessing the maximum well-dispersed gallium species and high dehydrogenation efficiency gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2). The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability. The support effects of catalysts were also considered to be an important topic. Previous studies reported that the Ga2O3 species were dispersed on different supports including TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZSM-5, HZSM-48 and MWW zeolites for alkane dehydrogenation reaction. Many literatures verified that acidity of support evidently influenced the catalytic performance of the supported catalysts. The detailed investigations of different supports on the catalytic performances for Ga2O3-based catalysts are rarely reported, especially with SBA-15 material as support. The dispersion of Ga2O3 species varied with different supports, and the effects of supports on the state of gallium species have not been fully understood, especially the causes of these changes.", "Doi": "10.1039/c6ra27204e"},

{"DOC": "The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review. The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},
{"DOC": "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-5 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well: among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation. Bell and coworkers believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory. Phadke et al. have pointed out that Ga-exchanged species associated with Al-pairs in Ga/H-MFI catalyze both propane and butane dehydrogenation while isolated Ga species did not. They found, however, that both Ga species exhibited similar properties for ethane dehydrogenation. It is thus possible that the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation with the In-CHA catalyst is different from that of ethane dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1039/d1sc05866e"},

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the identification of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations as the active sites for dehydrogenation activity. However, the exact nature of the active sites is still under debate, with some authors proposing the presence of Lewis acid sites, while others suggest the involvement of both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites. The role of CO2 in improving olefin yields has also been studied, with various mechanisms proposed, including the removal of acid sites, coke gasification, and hydrogen removal by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. The addition of promoters, such as potassium, has been shown to reduce coke formation and increase selectivity. The reducibility of Ga2O3 and the effect of hydrogen and steam on the catalyst's activity have also been investigated. The promotion of GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts with metals like Pt has been reported to assist hydrogen desorption and facilitate the regeneration of active sites.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"}
