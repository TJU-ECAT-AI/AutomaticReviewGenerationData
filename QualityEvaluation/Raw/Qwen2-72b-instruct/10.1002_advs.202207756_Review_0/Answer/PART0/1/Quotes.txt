Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infras- tructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chem- icals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene [1]. Propylene is currently obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries [2]. However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehy- drogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to produc- ing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5]. The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incen- tivized development of other PDH catalysts [4], such as Ga- [612], Zn- [13], Co- [1416], V-based [17] and ZrO2 [1820] catalysts.
Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123].
Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X- ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3- temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction [911,24].
A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques [911,24,2628].
Early in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas [24,29], which is consistent with a more recent report by Schreiber et al. [10] Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not suffi- ciently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species [11,30].
Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/ H-ZSM-5 with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spec- troscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting that these species could play an active role in the PDH.
However, they collected spectra at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, and the state of the catalyst at room temperature after cooling may not be representative of the catalyst state at 500 C.
Recently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio.
This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11].
FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were con- ducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga spe- ciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample.
Schreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,and DFT calculations.
The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and iso- lated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [9 11,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indi- rect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental character- izations and computational investigations.





[1] "The active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs.102 The [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolyti- cally activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1. This LewisBrnsted acid pair turned out to be far more active than an isolated Ga+, which can be attributed to the increasing Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site which promotes heterolytic CH bond activation (Fig. 18h). Besides, the Brnsted acid site prominently detruncates the activation barrier for H2 elimina- tion which is considerably high for the isolated Ga+ because the proton originates from an alkyl CH bond with the simulta- neous elimination of propene."

Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infras- tructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chem- icals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene [1]. Propylene is currently obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries [2]. However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehy- drogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to produc- ing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5]. The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incen- tivized development of other PDH catalysts [4], such as Ga- [612], Zn- [13], Co- [1416], V-based [17] and ZrO2 [1820] catalysts.
Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123].
Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X- ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3- temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction [911,24].
A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques [911,24,2628].
Early in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas [24,29], which is consistent with a more recent report by Schreiber et al. [10] Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not suffi- ciently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species [11,30].
Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/ H-ZSM-5 with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spec- troscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting that these species could play an active role in the PDH.
However, they collected spectra at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, and the state of the catalyst at room temperature after cooling may not be representative of the catalyst state at 500 C.
Recently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio.
This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11].
FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were con- ducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga spe- ciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample.
Schreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,and DFT calculations.
The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and iso- lated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [9 11,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indi- rect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental character- izations and computational investigations.





[1] "The active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs.102 The [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolyti- cally activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1. This LewisBrnsted acid pair turned out to be far more active than an isolated Ga+, which can be attributed to the increasing Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site which promotes heterolytic CH bond activation (Fig. 18h). Besides, the Brnsted acid site prominently detruncates the activation barrier for H2 elimina- tion which is considerably high for the isolated Ga+ because the proton originates from an alkyl CH bond with the simulta- neous elimination of propene."

Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infras- tructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chem- icals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene [1]. Propylene is currently obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries [2]. However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehy- drogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to produc- ing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5]. The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incen- tivized development of other PDH catalysts [4], such as Ga- [612], Zn- [13], Co- [1416], V-based [17] and ZrO2 [1820] catalysts.
Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123].
Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X- ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3- temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction [911,24].
A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques [911,24,2628].
Early in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas [24,29], which is consistent with a more recent report by Schreiber et al. [10] Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not suffi- ciently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species [11,30].
Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/ H-ZSM-5 with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spec- troscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting that these species could play an active role in the PDH.
However, they collected spectra at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, and the state of the catalyst at room temperature after cooling may not be representative of the catalyst state at 500 C.
Recently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio.
This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11].
FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were con- ducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga spe- ciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample.
Schreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,and DFT calculations.
The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and iso- lated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [9 11,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indi- rect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental character- izations and computational investigations.





[1] "The active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs.102 The [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolyti- cally activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1. This LewisBrnsted acid pair turned out to be far more active than an isolated Ga+, which can be attributed to the increasing Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site which promotes heterolytic CH bond activation (Fig. 18h). Besides, the Brnsted acid site prominently detruncates the activation barrier for H2 elimina- tion which is considerably high for the isolated Ga+ because the proton originates from an alkyl CH bond with the simulta- neous elimination of propene."

Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infras- tructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chem- icals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene [1]. Propylene is currently obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries [2]. However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehy- drogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to produc- ing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5]. The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incen- tivized development of other PDH catalysts [4], such as Ga- [612], Zn- [13], Co- [1416], V-based [17] and ZrO2 [1820] catalysts.
Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123].
Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X- ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3- temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction [911,24].
A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques [911,24,2628].
Early in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas [24,29], which is consistent with a more recent report by Schreiber et al. [10] Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not suffi- ciently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species [11,30].
Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/ H-ZSM-5 with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spec- troscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting that these species could play an active role in the PDH.
However, they collected spectra at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, and the state of the catalyst at room temperature after cooling may not be representative of the catalyst state at 500 C.
Recently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio.
This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11].
FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were con- ducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga spe- ciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample.
Schreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,and DFT calculations.
The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and iso- lated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [9 11,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indi- rect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental character- izations and computational investigations.





[1] "The active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs.102 The [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolyti- cally activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1. This LewisBrnsted acid pair turned out to be far more active than an isolated Ga+, which can be attributed to the increasing Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site which promotes heterolytic CH bond activation (Fig. 18h). Besides, the Brnsted acid site prominently detruncates the activation barrier for H2 elimina- tion which is considerably high for the isolated Ga+ because the proton originates from an alkyl CH bond with the simulta- neous elimination of propene."

Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infras- tructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chem- icals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene [1]. Propylene is currently obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries [2]. However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehy- drogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to produc- ing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5]. The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incen- tivized development of other PDH catalysts [4], such as Ga- [612], Zn- [13], Co- [1416], V-based [17] and ZrO2 [1820] catalysts.
Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123].
Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X- ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3- temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction [911,24].
A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques [911,24,2628].
Early in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas [24,29], which is consistent with a more recent report by Schreiber et al. [10] Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not suffi- ciently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species [11,30].
Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/ H-ZSM-5 with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spec- troscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting that these species could play an active role in the PDH.
However, they collected spectra at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, and the state of the catalyst at room temperature after cooling may not be representative of the catalyst state at 500 C.
Recently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio.
This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11].
FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were con- ducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga spe- ciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample.
Schreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,and DFT calculations.
The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and iso- lated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [9 11,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indi- rect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental character- izations and computational investigations.





[1] "The active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs.102 The [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolyti- cally activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1. This LewisBrnsted acid pair turned out to be far more active than an isolated Ga+, which can be attributed to the increasing Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site which promotes heterolytic CH bond activation (Fig. 18h). Besides, the Brnsted acid site prominently detruncates the activation barrier for H2 elimina- tion which is considerably high for the isolated Ga+ because the proton originates from an alkyl CH bond with the simulta- neous elimination of propene."

Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infras- tructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chem- icals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene [1]. Propylene is currently obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries [2]. However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehy- drogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to produc- ing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5]. The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incen- tivized development of other PDH catalysts [4], such as Ga- [612], Zn- [13], Co- [1416], V-based [17] and ZrO2 [1820] catalysts.
Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123].
Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X- ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3- temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction [911,24].
A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques [911,24,2628].
Early in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas [24,29], which is consistent with a more recent report by Schreiber et al. [10] Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not suffi- ciently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species [11,30].
Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/ H-ZSM-5 with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spec- troscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting that these species could play an active role in the PDH.
However, they collected spectra at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, and the state of the catalyst at room temperature after cooling may not be representative of the catalyst state at 500 C.
Recently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio.
This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11].
FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were con- ducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga spe- ciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample.
Schreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,and DFT calculations.
The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and iso- lated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [9 11,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indi- rect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental character- izations and computational investigations.





[1] "The active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs.102 The [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolyti- cally activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1. This LewisBrnsted acid pair turned out to be far more active than an isolated Ga+, which can be attributed to the increasing Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site which promotes heterolytic CH bond activation (Fig. 18h). Besides, the Brnsted acid site prominently detruncates the activation barrier for H2 elimina- tion which is considerably high for the isolated Ga+ because the proton originates from an alkyl CH bond with the simulta- neous elimination of propene."

          [7] "Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+."
          [8] "The high activity of b-Ga2O3 is due to its monoclinic structure, where Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron, which can provide a large number of weak acid sites."
          [9] "Recently, Sattler et al. reported trace Pt modified GaOx as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. They found that the promoter of Pt helps in facilitating hydrogen desorption and recovering the gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species."
          [1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products.1 Conventional propylene pro- duction processes involve fluid catalytic cracking, and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, with the rapid consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands. Therefore,the development of highly efficient propylene production technologies is of vital importance, both scientifically and economically.2 In the past few years, increasing technologies for propylene production have been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the FischerTropsch-to-olefins process (Fig. 1a and b). Especially, PDH technology is considered to Cite this: Chem. Soc.

          [2] "In addition to metals and metal oxides, the modern green chemical industry has made urgent and strict demands for environmentally and economically friendly catalysts, which has seriously restricted the large scale applications of conventional metal-based catalysts, especially pre- cious metal and toxic metal oxides. Alternative carbon-based materials and carbides and nitrides have been investigated widely."
          [3] "Although it is generally accepted that numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydro- genation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective. In the propane dehydrogenation system, it is of vital importance to understand the relationship between active-site motifs and unique catalytic behaviors,including dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechan- isms, which can shine a light on precise catalyst design. In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deac- tivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
