DFT calculations have shown that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 involves the loss of hydrogen to form hydroxyl groups, but the desorption step of adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3. Efforts to improve the activity of GaOx-based catalysts have included doping to increase the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, and the use of trace Pt as a promoter to facilitate hydrogen desorption and recover gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species. H2 pretreatment can also promote the formation of more active GaH species. However, GaOx-based catalysts suffer from significant sintering during continuous regeneration operations, so controlled regeneration is desired to recover their performance.

The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review.

{"Quotes": "Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infras- tructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chem- icals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene [1]. Propylene is currently obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries [2]. However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehy- drogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to produc- ing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5]. The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incen- tivized development of other PDH catalysts [4], such as Ga- [612], Zn- [13], Co- [1416], V-based [17] and ZrO2 [1820] catalysts.\nAmong these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123].\nVarious experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X- ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3- temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction [911,24].\nA number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques [911,24,2628].\nEarly in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas [24,29], which is consistent with a more recent report by Schreiber et al.

The abundance of natural gas as a feedstock has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is seen as a potentially effective alternative method to produce propylene. Two commercialized PDH processes are the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with a Pt-based catalyst. However, the high cost of Pt and health and environmental concerns associated with Cr have driven the development of alternative PDH catalysts, such as Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of PDH remain topics of active discussion. Various experimental techniques, including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), have been used to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in PDH. A number of Ga species have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early X-ray absorption studies suggested that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, independent of gallium loading and reducing gas, consistent with a recent report. However, alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. Hensen and coworkers first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting these species could play an active role in PDH. However, spectra were collected at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, which may not represent the catalyst state at 500 C. Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for PDH, and catalyst reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by FTIR spectroscopic, NH3-TPD results, and thermodynamic stability analysis. However, FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments were conducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state, where Ga speciation could differ from the reduced sample. Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations.

The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks.

The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review.

The 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity, possessing the maximum well-dispersed gallium species and high dehydrogenation efficiency gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2). The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability. The support effects of catalysts were also considered to be an important topic. Previous studies reported that the Ga2O3 species were dispersed on different supports including TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZSM-5, HZSM-48 and MWW zeolites for alkane dehydrogenation reaction. Many literatures verified that acidity of support evidently influenced the catalytic performance of the supported catalysts. The detailed investigations of different supports on the catalytic performances for Ga2O3-based catalysts are rarely reported, especially with SBA-15 material as support. The dispersion of Ga2O3 species varied with different supports, and the effects of supports on the state of gallium species have not been fully understood, especially the causes of these changes.", "Chinese": "丙烯需求的不断增长促使人们更加关注丙烷催化脱氢制丙烯，因为传统的烃类蒸汽裂解和催化裂解工艺无法满足日益增长的需求。基于氧化镓的催化剂，包括Ga/H-ZSM-5，由于其能够激活烃类物质并具有优异的催化效率，已被公认为是烷烃脱氢的有前途的材料。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究表明，催化剂中强酸位的存在可以导致更多的分散良好的Ga物种，这对丙烷脱氢反应是有利的。5Ga2O3/ZSM-5样品表现出最高的催化活性，具有最大量的分散良好的镓物种和高脱氢效率的镓离子（Gad+阳离子，d < 2）。5Ga2O3/SBA-15催化剂表现出最高的催化稳定性。催化剂的载体效应也被认为是一个重要的课题。以前的研究报道，Ga2O3物种分散在TiO2、MgO、Al2O3、ZrO2、ZSM-5、HZSM-48和MWW沸石等不同的载体上，用于烷烃脱氢反应。许多文献证实，载体的酸性对负载催化剂的催化性能有明显影响。对于基于Ga2O3的催化剂，不同载体对其催化性能的详细研究很少被报道，特别是在SBA-15材料作为载体的情况下。Ga2O3物种的分散度随不同载体而变化，载体对镓物种状态的影响尚未完全理解，特别是这些变化的原因。", "Doi": "10.1039/c6ra27204e"},

The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review.

The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review.

PDH technology is considered a promising method for propylene production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about active Ga species. DFT calculations have shown that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 involves the loss of hydrogen to form hydroxyl groups, but the desorption step of adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3. Efforts to improve the activity of GaOx-based catalysts have included doping to increase the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, and the use of trace Pt as a promoter to facilitate hydrogen desorption and recover gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species. H2 pretreatment can also promote the formation of more active GaH species. However, GaOx-based catalysts suffer from significant sintering during continuous regeneration operations, so controlled regeneration is desired to recover their performance. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking.

The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review. The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.", "Chinese": "丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），作为传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解的替代方案。发现活性和选择性催化剂是开发这些目的技术的核心。丙烷脱氢的研究是一个不断增长的领域，目前有几篇关于直接脱氢（DDH）、二氧化碳软氧化（ODH-CO2）和氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）的综述文章。本文的范围是批判性地回顾DDH、ODH-CO2和ODH-O2的文献，以确定催化剂设计的总体主题和共同规则。我们不试图捕捉反应设计和工程的方面，这本身是一个充满活力的研究领域。我们试图通过计算空间时间产率（STY）（以molC3H6 kgcat1 h1为单位）来比较不同子反应中催化剂的性能，这是基于催化剂的初始活性。此外，我们强调了每个反应的环境和工业视角以及工业应用的前景。不同现有丙烯生产技术的环境和经济方面在审查基于脱氢的较新技术的可行性时是重要的考虑因素。绿色化学原则，如原子经济性、有毒化学品的使用和原料的可再生性，尤其相关。直接丙烷脱氢与SC和MTO基准相比，在绿色化学的许多原则方面令人满意：它是高度原子经济的，不使用有毒反应物（或产生有毒副产品），原则上可以利用可再生原料。然而，在实践中，只有当反应能够有效运行，具有最小的副产品和最大产量时，脱氢才是一种理想的丙烯生产方式。这些因素受催化剂选择的支配，这是当前综述的主要焦点。开发活性、选择性和稳定的催化剂对于脱氢在近期和长期未来被视为可行的过程至关重要。", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},

Propylene is currently obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries [2]. However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehy- drogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to produc- ing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5].

[10] Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not suffi- ciently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species [11,30].\nHensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/ H-ZSM-5 with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spec- troscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting that these species could play an active role in the PDH.\nHowever, they collected spectra at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, and the state of the catalyst at room temperature after cooling may not be representative of the catalyst state at 500 C.\nRecently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio.\nThis was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11].\nFTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were con- ducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga spe- ciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample.\nSchreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,and DFT calculations.\nThe hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and iso- lated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [9 11,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indi- rect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental character- izations and computational investigations.", "English": "The growing demand for propylene has led to a gap between demand and supply, as propylene is traditionally obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units in refineries. The abundance of natural gas as a feedstock has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is seen as a potentially effective alternative method to produce propylene. Two commercialized PDH processes are the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with a Pt-based catalyst. However, the high cost of Pt and health and environmental concerns associated with Cr have driven the development of alternative PDH catalysts, such as Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of PDH remain topics of active discussion. Various experimental techniques, including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), have been used to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in PDH. A number of Ga species have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early X-ray absorption studies suggested that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, independent of gallium loading and reducing gas, consistent with a recent report.

Hensen and coworkers first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting these species could play an active role in PDH. However, spectra were collected at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, which may not represent the catalyst state at 500 C. Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for PDH, and catalyst reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by FTIR spectroscopic, NH3-TPD results, and thermodynamic stability analysis. However, FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments were conducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state, where Ga speciation could differ from the reduced sample. Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations.

The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review. The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.", "Chinese": "丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），作为传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解的替代方案。发现活性和选择性催化剂是开发这些目的技术的核心。丙烷脱氢的研究是一个不断增长的领域，目前有几篇关于直接脱氢（DDH）、二氧化碳软氧化（ODH-CO2）和氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）的综述文章。本文的范围是批判性地回顾DDH、ODH-CO2和ODH-O2的文献，以确定催化剂设计的总体主题和共同规则。我们不试图捕捉反应设计和工程的方面，这本身是一个充满活力的研究领域。我们试图通过计算空间时间产率（STY）（以molC3H6 kgcat1 h1为单位）来比较不同子反应中催化剂的性能，这是基于催化剂的初始活性。此外，我们强调了每个反应的环境和工业视角以及工业应用的前景。不同现有丙烯生产技术的环境和经济方面在审查基于脱氢的较新技术的可行性时是重要的考虑因素。绿色化学原则，如原子经济性、有毒化学品的使用和原料的可再生性，尤其相关。直接丙烷脱氢与SC和MTO基准相比，在绿色化学的许多原则方面令人满意：它是高度原子经济的，不使用有毒反应物（或产生有毒副产品），原则上可以利用可再生原料。然而，在实践中，只有当反应能够有效运行，具有最小的副产品和最大产量时，脱氢才是一种理想的丙烯生产方式。这些因素受催化剂选择的支配，这是当前综述的主要焦点。开发活性、选择性和稳定的催化剂对于脱氢在近期和长期未来被视为可行的过程至关重要。", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},

The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review.

The 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity, possessing the maximum well-dispersed gallium species and high dehydrogenation efficiency gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2). The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability. The support effects of catalysts were also considered to be an important topic. Previous studies reported that the Ga2O3 species were dispersed on different supports including TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZSM-5, HZSM-48 and MWW zeolites for alkane dehydrogenation reaction. Many literatures verified that acidity of support evidently influenced the catalytic performance of the supported catalysts. The detailed investigations of different supports on the catalytic performances for Ga2O3-based catalysts are rarely reported, especially with SBA-15 material as support. The dispersion of Ga2O3 species varied with different supports, and the effects of supports on the state of gallium species have not been fully understood, especially the causes of these changes.", "Chinese": "丙烯需求的不断增长促使人们更加关注丙烷催化脱氢制丙烯，因为传统的烃类蒸汽裂解和催化裂解工艺无法满足日益增长的需求。基于氧化镓的催化剂，包括Ga/H-ZSM-5，由于其能够激活烃类物质并具有优异的催化效率，已被公认为是烷烃脱氢的有前途的材料。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究表明，催化剂中强酸位的存在可以导致更多的分散良好的Ga物种，这对丙烷脱氢反应是有利的。5Ga2O3/ZSM-5样品表现出最高的催化活性，具有最大量的分散良好的镓物种和高脱氢效率的镓离子（Gad+阳离子，d < 2）。5Ga2O3/SBA-15催化剂表现出最高的催化稳定性。催化剂的载体效应也被认为是一个重要的课题。以前的研究报道，Ga2O3物种分散在TiO2、MgO、Al2O3、ZrO2、ZSM-5、HZSM-48和MWW沸石等不同的载体上，用于烷烃脱氢反应。许多文献证实，载体的酸性对负载催化剂的催化性能有明显影响。对于基于Ga2O3的催化剂，不同载体对其催化性能的详细研究很少被报道，特别是在SBA-15材料作为载体的情况下。Ga2O3物种的分散度随不同载体而变化，载体对镓物种状态的影响尚未完全理解，特别是这些变化的原因。", "Doi": "10.1039/c6ra27204e"},

The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review.

The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review.

PDH technology is considered a promising method for propylene production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about active Ga species. DFT calculations have shown that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 involves the loss of hydrogen to form hydroxyl groups, but the desorption step of adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3. Efforts to improve the activity of GaOx-based catalysts have included doping to increase the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, and the use of trace Pt as a promoter to facilitate hydrogen desorption and recover gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species. H2 pretreatment can also promote the formation of more active GaH species. However, GaOx-based catalysts suffer from significant sintering during continuous regeneration operations, so controlled regeneration is desired to recover their performance. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking.

The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review. The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.", "Chinese": "丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），作为传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解的替代方案。发现活性和选择性催化剂是开发这些目的技术的核心。丙烷脱氢的研究是一个不断增长的领域，目前有几篇关于直接脱氢（DDH）、二氧化碳软氧化（ODH-CO2）和氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）的综述文章。本文的范围是批判性地回顾DDH、ODH-CO2和ODH-O2的文献，以确定催化剂设计的总体主题和共同规则。我们不试图捕捉反应设计和工程的方面，这本身是一个充满活力的研究领域。我们试图通过计算空间时间产率（STY）（以molC3H6 kgcat1 h1为单位）来比较不同子反应中催化剂的性能，这是基于催化剂的初始活性。此外，我们强调了每个反应的环境和工业视角以及工业应用的前景。不同现有丙烯生产技术的环境和经济方面在审查基于脱氢的较新技术的可行性时是重要的考虑因素。绿色化学原则，如原子经济性、有毒化学品的使用和原料的可再生性，尤其相关。直接丙烷脱氢与SC和MTO基准相比，在绿色化学的许多原则方面令人满意：它是高度原子经济的，不使用有毒反应物（或产生有毒副产品），原则上可以利用可再生原料。然而，在实践中，只有当反应能够有效运行，具有最小的副产品和最大产量时，脱氢才是一种理想的丙烯生产方式。这些因素受催化剂选择的支配，这是当前综述的主要焦点。开发活性、选择性和稳定的催化剂对于脱氢在近期和长期未来被视为可行的过程至关重要。", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},

Propylene is currently obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries [2]. However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehy- drogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to produc- ing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5].

[10] Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not suffi- ciently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species [11,30].\nHensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/ H-ZSM-5 with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spec- troscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting that these species could play an active role in the PDH.\nHowever, they collected spectra at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, and the state of the catalyst at room temperature after cooling may not be representative of the catalyst state at 500 C.\nRecently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio.\nThis was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11].\nFTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were con- ducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga spe- ciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample.\nSchreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,and DFT calculations.\nThe hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and iso- lated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [9 11,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indi- rect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental character- izations and computational investigations.", "English": "The growing demand for propylene has led to a gap between demand and supply, as propylene is traditionally obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units in refineries. The abundance of natural gas as a feedstock has exacerbated this gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is seen as a potentially effective alternative method to produce propylene. Two commercialized PDH processes are the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with a Pt-based catalyst. However, the high cost of Pt and health and environmental concerns associated with Cr have driven the development of alternative PDH catalysts, such as Ga-, Zn-, Co-, V-based, and ZrO2 catalysts. Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes, but the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of PDH remain topics of active discussion. Various experimental techniques, including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), have been used to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in PDH. A number of Ga species have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Early X-ray absorption studies suggested that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, independent of gallium loading and reducing gas, consistent with a recent report.

Hensen and coworkers first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting these species could play an active role in PDH. However, spectra were collected at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, which may not represent the catalyst state at 500 C. Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for PDH, and catalyst reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio, supported by FTIR spectroscopic, NH3-TPD results, and thermodynamic stability analysis. However, FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments were conducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state, where Ga speciation could differ from the reduced sample. Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations.

The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review. The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.", "Chinese": "丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），作为传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解的替代方案。发现活性和选择性催化剂是开发这些目的技术的核心。丙烷脱氢的研究是一个不断增长的领域，目前有几篇关于直接脱氢（DDH）、二氧化碳软氧化（ODH-CO2）和氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）的综述文章。本文的范围是批判性地回顾DDH、ODH-CO2和ODH-O2的文献，以确定催化剂设计的总体主题和共同规则。我们不试图捕捉反应设计和工程的方面，这本身是一个充满活力的研究领域。我们试图通过计算空间时间产率（STY）（以molC3H6 kgcat1 h1为单位）来比较不同子反应中催化剂的性能，这是基于催化剂的初始活性。此外，我们强调了每个反应的环境和工业视角以及工业应用的前景。不同现有丙烯生产技术的环境和经济方面在审查基于脱氢的较新技术的可行性时是重要的考虑因素。绿色化学原则，如原子经济性、有毒化学品的使用和原料的可再生性，尤其相关。直接丙烷脱氢与SC和MTO基准相比，在绿色化学的许多原则方面令人满意：它是高度原子经济的，不使用有毒反应物（或产生有毒副产品），原则上可以利用可再生原料。然而，在实践中，只有当反应能够有效运行，具有最小的副产品和最大产量时，脱氢才是一种理想的丙烯生产方式。这些因素受催化剂选择的支配，这是当前综述的主要焦点。开发活性、选择性和稳定的催化剂对于脱氢在近期和长期未来被视为可行的过程至关重要。", "Doi": "10.1039/d1gc03700e"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-5 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well: among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation. Bell and coworkers believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory. Phadke et al. have pointed out that Ga-exchanged species associated with Al-pairs in Ga/H-MFI catalyze both propane and butane dehydrogenation while isolated Ga species did not. They found, however, that both Ga species exhibited similar properties for ethane dehydrogenation. It is thus possible that the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation with the In-CHA catalyst is different from that of ethane dehydrogenation.", "Chinese": "全球对丙烯的需求日益增长，以及从页岩气中提取的丙烷成本低廉，重新激发了人们对丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）的兴趣。金属阳离子（Ga+，Zn2+，Co2+等）在H-ZSM-5沸石中交换，也显示出有前景的烷烃脱氢性能：其中，Ga/H-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢中表现出高稳定性和高丙烯选择性（90%）。贝尔和他的同事认为，单个[GaH]2+位点是活性位点；然而，施赖伯等人报告说，Ga+H+对位点是稳定的活性位点，这一模型得到了我们实验室结果的支持。帕德克等人指出，与Ga/H-MFI中Al对相关的Ga交换物种催化丙烷和丁烷脱氢，而孤立的Ga物种则没有。然而，他们发现这两种Ga物种在乙烷脱氢方面表现出相似的性质。因此，In-CHA催化剂催化丙烷脱氢的反应机理可能与乙烷脱氢不同。", "Doi": "10.1039/d1sc05866e"},

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the identification of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations as the active sites for dehydrogenation activity. However, the exact nature of the active sites is still under debate, with some authors proposing the presence of Lewis acid sites, while others suggest the involvement of both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites. The role of CO2 in improving olefin yields has also been studied, with various mechanisms proposed, including the removal of acid sites, coke gasification, and hydrogen removal by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. The addition of promoters, such as potassium, has been shown to reduce coke formation and increase selectivity. The reducibility of Ga2O3 and the effect of hydrogen and steam on the catalyst's activity have also been investigated.
