          The growing demand for propylene has led to increased attention on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes cannot meet the growing demand. Gallium oxide-based catalysts, including Ga/H-ZSM-5, have been recognized as promising materials for alkane dehydrogenation due to their capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has shown that the existence of strong acid sites in the catalyst can lead to more well-dispersed Ga species, which is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity, possessing the maximum well-dispersed gallium species and high dehydrogenation efficiency gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2). The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability. The support effects of catalysts were also considered to be an important topic. Previous studies reported that the Ga2O3 species were dispersed on different supports including TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZSM-5, HZSM-48 and MWW zeolites for alkane dehydrogenation reaction. Many literatures verified that acidity of support evidently influenced the catalytic performance of the supported catalysts. The detailed investigations of different supports on the catalytic performances for Ga2O3-based catalysts are rarely reported, especially with SBA-15 material as support. The dispersion of Ga2O3 species varied with different supports, and the effects of supports on the state of gallium species have not been fully understood, especially the causes of these changes.

          丙烯需求的不断增长促使人们更加关注丙烷催化脱氢制丙烯，因为传统的烃类蒸汽裂解和催化裂解工艺无法满足日益增长的需求。基于氧化镓的催化剂，包括Ga/H-ZSM-5，由于其能够激活烃类物质并具有优异的催化效率，已被公认为是烷烃脱氢的有前途的材料。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最近的研究表明，催化剂中强酸位的存在可以导致更多的分散良好的Ga物种，这对丙烷脱氢反应是有利的。5Ga2O3/ZSM-5样品表现出最高的催化活性，具有最大量的分散良好的镓物种和高脱氢效率的镓离子（Gad+阳离子，d < 2）。5Ga2O3/SBA-15催化剂表现出最高的催化稳定性。催化剂的载体效应也被认为是一个重要的课题。以前的研究报道，Ga2O3物种分散在TiO2、MgO、Al2O3、ZrO2、ZSM-5、HZSM-48和MWW沸石等不同的载体上，用于烷烃脱氢反应。许多文献证实，载体的酸性对负载催化剂的催化性能有明显影响。对于基于Ga2O3的催化剂，不同载体对其催化性能的详细研究很少被报道，特别是在SBA-15材料作为载体的情况下。Ga2O3物种的分散度随不同载体而变化，载体对镓物种状态的影响尚未完全理解，特别是这些变化的原因。
