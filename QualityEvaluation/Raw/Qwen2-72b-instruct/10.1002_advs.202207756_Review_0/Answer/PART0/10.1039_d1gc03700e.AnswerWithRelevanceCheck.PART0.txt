          [1] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
          [2] "The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale."
          [3] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
          [4] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
          [5] "Historically, a bifunctional Ga/H-ZSM-5 material has been applied as a catalyst for the commercial process for propane aromatization, developed jointly by UOP and BP as the Cyclar Process."
          [6] "Sattler et al. reported a Pt-promoted Ga/γ-Al2O3 species (Pt3Ga/γ-Al2O3) as a highly promising catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, which showed remarkably high activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."
          [7] "Further investigations by Searles et al. showed that a Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalyst, featuring a highly dispersed GaxPt alloy structure, had a long-term stability evident in unchanged propene selectivity (>99%) over the course of a 20 h DDH reaction."
          [8] "Cybulskis et al. reported that the preparation strategy could greatly influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts."
          [9] "Shao et al. established an optimal Ga loading of 5 wt%, reporting an initial propene yield on different supports that followed the trend: Ga/H-ZSM-5 (48%) > Ga/γ-Al2O3 (43%) > Ga/SBA-15 (28%) > Ga/SiO2 (9%)."
          [10] "Schreiber et al. further verified the active sites for MFI supported Ga catalysts with moderate acidity, reporting an optimal Ga/Al ratio of 0.5, which enhanced the dehydrogenation rate."
          [11] "DFT calculations indicated that the generated LewisBrnsted acid pair is much more active than an isolated Ga+, due to the large increase in Lewis acidity upon protonation of Ga+ by the BAS, which facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation."
          [12] "The BAS also significantly reduces the activation barrier for H2 elimination by recombination with a hydride."

          The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an alternative to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies. Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field, with several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2). The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2, and ODH-O2 to identify overarching themes and common rules for catalyst design. The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation. Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals, and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant. The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane. Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum, and the propane production industry has responded accordingly. The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale. TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year. Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year. The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation. While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity. Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel as well as glycerol and other substrates. With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this. Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks. However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review. The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.

          丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），作为传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解的替代方案。发现活性和选择性催化剂是开发这些目的技术的核心。丙烷脱氢的研究是一个不断增长的领域，目前有几篇关于直接脱氢（DDH）、二氧化碳软氧化（ODH-CO2）和氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）的综述文章。本文的范围是批判性地回顾DDH、ODH-CO2和ODH-O2的文献，以确定催化剂设计的总体主题和共同规则。我们不试图捕捉反应设计和工程的方面，这本身是一个充满活力的研究领域。我们试图通过计算空间时间产率（STY）（以molC3H6 kgcat1 h1为单位）来比较不同子反应中催化剂的性能，这是基于催化剂的初始活性。此外，我们强调了每个反应的环境和工业视角以及工业应用的前景。不同现有丙烯生产技术的环境和经济方面在审查基于脱氢的较新技术的可行性时是重要的考虑因素。绿色化学原则，如原子经济性、有毒化学品的使用和原料的可再生性，尤其相关。直接丙烷脱氢与SC和MTO基准相比，在绿色化学的许多原则方面令人满意：它是高度原子经济的，不使用有毒反应物（或产生有毒副产品），原则上可以利用可再生原料。然而，在实践中，只有当反应能够有效运行，具有最小的副产品和最大产量时，脱氢才是一种理想的丙烯生产方式。这些因素受催化剂选择的支配，这是当前综述的主要焦点。开发活性、选择性和稳定的催化剂对于脱氢在近期和长期未来被视为可行的过程至关重要。
