1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered one of the most promising propylene production methods. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the identification of [GaH]2+ together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site as the active site for PDH reactions.
