1.The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered one of the most promising propylene production methods. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with recent research findings contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts. However, the ongoing debate about active Ga species remains unresolved.
