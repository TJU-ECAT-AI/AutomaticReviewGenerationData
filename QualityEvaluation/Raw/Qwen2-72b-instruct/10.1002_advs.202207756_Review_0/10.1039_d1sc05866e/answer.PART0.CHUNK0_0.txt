1.The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-5 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well: among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation. Bell and coworkers believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory. Phadke et al. have pointed out that Ga-exchanged species associated with Al-pairs in Ga/H-MFI catalyze both propane and butane dehydrogenation while isolated Ga species did not. They found, however, that both Ga species exhibited similar properties for ethane dehydrogenation. It is thus possible that the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation with the In-CHA catalyst is different from that of ethane dehydrogenation.

1.全球对丙烯需求的增加以及从页岩气中提取的丙烷成本的降低,重新激发了人们对丙烷脱氢反应(PDH)的兴趣。在H-ZSM-5沸石中交换的金属阳离子(Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+等)也显示出良好的烷烃脱氢性能:其中,Ga/H-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢中表现出高稳定性和高丙烯选择性(90%)。Bell及其同事认为,单个[GaH]2+位点是活性位点;然而,Schreiber等人报告称,Ga+H+对位点是稳定的活性位点,这一模型得到了我们实验室结果的支持。Phadke等人指出,与Ga/H-MFI中Al对相关的Ga交换物种催化丙烷和丁烷脱氢,而孤立的Ga物种则没有。然而,他们发现这两种Ga物种在乙烷脱氢中表现出相似的性质。因此,In-CHA催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的机理可能与乙烷脱氢不同。
