Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How has the growing demand for propylene influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and how has the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH evolved, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts?

1.The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-5 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well: among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation. Bell and coworkers believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory. Phadke et al. have pointed out that Ga-exchanged species associated with Al-pairs in Ga/H-MFI catalyze both propane and butane dehydrogenation while isolated Ga species did not. They found, however, that both Ga species exhibited similar properties for ethane dehydrogenation. It is thus possible that the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation with the In-CHA catalyst is different from that of ethane dehydrogenation.

1.全球对丙烯需求的增加以及从页岩气中提取的丙烷成本的降低,重新激发了人们对丙烷脱氢反应(PDH)的兴趣。在H-ZSM-5沸石中交换的金属阳离子(Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+等)也显示出良好的烷烃脱氢性能:其中,Ga/H-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢中表现出高稳定性和高丙烯选择性(90%)。Bell及其同事认为,单个[GaH]2+位点是活性位点;然而,Schreiber等人报告称,Ga+H+对位点是稳定的活性位点,这一模型得到了我们实验室结果的支持。Phadke等人指出,与Ga/H-MFI中Al对相关的Ga交换物种催化丙烷和丁烷脱氢,而孤立的Ga物种则没有。然而,他们发现这两种Ga物种在乙烷脱氢中表现出相似的性质。因此,In-CHA催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的机理可能与乙烷脱氢不同。
