1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The focus of the literature is on the chemistry of ethylene on Pt(111) surfaces, including molecular desorption, dehydrogenation to ethylidyne, H-D exchange within adsorbed molecules, and hydrogenation to ethane. The complexity of the reactions and the difficulty in determining the exact mechanism are discussed, but the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is not mentioned.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论。文献的重点是乙烯在Pt(111)表面上的化学，包括分子解吸、脱氢至乙炔、吸附分子内的H-D交换和氢化至乙烷。讨论了反应的复杂性和确定确切机制的困难，但没有提及Horiuti-Polanyi机制。
