1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts. For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are: (1) Adsorption of ethane on the metal surface, (2) Dissociation of ethane to form a surface-bound ethyl species, (3) Dehydrogenation of the surface-bound ethyl species to form ethene and hydrogen, and (4) Desorption of ethene and hydrogen from the metal surface. At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step over a range of metal catalysts, and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the degree of dehydrogenation of the C2Hx surface species that are important in the CC bond scission. In particular, over supported and unsupported Pt surfaces, C2Hx adsorbed species with x in the range 05 have been reported to be the surface intermediates responsible for cleavage of the CC bond. The number of hydrogen atoms in the adsorbed C2Hx in which CC bond cleaves may differ from one surface to another. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because of the lack of consensus on the detailed mechanism of CC bond cleavage and the role of surface intermediates in this process.

1.通常使用Horiuti-Polanyi机制来描述金属催化剂上烷烃的脱氢和烯烃的氢化。对于乙烷脱氢，该机制的初级反应步骤是：（1）乙烷在金属表面的吸附，（2）乙烷的解离形成表面结合的乙基物种，（3）表面结合的乙基物种的脱氢形成乙烯和氢气，以及（4）乙烯和氢气从金属表面的解吸。在较高温度下，乙烷的解离吸附被观察为一系列金属催化剂的速率决定步骤，特别是Pt和Pt,Sn催化剂。然而，关于C2Hx表面物种的脱氢程度，即在CC键裂解中重要的物种，存在持续的争论。特别是，在支撑和非支撑的Pt表面上，报道C2Hx吸附物种（x在05范围内）是负责CC键裂解的表面中间体。在吸附的C2Hx中CC键裂解的氢原子数量可能因表面而异。尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为对CC键裂解的详细机制和表面中间体在这一过程中的作用缺乏共识。
