1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts. For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are: (1) Adsorption of ethane on the metal surface, (2) Dissociation of ethane to form a surface-bound ethyl radical, (3) Dehydrogenation of the surface-bound ethyl radical to form ethene and a hydrogen atom, and (4) Desorption of ethene from the metal surface. At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step over a range of metal catalysts, and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the degree of dehydrogenation of the C2Hx surface species that are important in the CC bond scission. In particular, over supported and unsupported Pt surfaces, C2Hx adsorbed species with x in the range 05 have been reported to be the surface intermediates responsible for cleavage of the CC bond. The number of hydrogen atoms in the adsorbed C2Hx in which CC bond cleaves may differ from one surface to another. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because of the lack of consensus on the detailed mechanism of CC bond cleavage and the role of different surface species in the reaction.

1.通常使用Horiuti-Polanyi机制来描述金属催化剂上烷烃的脱氢和烯烃的氢化。对于乙烷脱氢，该机制的初级反应步骤是：（1）乙烷在金属表面的吸附，（2）乙烷的解离形成表面结合的乙基自由基，（3）表面结合的乙基自由基的脱氢形成乙烯和一个氢原子，以及（4）乙烯从金属表面的解吸。在高温下，乙烷的解离吸附被观察到是各种金属催化剂，特别是Pt和Pt,Sn催化剂的速率决定步骤。然而，关于C2Hx表面物种在CC键裂解中的重要性，存在持续的争论。特别是，在支撑和非支撑的Pt表面上，报告了C2Hx吸附物种（x在05范围内）是负责CC键裂解的表面中间体。在吸附的C2Hx中CC键裂解的氢原子数量可能因表面而异。尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为对CC键裂解的详细机制和不同表面物种在反应中的作用缺乏共识。
