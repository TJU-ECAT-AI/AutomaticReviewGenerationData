1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts. For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are: (1) Adsorption of ethane on the metal surface, (2) Dissociative adsorption of ethane to form C2H5 (ads) and H (ads), (3) Dehydrogenation of C2H5 (ads) to form C2H4 (ads) and H (ads), (4) Desorption of ethene and hydrogen from the metal surface. At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step over a range of metal catalysts, and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the degree of dehydrogenation of the C2Hx surface species that are important in the CC bond scission. In particular, over supported and unsupported Pt surfaces, C2Hx adsorbed species with x in the range 05 have been reported to be the surface intermediates responsible for cleavage of the CC bond. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because of the lack of consensus on the exact nature of the rate-determining step and the surface intermediates involved in the reaction.

1.通常使用Horiuti-Polanyi机制来描述金属催化剂上烷烃的脱氢和烯烃的氢化。对于乙烷脱氢，该机制的基元反应步骤是：（1）乙烷在金属表面的吸附，（2）乙烷的解离吸附形成C2H5（ads）和H（ads），（3）C2H5（ads）的脱氢形成C2H4（ads）和H（ads），（4）从金属表面解吸乙烯和氢气。在高温下，乙烷的解离吸附被观察到是Pt和Pt,Sn催化剂上一系列金属催化剂的速率决定步骤。然而，关于C2Hx表面物种的脱氢程度，即在CC键裂解中起重要作用的物种，存在持续的争论。特别是，在支撑和非支撑的Pt表面上，据报道C2Hx吸附物种（x在05范围内）是负责CC键裂解的表面中间体。尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为缺乏对速率决定步骤的确切性质和参与反应的表面中间体的共识。
