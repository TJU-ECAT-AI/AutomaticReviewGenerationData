1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts. For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are: (1) Adsorption of ethane on the metal surface, (2) Dissociative adsorption of ethane to form C2H5 (ads) and H (ads), (3) Dehydrogenation of C2H5 (ads) to form C2H4 (ads) and H (ads), (4) Desorption of ethene and hydrogen from the metal surface. At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step over a range of metal catalysts, and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the degree of dehydrogenation of the C2Hx surface species that are important in the CC bond scission. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because of the lack of consensus on the specific surface intermediates and the rate-determining step of the reaction.

1.通常使用Horiuti-Polanyi机制来描述金属催化剂上烷烃的脱氢和烯烃的氢化。对于乙烷脱氢，该机制的基元反应步骤是：(1) 乙烷在金属表面的吸附，(2) 乙烷的解离吸附形成C2H5(ads)和H(ads)，(3) C2H5(ads)的脱氢形成C2H4(ads)和H(ads)，(4) 乙烯和氢从金属表面的解吸。在较高温度下，乙烷的解离吸附被观察到是Pt和Pt,Sn催化剂上一系列金属催化剂的速率决定步骤。然而，关于C2Hx表面物种在CC键裂解中的重要性，脱氢程度的争议仍然存在。尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为缺乏对反应的具体表面中间体和速率决定步骤的共识。
