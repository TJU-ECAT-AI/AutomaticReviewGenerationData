1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or discuss its four main steps. It does not analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The reason why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study is not discussed either.
