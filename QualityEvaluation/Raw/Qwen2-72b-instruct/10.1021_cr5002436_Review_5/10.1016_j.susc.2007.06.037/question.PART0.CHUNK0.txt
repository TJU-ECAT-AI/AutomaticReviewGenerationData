Institut fu r Physikalische und Theoretische Chemie, Universita t Bonn, Wegelerstrasse 12, 53115 Bonn, Germany Received 7 May 2007; accepted for publication 21 June 2007 Available online 28 June 2007 Abstract The adsorption of ethene (C2H4) on Pt(111) and the Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys has been investigated experi- mentally by high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption. The experimental results have been compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations allowing us to perform a complete assignment of all vibration modes and loss features to the species present on the surfaces. On Pt(111) as well as on the PtSn surface alloys an g2 di-r-bonded conformation of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form. In addition to this majority species a minor amount of p-bonded ethene has been identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces. Additionally the HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(111) and the PtSn surface alloys differ only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Ethene is a major intermediate in chemical industry and moreover a good model agent for the investigation of the adsorption of alkenes on alloy surfaces. The world produc- tion of ethene exceeded 75,000,000 metric tons per year in 2005 [1]. Pt-based catalysts are important in heterogeneous catalysis, e.g. for conversion of ethane to ethene by oxidative dehydrogenation in a flow tube reactor. In this context PtSn catalysts are used for an optimized conversion and selectivity [2] and are superior to pure platinum catalysts. Moreover these bimetallic catalysts are important for suppressing the hydrogenolysis that can occur on pure platinum [3,4].
A detailed microscopic understanding of the catalytic process can only be gained through a simplification of the structure of the model catalyst by using single crystals.
This will allow us to attribute the catalytic properties to specific sites on the atomic scale of the catalyst surface.
Good candidates for such as systematic investigation are the two ordered PtSn surface alloys first reported by Paffet and Windham [5]. These Pt3Sn and Pt2Sn surface alloys are well characterized by a variety of techniques [6] and can be easily prepared by annealing of a Sn-covered Pt(111) sur- face at high temperatures. For annealing temperatures of about 800 K a ffiffiffi 3 p
ffiffiffi 3 p R30 LEED pattern can be observed corresponding to the Pt2Sn surface alloy, whereas at temperatures of about 1015 K a (2 · 2) LEED pattern indicates the formation of a Pt3Sn surface alloy [59].
Extensive studies of the adsorption of hydrocarbons on PtxSn/Pt(111) show a suppressed dehydrogenation on these surface alloys compared to the pure Pt(111) surface [1013]. Investigations of ethene on these surfaces with temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and high-reso- lution energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) suggested that the absence of dehydrogenation is due to missing adjacent platinum 3-fold hollow sites, which are needed during the 0039-6028/$ - see front matter  2007 Elsevier B.V.

The adsorption and decomposition of ethene on the Pt(111) surfaces has been copiously investigated by vari- ous techniques. Cassuto et al. observed by NEXAFS that ethene adsorbs p-bonded on the Pt(111) surface at temper- atures below 52 K [14,15]; above this temperature ethene changes its conformation to a di-r-bonded species with the CC axis parallel to the surface. The ethene adsorption on Pt(111) was also thoroughly investigated using HREELS and temperature programmed desorption [16 20] and the adsorption mode is generally described as being of di-r type. These experimental findings are corroborated by a number of theoretical calculations, which show that the di-r species is by at least 30% more stable than the p-bonded conformation on the Pt(111) surface [2124].
The p species has however been found to coexist with the di-r species under high pressure conditions [25] and its importance for the hydrogenation of ethene on Pt(111) was pointed out by O fner and Zaera [26,27] and Cremer et al. [28]. Above 240 K a conversion to ethylidyne occurs [16,18,19,29], which is accompanied by a self-hydrogena- tion of a minor fraction of the ethene [27].
In this work we aim at the more complete understanding of the bonding mechanism of ethene on Pt(111) and the two ordered PtxSn surface alloys. To this end, the adsorp- tion of ethene was investigated experimentally using HREELS and TPD, and these results are compared to the- oretical results from DFT calculations. The combination of experimental and theoretical results provides us with exact bonding distances, angles and energies of the adsorbed eth- ene species. Furthermore, a full assignment of the vibration modes of the adsorbed ethene and ethylidyne will be given.
2. Experimental details
The experiments were performed in an ultrahigh vac- uum (UHV) chamber operated at a base pressure of 108 Pa. The system was equipped with instrumentation for high-resolution electron loss spectroscopy (HREELS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for temperature programmed desorption (TPD).
For the experiments a disk-shaped Pt(111) sample of 9 mm diameter (MaTeck, Ju lich) was used, which was mounted between twisted tantalum wires wedged into grooves in the side of the crystal. The cooling was provided by a LN2 reservoir, which was directly connected, to the sample holder.
Cleaning of the sample was achieved by cycles of Ar+ ion sputtering (2 keV) at 900 K and annealing at 1150 K.
The cleanliness of the Pt(111) was monitored by AES and HREELS.
TPD measurements were made using the QMS in line- of-sight with the sample surface and using a linear heating rate of 2 K/s, which was controlled by a Eurotherm 2408 temperature controller. The HREELS spectrometer was run at a resolution of 4 meV and a primary energy of
3.0 eV. Spectra were recorded in specular geometry at a
scattering angle of 60 relative to the surface normal. An Al2O3 crucible, which was wrapped by a tungsten filament,was used for evaporation of Sn. The temperature was con- trolled by a thermocouple of type K.

Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys were prepared by evaporating Sn onto the clean Pt(111) surface followed by annealing.
This process was monitored by AES and LEED. After annealing to a temperature between 750 and 900 K the surfaces exhibited the ffiffiffi 3 p
ffiffiffi 3 p R30 LEED pattern cor- responding to the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. In a temper- ature range between 1000 and 1050 K a p(2 · 2) LEED pattern was obtained, characteristic of the Pt3Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Ethene exposure was performed by backfill- ing the UHV system with research grade ethene (99.95%, Air Liquide) to a pressure 1.5 · 106 Pa. The exposures are given in Langmuirs (1 L = 1.33 · 104 Pa s).
3. Computational details
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [3032]. This program permits periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations using a plane wave basis set and the PAW method. The PAW method is a fro- zen core method, which utilizes the exact valence wave functions instead of pseudo potentials [33]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level was used with the functional of Predew and Wang 91 [34].
The idealized surface was represented by a periodic four- layer slab, on which the adsorption can take place on only one side. For modeling the alloy surfaces Pt2Sn/Pt(111) and Pt3Sn/Pt(111) it is supposed that only the first layer contains Sn atoms. Each slab is separated from its periodic image in z-direction by 5 layers of vacuum (11.5 A ).
Only one molecule is adsorbed per (3 · 3) unit cell (h = 1/9 ML). For all structures the geometry optimization included all degrees of freedom of the adsorbed ethene molecule and the first two layers of the surface. The two following layers of Pt below are frozen. The same inter- atomic distance for the surface alloys like in pure Pt
(2.82 A
) (optimized from Pt bulk calculations) is used. This assumption is justified because the experimental lattice parameter is imposed by the Pt bulk, and the larger Sn atoms in the first layer evade this compression by an out- ward displacement, which induces a Pt-Sn distance of
2.86 A
[13]. The adsorption energy is defined as the differ- ence between the energy of the whole adsorption system and that of the pure slab and the free ethene.
Since the molecules are adsorbed on one side of the slab only, the unit cell has a net dipole moment resulting in elec- trostatic interactions between the periodic slabs, which affect the total energy. A correction has been applied to the energy and calculated potential in order to compensate
J.M. Essen et al. / Surface Science 601 (2007) 34723480
3473 for this effect. This correction does not exceed 30 meV for Pt and 60 meV for the alloys.
The HREELS spectra were simulated by the calculation of the vibration frequencies [35] and the loss intensities caused by dipole scattering. Within the harmonic approach these values can be derived by a numerical calculation of the second derivatives of the potential energy surface.
Any surface phonon coupling is neglected. The intensities of the HREELS-spectra are calculated considering only the dipole scattering mechanism by the formula given in Ref. [35]. The loss intensities are proportional to the square of the dynamic dipole moments and to a function that de- pends on experimental parameters and the inverse of the dipole moment [13].
4. Results
In order to establish reference data and record enhanced HREELS spectra that can be compared to the theoretically predicted ones we reinvestigated the adsorption of ethene on the Pt(111) surface. Likewise new TPD spectra have been acquired in order to deduced the relevant annealing temperature for the HREELS studies.
The TPD spectra (Fig. 1) of ethene (m/e = 27), ethane (m/e = 30) and hydrogen (m/e = 2) from the Pt(111) sur- face, after different exposures of ethene adsorbed at 90 K,are in good agreement with previous studies [17,26]. The TPD spectra show that the molecular desorption of ethene starts only for exposures above 1.2 L with a maximum of the desorption rate at about 282 K. This maximum shifts with increasing ethene exposure to 273 K. Using a Redhead analysis [36] assuming first order kinetics and a pre-expo- nential factor of 1013 s1, this corresponds to a shift of the desorption energy from 74 kJ/mol to 71 kJ/mol for increasing exposure up to saturation. Near saturation exposure (2 L) a low temperature shoulder at 242 K develops. The desorption spectra of hydrogen (m/e: 2) are characterized by two desorption peaks at about 300 K and 490 K, which result from the decomposition of the remaining ethene to ethylidyne (C2H3), and the further dehydrogenation of the ethylidyne on the Pt(111) surface to CHx species, respectively. In agreement with O fner and Zaera [26,27] we found a desorption of small amounts of ethane (m/e: 30) resulting from hydrogenation of ethene.
On the PtSn surface alloys a decomposition of ethene is not detected in the TPD spectra. The ethene desorbs fully intact and accordingly neither hydrogen nor ethane are found in the TPD spectra. The corresponding ethene desorption spectra compared to the spectrum at saturation coverage of ethene on Pt(111) are displayed in Fig. 2.
Obviously, with increasing Sn percentage the desorption maximum of saturated monolayers of ethene on the surface alloys is shifted to lower temperature. For the Pt3Sn/ Pt(111) surface alloy it is found at 226 K in good agree- ment with previous studies [11]. The shape of the TPD trace resulting from the ethene desorption (m/e: 27) from the Pt2Sn surface alloy is obviously different from that of the other two surfaces. Here two well defined desorption states are measured at 184 K and 163 K, respectively. Only the former has been reported by Paffett et al. [11], which is most likely due to the higher adsorption temperature used in that study. The good separation of the two peaks sug- gests that two different surface species may be present and this hypothesis will be supported by the HREELS experiments discussed below. A Redhead [36] analysis,under the assumption of a first order kinetics and a pre-exponential factor of 1013 s1, gives the correspond- ing desorption energies, which are summarized in Table 1 along with the adsorption energies calculated with DFT.

Seemingly the calculated values for the surface alloys are in good agreement with the experimentally measured ones but we must point out that this is rather by chance. In gen- eral the values gained by DFT correspond to adsorption at zero K whereas the desorption energies deduced from TPD correspond to a kinetically controlled out-of-equilibrium process, which does not necessarily yield a correct adsorp- tion energy. Only for the Pt(111) surface a rather big dif- ference between the experimental desorption energy and the calculated adsorption energy is encountered. This can be interpreted in terms of a competition between desorp- tion and dehydrogenation in this case, which has also been observed for cyclopentene on Pt(111) [13]. In summary the TPD measurements show that the desorption temperature and the adsorption energy of ethene decreases with increas- ing Sn content of the surface.
After discussing the main features of the ethene desorp- tion from Pt(111) and the Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and the Pt2Sn/ Pt(111) surface, we now turn to the presentation of the HREELS results. All HREELS spectra were taken at 100 K after flashing the respective surface to tempera- tures, which corresponded to characteristic changes in the TPD spectra. The HREELS spectra for a successively heated saturation coverage of ethene on Pt(111) are shown in Fig. 3.
Obviously the spectra are virtually unchanged in the temperature range from 90 K to about 215 K. Only after annealing to 269 K new loss peaks resulting from the for- mation of an ethylidyne species appear and the intensities of the previously present loss peaks decreases. Above 399 K only the new loss features (1406 cm1, 1377 cm1,1115 cm1, 966 cm1, 469 cm1, 421 cm1) of ethylidyne are present. After heating to higher temperatures (518 K) only two new broad loss features (1026 cm1, 792 cm1) are present, which vanish at even higher temperatures,and can be assigned to a methylidene (CH) surface species.
The majority of the loss peaks in the temperature range below 269 K can be assigned to di-r ethene (1416 cm1,1170 cm1, 1040 cm1, 987 cm1, 762 cm1, 641 cm1, QMS signal [arb. units] 500 400 300 200 temperature [K] Pt(111) Pt3Sn Pt 2Sn

3475 452 cm1). However, the double peak at 1170 cm1 and 1197 cm1 points to the presence of a different ethene spe- cies, which turns out to be p-bonded. A full assignment of the vibration modes of the various surface species is given in the discussion below.
Similar annealing series have been performed after eth- ene adsorption on the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) and the Pt3Sn/ Pt(111) surface alloys. Again up to the temperatures corre- sponding to the first desorption peak in the TPD spectra significant changes in the HREELS spectra are not encoun- tered. However, in the case of the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface after desorption of ethene at
163 K
the peak at 1498 cm1 vanishes and the peaks at 966 and 1212 cm1 decrease significantly in intensity (Fig. 4). We attribute this to the desorption of a p-bonded ethene species. Finally,after annealing to 270 K only weak traces of a remaining species are left. These can either be due to readsorption of ethene during cooling or to an incomplete alloy layer,which may have some remaining Pt(111) patches that cause a spurious dehydrogenation.
The HREELS spectra in Fig. 5 show the evolution of ethene on Pt3Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy during annealing.
Apparently heating to 230 K leads to an overall decrease of the loss intensities, which concerns all peaks except the one at 455 cm1. This indicates that in contrast to the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface a separation of differently adsorbed species by annealing is not possible on this surface. This observation is in good agreement with the presence of just one peak in the desorption spectrum (Fig. 2). Again after desorption of the ethene at 400 K only slight contamina- tions remain on the surface, which can be attributed to imperfections of the (2 · 2) PtSn surface alloy.
5. Discussion
First of all the vibration features of the adsorbed ethene on the three surfaces Pt(111), Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/ Pt(111) will be compared. In Fig. 6 the corresponding HREELS spectra recorded after monolayer adsorption at 90 K are displayed. Apparently there are only small differ- ences in terms of peak positions and relative intensities.
This is in line with the conclusion that the di-r configura- tion is the dominating species on all three surfaces. In par- ticular the energetic position of the ms(PtC) stretching vibration (450 cm1) is virtually constant on all three sur- faces suggesting that the local interaction of the ethene molecule with the bonding Pt atoms is similar. This view is corroborated by the fact that the pr parameter, which intensity [arb. units] 3000 2000 1000 0 energy loss [cm-1]

was introduced by Stuve and Madix [37] in order to char- acterize the bond order of the adsorbed ethene, takes a value of 1 on all three surfaces (see Table 2). This means that the bond order of the CC bond of the adsorbed eth- ene is close to unity, which in turn indicates a hybridization close to sp3 as in gas phase ethane. The same procedure applied to the minority species yields a pr parameter of
0.5 indicating a bond order of 1.5 for this ethene confor-
mation, which indicates a significant rehybridization of this species and thus a formation of a true chemical bond.
5.1. Assignment of the vibration modes
By comparing experimental and calculated HREELS spectra we are able to completely assign the observed loss peaks to the molecular vibration modes of the adsorbed ethene molecules. Furthermore this procedure undoubtedly allows us to verify the presence of the proposed p-bonded ethene species. Fig. 7 shows the comparison between the experimental and the calculated HREELS spectra of di-r- and p-bonded ethene on Pt(111). The energetic positions of the experimental loss peaks are very well reproduced by the calculated spectra  especially in the intermediate energy region (4001500 cm1). The devia- tions for lower and higher energies are attributed to the neglect of the phonon coupling and anharmonicity, respec- tively. The full assignment of the vibration modes is shown in Table 3.
In this way 13 of the experimentally detected loss peaks could be assigned to the corresponding normal modes of intensity [arb. units] 3000 2000 1000 0 energy loss [cm-1] Pt(111) Pt3Sn Pt2Sn x 222

3477 the di-r ethene, while doubtlessly further 4 losses stem from the p-species. The most intensive loss features in the experimental spectra are derived from the ds(CH2) mode,in which the m(CC) participates due to coupling at about 1416 cm1, the m(CC) mode (m8) at about 1040 cm1, the xs(CH2) mode (m10, 987 cm1), a frustrated rotation mode (m13) at 641 cm1 and finally the mode of the ms(PtC) vibra- tion (452 cm1). The presence of the p species is easily pro- ven by the appearance of a double peak at 1170 and 1197 cm1. In the calculated spectrum of the di-r species only a single loss is found in this region (1177 cm1) and an additional intense loss is found in the calculated spec- trum of the p species at 1202 cm1. Similarly the experi- mental peak at 937 cm1 (m10) is most likely derived from the intense peak 948 cm1 in the calculated spectrum. If we compare our vibration assignment to the data published by Steininger et al. [19] only minor differences are encoun- tered except for the fact that these authors did not identify the p species. Concerning the di-r species there are two dif- ferences, which should be pointed out. In Ref. [16,19] the loss peak at 661 cm1 is identified as qs(CH2) mode but according to our calculations it has to be assigned to a frus- trated rotation (fR) of the di-r species. Accordingly we find the qs(CH2) at much higher energy (m11, 935 cm1). In this energy range Steininger et al. could not resolve this feature in the spectra.
Fig. 8 shows the comparison between the experimental and calculated HREELS-spectra of di-r- and p-bonded ethene on the Pt3Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Again the dou- ble peak at 1165 and 1222 cm1 can only be explained if the coexistence of the di-r and p species on the surface is as- sumed. In general the correspondence between the experi- mental and the theoretical spectra in terms of peak positions is excellent. The complete assignment of the loss features for the two surface alloys is shown in Table 4 along with a comparison to the data published by Paffett et al. [11]. The situation is comparable for the HREELS Table 3 Assignment of the ethene and ethylidyne vibration modes on the Pt(111) surface Normal mode di-r Ethene p Ethene Ethylidyne

spectrum of ethene on Pt2Sn/Pt(111), which is shown in Fig. 9. Again the presence of r- and p-bonded ethene on the surface has to be assumed. However in this case the loss peak in the experimental spectrum at 1172 cm1 is clearly dominated by the corresponding peak of the p species (1182 cm1). Furthermore a larger abundance of this spe- cies is also suggested by the relatively strong peak at 1498 cm1, which was not present on the other two sur- faces. It is also this peak that vanishes almost completely if the Pt2Sn surface is heated to 170 K (Fig. 4) indicating that the p species is desorbing in the peak at 163 K (Fig. 2) as stated above. The relatively high intensity of this low temperature desorption peaks in conjunction with the HREELS assignments finally prove the large abundance of the p species on the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy.
The larger amount of p ethene relative to di-r ethene,which is found on the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy com- pared to the other two surfaces, can be rationalized by comparing the corresponding adsorption energies. The dif- ference of the adsorption energy of p ethene and di-r eth- ene on the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy is only 11.4 kJ/mol (Table 5), while the corresponding value on the other two surfaces is much bigger  about 35.2 kJ/mol on the Pt(111)-surface and 25.1 kJ/mol on the Pt3Sn/Pt(111) sur- face alloy. It is worthwhile comparing our theoretical re- sults to former results (Table 5). Not surprisingly the DFT adsorption energies found here for ethene on Pt(111) correspond very well to the values found by Hir- schl et al. who were using the same DFT package for the computations [24] but are considerably lower than the val- ues found by Watwe et al. [23]. This is most likely due to the fact that Watwe et al. used only 3 layer thick slabs Table 4 Assignment of the ethene vibration modes for the Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface Normal mode Pt3Sn/Pt(111) Pt2Sn/Pt(111) di-r Ethene p Ethene di-r Ethene p Ethene

3479 and only the top most layer was relaxed, which is not suf- ficient for getting precise results. The comparison of the Pt3Sn alloy is not so straightforward since in Ref. [23] the bulk alloy is treated. However, the same trend as for Pt(111) is found. The overestimation of the adsorption energies in Ref. [23] seems thus to be systematic. Moreover,as far as the dramatic decrease of the adsorption energy on the alloy surfaces is concerned, our work and the work of Watwe et al. are  as far as the lowering of the adsorption strength on the alloys is concerned  in line with the TPD results and show the behavior also found for cyclopentene on the PtSn surface alloys [13].
6. Conclusions
The adsorption of ethene on the three surfaces Pt(111), Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) was investigated experi- mentally by TPD and HREELS as well as theoretically by DFT calculations.
On the Pt(111) and both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys ethene preferentially adsorbs in a di-r conformation occu- pying pure platinum bridge sites. However on all surfaces a coadsorbed p species has been identified, which is rather abundant on Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface because the difference in adsorption energy of the di-r and the p is small species on this surface (11.4 kJ/mol). This p species has formerly only been identified on Pt(111) at temperatures below
52 K [14,15].
Most importantly  as in the case of cyclopentene [13] the vibration spectra of the adsorbed ethene are only weakly influenced despite the strong decrease of the adsorption energy on the surface alloys compared to Pt(111). This suggests a similar hybridization of the mole- cules on all three surfaces. This result is corroborated by the almost identical pr parameters for the ethene on the different surfaces.
Finally, the comparison of the calculated vibration spec- tra with the experimental ones allows us to perform a com- plete assignment of the vibration modes of the adsorbed ethene species.
