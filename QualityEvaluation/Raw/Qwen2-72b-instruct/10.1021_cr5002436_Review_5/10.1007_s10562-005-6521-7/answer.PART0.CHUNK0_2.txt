1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, which involves adsorption of ethane to form an ethyl species, followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen. The results of isotopic labeling experiments suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of the reaction. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is not addressed in the literature. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in the development of chemical industries and the production of light alkenes.

1.文献没有详细解释Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制。但是，它确实讨论了Cr/Al2O3催化剂上乙烷脱氢的机制，该机制涉及乙烷吸附形成乙基物种，随后脱氢和乙烯脱附。同位素标记实验的结果表明，乙烷吸附是反应的速率决定步骤。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续辩论在文献中没有提及。由于其在化学工业发展和轻烯烃生产中的重要性，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。
