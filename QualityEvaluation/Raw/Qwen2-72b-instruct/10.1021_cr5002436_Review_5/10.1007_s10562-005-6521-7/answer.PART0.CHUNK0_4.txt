1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. Ethane dehydrogenation proceeds via an end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site at the catalyst surface. Ethane adsorption is suggested to be the rate-determining step of the reaction. The absence of isotopic scrambling of ethylene indicates that coke deposits formed during the initial activation of the catalyst material are not involved in the ethane dehydrogenation cycle.

1.文献没有详细解释Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制。但是，它确实讨论了Cr/Al2O3催化剂上乙烷脱氢的机制。乙烷脱氢通过在催化剂表面Cr3+O活性位点的端部，解离吸附乙烷进行。乙烷吸附被建议是反应的速率决定步骤。没有观察到乙烯的同位素混乱，表明在催化剂材料初始激活期间形成的焦炭沉积物不参与乙烷脱氢循环。
