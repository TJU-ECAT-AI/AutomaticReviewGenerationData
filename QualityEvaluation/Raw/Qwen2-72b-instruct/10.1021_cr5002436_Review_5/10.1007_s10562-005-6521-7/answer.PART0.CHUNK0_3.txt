1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. The mechanism involves adsorption of ethane to form an ethyl species, followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen. Transient kinetic data suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of the reaction. The absence of significant differences in the tailing of the m/e 27 and m/e 28 fragments during a transient experiment indicates that neither beta-H transfer of an ethyl species nor ethene desorption is the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The results obtained in this work indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of the reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst.

1.文献没有详细解释Horiuti-Polanyi机制在催化脱氢反应中的作用。但是，它确实讨论了Cr/Al2O3催化剂上乙烷脱氢的机制。该机制涉及乙烷吸附形成乙基物种，随后脱附乙烯和氢气。瞬态动力学数据表明，乙烷吸附是反应的速率决定步骤。在瞬态实验中，m/e 27和m/e 28碎片的尾部没有显著差异，这表明乙基物种的beta-H转移或乙烯脱附不是反应的速率限制步骤。本工作中获得的结果表明，Cr/Al2O3催化剂上的乙烷吸附是反应的速率限制步骤。
