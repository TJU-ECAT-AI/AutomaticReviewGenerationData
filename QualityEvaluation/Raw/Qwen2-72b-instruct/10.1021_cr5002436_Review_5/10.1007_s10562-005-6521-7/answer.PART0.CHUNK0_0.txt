1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. Ethane dehydrogenation proceeds via an end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site at the catalyst surface. This is followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen. The results indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of the reaction. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is not discussed in the literature. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in the development of chemical industries and the production of light alkenes.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制对催化脱氢反应的详细解释。但是，它确实讨论了Cr/Al2O3催化剂上乙烷脱氢的机制。乙烷脱氢通过在催化剂表面Cr3+O活性位点的端部，解离性吸附乙烷进行。这之后是乙烯和氢的解吸。结果表明，乙烷吸附是反应的速率决定步骤。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续辩论在文献中没有讨论。由于其在化学工业发展和轻烯烃生产中的重要性，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。
