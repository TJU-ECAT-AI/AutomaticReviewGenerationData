          The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. Ethane dehydrogenation proceeds via an end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site at the catalyst surface. This is followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen. Ethane adsorption is suggested to be the rate-determining step of the reaction. The absence of isotopic scrambling of ethylene indicates that coke deposits formed during the initial activation of the catalyst material are not involved in the ethane dehydrogenation cycle. Transient kinetic data suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of the reaction. The absence of significant differences in the tailing of the m/e 27 and m/e 28 fragments during a transient experiment indicates that neither beta-H transfer of an ethyl species nor ethene desorption is the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is not discussed in the literature. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in the development of chemical industries and the production of light alkenes.

          文献没有详细解释Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制。但是，它确实讨论了Cr/Al2O3催化剂上乙烷脱氢的机制。乙烷脱氢通过在催化剂表面Cr3+O活性位点的端部，解离吸附乙烷进行。这之后是乙烯和氢的脱附。乙烷吸附被建议是反应的速率决定步骤。没有观察到乙烯的同位素混乱，表明在催化剂材料初始激活期间形成的焦炭沉积物不参与乙烷脱氢循环。瞬态动力学数据表明，乙烷吸附是反应的速率决定步骤。在瞬态实验中，m/e 27和m/e 28碎片的尾部没有显著差异，这表明乙基物种的beta-H转移或乙烯脱附不是反应的速率限制步骤。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续辩论在文献中没有讨论。由于其在化学工业发展和轻烯烃生产中的重要性，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。
