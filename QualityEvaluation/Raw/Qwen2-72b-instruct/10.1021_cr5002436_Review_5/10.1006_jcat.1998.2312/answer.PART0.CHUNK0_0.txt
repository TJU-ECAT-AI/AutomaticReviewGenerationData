1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or discuss the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The document focuses on the effects of Zn cations on the conversion of alkanes to aromatics and hydrogen over H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts. It does not delve into the specifics of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or the scientific interest and controversy surrounding it.
