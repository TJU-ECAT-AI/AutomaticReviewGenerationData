1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The document focuses on a comparative study of propane dehydrogenation over V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, examining their time on-stream behavior and origins of deactivation. It does not delve into the specifics of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or the scientific interest and controversy surrounding it.
