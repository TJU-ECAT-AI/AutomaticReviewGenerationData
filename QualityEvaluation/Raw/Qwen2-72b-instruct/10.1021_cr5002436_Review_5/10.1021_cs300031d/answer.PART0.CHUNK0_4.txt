1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not described in the provided literature. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of its four main steps or analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The reason why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study is also not discussed in the literature.
