1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The focus of the literature is on the development of a quantitative Raman spectroscopy method for studying supported metal oxide catalysts under working conditions.
