Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, describing its four main steps and analyzing the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. Additionally, discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The document focuses on the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation over a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, proposing a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account one-step or two-step dehydrogenation. The first CH bond cleavage in propane molecule is identified as the rate-determining step in the best-performing model. The reasons for the scientific interest and controversy surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism are not discussed in the literature.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论。该文件专注于PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上丙烷脱氢的动力学，基于考虑一步或两步脱氢的反应机制，提出了Langmuir-Hinshelwood动力学模型。在表现最佳的模型中，丙烷分子中的第一个CH键断裂被确定为速率决定步骤。关于Horiuti-Polanyi机制的科学兴趣和争议的原因在文献中没有讨论。
