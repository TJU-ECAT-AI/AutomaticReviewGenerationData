1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The document focuses on the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation over PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, proposing Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation. The first CH cleavage in propane molecule is identified as the rate-determining step in the proposed kinetic model. The reasons why the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study are not discussed in the literature.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论。该文件侧重于PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上丙烷脱氢的动力学，基于考虑一步或两步脱氢的反应机制，提出了Langmuir-Hinshelwood动力学模型。在提出的动力学模型中，丙烷分子中的第一个CH断裂被确定为速率决定步骤。尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题的原因在文献中没有讨论。
