1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The document focuses on the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation over a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, proposing a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account one-step or two-step dehydrogenation. The first CH bond cleavage in propane molecule is identified as the rate-determining step in the best-performing model. The reasons for the scientific interest and controversy surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism are not discussed in the literature.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论。该文件专注于PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上丙烷脱氢的动力学，基于考虑一步或两步脱氢的反应机制，提出了Langmuir-Hinshelwood动力学模型。在表现最佳的模型中，丙烷分子中的第一个CH键断裂被确定为速率决定步骤。关于Horiuti-Polanyi机制的科学兴趣和争议的原因在文献中没有讨论。
