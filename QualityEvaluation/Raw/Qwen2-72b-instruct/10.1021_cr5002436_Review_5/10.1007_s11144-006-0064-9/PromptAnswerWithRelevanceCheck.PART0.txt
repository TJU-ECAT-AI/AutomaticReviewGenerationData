1.The literature does not provide information on the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, its four main steps, or the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. However, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a widely discussed topic in the field of catalysis and involves the adsorption of a molecule onto a catalyst surface, followed by a series of chemical transformations that lead to the formation of the desired product. The mechanism's steps include adsorption, activation, reaction, and desorption. The rate-limiting step is often debated and can vary depending on the specific reaction and catalyst system. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its fundamental importance in understanding catalytic processes and the potential to improve catalyst design and efficiency.
