We have also determined the adsorption energies and most favourable adsorption sites for propylene, propylidyne, and all of the C3Hx (x = 37) interme- diates (1-propyl, 2-propyl, propylidene, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, propenylidene, and propynyl). All surface species are more stable than gas-phase propylene. Propylidyne is found to be the most stable species at the surface, in agreement with previous experiments. All surface moieties adsorb on sites where the metal atoms replace the missing hydrogen, thereby preserving a sp3 hybridisation of the C atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon.
We used the adsorption energies to compute the overall reaction energies for a total of 18 elementary CH bond activation and isomerisation reactions that are likely to be involved in the dehydrogenation of propylene. The combination of energy and vibrational frequency calculations allowed us to propose some species as possible intermediates of the decomposition processpropylidene and 1-propenyl. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
Fundamental studies of alkene chemistry over catalytically active transition metal surfaces play a key role in guiding sub- sequent efforts to understand and improve diverse catalytic processes ranking from pollution control to fine chemical syn- thesis. Consequently, the chemisorption of olefins has been extensively investigated with a view toward determining ad- sorption geometries and the nature and stability of reaction intermediates and products [1]. A first approach to the study of the hydrocarbon surface chemistry is achieved by single- crystal model surfaces [25], thus avoiding the complexities of * Corresponding authors.

At low temperatures, ethylene adsorbs on the Pt(111) surface in a di-σ mode, forming a (2 × 2) pattern. On heating to above 300 K, it transforms into a new, more stable species, ethyli- dyne [68]. A (2 × 2) structure is revealed after exposure to the electron beam of a LEED gun. This molecule is stable at the surface roughly between 300 and 420 K. The ethylene- to-ethylidyne transition represents a whole class of reactions,namely the dehydrogenation of alkenes to alkylidynes. This reaction is believed to be involved in catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes. To obtain ethylidyne, one H atom must migrate from one C atom to another, and a second H atom must be removed from the molecule. Then it is rea- sonable to assume that the mechanism comprises at least two steps and involves the formation of one or more intermediates. 0021-9517/$  see front matter  2006 Elsevier Inc.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this scheme legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) The details of this surface process have been subject of in- tense debate. Several simple mechanisms have been proposed with ethyl (CH3CH· 2), vinyl (CH2CH·), ethylidene (CH3CH·),and/or vinylidene (CH2C·) intermediates [915].
The attempt to extend the preceding conclusions to other olefins has been unsuccessful, because much less information is available for heavier alkenes. It has been also proposed that heavier alkenes decompose via the corresponding alkylidyne intermediates. After ethylene, propylene (CH3CH=CH2) is the most important raw material used in the production of organic chemicals. Early in 1982, Salmern and Somorjai showed that propylene adsorbs easily on Pt(111) and remains stable with no chemical decomposition up to around 280 K [16]. Using ther- mal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), these authors estimated an adsorption energy of 51 kJ mol1 at low coverage. Koestner et al. [8], using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), pro- posed that propylene binds to two surface Pt atoms through its unsaturated C=C unit (di-σ-bond) and forms a disordered monolayer. Their results are in agreement with more recent experimental works [17,18] and with the results derived from qualitative molecular orbital calculations [19]. In addition, Koel et al. also investigated the adsorption and decomposition of propylene on Pt(111) [20] and determined an adsorption energy of 70 kJ mol1. However, this rather simple picture of the interaction of propylene with Pt(111) contrasts with the com- plexity that emerges from the complete reflectionabsorption (RAIRS) studies of Zaera and Chrysostomou [21]. Those au- thors proposed that at least four species derive from adsorbed propylene, depending on coverage and temperature. For the sake of clarity, we created a schematic representation of these surface structures (Scheme 1). At temperatures below 230 K,this molecule adsorbs undissociated on Pt(111) analogously to ethylene [22]. Below half-saturation, propylene binds pref- erentially to the metal surface in a di-σ fashion through its central C bond (V-shape; Scheme 1a). As the coverage in- creases up to saturation, the molecule rearranges, the C=C bond becomes more parallel to the surface, and the methyl group tilts away from the surface toward a more vertical ori- entation (Scheme 1b). Comparing infrared data from propylene ligands in osmium organometallic complexes with electron en- ergy loss spectrometry (EELS) and RAIRS data for propylene on Pt(111) and on Ni(111) [23] corroborates the di-σ adsorp- tion mode with significant rehybridisation of the C atoms to- ward sp3. However, this comparison does not provide further Table 1 Surface species (C3Hx, x = 37) listed in decreasing value of x Name Molecular formula Structure 1-Propyl

information on the structure of the adsorbed molecule. Above saturation coverage, a second layer of weakly adsorbed mole- cules grows (π-bonded; Scheme 1c), and a clear transformation between about 230 and 270 K has been observed [23]. Actually,the 275 K RAIRS spectrum is consistent with the formation of propylidyne (CH3CH2C·; Scheme 1d), an alkylidyne moi- ety. The formation of an intermediate during the transformation from propylene to propylidyne seems evident according to the new feature at 2890 cm1 observed in the 256 and 268 K RAIRS spectra [23]. This signal cannot be associated with propylene or with propylidyne, but may be related to 2-propyl (CH3(CH3)CH·) or propylidene (CH3CH2CH·) species. Koest- ner et al. [8] also detected formation of the propylidyne species and found that the LEED-IV spectra of ethylene and propylene are roughly identical between 280 and 400 K. This seems to indicate that the room temperature propylene has a structure similar to that of room temperature ethylene. The data are con- sistent with the presence of an alkylidyne species. In contrast to the nonspontaneous ordering of ethylidyne, propylidyne forms spontaneously a 2 × 2 pattern due to steric considerations.
Clearly, deriving accurate descriptions of the structures of propylene, propylidyne, and the possible reaction intermediates (see Table 1) is a necessary step in understanding the subse- quent surface processes. Toward this end, we used periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine the geometry, adsorption site preference, and adsorption energy for these species. We also carried out an analysis of vibrational spectra. Here we focus our discussion on the comparison with available experimental data.
2. Computational details
We obtained the geometries and energies of the relevant species adsorbed on Pt(111) from DFT calculations on a two- dimensional four-layer slab model of Pt(111) generated in a three-dimensional periodic supercell by introducing a vacuum width in the direction perpendicular to the surface (12 Å).
We carried out the DFT calculations using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange-correlation potential of Perdew and Wang [24]. The KohnSham equations of the DFT were solved in a plane wave basis set, with the effect of core electrons in the one-electron functions taken into account through the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [25].
Tight convergence of the plane-wave expansion was achieved

This corresponds to the experimentally determined structure for propylidyne on Pt(111) [8]. The 2D Brillouin integrations were performed on a 7 × 7 × 1 MonkhorstPack grid.
We obtained the geometry of the different adsorbed species by total energy minimisation with respect to the degrees of freedom of the adsorbates and of the two uppermost atomic metal layers; the rest of metal planes were kept fixed at the calculated bulk geometry with a PtPt interatomic distance of 2.82 Å. The adsorption energies (Eads) were obtained us- ing Eads = (EC3Hx/surface Esurface EC3H6(g)) (1) (x 6)(EH/surface Esurface),where a negative value indicates an exothermic chemisorption process. Eq. (1) allowed us to obtain adsorption energies of the different surface intermediates, which can be directly compared with the propylene adsorption energy.
We computed the vibrational frequencies and the corre- sponding normal modes within the harmonic approach, ne- glecting the coupling between molecular vibrations and surface phonons. This allowed us to rely on the block of the Hessian matrix involving adsorbate atomic displacements only. The har- monic molecular frequencies and the associated normal modes were directly obtained by diagonalisation of the corresponding block of the mass-pondered Hessian matrix. The energy second derivatives were obtained from numerical differences of the an- alytical gradients. We calculated the IR intensities through the following equation:(2) I k = dμz dQk 2 =
3N
i=1 Pki mi dμz dri 2 ,where μz is the z-component of the dipole moment and Pki/mi is the mass weighted coordinate matrix of the nor- mal mode. We performed the numerical calculation of the first derivative of the dipole moment in the Cartesian coordinate sys- tem (ri). We carried out all calculations using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Program (VASP) [2628].
3. Results
3.1. Adsorption of propylene, propylidyne, and C3Hx
(x = 37) intermediates on Pt(111) In a previous paper [29], we showed that propylene ad- sorbs preferentially on Pt(111) in a di-σ mode [η1η1(C1,C2)- adsorption mode; Fig. 1]. Our calculations were in good agree- ment with the results of Zaera and Chrysostomou [21] (see Scheme 1b). In the earlier work, we did not consider the ef- fect of surface relaxation and used US-PP pseudopotentials. In this paper we reexamine the propylenesurface interaction, tak- ing surface relaxation explicitly into account and using PAW.
As expected, the changes on the substrate were rather small;the relaxation of the surface metal atoms involved mainly a small outward displacement of the Pt atoms directly interact- ing with the C atoms. This produced a small corrugation of the surface (<4%) with the simultaneous change in the PtPt bond distances (<0.16 Å). However, the adsorption energy changed significantly, from 39 kJ mol1 [29] (nonrelaxed sur- face, US-PP) and 66 kJ mol1 (nonrelaxed surface, PAW) to 87 kJ mol1 (relaxed surface, PAW). The computed adsorp- tion energy was noticeably larger than the value estimated by TDS experiments: 50 kJ mol1 [16] and 70 kJ mol1 [20].This is not surprising, because the tendency of PW91 to overes- timate adsorption energies is well established [30]. Moreover, it is difficult to compare the calculated value with the experimen- tal adsorption energy from TDS curves, because propylene de- composition may occur before desorption takes place at around 270280 K [21]. Zaera and Chrysostomou [21] proposed that below saturation coverage, the hydrogen atom released in the dehydrogenation reaction at 230250 K remains on the surface and weakens the adsorption of propylene. We computed the ad- sorption energy of the system propylene plus H atom at infinite distance (the sum of Eads of the hydrocarbon and of H) and coadsorbed on the same 2 × 2 unit cell. Our calculations pre- dict a decrease in the adsorption energy of 33 kJ mol1 when both species are coadsorbed, in agreement with the suggestion of Zaera and Chrysostomou [21]. The energy difference arises primarily from the surface-mediated repulsion between reac- tants sharing bonding with a metal atom [31]. 118

Fig. 1 (side view) summarizes the distortion of propylene and the changes in the PtPt bond distances on adsorption.
Gas-phase propylene has a calculated C1C2 bond distance of
1.33 Å and a C2C1H2 angle (defined as the angle between
the C1C2 bond and the C1H2 plane) of 180. On adsorption,the C1C2 distance increases significantly (1.49 Å). Interest- ingly, this bond distance is close to that obtained for ethylene adsorbed on Pt(111) in a di-σ configuration using a similar computational approach [32,33]. This represents an elongation of 0.15 Å with respect to the gas-phase propylene, thus ap- proaching a single CC bond length as in propane (1.54 Å) with concomitant reduction of the double-bond character. On ad- sorption on Pt(111), similar elongations of the C=C bond have also been reported for different alkene molecules [34,35]. An- other indicator of the degree of rehybridisation of the C atoms is the C2C1H2 angle. On Pt(111), propylene loses its planarity as the CH bonds bend away from the surface plane. The angle between the HC1H plane and the C1C2 bond (parallel to the surface) is 130.
Scheme 2 displays the elementary paths for the dehydro- genation of di-σ bonded propylene to propylidyne. We did not consider CC bond cleavage, and we also neglected the dehy- drogenation of the methyl group. We determined the adsorption modes and the corresponding adsorption energies for all C3Hx (x = 37) species using a 2 × 2 unit cell. The possible reaction intermediates are listed in Table 1. As for propylene [29], we explored different adsorption sites (top, bridge, hollow). Here we show only the most stable identified configuration for each Table 2 Calculated surface reaction energies (Ereac, kJ mol1) for the decomposition of propylene on Pt(111) Step Surface reaction Reaction Ereac 1 Propylene + H 2-propyl Hydrogenation 31 2 Propylene + H 1-propyl Hydrogenation 18 3 Propylene propylidene Isomerisation 18 4 Propylene 1-propenyl + H Dehydrogenation 6 5 Propylene 2-propenyl + H Dehydrogenation 2 6 2-Propyl 1-propyl Isomerisation 13 7 1-Propyl propylidene + H Dehydrogenation 1 8 Propylidene propylidyne + H Dehydrogenation 77 9 1-Propenyl + H propylidene Hydrogenation 25 10 1-Propenyl propylidyne Isomerisation 52 11 1-Propenyl propenylidene + H Dehydrogenation 30 12 1-Propenyl propyne + H Dehydrogenation 11 13 2-Propenyl 1-propenyl Isomerisation 4 14 2-Propenyl propyne + H Dehydrogenation 16 15 Propenylidene + H propylidyne Hydrogenation 22 16 Propyne propenylidene Isomerisation 19 17 Propyne propynyl + H Dehydrogenation 64 18 Propynyl + H propenylidene Hydrogenation 83 intermediate. The relative stabilities (Eads) for each of the sur- face species are also shown in Fig. 2.
All of the surface intermediates are stable with respect to gas-phase propylene and the clean surface. However, only four moieties are more stable than adsorbed propylene: 1-propenyl,propylidyne, propenylidene, and propyne (see Fig. 2). Among these, the most stable is the propylidyne species. Indeed, propy- lidyne is 59 kJ mol1 more stable than adsorbed propylene plus

In agreement with the experi- mental evidence [8,21,23], our calculations confirm that propy- lene dehydrogenation to propylidyne and surface hydrogen is thermodynamically favourable. Adsorbed 2-propenyl is almost isoenergetic with propylene, with an energy difference of only 2 kJ mol1. On the other hand, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, propylidene,and propynyl are less stable than adsorbed propylene by 18, 31,19, and 47 kJ mol1, respectively.
We investigated the coverage effects for propylene, propy- lidyne, and two of the possible reaction intermediates (propy- lidene and 1-propenyl). We increased the size of the unit cell to 3 × 3 (1/9 ML). In all of the cases, the adsorption energy increased by 10 kJ mol1, indicative of a slight repulsion be- tween the hydrocarbon molecules at 1/4 ML coverage (2 × 2 unit cell). Because the energy difference between the 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 systems was roughly the same for all cases, the relative stabilities did not change.
The calculated optimized structural parameters are illus- trated in Figs. 3a3i. For the sake of clarity, only the Pt atoms directly below the hydrocarbon fragment are shown. The 1-pro- pyl (Fig. 3a) and 2-propyl (Fig. 3b) prefer the top adsorption site where the surface metal atom essentially replaces the missing hydrogen atom to form a propane-like surface intermediate that preserves its sp3 symmetry. This is consistent with concepts derived from the orbital integration scheme of Hoffmann [36] and Shustorovich and Baetzold [37]. The balance between the Pauli repulsion and the orbital overlap dictates the adsorption site preference. For metals in the rightmost part of the periodic table, Pauli repulsion dominates [38] and favours the top ad- sorption site. Neurock and van Santen [39] have rationalized the adsorption site preference of ethyl groups on Pd(111) us- ing these arguments. With respect to propylene, propylidene (Fig. 3c) has two missing hydrogen atoms in C1 and thus is bet- ter adsorbed at a bridge site or η2(C1)-adsorption mode. (Here η2 denotes the number of Pt atoms bind to a C atom.) The C3H5 Fig. 3.

Propyli- dyne (Fig. 3d), with three missing hydrogen atoms in C1, pref- erentially binds to three Pt atoms in an η3(C1) coordination. Our results are in good agreement with the experimental results of Koestner et al. [8]. The 1-propenyl moiety (Fig. 3e) is missing two H atoms in C1 and one H atom in C2, and thus it prefers the 120

η2η1(C1,C2)-adsorption mode. The adsorption geometry of 2- propenyl (Fig. 3f) is equivalent to that obtained for 1-propenyl.
There appears to be a general trend of Pt(111) preferring sp3- bound intermediates of adsorbed hydrocarbons. Actually, all of the CC bond distances are within the range of 1.481.54 Å.
The pictures for propenylidene (Fig. 3g), propyne (Fig. 3h),and propynyl (Fig. 3i) are quite different. Similar to the C3H5 species, these surface intermediates adsorb preferentially on threefold hollow sites (fcc). Three H atoms from C1 and one atom from C2 are missing in the propenylidene moiety, and thus this moiety prefers to sit on η3η1(C1,C2) coordination. How- ever, the C1C2 bond distance (1.41 Å) is rather short compared with the C3Hx (x = 57) hydrocarbon fragments (see above).
Dumesic et al. obtained the same adsorption site and geom- etry for vinylidene (CH2=C·) on Pt(111) [40]. Propyne [41] adsorbs on Pt(111) in a η2η2(C1,C2) adsorption mode, with the C1C2 (1.39 Å) bond almost parallel to the metal surface. How- ever, propynyl binds in clearly a sp2 fashion. In this molecule,three H atoms from C1 and two H atoms from C2 are miss- ing, which favours the formation of a surface intermediate of sp3 symmetry; however, it binds to the Pt(111) surface in a η3η1(C1,C2) adsorption mode, with the C2 forming a bond only with a metal atom. Moreover, the C1C2 distance (1.31 Å) is obviously closer to a double bond than to a simple bond. Our results are well in line with those of Jacob and Goddard [42],who investigated the adsorption of the C2Hy (y = 15) inter- mediates on Pt(111) by means of DFT and found that the struc- ture of C2Hy molecules achieves a saturated configuration in which each C atom is almost tetrahedral. The only exceptions are CCH· (ethynyl) and CHCH (acetylene). Moreover, these au- thors determined that the alkylidyne moiety is the most strongly bound C2Hy species.
Table 2 summarizes the reaction energies for the various elementary steps depicted in Scheme 2. We computed the re- action energy (Ereac) by subtracting the initial energies from the energies of the final state. For example, we calculated the energy for the propylene dehydrogenation to propylidyne by subtracting the energy of the adsorbed propylene from the en- ergy of the adsorbed propylidyne plus adsorbed H with no in- teraction between them. We assumed low hydrogen coverage and also that the H atoms attached/released in the hydrogena- tion/dehydrogenation reactions come from/go to far surface sites.
Most of the elementary steps listed in Table 2 are either slightly endothermic or exothermic and thus will still play a role in propylene decomposition. The most exothermic steps correspond to formation of the propylidyne intermediate. This reaction can occur via hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, or iso- merisation. The most favourable way of obtaining this species is from propylidene (77 kJ mol1). Moreover, the reaction energies suggest that formation of propynyl is unlikely at this coverage. The formation of this species by dehydrogenation of propyne is uphill by 64 kJ mol1. Moreover, its hydrogenation to propenylidene is highly exothermic (84 kJ mol1). There- fore, we suggest that propynyl is unlikely to be involved in the direct decomposition of propylene to propylidyne. Among all of the possible mechanisms, the two-step reaction pathways Table 3 Experimental frequencies (νi, in cm1) and band assignments, calculated fre- quencies (ωi) and intensities (Ii, in kmmol1) for propylene on Pt(111) Experimental assignment RAIRSa νi 2 × 2b ωi Ii Present assignment CH2_as_st 2915(s) 3013

To shed some more light on the nature of the surface inter- mediate of the propylene dehydrogenation to propylidyne, we computed the RAIRS spectrum for propylene (Table 3), propy- lidyne (Table 4), and all of the possible reaction intermedi- ates (1-propyl, 2-propyl, propylidene, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl,propenylidene, propyne, and propynyl; Fig. 4) on Pt(111) at 1/4 ML coverage. Table 3 gives the frequencies along with the

Almost all of the normal modes are coupled. This makes the description of the vibrations somewhat arduous; in some cases, the assignment may be ambiguous. However, our aim is not to analyze in de- tail the normal modes, but rather to establish the differences among the surface species spectra that can help identify the pos- sible reaction intermediates. Thus, the theoretical assignment accounts for the main vibrations for each feature. The experi- mental spectrum [21] presents four bands in the CH stretching region (two of them quite intense), four medium or weak peaks in the 15001200 cm1 region, and three intense features in the 10001100 cm1 region. Despite some differences in intensi- ties and band assignment, our results are quite consistent with the experimental observations. The differences in the 2800 3100 cm1 region arise from the poor description of the CH stretching modes, because these modes are strongly affected by anharmonicity. Moreover, both the experimental coverage and the experimental periodicity are not fully reproduced by the present models. The arrangement of the molecules on the surface changes the orientation of the methyl groups and its en- vironment. Zaera and Chrysostomou [21] have pointed out that these changes strongly influence the band intensities.
Table 4 presents the calculated frequencies and intensities for propylidyne on Pt(111). For the sake of comparison, the ta- ble also summarizes the corresponding features in the RAIRS [21,43] and EELS spectra [17] of propylene at 300 K and sat- uration coverage. By analogy with the case of ethylene, these studies have determined that these spectra arise from the propy- lidyne species. Our results fully confirm the experimental as- signment (see Table 4). The agreement between the experimen- tal and simulated spectra is fairly good; the main difference appears in the region around 9001100 cm1. We assign the features at 1033, 1026, and 921 cm1 to CH3_ro, CH3_twi, and C2C3_st, respectively. (For definitions of the normal modes,see the footnotes of Tables 3 and 4.) Only the peaks at 1033 and 920 cm1 are intense. In the experimental RAIRS spec- trum, three intense peaks appear in this region. The bands at 1055 [43] (or 1079 [21]), 1039 [43] (or 1041 [21]), and 920 [43] cm1 have been assigned to CH3_ro, CH3_ro, and CC_st,respectively. These differences may arise from the orientations of the neighbouring methyl groups. In our calculations, all of the methyl groups are oriented in the same direction; however, Koestner et al. [8] suggested that the methyl groups tend to minimize the steric repulsions, and thus the steric effect makes some orientations impossible. Obviously, that reproduced with the 2 × 2 unit cell is not the most favoured.
The spectroscopic information available for the possible in- termediates of the propylene-to-propylidyne transformation is scarce. Zaera and Chrysostomou [21] investigated changes in the RAIRS spectrum of propylene on Pt(111) as a function of the temperature (230300 K) and found indications of the formation of an intermediate. They found that the spectrum at 260 K included a new signal at 2890 cm1 and had no new peaks in the CH deformation IR region. Actually, in the 10001500 cm1 region, all of the bands could be assigned to either propylene or propylidyne. These authors proposed that these features may belong to the 2-propyl or to the propyli- dene species. We simulated and analysed the RAIRS spectra for all of the proposed surface intermediates (Fig. 4). Unfor- tunately, the CH stretching region (28003100 cm1) is not well described with the harmonic model. Moreover, all of the features lie within a small range, and the differences are suffi- cient to be conclusive. Hence we focused our attention on the deformation region. More specifically, the features not present for either propylene or propylidine can help rule out some intermediate species (Fig. 4). The 1-propyl species has two signals at 1125 and 1350 cm1 that are not visible in either the propylene spectrum or the propylidyne spectrum. These features can be assigned to CH3_s_df and CH2_wag, respec- tively. 2-propyl has a quite strong feature at 1162 cm1 (CH_b mixed with CH3_ro). The propyne molecule and the 2-propenyl and the propenylidene moieties have some important peaks at around 1350 cm1 associated with CH3_s_df. The propy- nyl intermediate has a strong feature at 1599 cm1 that can be assigned to C=C_st. However, the experimental spectrum matches the spectrum from propylidene or 1-propenyl, because these species have no important signals in the 11001400 cm1 region. Unfortunately, unequivocally identifying the intermedi- ate is impossible.
4. Conclusions
We investigated the adsorption of propylene on Pt(111) at a surface coverage of 0.25 ML using DFT periodic calcula- tions. Moreover, we examined the adsorption modes and en- ergies for various dehydrogenated species: 1-propyl, 2-propyl,propylidene, propylidyne, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, propenyli- dene, propyne, and propynyl. Propylene adsorbs in a bridge adsorption mode with an adsorption energy of 87 kJ mol1.
We determined the relative stabilities and the most favourable adsorption site for propylidyne and all of the possible reaction intermediates. For the C3Hx (x = 37) fragments, there ap- pears to be a general trend of Pt(111) preferentially binding to sp3 carbon intermediates. The relative stabilities of 1-propyl,2-propyl, propylidene, propylidyne, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl,propyne, propenylidene, and propynyl are 69, 56, 68,145, 93, 89, 104, 123, and 40 kJ mol1, respec- 122

tively. Propylidyne is the most stable surface species on Pt(111),well in line with the experimental evidence.
We computed the reaction energies for 18 elementary steps that possibly may be involved in the propylene-to-propylidyne transformation. Our calculations clearly indicate that the de- hydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne is thermodynam- ically favourable. The formation of propynyl is energetically unfavourable, and we conclude that this species may not be in- volved in the direct reaction of dehydrogenation.
In addition, we simulated the vibrational spectra for propy- lene, propylidyne, and the possible reaction intermediates. Un- fortunately, the experimental data available for the reaction intermediate is not sufficient to enable an unequivocal identi- fication. Our best guesses are propylidene and 1-propenyl. It is noteworthy that these two intermediates are not the thermody- namically most stable.
