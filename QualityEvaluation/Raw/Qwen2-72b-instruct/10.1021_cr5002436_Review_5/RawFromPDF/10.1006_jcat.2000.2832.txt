Kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs) for oxidative dehydrogenation
of propane were measured on 10 wt% V2O5/ZrO2. Normal KIEs
were obtained using CH3CH2CH3 and CD3CD2CD3 as reactants
for primary dehydrogenation (2.8) and combustion (1.9) of propane
and for secondary combustion of propene (2.6), suggesting that
in all cases C–H bond dissociation is a kinetically relevant step.
CH3CH2CH3 and CH3CD2CH3 reactants led to normal KIEs for
dehydrogenation (2.7) and combustion (1.8) of propane, but to a
very small KIE (1.1) for propene combustion. These results show
that the methylene C–H bond is activated in the rate-determining
steps for propane dehydrogenation and combustion reactions. The
rate-determining step in secondary propene combustion involves
the allylic C–H bond. In each reaction, the weakest C–H bond in the
reactant is cleaved in the initial C–H bond activation step. The mea-
sured propane oxidative dehydrogenation KIEs are in agreement
with theoretical estimates using a sequence of elementary steps,
reaction rate expression, and transition state theory. The much
smaller KIE for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (2.8) than the
maximum KIE (6) expected for propane thermal dehydrogena-
tion indicates the participation of lattice oxygen. The different KIE
values for propane primary dehydrogenation and combustion sug-
gest that these two reactions involve different lattice oxygen sites.

INTRODUCTION
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is ther-
modynamically favored over a wide temperature range and
offers the potential for the synthesis of alkenes with signif-
icant savings in energy and feedstock costs (1–5). Propane
ODH occurs via the parallel and sequential oxidation steps
shown in Scheme 1 (1). Propene is a primary product and
carbon oxides (COx) form directly from propane and by
subsequent oxidation of propene. The most active and se-
lective catalysts for propane ODH are based on supported

vanadia (3). On VOx-based catalysts, ODH rate expres-
sions and reaction mechanisms have been reported (6–8).
Reaction rates are proportional to propane pressure and
generally independent of the pressure of O2. The reaction
involves Mars–van Krevelen redox pathways with lattice
oxygen involved in rate-determining C–H bond activation
steps (2, 8). Methylene C–H bonds in propane are weaker
than those of the methyl groups; as a result, propane acti-
vation has been proposed to occur by the initial cleavage
of these weaker C–H bonds to form isopropoxide species
(2), without direct experimental evidence. Kinetic isotope
effects for undeuterated, perdeuterated, and selectively
deuterated propane molecules can be used to discern the
rate-determining nature of C–H activation steps and the
position of the activated C–H bond. The replacement of
H with D at the position of C–H activation decreases the
rate of reactions limited by C–H bond cleavage, leading to
normal kinetic isotope effects (KIEs; kH/kD > 1).
Polyvanadate structures on ZrO2 appear to provide an
optimum compromise between the reducibility and the ac-
cessibility of VOx domains and they lead to more active
catalysts than VOx dispersed on other supports (9, 10).
The reaction rate constant ratio (k1/k2) for primary dehy-
drogenation (k1) and primary combustion (k2) increases
with increasing VOx surface density (9), suggesting that the
two reactions require different sites. Kinetic and isotopic
tracer studies showed that the activation of C–H bonds is
involved in rate-determining steps (8). Here, we provide
supporting evidence for the proposed mechanism by exam-
iningODHreactionratesandselectivitiesforCH3CH2CH3,
CH3CD2CH3, and CD3CD2CD3 reactants.
EXPERIMENTAL
V2O5/ZrO2 (10 wt%) was prepared by incipient wetness
impregnation methods and treated in air at 773 K, as de-
scribed in Ref. (9). X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption,
Raman, and UV–visible methods showed that this sample
consists of two-dimensional polyvanadate structures on a
predominately tetragonal ZrO2 surface (9, 10).

SCHEME 1. Reaction network for the oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane.
Reaction rates were measured using a gradientless batch
reactor consisting of a shallow packed bed within a gas
recirculation loop (11). Reactants and products were re-
circulated at 3.3 cm3 s−1 using a graphite gear microp-
ump in order to achieve low propane conversions (<1%)
per pass. The chemical composition of the recirculating
stream was determined by gas chromatography (Hewlett-
Packard 6890), and the isotopic content by mass spectrom-
etry/gas chromatography (Hewlett-Packard 5972). Mass
spectra were used to calculate the deuterium content and
the isotopomer contribution in each reactant and product
moleculeusingdeconvolutionmethodsreportedpreviously
(12). Reaction rates were extrapolated to zero reaction time
in order to obtain initial reaction rates and rate constants.
Undeuterated propane (Matheson, instrument purity
>99.5%), perdeuterated propane (Isotec, chemical purity
>99.0%, isotopic purity >99.0%), propane-2,2-d2 (Isotec,
chemical purity >99.0%, isotopic purity >99.0%), oxy-
gen (research grade, >99.999%), and propene (Matheson,
chemical purity >99.0%) were used as reactants with-
out further puriﬁcation. Perdeuterated water (D2O; Isotec,
chemical purity >99.0%, isotopic purity >99.0%) was pu-
riﬁed by several freeze–thaw evacuation cycles before use.
Helium (research grade, >99.999%) was used as an inert
diluent.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As reported earlier (9), propane ODH on VOx/ZrO2 oc-
curs via parallel and sequential steps as shown in Scheme 1.
At relatively low conversions and low H2O concentrations,
the rate of each reaction is well described by
r1 = k1[C3H8]
[1]
r2 = k2[C3H8]
[2]
r3 = k3[C3H6],
[3]
where ki is the apparent ﬁrst-order rate coefﬁcient for reac-
tion i. The propene selectivity at relatively low conversions
in a batch reactor is given by (10)
S = S0[1 −(k3CV/2)t],
[4]
where CV is the concentration of V atoms per unit reactor
volume, t is the reaction time, and S0 [=k1/(k1 + k2)] is the
initial propene selectivity (at zero conversion). The value

of k1 is determined from the initial rate of propene conver-
sion (as t →0) and the value of k2 from the initial propene
selectivity (S0). The value of k3 is then calculated from the
dependence of propene selectivity on time, as predicted by
Eq. [4]. Figure 1 shows an example of the propene forma-
tion rate and selectivity versus reaction time.
Reaction rate constants (ki,C–H and ki,C–D) for ODH
of undeuterated propane, perdeuterated propane, and
propane-2, 2-d2 were obtained from the rate of initial
propeneformationmeasuredforreactionmixturescontain-
ing CH3CH2CH3/O2, CD3CD2CD3/O2, or CH3CD2CH3/O2.
Kinetic isotope effects (deﬁned as the ratio of ki,C–H/ki,C–D)
for reactions 1, 2, and 3 are shown in Table 1. Results ob-
tained with CH3CH2CH3/O2 and CD3CD2CD3/O2 gave ki-
netic isotope effects greater than unity for all three reaction
steps, conﬁrming that C–H bond dissociation is a kinetically
relevant step (8). The KIE values for propane ODH (2.8)
and propane combustion (1.9) are different, suggesting that

the formation of propene and COx from propane involves
different active sites (see below). These results are consis-
tent with those reported in the literatures (9, 10).
The activation of both propane and propene involves
the cleavage of C–H bonds in kinetically relevant steps.
There are two kinds of C–H bonds in molecular propane;
the methyl C–H bonds have a dissociation enthalpy of
420 kJ/mol and the methylene C–H bonds have a disso-
ciation enthalpy of 401 kJ/mol (13). KIE measurements us-
ingCH3CH2CH3andCD3CD2CD3cannotdeterminewhich
C–H bond is involved in the initial activation step. On the
other hand, CH3CD2CH3 is expected to react more slowly
than CH3CH2CH3 if methylene C–H bonds are involved
in the initial activation step. Similar rates for CH3CD2CH3
and CD3CD2CD3 would indicate that only the methylene
C–H bonds are involved in the rate-determining step and
that the isotopic content of the rest of the propane molecule
does not inﬂuence reaction rates. The data in Table 1 show
that CH3CD2CH3 exhibits a normal KIE for both propane
dehydrogenation (2.7) and combustion (1.8). These values
are almost identical to those obtained using CD3CD2CD3
(2.8 and 1.9, respectively), conﬁrming the hypothesis that
methylene C–H bonds are the only ones involved in the
rate-determining steps for both propane dehydrogenation
and combustion. Similar isotopic studies for butane oxida-
tion to maleic anhydride have led to the similar conclusion
that methylene C–H bonds are activated preferentially dur-
ing the initial phase of the process (14).
Kinetic isotopic effects for propene combustion were de-
termined from the effect of contact time on propene selec-
tivity (Table 1); however, it is not possible to conclude which
particular bond cleaves in the rate-determining step for this
reaction just by simple inspection of the KIE for the reac-
tion of CH3CD2CH3/O2. Propene exchanges rapidly with
available adsorbed H and D species during ODH, leading
to statistical distribution of D atoms, as shown in studies of
C3H8/D2O over VOx/ZrO2 (8). Therefore, propene formed
from CH3CD2CH3/O2 contains CH3CDCH2, as well as all
the other isotopomers of C3H5D and C3H4D2, etc. Conse-
quently, the observed KIE reﬂects an average value for all
propene isotopomers.
Previous results show that water can also exchange with
H and D present on the catalyst surface during ODH
(8). Figures 2 and 3 show the results for the reaction of
C3H6/D2O/O2. At all propene conversion levels (1–20%),
the deuterium distribution in the unreacted propene obeys
a binomial distribution rule (Fig. 2). This conﬁrms that H/D
exchange of propene with the catalyst surface is very fast
and quasi-equilibrated, so the H/D ratio in propene is equal
to the H/D ratio in the surface H/D pool. However, the
H/D ratio in the unreacted propene is very large initially
and decreases with reaction time, reaching steady state

after ∼20 min (Fig. 3). This suggest that during the reac-
tion, gas-phase water exchanges H and D with the surface
H/D pool (because all D in the surface pool comes from
D2O), but that this step is much slower than the rate at
which propene exchanges with the surface H/D pool. With
increasing contact time, the concentration of D in the sur-
face H/D pool increases because of the exchange of H in the
pool with D2O. This, in turn, causes the H/D ratio in the sur-
face pool, and in propene, to decrease. However, the deu-
terium concentration in water decreases during the course
of the reaction because D2O is diluted by the formation of
H2O. The deuterium concentrations in the catalyst surface
H/D pool, propene, and gas-phase water ﬁnally equilibrate.
The discussion of how C3H6/D2O/O2 reacts demonstrates
that the exchange of the catalyst surface H/D pool with
water is much slower than with propene. As a conse-
quence, the initial D/H ratio in the propene formed from a
CH3CD2CH3/O2 mixture should be close to 1 : 5. Propene
has three kinds of C–H bonds. The weakest C–H bonds
are the allylic ones which have a dissociation enthalpy
of 361 kJ/mol (13). Previous studies of propene oxida-
tion to acrolein (15–17) have shown that the weakest al-
lylic C–H bonds are activated. Assuming that the allylic
C–H bonds of propene are dissociated preferentially dur-
ing propene combustion, the KIE associated with the com-
bustion of propene derived from CH3CD2CH3 was calcu-
lated. A base case KIE value of 2.6 for the combustion
of C3H6 versus C3D6 was taken for these calculations. The
calculated KIE for propene combustion (assuming an ini-
tial D/H ratio of 5) for CH3CH2CH3 versus CH3CD2CH3 is
1.14, which is very close to the value found experimentally,
1.1. Similarly, the calculated KIE for propene combustion
for CH3CD2CH3 versus CD3CD2CD3 is 2.45, whereas that
seen experimentally is 2.5. These results provide indirect
evidence that the weakest C–H bond in propene, i.e., the
allylic C–H bond, is dissociated preferably during propene
oxidation. Also shown in Table 2 are the KIE values calcu-
lated under the assumption the initial D/H ratio in propene
for CH3CD2CH3/O2 reaction is 2 : 6. These values do not
agree with the experimental ones as well, conﬁrming that
the exchange of the catalyst surface H/D pool with water is
much slower than that with propene.

The measured KIE values are reasonable and reﬂect the
participationoflatticeoxygenspeciesduringpropaneODH
reaction. ODH kinetics over VOx/ZrO2 catalysts have been
studied in detail and the kinetic rate expression has also
been obtained (8). Propane ODH is envisioned to occur
via the following sequence:
1. Weak associative adsorption of propane on lattice oxy-
gen (O∗),
C3H8 + O∗
C3H8O∗.
[I]
2. C–H cleavage via H-abstraction from propane using a
neighboring lattice oxygen,
C3H8O∗+ O∗
C3H7O∗+ OH∗.
[II]
3. Desorption of propene by hydride elimination from ad-
sorbed alkoxide species,
C3H7O∗
C3H6 + OH∗.
[III]
4. Recombination of OH groups to form water and a red-
uced V center (*),
OH∗+ OH∗
H2O + O∗+ ∗.
[IV]
5. Reoxidation of reduced V centers via dissociative chem-
isorption of O2,
O2 + ∗+ ∗
O∗+ O∗.
[V]
In this scheme, O∗is a lattice oxygen atom in the VOx
overlayer (e.g., V=
=O, V–O–V, or V–O–Zr), OH* is a hy-
droxyl group in V–O–H, C3H7O* represents an adsorbed
propoxide bonded to V (V–O–C3H7), and ∗represents a
surface vacancy associated with either one V3+ or two V4+
cations in the VOx lattice. These elementary steps, together
with pseudo-steady-state assumptions for all adsorbed in-
termediates and quasi-equilibrium assumptions for steps
(II) and (IV), lead to a rate expression of the form
r = kIIKI[C3H8]/
©
1 + (KIV[H2O])0.5
× (kIIKI[C3H8]/2kV[O2])0.25ª2,
[5]
where ki is the rate coefﬁcient and Ki is the equilibrium
constant for step i. At low H2O concentrations, the rate of
propane ODH given by Eq. [5] becomes
r = kIIKI[C3H8] = k1[C3H8].
[6]
The apparent rate coefﬁcient k1 is, therefore, equal to kIIKI.
The theoretical KIE of propane ODH can be calculated on
the basis of elementary steps I and II, Eq. [6], and tran-
sition state theory (18, 19). As shown in the Appendix, if
lattice oxygen does not participate in C–H bond activation
of propane, i.e., the transition state involves only the ho-
mogeneous dissociation of the C–H bond and no O–H and

based catalysts.
C–O bonds are formed, the theoretical KIE at 593 K will be
ca. 6. This value is much larger than what we observe (2.8).
However, when the activation of the C–H bond includes
the participation of lattice oxygen, i.e., C–H bond cleavage
is accompanied by formation of C–O and O–H bonds, the
KIE becomes smaller. The experimental KIE value of 2.8
suggests that the transition state for ODH involves the for-
mation of C–O and O–H bonds as well as the weakening
of a C–H bond (i.e., participation of lattice oxygen in C–H
bond activation). This conclusion is consistent with that ob-
tained by reacting C3H8/O18
2 over VO16
x /ZrO2 (8).
The theoretical calculations presented in the Appendix
cannot prove why the KIE for propane primary dehydro-
genation is larger than that for propane combustion. How-
ever, they do provide a qualitative explanation for why the
KIEs for these two reactions are different. As noted earlier,
lattice oxygen participates in C–H bond activation. Previ-
ous results have shown that the reaction rate constant ratio
(k1/k2) for primary dehydrogenation (k1) and primary com-
bustion (k2) increases with the increase of VOx surface den-
sity (9), suggesting that the two reactions require different
sites; e.g., V=
=O or V–O–V bonds are involved in primary
dehydrogenation, while the V–O–Zr bond is involved in
primary combustion reactions. If the lattice oxygen species
participating in the propane primary dehydrogenation and
combustion reactions are different, it is expected that the
strengths of the O–H bonds formed in the two transition
states are different, and, hence on the basis of Eq. [A22],
the KIEs for these two reactions will be different.
The proposed pathways for the activation of propane and
propene deduced from the isotopic labeling experiments
reported here and those reported earlier (8, 9) are summa-
rized in Fig. 4. Propane can either interact with V=
=O or
V–O–V bonds at selective oxidation sites forming propene
(k1), or interact with V–O–Zr bonds at combustion sites
forming COx (k2). In both cases, the secondary C–H bond
in propane dissociated preferentially. The primary dehy-
drogenation product propene can either desorb or readsorb
on dehydrogenation and combustion sites where it is then
converted to COx (k3). The weakest C–H bond in propene,
i.e., the allylic C–H bond, is preferably dissociated during
combustion reaction.
CONCLUSIONS
Measurements of kinetic isotopic effects using undeuter-
ated (CH3CH2CH3), perdeuterated (CD3CD2CD3), and se-
lectively deuterated propane (CH3CD2CH3) molecules can
be used to identify the kinetic signiﬁcance of C–H bond
activation steps and the position of the C–H involved in
oxidative dehydrogenation. Normal KIEs for propane pri-
mary dehydrogenation (2.8) and combustion (1.9) and for
propene secondary combustion reactions (2.6) were ob-
tained when CH3CH2CH3 and CD3CD2CD3 were used as
reactants, suggesting that in all cases C–H bond dissociation
is a kinetically relevant step. Comparison of CH3CH2CH3
and CH3CD2CH3 as reactants led to normal KIEs for de-
hydrogenation (2.7) and combustion (1.8) of propane, con-
ﬁrming that the methylene C–H bond is activated in the
rate-determining steps for propane dehydrogenation and
combustion. It is expected that the rate-determining step
in secondary propene combustion involves activation of an
allylic C–H bond. The measured propane oxidative dehy-
drogenation KIE values are consistent with those theoreti-
cally predicted. The smaller KIE for propane oxidative de-
hydrogenation (2.8) than the maximum KIE (6) expected
for propane thermal dehydrogenation indicates the partic-
ipation of lattice oxygen. The difference in the KIE values
for propane primary dehydrogenation and combustion re-
actions reﬂects that these two reactions involve different
lattice oxygen species.

1EH is the zero-point energy difference between C3H8 and
the corresponding transition state species, while 1ED is the
zero-point energy difference between C3D8 and the corre-
sponding transition state species, and 1(1E) reﬂects the
difference between 1EH and 1ED. The zero-point energy
of the transition state species cannot be determined; how-
ever, as shown in Fig. A1, comparing propane and the cor-
responding transition state, the main difference in energy is
the full C–H bond in propane changes to partially formed

0.3EC–H (=4.83 kJ) can be obtained from the literature (19).
At 593 K, the maximum KIE will be 6 when no lattice
oxygen participates in the C–H bond activation. However,
when lattice oxygens are involved (i.e., formation of C–O
and O–H bonds as well as the weakening of the C–H bond),
the KIE value becomes smaller than 6.
