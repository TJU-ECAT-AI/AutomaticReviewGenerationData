The dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene on Sn-promoted Pt supported on calcined hydrotalcite, PtSn/
Mg(Al)O, was investigated with the aim of understanding the effects of Sn on the local environment of
the dispersed Pt, the catalyst activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation, and the formation of coke.
The origins of methane, the primary byproduct of ethane dehydrogenation were also investigated as a
part of this study. Pt/Mg(Al)O was reacted with tetra-n-butyl tin in order to introduce Sn selectively to
the dispersed Pt particles. High-resolution TEM revealed the formation of a PtSn bimetallic phase upon
introduction of Sn. The activity of PtSn/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation at 873 K was highest for a
Sn/Pt ratio of 0.3, whereas the ethene selectivity increased monotonically with increasing Sn/Pt ratio,
reaching 100% for Sn/Pt = 0.4. Sn promotion also signiﬁcantly decreased the deposition of coke. Addition
of H2 to the feed enhanced the formation of ethene for H2/C2H6 ratios up to 0.58 for Pt/Mg(Al)O and 0.25
for PtSn/Mg(Al)O, but for higher ratios the product concentration of ethene decreased and approached
that determined thermodynamically. The ethene selectivity decreased dramatically with increasing H2/
C2H6 ratio for Pt/Mg(Al)O but only slightly for PtSn/Mg(Al)O. Coke formation was suppressed consider-
ably by H2 addition to the feed, particularly for PtSn/Mg(Al)O. Isotopic tracer studies revealed that meth-
ane formation resulted primarily from the readsorption of ethene. A mechanism is proposed for ethane
dehydrogenation and is used to interpret the effects of Sn promotion and the addition of H2 to the feed.

1. Introduction
Thermal dehydrogenation of ethane on supported Pt has been
investigated extensively as a means for producing ethene and
hydrogen [1–3]. Since the reaction is endothermic, high tempera-
tures are required to achieve reasonable conversions. To maintain
high activity, metal sintering and coke accumulation must be min-
imized, and to achieve high ethene selectivity, the conversion of
ethane to methane must be minimized. Previous studies have
shown that non-acidic supports such as K–L zeolite, alkali-doped
alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite [Mg(Al)O] minimize
the adsorption of ethene and the formation of coke [4–6]. Of these
supports, Mg(Al)O is particularly attractive because it is moder-
ately basic and exhibits high thermal stability to steam and reac-
tion-oxidation cycling [5,7–10] The addition of Sn to Pt further
suppresses coking as well as minimizing metal sintering and sup-
pressing methane formation [2,5–13]. The inﬂuence of Sn on Pt has
been attributed to both geometric and electronic effects. Reduction
in the size of Pt clusters present at the surface of the metal particles
caused by the addition of Sn reduces the ability of Pt to cleave C–C
bonds leading to the formation of CHx species that undergo hydro-
genation to methane or further dehydrogenation leading to coke
[14–21]. Quantum chemical studies suggest that the presence of
Sn at the surface of Pt enhances the dissociative adsorption of eth-
ane but suppresses the adsorption of ethene [22–25]. The inclusion
of hydrogen, hydrogen and oxygen, steam, or carbon dioxide has
also been reported to enhance the stability of PtSn bimetallic cat-
alysts, primarily by suppression of coke formation [26–29].
Given the wide array of roles Sn plays in modifying Pt, a consid-
erable number of studies have been conducted to characterize the
environment of Pt and Sn in Pt–Sn catalysts. EXAFS studies have
demonstrated the existence of Pt–Sn interactions, but the extent
of Sn interactions is shown to be highly dependent on synthesis
methods [15,21,30]. XPS, focusing on Sn, has conﬁrmed the pres-
ence of Sn(0) on catalysts, with the amount of metallic tin being
dependent on the support used [4,9,15,21,31]. Mössbauer spec-
troscopy has been used to conﬁrm the presence of not only Sn(0)
but also Pt–Sn alloys [32–34]. Finally, HRTEM and the associated
techniques of EDX and microdiffraction have also been used to
identify Pt–Sn alloys [35–37].
It is notable that while much is known about the effects of Sn on
the behavior of PtSn bimetallic catalysts for the dehydrogenation
of ethane, there remain a number of issues not fully understood.
These include the origins of coke formation, the role of coke in
altering ethene selectivity, the origins of methane formation, and

the inﬂuence of catalyst regeneration on its activity, selectivity,
and stability for ethene formation. The role of Sn/Pt ratio on the
catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability is also not well estab-
lished. Likewise, the extent to which a PtSn bimetallic phase is
formed has not been fully established. The present investigation
was undertaken with the aim of addressing these issues. Studies
were carried out using well-characterized Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/
Mg(Al)O catalysts containing the same loading of Pt in order to
fully understand the role of Sn.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Hydrotalcite was prepared by the method of coprecipitation [5].
A solution containing 233.24 g of Mg(NO3)26H2O (Alfa Aesar, 98–
102%), 34 g of Al(NO3)39H2O (Alfa Aesar, 98–102%) dissolved in
1000 mL deionized H2O was mixed dropwise with a solution con-
taining 4.8 g of Na2CO3 (EMD Chemicals Inc., 99.5%) and 45.32 g of
NaOH (Fisher Scientiﬁc, 98.3%) dissolved in 1000 ml H2O. Co-precip-
itation was carried out with stirring at 333 K for 1 h. The precipitate
was ﬁltered and dried overnight at 383 K. The dried material was
then heated in air at 2 K/min up to a temperature of 973 K. The cal-
cined material is referred to from here on out as Mg(Al)O. The BET
surface area of the dried hydrotalcite was 300 m2/g, but after calci-
nation the surface area of Mg(Al)O decreased to 200 m2/g. The Mg/
Al ratio of Mg(Al)O determined by elemental analysis was ﬁve.
Prior to impregnation with Pt and Sn, the Mg(Al)O support was
dried at 473 K for 2 h in air. Pt was introduced by mixing the sup-
port with three pore volumes of a solution containing Pt(acetylace-
tonate)2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) dissolved in toluene (2.7 mL
toluene/g catalyst). The Pt content varies from 0.7 wt.% to 0.8 wt.%
[38]. The mixture was then stirred until it became powdery, left
at room temperature in air for 2 h, and then dried at 383 K in air
for 4 h. After drying, the catalyst was reduced at 723 K for 2 h
(5 K/min temperature ramp) in a ﬂow of 10% H2/Ar (60 cm3/min)
[15]. The resulting material was either kept for characterization
or transferred immediately (exposure to air at room temperature
was limited to <1 min) to the reaction vessel for further impregna-
tion with Sn. Tetra-n-butyl tin was used as a precursor instead of
SnCl2 in order to achieve a preferential reaction of the precursor
with the Pt particles and dispersed on the support and to avoid
leaching of Mg from the support, an effect observed when samples
were prepared using SnCl2. The amount of tetra-n-butyl tin used
was varied based on the Sn/Pt ratio (for 0 < Sn/Pt < 1) desired for
the catalyst, a complete reaction of the tin precursor with the Pt
clusters was assumed, this was conﬁrmed with inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Tin was intro-
duced by mixing Pt/Mg(Al)O with a solution of tetra-n-butyl tin
(Alfa Aesar, 94%) in decane (10 mL solvent/g support) under an
ﬂowing 10% H2/Ar atmosphere (120 cc/min) [39]. To create cata-
lysts with Sn/Pt  1, an excess of tetra-n-butyl tin was used corre-
sponding to Sn/Pt = 2. The reaction vessel was then sealed and
120 cm3/min of 10% H2/Ar was continuously ﬂowed while heating
to 358 K for 4 h with stirring. After reaction, the wet powder was
extracted and washed with decane and vacuum dried in air
[38,40]. The vacuum dried material was then reduced under 10%
H2/Ar (60 cc/min) for 2 h at 383 K, 1 h at 623 K, and 1 h at 873 K
(5 K/min ramp rate). The resulting PtSn bimetallic catalyst was
re-reduced in situ immediately prior to catalyst testing.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The structure of the support was characterized before and after
calcination by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) on a Siemens Dif-
fractometer D 5000 with Cu Ka radiation (k = 1.5418 Å) at 20 kV
and 5 mA. The samples were scanned from 5 to 70 2h with a step
size of 0.02 and a dwell time of 1.0 s. Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the as-pre-
pared support were carried out using a TA instrument, SDT 2960
Simultaneous DSC–TGA. About 20–30 mg of as-synthesized hydro-
talcite, was placed in alumina crucible that was heated from 303 K
to 1273 K at a rate of 10 K/min in the TGA–DSC instrument nitro-
gen ﬂowing at 100 cm3/min. The surface area of as-synthesized
and calcined supports was determined by multi-point method
using an Autosorb-1 instrument (Quantachrome Corporation,
Boynton Beach, FL). Prior to measurement of surface area, each
sample was degassed at 573 K for 22–24 h. The Pt, Mg, Al, Sn con-
tents of the support and of support Pt and Pt/Sn were determined
by Galbraith Laboratories (Knoxville, TN) using ICP-OES. The dis-
persion of Pt on Pt/Mg(Al) O was determined by H2 chemisorption
using a AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation).
About 60 mg of Pt/Mg(Al)O was loaded into a quartz cell and then
reduced in ﬂowing 10% H2/Ar (50 cm3/min). The temperature of
the sample was raised at 5 K/min to 873 K and then maintained
at this level for 2 h. The sample was then ﬂushed in ﬂowing Ar
for 90 min and then cooled down to 308 K. The pulse size was
50 cm3/g and the time between pulses was 10 min.
Raman spectra were recorded with a Kaiser Optical HoloLab
series 5000 Raman spectrometer equipped with a Nd:YAG laser
that is frequency-doubled to 532 nm. The laser was operated at a
power level of 25 mW measured at the sample with a power meter.
A Princeton Instruments TEA/CCD detector was operated at 40 C.
Spectra were recorded with a resolution of 2 cm1. Samples
(approximately 25 mg each) were pressed into pellets at 5000 psi
and placed within a rotary quartz Raman cell. The samples were
rotated at 100 rpm during the measurements to reduce the effects
of sample heating by the laser. A quartz reactor allowed the sample
to be heated and reacted with gases while gathering Raman
spectra.
Analysis of the samples by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was carried out at the Electron Microscopy Lab at UC Berke-
ley using a FEI Tecnai 12 Transmission electron microscope. High-
resolution TEM studies were conducted at the National Center for
Electron Microscopy (NCEM), at the Lawrence Berkeley National
Lab using the OAM microscope, which is a modiﬁed Philips
CM300FEG/UT. Samples were prepared by suspending 5 mg of
sample in ethanol, dripping the solution onto a 200-mesh Cu grid
coated in holey carbon (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA, USA), and
letting the ethanol evaporate. HRTEM images were obtained using
the Scherzer focus, then defocusing the microscope and taking a
series of images with varying degrees of defocus. Images were
reconstructed from the series of defocused images via exit wave
reconstruction, using the MACTEMPAS software at NCEM. Analysis
of the reconstructed images was done using MACTEMPAS and
CrystalKit to analyze the FFT images and determine the crystal
structure [41].
2.3. Catalyst testing
Reactions were carried out in a quartz reactor with an inner
diameter of 7 mm. Prior to testing, the catalyst (0.025 g, 0.25–
0.5 mm particle size, diluted with quartz particles of the same par-
ticle size in a 1:4 ratio) was heated at 10 K/min to 883 K in 10% H2
in He and then maintained at this temperature for 1.5 h. The cata-
lyst bed was heated by a three-zone furnace (Applied Test System,
Inc.) controlled by Watlow 988 controllers. The temperature of the
catalyst bed was measured by two thermocouples centered axially
inside the reactor, one at the top and one at the bottom of the cat-
alyst bed. Brooks Mass Flow Controllers (MFC) were used to deliver
a deﬁned ﬂow of each gas. The feed concentrations were varied
210

from 2% to 30% for ethane and from 0% to 25% for hydrogen. For
residence time experiments, the amount of catalyst was varied
from 10–25 mg for Pt/Mg(Al)O and 10–50 mg for PtSn/Mg(Al)O,
and ﬂowrates varied from 0.25 to 3 cm3/s. All experiments were
performed in the kinetic regime. Internal mass transport limita-
tions were not observed as evidenced by a linear Arrhenius plot.
Catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition was observed. Regen-
eration of the catalysts was done by oxidizing the catalyst in a ﬂow
of 5 vol.% O2 in He (100 cm3/min) for 15 min and then reducing the
catalyst in a ﬂow of 20 vol.% H2 in He (100 cm3/min) for 30 min.
Prior to the changing the gas composition, the reactor was ﬂushed
with helium. The amount of coke was determined by combustion
of the deposited material. Prior to combustion, the catalyst was
(0.025 g) purged in a ﬂowing He (60 cm3/min) at 873 K for
30 min, after which it was exposed to a mixture of 5% O2 in He
ﬂowing at 100 cm3/min. The CO2 generated was monitored by an
on-line mass spectrometer. The ﬂow of O2 was stopped once the
production of CO2 ceased. The amount of deposited coke on the
catalyst was calculated from the amount of generated CO2.
Reactants and products were analyzed on-line using a gas chro-
matograph–mass spectrometer (Varian, Model 320) equipped with
a 14-port sampling valve and three sample loops. One sample loop
was injected into an Alumina PLOT column for the FID and MS, and
the other one into a Hayesep and Mol Sieve packed columns. A
thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to measure the con-
centration of He and H2. A ﬂame ionization detector (FID) and mass
spectrometer were used to measure the concentrations of all or-
ganic compounds eluting from the capillary column.
The ratio of hydrogen to ethane partial pressure in the feed was
varied from 0 to 2.5, while maintaining the total ﬂow constant by
appropriate addition of He. To compensate for catalyst deactiva-
tion,
measurements

ethane
conversion
were
made
after
60 min of time on stream at which time the conversion changed
by less than 10%. Experiments conducted with the empty reactor
showed that the conversion of ethane was less than 0.01% at 893 K.
The overall ethane conversion was calculated according to Eq.

2.4. Isotopic labeling
All isotopic labeling experiments were performed at atmo-
spheric pressure with 600 C as a standard temperature and total
ﬂow rate 60 cm3/min. The experiments where H2 in the feed was
replaced with D2 were performed on Pt/Mg(Al)O and Pt–Sn/Mg(A-
l)O catalysts. Prior to deuterium labeling experiments, the catalyst
was reduced in D2, with a D2 feed partial pressure of 11.3 kPa and
with the ratio of partial pressures of ethane and deuterium being
0.58. Natural occurrence of 1% 13C in carbon was neglected by com-
mon approximation in calculation of isotopomer distributions [42].
D2 gas (99.9% isotopic purity) was obtained from Sigma–Aldrich.
An experiment where 13C2H4 was cofed with unlabeled ethane to
Pt–Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst was also performed to study the origin of
the byproducts and the extent of reverse reactions. Experiments
were carried out at different ratios of ethane and hydrogen
(H2/13C2H6 = 1.25, 0.58, and 0). Prior to 13C isotopic labeling exper-
iments, the reactor was ﬂushed with ethane-free ﬂow to avoid con-
tamination with unlabeled ethane. No kinetic isotope effect was
expected in 13C labeling experiments. 13C2H4 gas (99 atm.% 13C)
was obtained from Sigma–Aldrich. The isotopic composition of re-
agents and products was determined by using a Varian gas chro-
matograph–mass spectrometer.
3. Results
3.1. Catalyst characterization
Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns for the support taken after synthesis
and after calcination. The positions of the diffraction lines observed
after synthesis are consistent with those reported for hydrotalcite
[43]. The BET surface area of the as-synthesized support is 300
m2/g. Fig. 2A shows a TEM image of the support prior to calcina-
tions. A rag-like, layered structure is evident, consistent with the
structure of hydrotalcite. TGA–DSC analysis shows that water is
evolved at 373 K and 643 K, and carbon dioxide at 353 K and
623 K. The XRD pattern of the calcined support shows two lines
characteristic of cubic MgO. The Al present in the original hydrotal-
cite is believed to be retained and located in interstitial sites in the
MgO framework after calcination [44]. Calcination led to a reduc-
tion in the BET surface area to 200 m2/g. Consistent with the loss
in surface area, the TEM image of the calcined support shows den-
ser plate-like structures (Fig. 2B).
The introduction of Pt and then Sn did not lead to a loss in the
surface area of the calcined support. The BET surface area remained
at 200 m2/g, and the image of the support shown in Fig. 2B is sim-
ilar to that seen in Fig. 2A prior to calcinations. Small particles of Pt
and PtSn are evident in Fig. 2C and D. The average diameter of
these particles was 1.0–1.5 nm. This corresponds well to the mean
particle size calculated from the Pt/Mg(Al)O dispersion of 84%,
determined by H2 chemisorption, of 1.35 nm, calculated from dis-
persion of Pt. Formation of PtSn bimetallic particles is clearly evi-
dent from high-resolution TEM. Fig. 3A shows a HRTEM image
obtained via exit wave reconstruction of a series of defocused
images taken for an as-prepared sample of the catalyst having a
Sn/Pt ratio of 0.23. The bright spots presenting this image repre-
sent atoms. The indicated reﬂections in the FFT of the particle
(Fig. 3B) have spacings in reciprocal lattice space of 0.28 Å1,
0.34 Å1, and 0.37 Å1, which correspond well to the ﬁrst three
(0 1 0), (0 1 1), and (0 0 2), reﬂection planes of PtSn [45]. The reﬂec-
tions planes observed have far smaller lattice spacings than those
observed for Pt, which has its ﬁrst (1 1 0), reﬂection plane at
0.44 Å1. It is noted that particles of Pt, and possibly Pt-rich PtSn
alloys, should coexist with particles of PtSn, since the Sn/Pt ratio
of the sample examined was less than 1.0. However, deﬁnitive
identiﬁcation of such Pt-rich phases could not be made because
the majority of the observed particles were so small (1.5 nm) that
diffraction patterns of sufﬁcient quality to differentiate the Pt
phase from the support phase could not be obtained.

3.2. Catalytic performance of Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O
Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O were active for ethane dehydro-
genation over the range of 823–873 K. Evidence for homogeneous
dehydrogenation was observed above 873 K, so higher tempera-
tures were not investigated. The apparent activation energy for
ethane dehydrogenation over the range investigated was calcu-
lated to be 114 kJ/mol and 102 kJ/mol for Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/
Mg(Al)O, respectively. Based on the results of these preliminary
studies, all further experiments were conducted at 873 K.
Fig. 4 shows the conversion of ethane to ethene and the selec-
tivity to ethene for Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O as functions of
time. The reaction conditions used for both catalysts were the
same: the ethane inlet concentration was 19.5%, the total gas ﬂow
rate was 60 cm3/min, the reaction temperature was 873 K, and no
H2 was included in the feed. Both catalysts exhibited a rapid loss in
conversion during the ﬁrst 40 min of time on stream but then at-
tained a period of nearly constant conversion. During this period,
the conversion of ethane to products was 0.66% for Pt/Mg(Al)O
and 2.6% for PtSn/Mg(Al)O, resulting in an activity for PtSn/Mg(A-

l)O that was a factor of 3 higher than that for Pt/Mg(Al)O under
identical conditions. The ethene selectivity of Pt/Mg(Al)O was
99.4% initially and then rose to 99.9%, whereas that of PtSn/Mg(A-
l)O was 99.8% initially and then rose to 99.9%. The only other car-
bon-containing product observed besides ethene was methane.
Prior studies have shown that catalyst deactivation can be
inhibited by adding H2, H2/O2, CO2, or H2O to the feed [26–29]. Figs.
5 and 6 show the effects of adding H2 to the feed for Pt/Mg(Al)O
and PtSn/Mg(Al)O, respectively. In the case of Pt/Mg(Al)O raising
the ratio of H2 to C2H6 from 0.25 to 1.25 strongly inhibited the loss
of activity for ethene formation and increased the steady-state
activity of the catalyst. However, H2 addition to the feed also
caused a signiﬁcant decrease in the selectivity to ethene and a cor-
responding increase in the selectivity to methane relative to that
observed in the absence of H2 addition (see Fig. 5), but nevertheless
the ethene selectivity rose with time on stream. H2 addition to the
feed also reduced the loss of activity for ethene formation on PtSn/
Mg(Al)O but to a lesser extent than was observed for Pt/Mg(Al)O,
and in contrast to what was observed with that catalyst, the activ-
ity for ethene formation decreased with increasing addition of H2.
The presence of H2 in the feed stream also caused a loss in the
selectivity to ethene for PtSn/Mg(Al)O but to much lesser extent
than was observed for Pt/Mg(Al)O (see Fig. 6).
Fig. 7a and b shows the amount of carbon deposited on the cat-
alyst as a function of time on stream and the H2/C2H6 ratio in the
feed. In the absence of H2 in the feed both Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/
Mg(Al)O accumulated carbon rapidly with time on stream, the
amount being roughly a factor of two less for PtSn/Mg(Al)O than
Pt/Mg(Al)O. When H2 is added to the feed at the level of H2/
C2H6 = 1.25, the amount of carbon accumulated was greatly re-
duced, particularly for PtSn/Mg(Al)O. Raman spectra of the catalyst
taken after ethane dehydrogenation and after oxidation are shown
in Fig. 8. The bands seen at 1315 and 1575 cm1 are attributable to
graphite-like species [46–48]. After catalyst oxidation of the used
catalysts at 673 K, these bands disappeared completely (Fig. 8B).
Further evidence of the effects of H2/C2H6 ratio on the activity and
selectivity of ethene formation on Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O
isshowninFig.9. Forbothcatalysts,theproductionof ethene,passed
througha maximumand then decreased with increasingH2/C2H6 ra-
tio. At high values of H2/C2H6, the rate of production of ethene ap-
proached that predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium. It is
notable that the rate of formation of ethene produced by PtSn/Mg(A-
l)O was only slightly greater than that produced by Pt/Mg(Al)O.

However, the selectivity to ethene decreases from 100% to 20% as the
H2/C2H6 ratio increases from 0 to 2.5 for Pt/Mg(Al)O, but decreased
only slightly from 100% for PtSn/Mg(Al)O over the same range of
H2/C2H6 ratios.Since methanewas the onlyother hydrocarbonprod-
uct produced, these results demonstrate that the formation of meth-
ane increases signiﬁcantly with increasing H2/C2H6 ratio for Pt/
Mg(Al)O, but not for PtSn/Mg(Al)O. To study the reaction order with
respect to ethane, H2 in the feed was kept constant, and the amount
of ethane was increased from 3% to 30%. Shown in Fig. 10, the ethane
dehydrogenation reaction is ﬁrst order with respect to ethane.
The effects of residence time on the performance of Pt/Mg(Al)O
and PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts are shown in Fig. 11a–c. To compen-
sate for catalyst deactivation during residence time variation
experiments, the products concentration at reference conditions
was measured when concentration deviations between successive
measurements were not more than 5%. Fig. 11a shows that the pro-
duction of ethene increased with increasing space time for both Pt/
Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O and that for low residence times the
production of ethene from both catalysts was nearly identical.
However, at higher residence times, the ethene production ob-
served for Pt/Mg(Al)O was below that observed for PtSn/Mg(Al)O.
As seen in Fig. 11b, the production of methane from Pt/Mg(Al)O
at low residence times was comparable to the amount of ethene
formed, but the production of methane becomes signiﬁcantly high-
er than that of ethene at higher space residence times. Consistent
with these observations, Fig. 11c shows that the selectivity to eth-
ene falls and the selectivity to methane rises with increasing resi-
dence time. In contrast to Pt/Mg(Al)O, the selectivity to ethene
remained high for PtSn/Mg(Al)O, irrespective of the residence time.
The results presented in Fig. 11 clearly demonstrate that the addi-
tion of Sn to Pt/Mg(Al)O has a much larger effect on the formation
of methane than on the formation of ethene. The change in ethene
and methane selectivities with residence time suggests that meth-
ane may be formed both as a primary product of ethane hydrogen-
olysis and as a secondary product of ethene hydrogenolysis, a
subject discussed in more detail in the next paragraph.

3.3. Isotopic labeling experiments
13C2H4 was cofed with unlabeled C2H6 with the aim of under-
standing the origin of methane and the extent to which product
ethene undergoes hydrogenation back to ethane. These experi-
ments were carried out at 873 K after reduction of the catalyst in
H2. Table 1 lists the isotopomer distributions for 13C-unlabled, sin-
gly labeled, and doubly labeled C2H4 and C2H6 present in the prod-
ucts formed on PtSn/Mg(Al)O for different H2/C2H6 feed ratios.
With no H2 added to the feed none of the C2H6 was 13C labeled.
The ethane in the products was comprised of a small concentration
of 12C2H4 and a large concentration of 13C2H4, but contained hardly
any 12CH2
13CH2. Thus, in the absence of H2 addition to the feed the
13C2H4 passed through reactor without signiﬁcant transformation.
Upon addition of H2 to the feed the concentration of 12C2H4 in-
creased progressively, consistent with what was observed in
Fig. 9. The presence of H2 in the feed also increased the concentra-
tion
13C2H6 at the expense of decreasing the concentration of
13C2H4 due to hydrogenation of the doubly labeled ethene.
The origins of methane formation were investigated with Pt/
Mg(Al)O, since virtually no methane was formed on PtSn/Mg(Al)O.
For these experiments, H2 was added to the feed (H2/C2H6 = 1.25)
together with 1.4% 13C2H4. The fractional distribution of 13CH4,
13C2H4, and 13C2H6 produced are listed in Table 2. Only 14% of
the product methane was 13C labeled. The principal source of prod-
uct methane was deduced from the following considerations. The
conversion of 13C2H4 to methane was 7.4% and the conversion of
12C2H6 to methane was 3.2%; however, it must be recognized that
the partial pressure of 12C2H6 was 14 times higher than the partial
pressure of 13C2H4. These observations suggest that methane for-
mation from ethene is much more rapid than the formation of this
product directly from ethane, and that 12CH4 is produced as a sec-
ondary product from 12C2H4, consistent with what was inferred
from Fig. 11. The fraction of 13C2H4 in the products was 16%, indi-
cating that most of the product ethene derived from dehydrogena-
tion of C2H6. The observation of 5.5%
13C2H6 in the products
indicates that rehydrogenation of ethene occurs under the experi-
mental conditions used. The conclusion that ethene is the principal
source of methane is consistent with the work of Virnovskaia et al.
in which 12CH3
13CH3 was cofed with unlabeled ethene over a PtSn/
Mg(Al)O catalyst similar to that used in the present study [26].

Experiments were carried out in which D2 was fed together
with C2H6 over both Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O with the objec-
tive of establishing the effect of catalyst composition on the extent
of H/D exchange. The level of exchange observed for the empty
reactor at 873 K was only 1%. Fig. 12 shows the deuterium distribu-
tion in ethane, ethene, and methane during the reaction of a C2H6/
D2 mixture over Pt/Mg(Al)O catalyst at 10% conversion of ethane.
Under these conditions, 10% of the hydrogen in C2H6 was ex-
changed for deuterium, but the distribution of deuterium in the
isotopomers was far from that expected for a binomial distribution.
By contrast, the distribution of deuterium in ethene approached
that for a binomial distribution. The high fraction of ethene con-
taining deuterium indicates that C2H4 once formed readsorbs on
the catalyst surface and undergoes H/D exchange. The deuterium
content of methane was higher than that expected if all methane
were formed by the hydrogenolysis of C2H6, supporting the idea
that methane is formed by readsorption and subsequent hydrogen-
olysis of ethene.
The distribution of deuterium in ethane and ethene upon reac-
tion of a C2H6/D2 mixture over PtSn/Mg(Al)O is shown in Fig. 13.
The extent of H/D exchange in ethane was only 3% in the case. In
contrast to Pt/Mg(Al)O, the extent of H/D exchange into ethene
was much lower for PtSn/Mg(Al)O. These results suggest that the
addition of Sn to Pt inhibits the readsorption of ethene.
3.4. Inﬂuence of Sn/Pt ratio on catalyst activity, selectivity, and
stability
The effects of Sn/Pt ratio on the activity and selectivity of PtSn/
Mg(Al)O is shown in Fig. 14. With increasing Sn/Pt ratio, the rate of
production of ethene increases, reaching a maximum at Sn/Pt = 0.3,
and then decreases. On the other hand, the selectivity to ethene in-
creases from 60% for Sn/Pt = 0 to nearly 100% for Sn/Pt = 0.6 and
then remains constant for higher ratios of Sn/Pt.

As noted earlier, both Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O undergo
noticeable loss
in
dehydrogenation
activity
during the
ﬁrst
30 min of time on stream followed by a slower loss in activity for
longer reaction times, particularly in the absence of H2 in the feed.
The coke built up during deactivation could be burned off by oxi-
dation at 873 K (see Fig. 8), and the catalyst brought back to its re-
duced state by treatment in hydrogen at 873 K. As shown in
Fig. 14a, there was essentially no change of catalyst activity with
regeneration for catalysts prepared with Sn/Pt = 0–0.4, but for
higher values of Sn/Pt, the catalyst activity increased slightly with
Sn/Pt ratio. A similar increase in activity, but greater in magnitude,
after use and regeneration has been reported previously for PtSn/
Mg(Al)O catalysts prepared with Sn/Pt > 2 [5,10]. Fig. 14b shows
that regeneration of the catalyst also led to a slight decrease in
the ethene selectivity.
4. Discussion
The results of this study show that the promotion of Pt/Mg(Al)O
with Sn enhances the activity of the catalyst for ethane dehydroge-
nation and increases the catalyst selectivity to ethene. This effect is
strongest for a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.3. The addition of H2 to the feed
also enhances catalyst activity for the formation of ethene for H2/
C2H6 ratio up to about 0.5 but causes a loss in catalyst selectivity
for higher H2/C2H6 ratios due to the formation of CH4. The latter ef-
fect is severe for Pt/Mg(Al)O but leads to only a modest loss in
selectivity for PtSn/Mg(Al)O. The introduction of Sn also results
in a signiﬁcant reduction in carbon deposition due to coking, as
does the addition of H2 to the feed. Interpretation of these effects
is complex, since reactions pathways leading to ethene, methane,
and coke are interconnected.
The elementary processes involved in ethane dehydrogenation
to ethene, the formation of methane, and the deposition of coke
can be described by the following sequence of reactions, in which
Sn (n = 1–3) indicates the number of metal atoms interacting with
either an H or a C atom.
1. H2 þ 2S  2H—S
2. C2H6 + 2S ? C2H5–S + H–S
3. C2H5–S + 2S ? C2H4–S2 + H–S
4. C2H5–S + H–S ? C2H4–S2 + H2
5. C2H4—S2  C2H4 þ 2S
6. C2H4—S2  CH3CH—S2
7. CH3CH–S2 + 2S ? CH3C–S3 + H–S
8. CH3C–S3 + S ? CH3–S + C–S3
9. CHy–S4y + (4  y)H–S ? ? ? CH4 + 2(4  y)S (y = 1–3)
The dehydrogenation of ethane begins with the dissociative
adsorption of C2H6 to form C2H5–S species (Reaction 2), a reaction
that has been observed to occur on Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 1 0) surfaces
[49–54]. Adsorbed C2H4 can form via two competing processes, the
ﬁrst (Reaction 3) involves dissociation of an H atom from C2H5–S
[49–54]. The second (Reaction 4) involves the attack an adsorbed
H atom on C2H5–S. While this step has not been proposed in previ-
ous studies of ethane dehydrogenation, its involvement is sug-
gested by the results presented in Fig. 8, which show that for H2/
C2H6 ratios below 0.58 for Pt/Mg(Al)O and 0.25 for PtSn/Mg(Al)O
the formation of ethene is enhanced by increasing the concentra-
tion of H2 in the feed. Ethene and hydrogen are obtained by desorp-
tion of C2H4–S (Reaction 5) and associative desorption of H2 (the
reverse of Reaction 1). However, adsorbed ethene can also undergo
isomerization to form ethylidene, CH3CH–S2 (Reaction 6). Dehy-
drogenation of ethylidene to form ethylidyne, CH3C–S3 (Reaction
7). This process is known to occur on Pt, and at temperatures above
400 K, ethylidyne species undergo C–C bond cleavage (Reaction 8)
to form CHy–S4y species [45,46]. Evidence for the occurrence of
Reactions 6–8 on Pt is well documented both experimentally and
theoretically [55–62]. In the presence of atomically adsorbed
hydrogen, the CHy–S4y (y = 1–3) species can undergo hydrogena-
tion to form CH4 (Reaction 8), whereas dehydrogenation and asso-
ciation of such species very likely contributes to the formation of
coke precursors.
It is evident from the proposed reaction mechanism that ad-
sorbed hydrogen plays several important roles. As suggested by
Reaction 4, atomically adsorbed hydrogen promotes the dehydro-
genation of C2H5–S to form C2H4–S, adsorbed ethene, via Reaction
4. High H–S coverage is, however, detrimental, since it facilitates
the hydrogenation of C2H5–S to reform C2H6, and the hydrogena-
tion of CHx–S to form methane via the reverse of Reaction 2 and
Reaction 9, respectively. As noted in Fig. 9, H2/C2H6 ratios above
0.58 for Pt/Mg(Al)O and 0.25 for PtSn/Mg(Al)O lead to a decrease
in the formation of ethene, the approach of the ethene concentra-
tion to that expected for thermodynamic equilibrium, and the for-
mation of increasing amounts of methane. The deposition of coke
is also suppressed with increasing feed H2/C2H6 ratio (see Fig. 7).
This is envisioned to occur by the reverse of Reaction 7, which
leads to a reduction in the surface concentration of coke precursors
formed via Reaction 9.
A Bond-order-Morse-Potential (BOC-MP) analysis of Reactions
2–4 reveals that the effect of H2/C2H6 ratio on the formation of
C2H4 results from the interplay in the kinetics of Reactions 2–4.
The activation energy for the forward direction of Reaction 3 is
4 kcal/mol and 0 kcal/mol for the reverse direction of this reaction,
whereas the activation for the forward direction of Reaction 4 is
9.5 kcal/mol and 24.5 kcal/mol for the reverse direction [63]. This
suggests that an increase in H atom surface concentration will fa-
vor the progress of Reaction 4 in the forward direction. An increase
in H atom surface concentration also increases the rate of Reaction
2 in the reverse direction, but BOC-MP calculations show that the
activation energy for this process is 10 kcal/mol, slightly more than
that for Reaction 4 in the forward direction [63]. BOC-MP calcula-
tions also suggest that the precursor to C–C bond cleavage is CH3C–
S, since the activation energy for this species to form CH3–S and C–
S, 11 kcal/mol, is signiﬁcantly lower than that for C–C bond cleav-
age from any other C2Hx–S species [63]. This last conclusion is con-
sistent with experimental observations, as noted previously.
The accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface is accompa-
nied by an increase in the selectivity to ethene, as can be seen from
Figs. 4 and 5. A similar observation has been reported previously
for Pt dispersed on different supports [6,9,27], and this effect has
been attributed to a decrease in the presence of large Pt clusters
occurring on the surface of Pt particles as coke accumulates on
the surface of the Pt particles [9,64].
The addition of Sn to Pt can lead to a variety of bulk and sur-
face structures depending on the Sn/Pt ratio, the nature of the Pt
and Sn precursors used, and the manner of catalyst pretreatment
[9,14,15,36,65]. Sn oxidation states of 0, +2, and +4 have been
observed for supported PtSn catalysts after reduction in H2. It
is generally agreed that Sn(0) is present in bimetallic PtSn parti-
cles, whereas Sn(+2) and Sn(+4) are present in the form of SnO
and SnO2 particles, respectively, on the support or in contact
with Pt particles. Whereas the phase diagram for PtSn alloys
shows stable Pt, Pt3Sn, PtSn, Pt2Sn3, PtSn2, and PtSn4 phases
for Sn/Pt ratios of 0 to 4.0 [66], identiﬁcation of speciﬁc PtSn
phases in supported PtSn catalysts has proven to be difﬁcult.
XPS studies of H2-reduced PtSn/Mg(Al)O have shown that the
metal particles are enriched with Sn for samples prepared with
a nominal Sn/Pt ratio of  4; however, the stoichiometry of this
phase was not reported [9]. Mössbauer spectroscopy also shows
the presence of metallic Sn and Pt–Sn interactions [32,33]. On
the other hand, EXAFS evidence for the coexistence particles of

PtSn and Pt phases has been presented for PtSn/SiO2 and PtSn/c-
Al2O3 catalysts, in which Sn was introduced by reaction of
Sn(Bu)4 with preformed Pt particles [15], TEM evidence for the
formation of Pt3Sn particles has been reported for PtSn/C [36].
In the present study, selected-area electron diffraction indicates
that particles of PtSn were formed upon reduction of as-pre-
pared PtSn/Mg(Al)O (Sn/Pt = 0.23) providing direct evidence for
the formation of bimetallic particles. It should be noted, though,
that not all of the metal particles have this stoichiometry, and
hence it is reasonable to believe that individual metal particles
having different Sn/Pt ratios coexist.
As noted previously, the addition of Sn to Pt/Mg(Al)O increases
C2H6 consumption and the product selectivity to C2H4, but dimin-
ishes the accumulation of coke, in agreement with the general
ﬁndings reported earlier for similar catalysts [26]. The present
work has also shown (see Fig. 13) that the highest rate of ethane
formation occurs for a Sn/Pt ratio of about 0.3. Several hypotheses
have been put forth in the literature to explain the means by which
Sn alters catalyst properties. The suppression of coke formation by
supported by PtSn catalysts has been attributed to both geometric
and electronic effects [2,6,16–20,35,67]. The presence of Sn at the
surface of PtSn bimetallics reduces the number of adjacent Pt
atoms, thereby decreasing the number of Pt atoms in ensembles
required to form coke precursors via processes such as Reaction
8 (see above). It has also been found that Sn reduces the heat of
adsorption
of
ethene
formed
via
ethane
dehydrogenation
[19,24,68]. As noted above, the isotopic tracer studies conducted
as a part of this study clearly demonstrate that ethene readsorption
is responsible for the formation of CHx species, the precursors to
both methane and coke formation. Sn atoms may also suppress
the formation of coke and methane by preferential segregation to
step and kink edge sites, where it could attenuate the cleavage of
C–C bonds on low-coordination Pt sites exposed at these locations
[10].
In contrast to previous studies of ethane dehydrogenation on
PtSn/Mg(Al)O [65], the catalysts prepared in the present study
were stable to regeneration (see Fig. 13). We believe that this is a
consequence of introducing Sn via the selective reaction of Sn(Bu)4
with the Pt particles formed on the support. By contrast, the use of
SnCl2 as the precursor for introducing Sn is non-selective and can
cause damage to the support since the solution used to introduce
Sn in this manner is quite acidic and will react with the basic
Mg(Al)O. Moreover, the use of high Sn/Pt ratios (e.g., >2) may result
in the formation of PtSn2 particles that have been shown to be less
active for ethane dehydrogenation than alloys with lower Sn/Pt ra-
tios [69], and hence the increase in dehydrogenation activity ob-
served with sequential regeneration reported earlier may have
been the consequence of the removal of excess Sn from PtSn parti-
cles and the storage of Sn on the support as SnO or SnO2 [65]. Our
ﬁndings regarding catalyst stability to regeneration are similar to
those reported earlier for the promotion of Pt/SiO2 and Pt/c-
Al2O3, in which Sn(Bu)4 was used as the precursor to introduce
Sn [15]. In that study PtSn catalysts with Sn/Pt ratios similar to
those used in the present work were found to be stable for isobu-
tene dehydrogenation after repeated regeneration by oxidation
and reduction.
5. Conclusions
1. Sn promotion of Pt/Mg(Al)O increases the activity of Pt/Mg(Al)O
for ethane dehydrogenation to ethene increases for Sn/Pt ratio
between 0 and 0.3, beyond which the activity decreases. On
the other hand, the selectivity to ethene increases monotoni-
cally, and approaches 100% for Sn/Pt ratios above 0.4.
2. Both Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O deactivate with time on
stream at about the same rate due to the accumulation of coke;
however, the amount of coke accumulated on PtSn/Mg(Al)O is
signiﬁcantly lower than that on Pt/Mg(Al)O. Deactivation on
both Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O is accompanied, though,
by an increase in ethene selectivity.
3. Isotopic tracer studies demonstrate that the formation of meth-
ane is due primarily to the readsorption of ethene, a process
that is much more signiﬁcant on Pt/Mg(Al)O than on PtSn/
Mg(Al)O. Ethene readsorption also contributes to the hydroge-
nation of ethene to ethane and to the formation of coke
precursors.
4. Addition of H2 to the feed stream increases the product concen-
tration of ethene for H2/C2H6 ratios up to 0.58 for Pt/Mg(Al)O,
and ratios of up to 0.25 for PtSn/Mg(Al)O. In both cases, further
increases in the H2/C2H6 ratio decreases the product concentra-
tion of ethane and enhances the approach to thermodynamic
equilibrium. Addition of H2 of to the feed stream causes a sharp,
monotonic decreases in ethene selectivity for Pt/Mg(Al)O, but
only a very small decrease in ethene selectivity for PtSn/
Mg(Al)O. Coke deposition is also suppressed by H2 addition to
the feed, an effect which is particularly strong for PtSn/Mg(Al)O.
5. The effects of H2 addition to the feed and Sn promotion of the
catalyst can be interpreted in light of the mechanism comprised
of Reactions 1–8. This scheme suggests that adsorbed H atoms
can promote the dehydrogenation of C2H5–S species via Reac-
tion 4. However, a high surface concentration of H atoms is
undesirable because it contributes to the hydrogenation of eth-
ene via the reverse of Reaction 4 and to the formation of meth-
ane via Reaction 8. H2 is also envisioned to suppress the
formation of C2Hx–S2 species, which are the precursors to CHy
–S species formed via Reaction 7. The latter species are undesir-
able, since they can undergo hydrogenation to form methane as
well dehydrogenation to form coke. Promotion of Pt/Mg(Al)O
with Sn suppresses the readsorption of ethene thereby inhibit-
ing hydrogenation of the ethene back to ethane and the contri-
bution of adsorbed ethene to the formation of methane and
coke.
6. Coke accumulated on either Pt/Mg(Al)O or PtSn/Mg(Al)O can be
fully removed by oxidation, and the catalyst activity restored by
subsequent reduction. Regeneration by such treatment appears
to have little effect on the activity of catalysts prepared with Sn/
Pt ratios less than 0.3, and leads to a slight improvement in
ethene formation activity for higher Sn/Pt ratios. Regeneration,
however, leads to small loss in ethene selectivity independent
of the Sn/Pt ratio.
