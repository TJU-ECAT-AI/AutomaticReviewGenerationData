Abstract 
The chemistry of ethylene on Pt(lll) single-crystal surfaces has proven quite complex because it involves the simultaneous 
occurrence of several reactions, namely molecular desorption, dehydrogenation to ethylidyne, H-D exchange within the adsorbed 
molecules, and hydrogenation to ethane. Reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) has been used here in conjunction 
with isothermal kinetic measurements to identify the possible intermediates involved in each of those reactions, and to follow their 
thermal chemistry on the platinum surface. All vinyl, ethyl and ethylidene moieties were prepared by thermal decomposition of their 
corresponding iodides and characterized by RAIRS. The experimental data available to date favors the formation of ethylidene as 
an intermediate in the conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne, but the complexity of the kinetics of that reaction, which changes 
significantly with changing surface coverages, makes the final proof of this mechanism quite difficult. In addition, a side ethylene- 
ethyl equifibrium which starts at temperatures below those required for the formation of ethylidyne is responsible for H-D exchange 
in ethylene. Finally, the hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane also involves an ethyl intermediate, but only occurs at the ethylene high 
coverages needed for the transition of the di-tr strongly bonded species to a weak it configuration. The relevance of the reactions 
seen under vacuum to the high-pressure catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene is briefly discussed.

1. Introduction 
Since its discovery by Sabatier and Senderens in 
1897, the hydrogenation of olefins over metal cata- 
lysts has been one of the most studied chemical 
processes [ 1,2]. As a representative case of those 
reactions, the chemistry of ethylene on Pt(lll) 
surfaces has received particular attention from the 
surface science community [ 3-5 ]. The study of this 
seemingly simple system is complicated by the fact 
that there appears to be at least two types of 
molecular adsorption states for ethylene, namely, a

strong di-a bonding and a weaker n-bonded con- 
figuration [6,7]. Furthermore, heating chemi- 
sorbed ethylene to around room temperature 
triggers several competitive reaction pathways, 
including hydrogenation to ethane, H-D exchange 
and conversion to ethylidyne [5]. Here we report 
some recent studies carried out in our laboratory 
designed to address each of those reactions in an 
individual manner. 
2. Experimental 
Most experiments reported here were performed 
in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber evacu-

ated to a base pressure below 1 x 10 -1° Torr and 
equipped with sample cleaning and characteriza- 
tion facilities, as well as with instrumentation for 
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and 
reflection absorption infrared (RAIRS) spectro- 
scopies [8]. The RAIRS spectra reported here 
were taken using a mercury--cadmium telluride 
(MCT) detector, by averaging 1000 scans taken 
with 4 cm -1 resolution and ratioing that against 
spectra for the clean surface recorded immediately 
before dosing. The kinetic measurements were per- 
formed in a second UHV system [9] specifically 
designed to perform dynamic kinetic measurements 
using a variation of the molecular-beam method 
initially developed by King and Wells [10]. The 
kinetic data reported here were taken isothermally 
by exposing the clean platinum surface to a direc- 
tional collimated beam composed of mixtures of 
ethylene and hydrogen gases [ 11

bonds) [21]. In that case vinylidene disappears 
around 170 K while acetylene subsists to 200 K, 
but above that temperature both appear to convert 
to chemisorbed ethylene, and only after heating to 
about 300 K is ethylidyne formation detected. 
At the present time ethylidene seems to be the 
most likely intermediate in the conversion of ethy- 
lene to ethylidyne. Indeed, 1,1-diiodoethane, used 
as a precursor for ethylidene, converts readily to 
ethylidyne [22]. This is illustrated by Fig. 1, which 
displays infrared spectra for 5.0 L (dose to satura- 
tion coverage, which amounts to about 0.10 ML) 
of 1,1-diiodoethane adsorbed on Pt(lll) after 
annealing the surface to different temperatures. 
The initial molecular adsorption below 100 K is 
apparent by the signals at 1197 and 1371 cm -1, 
which correspond to the ~-C-H and symmetric 
(umbrella) methyl deformation modes respectively. 
3. Formation of ethylidyne 
The reaction which perhaps has received the 
most attention in relation to the thermal reactivity 
of ethylene chemisorbed on transition metal sur- 
faces is its conversion to ethylidyne. This has 
turned out to be a particularly puzzling process, 
and the extensive studies performed on this system 
have not yet led to the development of a clear idea 
of the mechanism for the reaction. It has been 
argued that ethyl [12], vinyl [ 13], and/or ethyli- 
dene [14,15] moieties are the most likely surface 
intermediates in this conversion. We have taken 
advantage of the fact that halide derivatives are 
good precursors for hydrocarbon moieties [ 16,17] 
to prepare and characterize the chemistry of those 
three species by RAIRS. Ethyl moieties, prepared 
by thermal decomposition of chemisorbed ethyl 
iodide, were shown to convert to ethylene via a/3- 
hydride elimination step at temperatures much 
lower than those required for the formation of 
ethylidyne [8,18-20]. Vinyl species, also made via 
thermal activation of its iodide, display a much 
more complex surface chemistry which involves 
the initial formation of a mixture of/~3-~/2-vinyli 
- 
dene and p3-~/2-acetylene (both moieties coordi- 
nated to several metal atoms via both a and

5.0L of 1,1-diiodoethane on Pt(lll), immediately following 
dosing at 100 K and after subsequent annealing to 150, 200, 
250 and 300 K. The signals at 1197 and 1371 cm -1 correspond 
to C-H deformation modes in the molecular diiodoethane, 
while that at 1339 cm -1 is assigned of the symmetric deforma- 
tion of methyl groups in ethylidyne. The inset displays the 
changes in the amount of ethyfidyne produced as a function of 
annealing temperature for low (2.0 L) and high (10.0 L) initial 
coverages of 1,1-diiodoethane. Two reactivity regimes are 
clearly distinguished here, one around 150 K favored at low 
coverages, and a second around room temperature which most 
probably involves the previous formation of ethylene, and 
which is preferred on saturated surfaces.

The interesting observation from these experiments 
is the fact that the peak at 1339 cm 
-1 associated 
with ethylidyne starts to grow around 150 K, a 
temperature well below that required to make 
ethylidyne from ethylene, ethyl or vinyl species. 
The chemistry of ethylidene is nevertheless compli- 
cated by the fact that variations in surface cover- 
ages induce significant changes in its kinetic 
behavior: after exposures above 2.0L 
(0= 
0.05 ML), additional ethylidyne is made around 
300 K, and no low-temperature conversion at all 
is seen after a 10.0 
L dose (Fig. 1, inset). These 
results highlight the fact that the availability of 
empty surface sites plays a key role in the kinetic 
of ethylidyne formation. 
The isothermal kinetics of the conversion of 
ethylene to ethylidyne was initially thought to 
follow a simple first-order behavior 1-23-26], but 
was later proven to display at least two different 
rate constants as the reaction progresses [27]. 
Furthermore, a scanning tunneling microscopy in 
situ characterization of this system has highlighted 
the fact that the reaction occurs preferentially at 
the edges of ethylene domains, indicating that 
special surface ensembles are needed for the conver- 
sion to proceed 1,28]. Finally, results from TPD 
experiments 
with 
the 
isotopically 
labelled 
CHD=CD2 ethylene argue for the need of an 
ethylene--ethylidene 
pre-equilibrium to precede the 
subsequent conversion to ethylidyne at high cover- 
ages [13]. All this is consistent with a mechanism 
in which ethylene always isomerizes to ethylidene 
prior to its conversion to ethylidyne, and where 
that first step is rate-limiting at low coverages but 
leads to an ethylene-ethylidene 
pre-equilibrium at 
coverages close to saturation because of the 
unavailability of empty sites, which poisons the

formation of partially deuterated ethylidyne [29]. 
However, extensive isotope scrambling is also 
observed when coadsorbing C2D, with H2, indicat- 
ing that the exchange most likely involves surface 
hydrogen. Fig. 2 shows the key RAIRS spectra 
that corroborate those observations. Additional 
TPD evidence also points to the idea that the 
detection of the observed H-D-exchanged ethyli- 
dyne is not necessarily connected with the reactions 
leading to its formation, but due to previous 
exchange on chemisorbed ethylene instead. The 
kinetics of H-D exchange in chemisorbed ethylene 
has been independently studied by laser-induced 
desorption isothermal kinetic experiments [30]. 
Those experiments have shown that there is sig- 
nificant H-D exchange reactivity at temperatures 
as low as 215 K, much lower than those required 
for ethylidyne formation, and that the reaction 
displays a complex kinetic behavior most probably 
associated with a limited diffusivity of hydrogen 
(deuterium) atoms on metal surfaces covered with 
hydrocarbon moieties.

4. H-D exchange in chemisorbed ethylene 
In the presence of surface deuterium, the conver- 
sion of ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt(111) is accom- 
panied by exchange of hydrogen for deuterium 
atoms. Indeed, infrared spectra obtained after 
coadsorbing C2H4 and C2D4 at 330 K reveal the 
Fig. 2. RAIRS spectra for the ethylidyne produced by adsorp- 
tion of 5.0 L of pure C2H+ (top), pure C2D4 (second from top), 
and a mixture of C2H+ and C2D+ (ratio C2H+: C~D4= 1:2.5) 
(third from top) on Pt(lll) under vacuum, and by adsorption 
of 5.0L of C2D4 in the presence of 5xl0-aTorr of Hz 
(bottom). All exposures were performed at 330 K. The peak at 
1247cm -1 seen in the two last spectra is due to partially 
deuterated cthylidyne, and is indicative of the occurrence of 
H-D exchange reactions.

The most likely mechanism for the H-D 
exchange in ethylene is one involving the formation 
of an ethyl intermediate [31,32]. This idea is quite 
reasonable, given that a similar pathway has been 
demonstrated in organometallic systems [17,33], 
and because ethyl, once formed, does undergo a 
clean and facile #-hydride elimination step back to 
ethylene on most surfaces studied to date 
[17,18,34,35]. H-D exchange between ethylidyne 
and surface hydrogen (or deuterium) does occur 
too, but at a much lower rate than ethylidyne 
formation [29,36]; the mechanism for that reaction 
has not yet been elucidated. 
5. Hydrogenation to ethane 
Finally, a small amount of ethane formation 
from self-hydrogenation is also seen in TPD experi- 
ments with ethylene on Pt(lll) under vacuum 
[32,37]. Isotope-labelling experiments have shown 
that this occurs in a stepwise fashion, via the slow 
formation of an ethyl intermediate [5,32], but 
there has been some discussion on the relevance 
of this mechanism to the catalytic ethylene hydro- 
genation process which occurs at higher pressures, 
since under those conditions the surface is covered 
almost completely with other hydrocarbon moie- 
ties [38]. In the initial surface science study that 
identified the presence of ethylidyne during the 
catalytic process, it was suggested that the surface 
moieties could act as hydrogen-transfer agents 
between the metal and ethylene molecules weakly 
adsorbed on a second layer [38], but later work 
has led to an alternative model in which ethylidyne 
acts just as a site blocker, and where ethylene 
hydrogenation still occurs via ethyl surface inter- 
mediates [39]. Distinguishing between these two 
ideas is particularly hard not only because it has 
not been possible to emulate the catalytic nature 
of the hydrogenation under vacuum, but also 
because the reaction probabilities per impinging 
molecule under most practical conditions are 
extremely low, on the order of 10 -4 or less, and 
this suggests a correspondingly small steady-state 
concentration of surface intermediates. 
We have recently performed some isothermal 
vacuum kinetic measurements on this system 
[11,40] which indicate that: (i) ethylidyne may 
indeed only poison the hydrogenation reaction. In 
fact, the rate for ethylene hydrogenation may be 
limited by the rate of ethylidyne removal, since 
that reaction would be required to open surface 
sites for the adsorption of both hydrogen and 
ethylene. (ii) Hydrogen adsorption is strongly 
inhibited by the presence of ethylene in the gas 
phase. The competitive adsorption of hydrogen 
does not occur under vacuum, even when gas 
mixtures with hydrogen-to-ethylene ratios as high 
as 1000:1 are used. This may explain the first- 
order dependence on hydrogen and the negative 
order on ethylene obtained for the rate law of 
ethylene hydrogenation in most catalytic cases 
[2,38]. (iii) Only a weakly, probably n-bonded, 
ethylene species (for which there is in fact some 
spectroscopic evidence of its presence during the 
catalytic process [41,42]) is active in ethylene 
hydrogenation. This is illustrated by the kinetic 
results displayed in Fig. 3, which displays the time 
evolution of the partial pressures of both ethylene 
and ethane during King and Wells-type experi-

Fig. 3. Isothermal kinetic data for the hydrogenation of 
ethylene at 250 K, as obtained by using a variation of the 
so-called King and Wells method where collimated beams of 
hydrogen+ethylene gas mixtures are impinged onto a clean 
Pt(lll) surface. Both the uptake of ethylene (C2H4) on the 
surface and the evolution of ethane (C2H6, the hydrogenation 
product) are shown here as a function of time for three different 
gas mixtures. The figure shows that ethane formation starts 
only after reaching ethylene coverages high enough to induce 
the transition from di-a to ~ bonding, and that an increase in 
hydrogen content in the impinging beam mixture exerts two 
main effects on the kinetics of the reaction, namely, an increase 
in both the hydrogenation rate and its yield, and an inhibition 
of the uptake of ethylene on the surface.

ments [ 10]. Collimated beams of mixtures of ethy- 
lene and hydrogen (where the flux of ethylene was 
fixed at F(C2H4)=0.05ML s -1 and that of 
hydrogen was varied between F(H2)=0.8 and 
15 ML s -1) were turned on around t= -10 s, but 
were kept away from the crystal until t=0, at 
which point the intercepting flag was removed and 
the gases were allowed to impinge directly onto 
the platinum surface. The drop in ethylene signal 
seen from that point on is proportional to the 
ethylene sticking coefficient on Pt(lll) (which 
initially is of the order of 0.8), while the increase 
in ethane partial pressure is proportional to the 
rate of ethylene hydrogenation. One fact that 
becomes immediately apparent from the data in 
Fig. 3 is that there is a delay between the beginning 
of the ethylene uptake on the surface and the start 
of ethane formation. In fact, the threshold for 
ethane production is seen at the point where the 
weakly adsorbed ethylene state starts to be popu- 
lated. Two other effects are highlighted by these 
results, namely: (i) that the rate for ethane forma- 
tion is higher and continues for a longer time when 
the hydrogen content in the beam is increased, and 
(ii) that the uptake of ethylene on the surface is 
inhibited by coadsorbed hydrogen as well. Finally, 
additional isotope-labelling experiments indicate 
that the transition from the strongly bonded di-tr 
state to the weaker rc interaction for ethylene is 
fast and reversible, occurs once a given surface 
coverage is reached, and may either be collective 
or take place via a fast displacement mechanism 
[41]. 
6. Conclusions 
The present paper summarizes the results from 
some of our most recent studies on the chemistry 
of ethylene on platinum surfaces. It is apparent 
from the brief review provided here that even 
though some progress has been made on the 
understanding of this chemistry at a molecular 
level, most of the key questions still remain unan- 
swered. At the present time we would suggest that 
the catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene most prob- 
ably occurs via the stepwise incorporation of 
hydrogen atoms into weakly adsorbed ethylene, to 
form initially ethyl moieties and ultimately ethane

(the same as under vacuum). This reaction is 
inhibited considerably by the competitive forma- 
tion of ethylidyne, since this last species is particu- 
larly stable and hard to rehydrogenate. The 
conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne is most likely 
a complex reaction, but it probably does not involve 
an ethyl intermediate, as the hydrogenation and 
H-D exchange processes, but an ethylidene moiety 
instead. All these ideas are illustrated schematically 
in Fig. 4. The other important observation to keep 
in mind from this work is the fact that the kinetics 
of the relevant surface reactions are greatly affected 
by both the coverages of the different surface 
species and the availability of surface free sites.
