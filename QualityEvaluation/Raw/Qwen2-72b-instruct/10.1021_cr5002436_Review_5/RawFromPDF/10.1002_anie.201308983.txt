Polymerization of Ethylene by Silica-Supported Dinuclear CrIII Sites through an Initiation Step Involving CH Bond Activation
Graphical Abstract
Three is better than two: CrIII silicates, in contrast to the CrII analogues, were found to be efficient ethylene-polymerization catalysts that initiate the reaction without a cocatalyst through the heterolytic splitting of an ethylene CH bond across a CrO bond (see picture). This study provides clues about the active sites and initiation mechanism of the industrial Phillips catalyst.
Abstract
The insertion of an olefin into a preformed metal–carbon bond is a common mechanism for transition-metal-catalyzed olefin polymerization. However, in one important industrial catalyst, the Phillips catalyst, a metal–carbon bond is not present in the precatalyst. The Phillips catalyst, CrO3 dispersed on silica, polymerizes ethylene without an activator. Despite 60 years of intensive research, the active sites and the way the first CrC bond is formed remain unknown. We synthesized well-defined dinuclear CrII and CrIII sites on silica. Whereas the CrII material was a poor polymerization catalyst, the CrIII material was active. Poisoning studies showed that about 65 % of the CrIII sites were active, a far higher proportion than typically observed for the Phillips catalyst. Examination of the spent catalyst and isotope labeling experiments showed the formation of a Si–(μ-OH)–CrIII species, consistent with an initiation mechanism involving the heterolytic activation of ethylene at CrIIIO bonds.
Olefin-insertion polymerization catalysts contain a metal–carbon (or a metal–hydride) bond and an open coordination site to accommodate incoming molecules of ethylene (Scheme 1, A). Coordination of ethylene forms the alkyl–ethylene complex B, which undergoes olefin insertion to give C. Growth of the polymer chain is a repetition of this step until chain transfer occurs. Chain transfer depends on the conditions and chosen catalyst, but generally takes place through β-hydride elimination, transmetalation to an alkyl aluminum species, hydrogenolysis, or through a direct β-proton transfer to a coordinated ethylene molecule.1 The metal product then reenters the catalytic cycle.

Generally accepted mechanism for ethylene polymerization by metal–alkyl complexes.
Generation of the catalytically active polymerization species containing the necessary metal–carbon bond, whether Ziegler–Natta catalysts or more well defined systems, requires the treatment of the precatalyst, typically a supported or ligated metal chloride, with alkyl aluminum reagents, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) or triethylaluminum.2 Alternatively, metal–alkyl derivatives are treated with a Lewis acid to abstract one of the alkyl groups to generate the active species.3
Exploitation of this general mechanism has led to a large family of catalysts that can polymerize olefins with control of the polymer molecular-weight distribution,4 incorporate long-chain branches,5 and stereoselectively polymerize α-olefins.6 This mechanism applies to “chain-shuttling” catalysis,7 surface-supported organometallic species,8 and cationic/neutral nickel9 and palladium10 complexes that can tolerate polar functionalities.11
The chromium-based Phillips catalyst seemingly defies this mechanism. This catalyst, discovered in 1951, currently accounts for 40–50 % of global linear high-density polyethylene (PE).12 The catalyst precursor is prepared by dispersing CrO3 on silica; exposure to ethylene forms a “reduced” chromium active site that polymerizes ethylene without a cocatalyst. The absence of a preformed CrC bond in this composition separates this class of catalysts from the family of olefin-insertion catalysts mentioned above.
Spectroscopic analysis of the Phillips catalyst involves multiple techniques (IR, UV/Vis, EPR, XAS, etc.) to obtain data about the surface Cr species.13 Since only about 10 % of the chromium present is active in polymerization,14 the spectroscopic information relates mostly to inactive sites. Due to this obstacle, even fundamental information about the Phillips catalyst, such as the active-site structure and the functional oxidation state, remain controversial. From spectroscopic studies, the major species observed in the reduced Phillips catalyst are isolated CrII sites, which are often interpreted as active species.15 Related empirical studies have shown that silica-supported CrIII salts are ethylene-polymerization catalysts.16 These complications limit the understanding of this catalyst. The grafting of inorganic chromium compounds17 or organometallic chromium complexes onto silica18 has also been investigated, although in each case access to isolated CrII or CrIII silicates was not possible owing to the incorporation of ligands around the metal center. Herein, we describe the formation and detailed characterization of silica-supported dinuclear CrII and CrIII sites. We found that the CrIII silicates are highly active, in contrast to the CrII analogues, and we propose that ethylene polymerization initiates through the heterolytic CH bond activation of ethylene on a CrO bond.
The ligand environment around the chromium center is critical for metal-silicate formation. We chose tri-tert-butoxysiloxy (OSi(OtBu)3) as a ligand for the coordination of chromium because these complexes are known to decompose at relatively low temperatures (ca. 200 °C) into silica materials through the loss of isobutene, tert-butanol, and water.19 We envisioned that the grafting of a hypothetical CrII complex containing only OSi(OtBu)3 ligands on silica dehydroxylated at 700 °C (ca. 0.8 SiOH nm−1), followed by thermal treatment, would yield well-defined CrII sites on the silica surface without additional ligands.
Cr{N(SiMe3)2}2⋅2 THF20 was treated with two equivalents of HOSi(OtBu)3 to give the blue crystalline CrII dimer [{Cr(OSi(OtBu)3)2}2] (1) in 60 % yield. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 in C6D6 contained a broad signal at δ=1.77 ppm (ν1/2=530 Hz, μeff=5.99 μB). Compound 1 crystallized as two independent molecules in the unit cell with similar bond lengths and angles; one of the molecules is shown in Scheme 2. Compound 1 contains two chromium atoms in distorted square-planar geometries, typical for high-spin CrII species. The Cr–Cr distance in 1 is 2.884(2) Å, which is outside the range for significant metal–metal bonding. The terminal Cr(2A)O(1A) and Cr(1A)O(4A) bonds have a length of 1.934(4) and 1.984(4) Å, respectively, similar to other chromium siloxide complexes.21 The bridging Cr–O(2A) and Cr–O(3A) distances are slightly longer than the terminal CrO bonds. Besides the terminal and bridging chromium–oxygen bonds in 1, two OSi(OtBu)3 ligands coordinate through a OtBu fragment to satisfy the distorted square-planar geometry; these distances are longer (2.109(4) and 2.167(4) Å, respectively).

Grafting of 1 on SiO2–700 to form [(≡SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2) and thermal decomposition under high vacuum to yield [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3). The solid-state structure obtained by X-ray diffraction for an independent molecule of 1 is shown at 50 % probability. Methyl groups of OSi(OtBu)3 ligands and H atoms have been removed for clarity.
When a blue solution of 1 in benzene was brought in contact with silica (Aerosil-200) partially dehydroxylated at 700 °C (0.26 mmol SiOH g−1), immediate blue coloration of the solid resulted. A combination of mass-balance (0.16 mmol SiOH g−1) and elemental analysis (0.31 mmol Cr g−1; 18 C atoms per Cr atom) was consistent with the presence of chromium dimers on the silica surface and indicated that [(≡SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2; Scheme 2) had formed. Thermal treatment of [(≡SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2) under high vacuum (10−5 mbar) yielded the blue solid [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3; Scheme 2). Analysis of the volatile products gave 3.6 equivalents of isobutene and 1.1 equivalents of tBuOH per Cr atom, which is close to the expected value of 4.5 C4 products per Cr atom. The infrared spectrum of this material lacked νCH bands but did contain new silanol vibrations. Exposure of [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3) to excess CO resulted in one νCO band at 2189 cm−1, thus indicating a rather narrow distribution of surface species. This particular vibration has been observed for the reduced Cr/SiO2 Phillips catalyst upon exposure to CO, although multiple other vibrations are also observed because many Cr sites are present in the Phillips catalyst.22
We performed XAS experiments at the Cr K-edge to gain deeper insight into the structure and oxidation state of the grafted species. X-ray absorption near-edge (XANES) spectra for the molecular precursor 1, [(≡SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2), and [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3) are shown in Figure 1. The XANES spectrum of the molecular species 1 is nearly identical to those of [(≡SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2) and [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3), thus indicating that the oxidation state and the local geometric structure of chromium in these materials is very similar to those in molecular precursor 1.

The results of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis of 1, [(≡SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2), and [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3) are summarized in Table 1. The Cr–O, Cr–Si, and Cr–Cr scattering paths used in our model correspond to the nearest neighbors present in 1. To reduce the number of variables, we used oxygen scattering paths corresponding to the average Cr–O distance in each species (Table 1). For 1, we compared the average Cr–O fit with a fit based on four independent oxygen scattering paths corresponding to the Cr–O distances in the crystal structure of 1. The quality of both fits (see the Supporting Information) was statistically similar. We used this approach for all structures, which explains the higher effective Debye–Waller factors for the O coordination shell (Table 1).

We anticipated that [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3) would initiate ethylene polymerization because this material contains CrII sites on silica. The polymerization activity of [(≡SiO)4Cr2] was monitored at a low ethylene pressure (ca. 300 mbar) in a glass reactor equipped with an IR cell. To accurately determine the polymerization activities, we used Sylopol-948, an amorphous silica support composed of particles that fragment when polymer is formed, to avoid mass-transfer limitations. [(≡SiO)4Cr2] has a low initial polymerization activity of 1.6 kg PE (mol Cr)−1 h−1. The addition of 4-methylpyridine (20 mol %) to this material resulted in negligible polymerization activity. Furthermore, the EPR spectrum of [(≡SiO)4Cr2] at 100 K contained a weak EPR signal that is characteristic CrIII, suggesting that the active sites on [(≡SiO)4Cr2] could arise from small amounts of CrIII. This result was surprising owing to the wealth of literature that has implicated CrII as the active site during polymerization catalysis.12, 15b, 23
The treatment of [(≡SiO)4Cr2] with N2O, as inspired by a recent report showing that N2O increases the ethylene-polymerization activity of the reduced Phillips catalyst,24 led to the formation of the CrIII dimer [(≡SiO)6Cr2] (4; Scheme 3 c). The Cr K-edge XANES spectrum of [(≡SiO)6Cr2] (Figure 1) was shifted relative to those of 1, [(≡SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2), and [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3). Also, a pre-edge feature at 5990–5992 eV appeared. Exposure of [(≡SiO)6Cr2] (4) to ethylene at 25 °C resulted in the rapid saturation of the νCH region in the IR spectrum and the formation of a white film on the pellet, thus indicating ethylene polymerization.

Although the XANES spectrum is consistent with the oxidation of [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3) by N2O to give [(≡SiO)6Cr2] (4), we confirmed this proposal by preparing the corresponding molecular analogue. Exposure of the CrII dimer 1 to N2O resulted in purple single crystals of 5 (Scheme 3 a,b). X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the two five-coordinate CrIII centers had different geometries: Cr(1) adopted a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal geometry, whereas the Cr(2) center had a square-pyramidal geometry typical of five-coordinate metal species. The Cr–Cr distance in 5 was 2.966(1) Å and thus slightly longer than in 1. Importantly, the Cr K-edge XANES spectrum of 5 contained similar edge and pre-edge features to those of [(≡SiO)6Cr2] (4). This result confirms that the chromium centers in [(≡SiO)6Cr2] are in the +3 oxidation state and have a similar coordination geometry to those in 5. The results of the EXAFS analysis of 5 and [(≡SiO)6Cr2] are given in Table 1 and show similar environments between the molecular and the surface species.
The [(≡SiO)6Cr2] surface species displayed an initial ethylene-polymerization activity of 19 kg PE (mol Cr)−1 h−1, roughly one order of magnitude higher than that found for [(≡SiO)4Cr2]. The higher activity of CrIII is not surprising in view of what has been shown in homogeneous catalysis.25 In a fixed-bed reactor at 70 °C under gas-phase polymerization conditions, the activity increased to 107 kg PE (mol Cr)−1 h−1 at an ethylene pressure of 6 bar. The polymer obtained under high-pressure conditions had a number-average molecular weight of Mn=5500 g mol−1, a weight-average molecular weight of Mw=52 000 g mol−1, and a dispersity Đ=Mw/Mn=9.4. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the polymer were consistent with linear polyethylene containing 1.5 branches per 1000 C atoms as well as olefin and methyl end groups. The broad polymer dispersity indicates multisite behavior. Despite the well-defined first coordination sphere in [(≡SiO)6Cr2] as established by XAS, there are probably small variations in the chromium environment as a result of the amorphous silica surface; these variations would impact the rate of polymerization and/or chain transfer.26
We also evaluated the number of active sites in [(≡SiO)6Cr2] by carrying out poisoning experiments with 4-methylpyridine (see the Supporting Information for details). The ethylene-polymerization activity, monitored by IR spectroscopy under a low ethylene pressure, decreased linearly with increasing amounts of catalyst poison. The estimated number of active sites present in [(≡SiO)6Cr2] on the basis of this method is at least 65 %. This result indicates that the surface chromium(III) sites in [(≡SiO)6Cr2], characterized by XANES and EXAFS, are related to the active sites.
[(≡SiO)6Cr2] exposed to ethylene contains some intriguing features. The XANES spectrum of [(≡SiO)6Cr2] exposed to ethylene is identical to that of pristine [(≡SiO)6Cr2]. The IR spectrum of this material contains the expected νCH and δCH vibrations associated with the polymer chain, and a vibration observed at 3692 cm−1 for surface silanols interacting with the polymer chain.27 Two new OH bands are also present: a major vibration at approximately 3605 cm−1 and a minor vibration at 3640 cm−1. These vibrations, which we assign to Si–(μ-OH)–CrIII interactions, are typical of SiOH groups interacting with an adjacent Lewis acidic metal center and are often observed for crystalline zeolitic materials.28 The formation of Si–(μ-OH)–CrIII interactions would arise from the CH activation of ethylene across a CrOSi bond. Consistent with this proposal, when [(≡SiO)6Cr2] was brought into contact with C2D4, an isotopically shifted Si–(μ-OD)–CrIII band was observed at 2580 cm−1 (expected at 2575 cm−1; see the Supporting Information).
From these results, we propose the following polymerization mechanism (Scheme 4): Polymerization is initiated through CH bond activation of ethylene across one of the CrO bonds in [(≡SiO)6Cr2] (4). This reaction results in the formation of a surface chromium(III) species 6 that contains a chromium–vinyl group, two anionic siloxides, and one SiOH group. The intermediate 6 can insert ethylene, and chain growth continues through a classical Cossee–Arlman insertion mechanism. Chain termination could be the microreverse of the initiation step, proton transfer from the coordinated silanol to the carbon atom bound to Cr, or through direct β-proton transfer to a coordinated ethylene to liberate a polymer chain containing olefinic and methyl end groups with regeneration of the neutral CrIII site.

Proposed mechanism for ethylene polymerization by [(≡SiO)6Cr2].
The key step in this mechanism is the heterolytic CH activation of ethylene, a process that conserves the oxidation state of chromium and is consistent with the XANES spectrum of [(≡SiO)6Cr2] exposed to ethylene. On metal-oxide surfaces, the activation of CH bonds often occurs heterolytically by σ-bond-metathesis-type mechanisms.29 Trivalent Lewis acid sites are particularly prone to activate CH bonds; for example, tricoordinate Al sites of highly dehydroxylated γ-Al2O3 activate methane and other hydrocarbons at low temperatures.30 Alkane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 or Ga/Zn-zeolite were also proposed to occur through CH activation and the formation of metal–alkyl surface species as key intermediates.29, 31
We have described the formation of isolated CrII and CrIII dinuclear surface species by a molecular approach. The well-defined CrII sites are not efficient olefin-polymerization catalysts, but CrIII sites do polymerize ethylene. Like the Phillips catalyst, these materials polymerize ethylene in the absence of alkyl aluminum cocatalysts or preformed CrC bonds. The formation of the first CrC bond, key to ethylene polymerization, occurs through heterolytic CH bond activation of ethylene on the CrIII silicates in [(≡SiO)6Cr2]. This mechanistic insight clearly distinguishes chromium-based catalysts from other olefin-insertion polymerization catalysts and opens new avenues for the manipulation of these materials to produce a wider range of polymer properties.

Olefin-insertion polymerization catalysts contain a metal–carbon (or a metal–hydride) bond and an open coordination site to accommodate incoming molecules of ethylene (Scheme 1, A). Coordination of ethylene forms the alkyl–ethylene complex B, which undergoes olefin insertion to give C. Growth of the polymer chain is a repetition of this step until chain transfer occurs. Chain transfer depends on the conditions and chosen catalyst, but generally takes place through β-hydride elimination, transmetalation to an alkyl aluminum species, hydrogenolysis, or through a direct β-proton transfer to a coordinated ethylene molecule.1 The metal product then reenters the catalytic cycle.

Generally accepted mechanism for ethylene polymerization by metal–alkyl complexes.
Generation of the catalytically active polymerization species containing the necessary metal–carbon bond, whether Ziegler–Natta catalysts or more well defined systems, requires the treatment of the precatalyst, typically a supported or ligated metal chloride, with alkyl aluminum reagents, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) or triethylaluminum.2 Alternatively, metal–alkyl derivatives are treated with a Lewis acid to abstract one of the alkyl groups to generate the active species.3
Exploitation of this general mechanism has led to a large family of catalysts that can polymerize olefins with control of the polymer molecular-weight distribution,4 incorporate long-chain branches,5 and stereoselectively polymerize α-olefins.6 This mechanism applies to “chain-shuttling” catalysis,7 surface-supported organometallic species,8 and cationic/neutral nickel9 and palladium10 complexes that can tolerate polar functionalities.11
The chromium-based Phillips catalyst seemingly defies this mechanism. This catalyst, discovered in 1951, currently accounts for 40–50 % of global linear high-density polyethylene (PE).12 The catalyst precursor is prepared by dispersing CrO3 on silica; exposure to ethylene forms a “reduced” chromium active site that polymerizes ethylene without a cocatalyst. The absence of a preformed CrC bond in this composition separates this class of catalysts from the family of olefin-insertion catalysts mentioned above.
Spectroscopic analysis of the Phillips catalyst involves multiple techniques (IR, UV/Vis, EPR, XAS, etc.) to obtain data about the surface Cr species.13 Since only about 10 % of the chromium present is active in polymerization,14 the spectroscopic information relates mostly to inactive sites. Due to this obstacle, even fundamental information about the Phillips catalyst, such as the active-site structure and the functional oxidation state, remain controversial. From spectroscopic studies, the major species observed in the reduced Phillips catalyst are isolated CrII sites, which are often interpreted as active species.15 Related empirical studies have shown that silica-supported CrIII salts are ethylene-polymerization catalysts.16 These complications limit the understanding of this catalyst. The grafting of inorganic chromium compounds17 or organometallic chromium complexes onto silica18 has also been investigated, although in each case access to isolated CrII or CrIII silicates was not possible owing to the incorporation of ligands around the metal center. Herein, we describe the formation and detailed characterization of silica-supported dinuclear CrII and CrIII sites. We found that the CrIII silicates are highly active, in contrast to the CrII analogues, and we propose that ethylene polymerization initiates through the heterolytic CH bond activation of ethylene on a CrO bond.
The ligand environment around the chromium center is critical for metal-silicate formation. We chose tri-tert-butoxysiloxy (OSi(OtBu)3) as a ligand for the coordination of chromium because these complexes are known to decompose at relatively low temperatures (ca. 200 °C) into silica materials through the loss of isobutene, tert-butanol, and water.19 We envisioned that the grafting of a hypothetical CrII complex containing only OSi(OtBu)3 ligands on silica dehydroxylated at 700 °C (ca. 0.8 SiOH nm−1), followed by thermal treatment, would yield well-defined CrII sites on the silica surface without additional ligands.
Cr{N(SiMe3)2}2⋅2 THF20 was treated with two equivalents of HOSi(OtBu)3 to give the blue crystalline CrII dimer [{Cr(OSi(OtBu)3)2}2] (1) in 60 % yield. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 in C6D6 contained a broad signal at δ=1.77 ppm (ν1/2=530 Hz, μeff=5.99 μB). Compound 1 crystallized as two independent molecules in the unit cell with similar bond lengths and angles; one of the molecules is shown in Scheme 2. Compound 1 contains two chromium atoms in distorted square-planar geometries, typical for high-spin CrII species. The Cr–Cr distance in 1 is 2.884(2) Å, which is outside the range for significant metal–metal bonding. The terminal Cr(2A)O(1A) and Cr(1A)O(4A) bonds have a length of 1.934(4) and 1.984(4) Å, respectively, similar to other chromium siloxide complexes.21 The bridging Cr–O(2A) and Cr–O(3A) distances are slightly longer than the terminal CrO bonds. Besides the terminal and bridging chromium–oxygen bonds in 1, two OSi(OtBu)3 ligands coordinate through a OtBu fragment to satisfy the distorted square-planar geometry; these distances are longer (2.109(4) and 2.167(4) Å, respectively).

When a blue solution of 1 in benzene was brought in contact with silica (Aerosil-200) partially dehydroxylated at 700 °C (0.26 mmol SiOH g−1), immediate blue coloration of the solid resulted. A combination of mass-balance (0.16 mmol SiOH g−1) and elemental analysis (0.31 mmol Cr g−1; 18 C atoms per Cr atom) was consistent with the presence of chromium dimers on the silica surface and indicated that [(≡SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2; Scheme 2) had formed. Thermal treatment of [(≡SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2) under high vacuum (10−5 mbar) yielded the blue solid [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3; Scheme 2). Analysis of the volatile products gave 3.6 equivalents of isobutene and 1.1 equivalents of tBuOH per Cr atom, which is close to the expected value of 4.5 C4 products per Cr atom. The infrared spectrum of this material lacked νCH bands but did contain new silanol vibrations. Exposure of [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3) to excess CO resulted in one νCO band at 2189 cm−1, thus indicating a rather narrow distribution of surface species. This particular vibration has been observed for the reduced Cr/SiO2 Phillips catalyst upon exposure to CO, although multiple other vibrations are also observed because many Cr sites are present in the Phillips catalyst.22
We performed XAS experiments at the Cr K-edge to gain deeper insight into the structure and oxidation state of the grafted species. X-ray absorption near-edge (XANES) spectra for the molecular precursor 1, [(≡SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2), and [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3) are shown in Figure 1. The XANES spectrum of the molecular species 1 is nearly identical to those of [(≡SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2) and [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3), thus indicating that the oxidation state and the local geometric structure of chromium in these materials is very similar to those in molecular precursor 1.

To reduce the number of variables, we used oxygen scattering paths corresponding to the average Cr–O distance in each species (Table 1). For 1, we compared the average Cr–O fit with a fit based on four independent oxygen scattering paths corresponding to the Cr–O distances in the crystal structure of 1. The quality of both fits (see the Supporting Information) was statistically similar. We used this approach for all structures, which explains the higher effective Debye–Waller factors for the O coordination shell (Table 1).

To accurately determine the polymerization activities, we used Sylopol-948, an amorphous silica support composed of particles that fragment when polymer is formed, to avoid mass-transfer limitations. [(≡SiO)4Cr2] has a low initial polymerization activity of 1.6 kg PE (mol Cr)−1 h−1. The addition of 4-methylpyridine (20 mol %) to this material resulted in negligible polymerization activity. Furthermore, the EPR spectrum of [(≡SiO)4Cr2] at 100 K contained a weak EPR signal that is characteristic CrIII, suggesting that the active sites on [(≡SiO)4Cr2] could arise from small amounts of CrIII. This result was surprising owing to the wealth of literature that has implicated CrII as the active site during polymerization catalysis.12, 15b, 23
The treatment of [(≡SiO)4Cr2] with N2O, as inspired by a recent report showing that N2O increases the ethylene-polymerization activity of the reduced Phillips catalyst,24 led to the formation of the CrIII dimer [(≡SiO)6Cr2] (4; Scheme 3 c). The Cr K-edge XANES spectrum of [(≡SiO)6Cr2] (Figure 1) was shifted relative to those of 1, [(≡SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2), and [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3). Also, a pre-edge feature at 5990–5992 eV appeared. Exposure of [(≡SiO)6Cr2] (4) to ethylene at 25 °C resulted in the rapid saturation of the νCH region in the IR spectrum and the formation of a white film on the pellet, thus indicating ethylene polymerization.

Although the XANES spectrum is consistent with the oxidation of [(≡SiO)4Cr2] (3) by N2O to give [(≡SiO)6Cr2] (4), we confirmed this proposal by preparing the corresponding molecular analogue. Exposure of the CrII dimer 1 to N2O resulted in purple single crystals of 5 (Scheme 3 a,b). X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the two five-coordinate CrIII centers had different geometries: Cr(1) adopted a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal geometry, whereas the Cr(2) center had a square-pyramidal geometry typical of five-coordinate metal species. The Cr–Cr distance in 5 was 2.966(1) Å and thus slightly longer than in 1. Importantly, the Cr K-edge XANES spectrum of 5 contained similar edge and pre-edge features to those of [(≡SiO)6Cr2] (4). This result confirms that the chromium centers in [(≡SiO)6Cr2] are in the +3 oxidation state and have a similar coordination geometry to those in 5. The results of the EXAFS analysis of 5 and [(≡SiO)6Cr2] are given in Table 1 and show similar environments between the molecular and the surface species.
The [(≡SiO)6Cr2] surface species displayed an initial ethylene-polymerization activity of 19 kg PE (mol Cr)−1 h−1, roughly one order of magnitude higher than that found for [(≡SiO)4Cr2]. The higher activity of CrIII is not surprising in view of what has been shown in homogeneous catalysis.25 In a fixed-bed reactor at 70 °C under gas-phase polymerization conditions, the activity increased to 107 kg PE (mol Cr)−1 h−1 at an ethylene pressure of 6 bar. The polymer obtained under high-pressure conditions had a number-average molecular weight of Mn=5500 g mol−1, a weight-average molecular weight of Mw=52 000 g mol−1, and a dispersity Đ=Mw/Mn=9.4. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the polymer were consistent with linear polyethylene containing 1.5 branches per 1000 C atoms as well as olefin and methyl end groups. The broad polymer dispersity indicates multisite behavior. Despite the well-defined first coordination sphere in [(≡SiO)6Cr2] as established by XAS, there are probably small variations in the chromium environment as a result of the amorphous silica surface; these variations would impact the rate of polymerization and/or chain transfer.26
We also evaluated the number of active sites in [(≡SiO)6Cr2] by carrying out poisoning experiments with 4-methylpyridine (see the Supporting Information for details). The ethylene-polymerization activity, monitored by IR spectroscopy under a low ethylene pressure, decreased linearly with increasing amounts of catalyst poison. The estimated number of active sites present in [(≡SiO)6Cr2] on the basis of this method is at least 65 %. This result indicates that the surface chromium(III) sites in [(≡SiO)6Cr2], characterized by XANES and EXAFS, are related to the active sites.
[(≡SiO)6Cr2] exposed to ethylene contains some intriguing features. The XANES spectrum of [(≡SiO)6Cr2] exposed to ethylene is identical to that of pristine [(≡SiO)6Cr2]. The IR spectrum of this material contains the expected νCH and δCH vibrations associated with the polymer chain, and a vibration observed at 3692 cm−1 for surface silanols interacting with the polymer chain.27 Two new OH bands are also present: a major vibration at approximately 3605 cm−1 and a minor vibration at 3640 cm−1. These vibrations, which we assign to Si–(μ-OH)–CrIII interactions, are typical of SiOH groups interacting with an adjacent Lewis acidic metal center and are often observed for crystalline zeolitic materials.28 The formation of Si–(μ-OH)–CrIII interactions would arise from the CH activation of ethylene across a CrOSi bond. Consistent with this proposal, when [(≡SiO)6Cr2] was brought into contact with C2D4, an isotopically shifted Si–(μ-OD)–CrIII band was observed at 2580 cm−1 (expected at 2575 cm−1; see the Supporting Information).
From these results, we propose the following polymerization mechanism (Scheme 4): Polymerization is initiated through CH bond activation of ethylene across one of the CrO bonds in [(≡SiO)6Cr2] (4). This reaction results in the formation of a surface chromium(III) species 6 that contains a chromium–vinyl group, two anionic siloxides, and one SiOH group. The intermediate 6 can insert ethylene, and chain growth continues through a classical Cossee–Arlman insertion mechanism. Chain termination could be the microreverse of the initiation step, proton transfer from the coordinated silanol to the carbon atom bound to Cr, or through direct β-proton transfer to a coordinated ethylene to liberate a polymer chain containing olefinic and methyl end groups with regeneration of the neutral CrIII site.

Proposed mechanism for ethylene polymerization by [(≡SiO)6Cr2].
The key step in this mechanism is the heterolytic CH activation of ethylene, a process that conserves the oxidation state of chromium and is consistent with the XANES spectrum of [(≡SiO)6Cr2] exposed to ethylene. On metal-oxide surfaces, the activation of CH bonds often occurs heterolytically by σ-bond-metathesis-type mechanisms.29 Trivalent Lewis acid sites are particularly prone to activate CH bonds; for example, tricoordinate Al sites of highly dehydroxylated γ-Al2O3 activate methane and other hydrocarbons at low temperatures.30 Alkane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 or Ga/Zn-zeolite were also proposed to occur through CH activation and the formation of metal–alkyl surface species as key intermediates.29, 31
We have described the formation of isolated CrII and CrIII dinuclear surface species by a molecular approach. The well-defined CrII sites are not efficient olefin-polymerization catalysts, but CrIII sites do polymerize ethylene. Like the Phillips catalyst, these materials polymerize ethylene in the absence of alkyl aluminum cocatalysts or preformed CrC bonds. The formation of the first CrC bond, key to ethylene polymerization, occurs through heterolytic CH bond activation of ethylene on the CrIII silicates in [(≡SiO)6Cr2]. This mechanistic insight clearly distinguishes chromium-based catalysts from other olefin-insertion polymerization catalysts and opens new avenues for the manipulation of these materials to produce a wider range of polymer properties.
