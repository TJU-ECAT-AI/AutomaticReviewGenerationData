Abstract
The performances of zirconia-, alumina-, and zirconia/alumina-supported chromia catalysts were investigated in the dehydrogenation of
isobutane in order to elucidate the role of the support material in the dehydrogenation reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction was studied by
activity measurements and by experiments using in situ diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and in situ Raman
spectroscopy. Zirconia was deposited on alumina to clarify if it is possible to combine the beneﬁcial properties of the industrially used chromia/
alumina catalysts with those of the more active chromia/zirconia. Zirconia deposition on alumina decreased the Lewis acidity of the support and the
coke formation rate during the dehydrogenation. The dehydrogenation activities of the supports were low. Deposition of chromium (1–2 atCr/nm2)
increased the activity for all catalysts. The chromia/zirconia catalyst had the highest activity, whereas the use of zirconia/alumina support decreased
the activity. The coke deposition rate increased with increasing dehydrogenation activity. The results suggested that the Lewis acidity alone is not
important for the activity of the chromia-containing catalysts, but the phase of zirconia might have an inﬂuence.

1. Introduction
Catalytic dehydrogenation with chromia/alumina is an
industrially important route for producing light alkenes [1].
This system has been extensively studied during the past
decades [2–7]. The activity of the chromia dehydrogenation
catalysts can be enhanced, e.g. by adding alkali dopants [8], or
by the use of zirconia as the support material [9]. Zirconia,
however, despite its beneﬁcial inﬂuence on the dehydrogena-
tion activity, suffers from a low surface area. Therefore,
zirconia has been deposited on high surface area oxides such as
alumina to prepare zirconia supports with high surface area
[10–15].
The surface composition and characteristics of zirconia/
alumina have been studied to some extent. Zirconia has been
deposited on alumina by impregnation from solution [10–
12,14], and by atomic layer deposition (ALD) [13], which was
previously known as atomic layer epitaxy (ALE). Pure, bulk
zirconia exhibits three well-deﬁned crystal phases of which the
monoclinic phase (stable below 1100 8C [16]) is commonly
used for, e.g. catalytic applications. The monoclinic phase
transforms into the tetragonal (stable below 2400 8C) and the
cubic (stable below the melting point of 2670 8C) phases with
increasing temperature [16].
The monolayer capacity of zirconia on alumina (calculated
based on the surface area of the support) has been estimated to
be 4–5 atZr/nm2 [13] or even 7.4 atZr/nm2 [12]. Below the
monolayer coverage zirconia is amorphous, whereas at higher
loadings nano-sized tetragonal zirconia crystallites or islands of
these crystallites are formed [10,13,14]. Especially at low
loadings, zirconia has also been suspected to migrate into the
alumina matrix forming a mixed oxide [10–12]. Earlier, we

have investigated by methanol adsorption–desorption experi-
ments [17] the Lewis acidic, redox, and basic characteristics of
zirconia/alumina-supported chromia catalysts in comparison
with the zirconia- and alumina-supported catalysts. The results
suggested a strong interaction between the deposited zirconia
and the support alumina, although the formation of a mixed
oxide
was
not
observed.
Furthermore,
zirconia/alumina
behaved more like alumina than zirconia.
The possible oxidation states of chromium on inorganic
oxides are +2, +3, +5, and +6, but their occurrence depends on
the catalyst preparation and pretreatment conditions, and the
chromium content [3]. The monolayer coverage of chromium
on alumina is approximately 4–5 atCr/nm2 [1,4,5]. On zirconia
the monolayer coverage has been estimated to be 5 atCr/nm2 [9]
or even 9 atCr/nm2 [4]. Cr6+ species dominate on alumina under
oxidizing conditions at low surface densities of chromium (up
to 0.5 atCr/nm2), and traces of Cr5+ (1–2% of total chromium
[9]) can also be detected. On zirconia comparable amounts of
Cr5+ (50% of total chromium) and Cr6+ are present at low
surface densities [9]. At low surface densities the chromium
species are mainly monochromates [1]. At an intermediate
coverage Cr3+ species are also present and the fraction of
polychromates increases with increasing coverage [1,9]. Above
the monolayer coverage on both oxides crystalline a-Cr2O3 is
formed and the main oxidation state is +3, but Cr6+ species are
also present [1,9].
On alumina the high oxidation state species reduce in the
presence of alkanes, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide to
produce Cr3+ and possibly some Cr2+ [1,6,7]. According to De
Rossi et al. [9] on zirconia the Cr6+ and Cr5+ species reduce
under carbon monoxide to Cr2+ and Cr3+ species, respectively.
The catalytically active species in the dehydrogenation reaction
on chromia/alumina and chromia/zirconia are the Cr3+ species
available to the alkane molecules [1,3,6,7,9]. De Rossi et al. [9]
assigned the higher dehydrogenation activity of chromia/
zirconia compared with chromia/alumina to the high concen-
tration of mononuclear Cr5+ species that reduce under reaction
conditions to form mononuclear Cr3+ species. However, for
chromia/alumina the dehydrogenation activity is insensitive to
the size of the Cr3+ species and their redox history [7].
The catalytic performance of zirconia/alumina-supported
catalysts has been investigated in the reforming reaction of
methane with carbon dioxide [14], in the dehydrogenation of
isobutane [15], and in the combustion of methane and in the
reduction of nitrogen oxide [18]. Souza et al. [14] observed an
increase
in
the
reforming
activity
of
zirconia/alumina-
supported platinum catalysts in comparison to zirconia- and,
especially, alumina-supported ones. The zirconia/alumina
catalysts showed a high activity in a wide temperature range,
whereas the alumina- and zirconia-supported catalysts were
only active either at low or at high temperature, respectively. In
addition, the zirconia/alumina catalysts had a similar, high
resistance to coke formation as the zirconia-supported catalyst
had. Gaspar and Dieguez [15] observed a slight increase in the
activity of a chromia catalyst in the dehydrogenation of
isobutane when using zirconia/alumina as the support material
instead of alumina. However, Burch and Loader [18] observed a
lower activity for the zirconia/alumina-supported rhodium
catalysts in the combustion of methane and in the reduction of
nitrogen oxide compared with zirconia- or alumina-supported
ones, respectively. According to them this was due to the
incomplete monolayer of zirconia on alumina that interfered
but not fully prevented the interaction of rhodium with alumina
on these catalysts modifying the active surface species.
In the present study the activity and behavior of chromia/
zirconia/alumina catalysts is compared with that of both
chromia/alumina and chromia/zirconia. The aim of this study
was to elucidate the role of the support material in the
dehydrogenation reaction. The catalysts were studied by in situ
DRIFTS
and
in
situ
Raman
spectroscopy
which
give
information on the surface species formed under reaction
conditions. Earlier obtained acid–base properties [17] and the
surface species formed under isobutane were correlated with
activity results. The chromia catalysts and the zirconia/alumina
supports were prepared by ALD, where the deposition occurs
through self-terminating and saturating gas–solid reactions
ensuring a high dispersion and homogeneity of the material
[13,19]. Thereby, the samples were more homogenous and
similar surface chromium densities were present independent
of the support material enabling the conclusions on the role of
the support material on the dehydrogenation performance.

where x is the amount of chromium in wt.%, y is the amount of
zirconium in wt.%, and Z is the support (Zr for zirconia, Al for
alumina, or ZrAl for zirconia/alumina). The preparation and
some of the characterizations of the catalysts are described in
detail in our earlier publication [17].
Commercial zirconia (Mel Chemicals EC 0100 1/8 in) and
alumina (Akzo 000-1.5 E, g-alumina) supports were used in the
study. The supports were calcined in air before use at 600 8C for
16 h. The zirconia/alumina supports were prepared by ALD
using ZrCl4 (Fluka 98%) as the zirconium precursor. During the
preparation the precursor reacts with the surface species of the
support forming a complex that still contains some of the
chlorine
ligands
[13,19].
The
surface
complexes
were
decomposed to form zirconia by using water vapour at elevated
temperature. Two zirconia/alumina supports were prepared
using one or ﬁve sequences of complex formation and water
vapour treatment. The supports contained zirconium either
below, or approximately equal to the monolayer coverage of
4 atZr/nm2 [13]. The zirconia/alumina supports were calcined
in air at 600 8C for 16 h. The ALD preparation of zirconia/
alumina is described in more detail by Kyto
¨kivi et al. [13].
ALD was also used to deposit the chromia precursor
(chromium acetyl acetonate, Cr(acac)3, Riedel-de Hae
¨n 99%)
on the zirconia, alumina, and zirconia/alumina supports. The
chromia deposition technique is similar to the technique used
for zirconia deposition [7]. After the Cr(acac)3 deposition the
surface acac complexes were decomposed to form the
chromium oxide by using air at elevated temperature. Two
sequences of complex formation and decomposition were used
to prepare chromia catalysts containing 1–2 atCr/nm2. The
catalysts were calcined in air at 600 8C for 4 h.
The surface area and porosity of the catalysts were
determined by the BET method [17]. The amounts of chromium
and zirconium were determined by X-ray ﬂuorescence (XRF).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the
surface composition of the calcined catalysts [17]. The amount
of Cr6+ on the calcined catalysts was analyzed by UV–vis
spectrophotometry (UV-Shimadzu, l = 375 nm) after dissolu-
tion of Cr6+ by aqueous sodium hydroxide. The method is
described in detail by Haukka [20].
2.2. Isobutane dehydrogenation activity measurements
The isobutane dehydrogenation activities of the catalysts
were measured in a continuous ﬂow reaction system consisting
of a ﬁxed-bed microreactor, and a Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) gas analyzer and a gas chromatograph (GC) for on-line
product analysis. All gases were from AGA (synthetic air
99.99%, nitrogen 99.999%, isobutane 99.95%, and hydrogen
99.999%). Nitrogen was further puriﬁed with Oxisorb (Messer
Griesheim GmbH).
The activity measurements were carried out at 560 8C under
atmospheric pressure. The samples (0.1 g) were loaded in the
reactor between two layers of silicon carbide (SiC) and were
heated
to
the
reaction
temperature
under
5%
O2/N2.
Dehydrogenation was carried out for 15 min using isobutane
feed with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 15 h1 and
diluted with nitrogen at a molar ratio of 3:7. The reaction
products were monitored by FTIR for the ﬁrst 6 min on stream,
a GC sample was taken after 10 min, and the FTIR analysis was
continued after this. After the dehydrogenation, the catalyst
was regenerated with diluted air. The regeneration products –
carbon oxides and water – were analyzed by FTIR. The amount
of
coke
(as
carbon)
deposited
on
the
catalyst
during
dehydrogenation was calculated from the measured amounts
of carbon oxides. The amount of water formed was indicative of
the amount of hydrogen in the coke. In selected experiments the
catalyst was prereduced with 10% H2/N2 for 15 min before the
dehydrogenation. Water formed in the prereduction was
analyzed by FTIR. Thermal reactions in the system were
investigated by replacing the catalyst with inert SiC.
The gaseous products were analyzed on-line with a Gasmet
FTIR gas analyzer (Gasmet Technologies) equipped with a
Peltier-cooled mercury–cadmium–telluride detector, and with
an HP 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with an HP PLOT/
Al2O3 ‘‘M’’ column and a ﬂame ionization detector. The FTIR
spectra were recorded in the wavenumber range 4000–
850 cm1 with a resolution of 8 cm1 and a scanning rate of
10 scans/s. The analysis cuvette (9 cm3) was kept at constant
temperature (180 8C) and pressure (103 kPa). The spectra were
measured every 2 s during the ﬁrst 2 min on stream, every 5 s
during the next 2 min, and thereafter every 30 or 60 s. Further
details of the FTIR gas analysis method, and of the
determination of the product distribution based on the measured
spectra can be found elsewhere [21,22]. The conversions,
selectivities, and yields were calculated on a molar basis as
presented in [21].
2.3. In situ DRIFTS
In situ DRIFTS was used to characterize the calcined
catalysts and to study the formation of surface species during
isobutane dehydrogenation. The equipment consisted of a
Nicolet Nexus FTIR spectrometer equipped with a Spectra-
Tech high temperature and high pressure reaction chamber
(ZnSe windows). A Pfeiffer Vacuums Omnistar mass spectro-
meter (MS) was used to monitor the gaseous products on-line.
All samples were studied undiluted in powder form and
calcined in situ with 10% O2/N2 at 580 8C for 2 h. In all
experiments the spectrum measured with an aluminum mirror
(4 cm1, 200 scans) was used as the background, and the total
gas ﬂow was kept constant at 50 cm3/min. All gases were from
AGA (synthetic air 99.99%, N2 99.999%, isobutane 99.95%,
and H2 99.999%). Nitrogen was further puriﬁed with Oxisorb
(Messer Griesheim GmbH).
The performance of the catalysts in dehydrogenation of
isobutane was studied with two different approaches. The
experiments
were
performed
either
as
(i)
temperature-
dependent, where the catalysts were heated slowly in 5%
isobutane in nitrogen from room temperature to 580 8C, or as
(ii)
time-dependent
studies,
where
the
dehydrogenation
performance of the catalysts was studied at the constant
temperature of 580 8C under 5% isobutane in nitrogen. During
the temperature-dependent measurement the spectra were ﬁrst
S.T. Korhonen et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 333 (2007) 30–41
32
recorded at 30, 50, 75, and 100 8C (4 cm1, 100 scans), after
which the sample was ﬂushed with nitrogen for 5 min at
100 8C. After the ﬂush, a spectrum (4 cm1, 100 scans) was
recorded under nitrogen at 100 8C. The experiment was
continued by redirecting the isobutane ﬂow to the sample and
by heating slowly. The spectra were recorded every 25 8C under
isobutane and at 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 580 8C under
nitrogen. During the time-dependent measurements at 580 8C
the dehydrogenation performance was studied by feeding
isobutane for 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, and 10 min (total 30 min) to the
sample with 5 min nitrogen ﬂushes in between the isobutane
sequences. Spectra were recorded every minute (4 cm1, 30
scans). The samples were reoxidized at 580 8C after the
experiments with 2–10% O2/N2 for 30 min.
The effect of hydrogen prereduction (5% H2/N2) was studied
with both temperature- and time-dependent measurements. The
prereduction was done at 580 8C for 15 min during which
spectra were recorded every minute (4 cm1, 30 scans) for the
ﬁrst 8 min on stream and then once after 9 and 12 min (4 cm1,
100 scans). After the prereduction the sample was either ﬂushed
with nitrogen for 10 min at 580 8C after which it was cooled to
room temperature under nitrogen followed by the temperature-
dependent isobutane experiment, or it was ﬂushed with nitrogen
for
30 min
at
580 8C
followed
by
the
time-dependent
measurement.
2.4. In situ Raman spectroscopy
The in situ Raman–MS measurements were performed to
study the chromium and hydrocarbon surface species formed
during dehydrogenation on the chromia catalysts at the constant
temperature of 570 8C. The measurements were performed
with a Renishaw Micro-Raman System-1000 using a home-
made quartz ﬂow-through reactor (operando reactor [23]) and a
MS for on-line product analysis. The Raman spectrometer
consisted of an Ar+ (514 nm) laser, a cooled CCD detector, and
a holographic super-Notch ﬁlter for the removal of elastic
scattering. The catalyst sample was loaded to the reactor
between two layers of silicon carbide to minimize the void
volume inside the reactor. The catalyst samples were calcined
using 5% O2/He at 570 8C for 2 h after which the reactor was
ﬂushed with helium for 30 min before the experiments. The
dehydrogenation measurements were performed at 570 8C by
feeding 5% isobutane in nitrogen to the sample. The spectra
were recorded after 2, 12, 22, and 32 min on stream under
isobutane. The acquisition of one spectrum required 9 min.
After the dehydrogenation, the samples were ﬂushed with
helium for 30 min and reoxidized using 5% O2/He for 30 min.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of the catalysts
Table 1 presents the surface areas and elemental composi-
tion of the samples measured by BET and XRF, respectively
[17]. The characterization and surface composition of the
zirconia-, alumina-, and zirconia/alumina-supported chromia
catalysts has been reported in detail elsewhere [17]. Therefore,
only a short summary will be given here. The zirconia/alumina
supports had a zirconium surface density either below, or
approximately equal to the monolayer coverage of 4 atZr/nm2.
Their surface area was in the same order of magnitude as that of
alumina, whereas the surface area of pure zirconia was one-
third of that. No crystalline zirconia was observed by Raman
spectroscopy for the zirconia/alumina supports, whereas the
pure zirconia was mainly monoclinic. No indication of the
formation of a mixed oxide was observed by XPS [17].
Methanol adsorption–desorption experiments suggested a
strong interaction between zirconia and alumina for these
supports [17].
The hydroxyl groups for the zirconia/alumina support
resembled more those of alumina than those of zirconia.
Damyanova et al. [10] and Kyto
¨kivi et al. [13] also reported that
the hydroxyls for zirconia/alumina did not resemble those of
zirconia even at zirconia loadings near the monolayer coverage.
Pyridine adsorption measurements on zirconia/alumina have
shown that the deposition of zirconia reduces the concentration
of strong Lewis acidic sites, whereas the concentration of weak
Lewis acidic sites increases [10]. In our methanol adsorption–
desorption
measurements
[17],
where
the
formation of
dimethylether (DME) was indicative of surface Lewis acid
species, the strength of Lewis acidity was highest for pure
alumina. The deposition of zirconia on alumina decreased the
Lewis acidity of the support. DME was not formed on pure
zirconia.
The chromium surface density for the catalysts was 1–2 atCr/
nm2, which is below the monolayer coverage of 4–5 atCr/nm2.
No crystalline a-Cr2O3 was observed for the catalysts by
Raman spectroscopy [17]. The Raman spectroscopic measure-
ments showed that the chromates for the calcined catalysts were
polychromates [17]. Table 1 presents the UV–vis results on the
amount of Cr6+ species for the calcined catalysts. In agreement
with our earlier XPS results [17], a higher fraction of chromium
was in the oxidation state +6 than in the oxidation state +3 on
the calcined catalysts. However, the UV–vis measurement
technique for the quantiﬁcation of Cr6+ species is more accurate
for the chromia/alumina catalyst than for the chromia/zirconia
catalyst due to the higher fraction of Cr5+ species present on the
zirconia support. Cr5+ species are not stable in aqueous
solutions and tend to disproportionate (3Cr5+ ! 2Cr6+ + Cr3+)
into soluble Cr6+ and ﬁnely dispersed, surface bound Cr3+
hydroxide [9]. It is suggested that the oxidation state
distribution of the chromia species on zirconia/alumina
resembled more that of the alumina-supported catalyst than
the zirconia-supported one.
3.2. Activity measurements
Isobutane dehydrogenation activities were measured for the
chromia catalysts described in Table 1, and for the 4.4ZrAl,
alumina, and zirconia supports. Fig. 1 shows the yields of
isobutene
and
cracking
products
(C1–C3
hydrocarbons)
obtained with the supports and in thermal reactions investigated
with inert silicon carbide. No reduction products (carbon oxides
S.T. Korhonen et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 333 (2007) 30–41
33
or water) were released from the supports. The dehydrogena-
tion and cracking activities were similar for the 4.4ZrAl and
alumina supports, whereas the zirconia support had a higher
dehydrogenation activity but the cracking products were
mainly formed in thermal reactions.
The isobutane dehydrogenation activities of the supported
chromia catalysts were measured after calcination and after
prereduction by hydrogen. The calcined catalysts were reduced
during the ﬁrst minute(s) on isobutane stream or on hydrogen
stream seen as a release of carbon oxides or water, respectively.
Based on the amount of the reduction products and the amount
of Cr6+ on the calcined catalysts, the average oxidation state of
chromium for the 2.1(15)CrZrAl and the 2.2CrAl was +3 after
the reductions. For the 0.8CrZr catalyst this calculation was not
accurate due to the uncertainty in the amount of Cr6+ and Cr5+
for the calcined catalyst. Fig. 2 shows the yield of isobutene
obtained during dehydrogenation. After calcination, the two
chromia/zirconia/alumina catalysts had lower dehydrogenation
activities than the 0.8CrZr and 2.2CrAl catalysts had. The
yields of cracking products were the same with a catalyst or
with inert silicon carbide, indicating that cracking was mainly a
thermal reaction. The yield of cracking products for the
2.0(4.4)CrZrAl catalyst was slightly higher than for the other
chromia catalysts, but the difference was not signiﬁcant.
Prereduction of the catalysts by hydrogen decreased the
dehydrogenation activities, the decrease being the most
apparent for the alumina- and zirconia/alumina-supported
samples.
Fig. 3 summarizes the dehydrogenation activities of the
calcined supports and catalysts and the coke contents after
dehydrogenation. The isobutene yields were measured at 2 min
on stream, at which time the catalysts were reduced but had not
yet severely deactivated. The yields of cracking products were
calculated as an average over 10 measurement points between 2
and 3 min on isobutane stream. The coke content after
dehydrogenation was lower on the 4.4ZrAl support than on
the alumina support, although their activities were similar. The
coke content was low also on the zirconia support, even though
it had the highest dehydrogenation activity. On the contrary, for
the chromia catalysts the coke content was lower on the
alumina- and zirconia/alumina-supported catalysts than on the
0.8CrZr catalyst. In addition, the hydrogen content for the coke
on the 0.8CrZr catalyst was lower than for the alumina-
containing catalysts; the approximate H/C ratios were 0.2, 0.6,
and 0.8 for the 0.8CrZr, 2.1(15)CrZrAl, and 2.2CrAl catalysts,
respectively (not shown). For the prereduced catalysts the
amount of coke deposited decreased in accordance with the
decreased activity.

3.3. In situ DRIFTS
3.3.1. Temperature-dependent measurements
The temperature-dependent measurements were performed
for all chromia catalysts, and for the 4.4ZrAl, zirconia, and
alumina supports to study the formation and stability of the
different carbonaceous surface species on the catalysts, and
their relevance to the dehydrogenation. Fig. 4 presents as an
example spectra measured for the 2.0(4.4)CrZrAl catalyst
during the temperature-dependent measurement. The spectra
were
recorded
during
nitrogen
ﬂushes
to
increase
the
observability of the bands of the surface species in the C–H
stretching region.
Table 2 presents a summary of the observed bands and their
assignments for the catalysts. The strong band at 2340 cm1
observed for all of the samples is assigned to carbon dioxide
impurities inside the support [24]. For the zirconia/alumina-
and alumina-supported catalysts the formation of water
(1630 cm1) and acetone (1680 (n(CO) and 1248 cm1
[25])) was less pronounced than for the zirconia-supported
catalyst. At 100 8C also a band at 2980 cm1 was observed
for all catalysts. This band is tentatively assigned to a n(CH3)
vibration of a tert-butoxide species [26]. Starting from 200 8C
the formation of formates was observed for all catalysts from
the bands around 2975 (nas(COO) + ns(COO)), 2880 (n(CH)),
2750 (ns(COO) + d(CH)), 1562 (nas(COO)), 1380 (d(CH)),
1365 (ns(COO)), and 1350 cm1 [25,27,28]. The formate bands
reached their maximum intensities around 400 8C. Around
325 8C the chromates were observed to reduce as the Cr6+ = O
[4] bands at 2000 cm1 disappeared from the spectra.
Simultaneously with the decrease in the intensity of the bands
of the formate species, bands assigned to carboxylate-type
species, also assigned to acetates by Finocchio et al. [27], were
observed at 1530 (nas(COO)), 1430 (ns(COO)), and
1350 cm1.
Approximately at 400 8C bands assigned to adsorbed
isobutene [29] (3103, 1638, 1472, and 1239 cm1) were
observed for the 0.8CrZr catalyst. Bands at 3102 cm1, and at
3106 and 1242 cm1 were also observed for the 2.0(4.4)CrZrAl
and the 2.1(15)CrZrAl catalysts, respectively. However, these
were lower in intensity and appeared at slightly higher
temperature than for the 0.8CrZr catalyst. The formation of
dehydrogenation products (hydrogen and isobutene) was
observed by MS approximately at the same temperature as
the bands of adsorbed isobutene and, therefore, the appearance
of adsorbed isobutene can be linked with the start of the
dehydrogenation reaction.
At the highest temperature studied (580 8C) bands of the
carboxylate-type species and of aliphatic [30,31] (2980 and
2940 cm1) and unsaturated/aromatic [26,30] (3060 cm1)
hydrocarbons were observed for the alumina-containing
catalysts. The band at 2940 cm1 is assigned to a nas(CH)
vibration of a methylene-type (>CH2) group, whereas the band

at 2980 cm1 could originate from a nas(CH) vibration of a
methyl-type (–CH3) group. The band at 2980 cm1 dis-
appeared from the spectra of the 0.8CrZr catalyst above 500 8C,
after which the carboxylate-type and unsaturated/aromatic
species, and a methylene-type vibration were observed.
The temperature-dependent measurements were also done
after hydrogen prereduction. Fig. 5 presents as an example
spectra measured for the prereduced 2.0(4.4)CrZrAl sample.
The spectra were recorded under nitrogen as described earlier.
After prereduction the formation of water, acetone, and
formates was suppressed. This suggests that the formation of
these species required interaction of the gas phase with the Cr6+
species, or that the hydrogen prereduction was able to suppress
their formation, e.g. by inhibiting the adsorption of isobutane at
low temperatures. At 100 8C the only band arising from the
surface bound carbonaceous species for all catalysts was
observed at 2980 cm1, and was assigned to tert-butoxide as
discussed previously. This band was lower in intensity for the
prereduced catalysts than for the calcined ones. For the
alumina-containing catalysts this band disappeared with
heating and no bands of carbonaceous surface species were
observed at 200 8C. For the 0.8CrZr at 200 8C low intensity
bands assigned to the carboxylate-type species were observed.
For the alumina-containing catalysts these species were
observed starting at approximately 300 8C.
Approximately at 300 8C low intensity bands assigned to the
formates were observed for the 0.8CrZr at 2880, 1570, and
1370 cm1, but these bands were only observable up to
400 8C. For the 0.8CrZr catalyst the bands of adsorbed
isobutene were observed as during the experiment for the
calcined sample. For the zirconia/alumina- and alumina-
supported catalysts these bands were not observed. At the
highest temperature studied (580 8C) the bands assigned to the
aliphatic and carboxylate-type species were observed at 2980,
2940, and at 1530, 1430 cm1, respectively, for the
zirconia/alumina- and alumina-supported catalysts, whereas for
the zirconia-supported catalyst the formation of unsaturated/
aromatic species (3060 cm1) was observed in addition to the

bands of the carboxylate-type and aliphatic species. In
accordance with the experiment for the calcined 0.8CrZr the
band at 2980 cm1 was only observable up to 500 8C. The
prereduction seems to suppress the formation of all carbonac-
eous surface species for the zirconia/alumina- and alumina-
supported catalysts, whereas for the zirconia-supported one
only the formation of acetone, water, and formates was
affected.
3.3.2. Time-dependent measurements
The time-dependent measurements were performed for all
chromia-containing catalysts and for all supports to study the
formation of carbonaceous surface species at high temperature
and their effect on the activity of the catalysts as a function of
reaction time. Fig. 6 presents a comparison of the bands in the
C–H stretching region. The spectra were recorded during
nitrogen ﬂushes. For all calcined catalysts the formation of the
carboxylate-type and aliphatic species was observed after short
time on isobutane stream, whereas the formation of the
unsaturated/aromatic species required a longer time. The
performance
of
the
zirconia/alumina-supported
catalysts
resembled that of the alumina-supported one rather than that
of the zirconia-supported catalyst. After the ﬁrst isobutane feed
(3 min) aliphatic surface species were observed for all catalysts.
For the 0.8CrZr catalyst, however, only the band at 2927 cm1
(methylene-type) was observed, whereas for the alumina-
containing catalysts bands at 2980 (methyl-type) and
2940 cm1 (methylene-type) were observed. With time on
stream the band at 2980 cm1 decreased in intensity for the
alumina-containing catalysts. The methyl band at 2980 cm1
was more intense for the 2.2CrAl catalyst than for the other
catalysts after 30 min of dehydrogenation. This order is in
accordance with that observed for the H/C ratios of coke in the
activity measurements. Therefore, the band may correlate with
the hydrogen content of the coke. For the alumina-containing
catalysts also a low intensity band at 3104 cm1 was observed
possibly originating from adsorbed isobutene. After 6 min on
isobutane stream the formation of the band at 3060 cm1,
assigned to the unsaturated/aromatic species, was observed for
all catalysts. The band increased in intensity with time on
stream with a decrease in the amount of isobutene and hydrogen
in the product stream (MS) suggesting that the catalysts
deactivated due to coke formation.
Fig. 7 presents a similar comparison as presented in Fig. 6
for
the
hydrogen
prereduced
catalysts.
Similar
to
the
temperature-dependent experiments, the formation of carbo-
naceous surface species was suppressed for the alumina-
containing catalysts, whereas the 0.8CrZr was affected only
little. For the 0.8CrZr bands originating from the vibrations of
unsaturated/aromatic surface species (3064 cm1) and methy-
lene-type groups (2928 cm1) were observed. The 3064 cm1
band increased in intensity with time on stream with a decrease
in the amount of dehydrogenation products. For the alumina-
containing catalysts no bands of adsorbed isobutene or
unsaturated/aromatic species could be observed, and those
arising from the carboxylate-type and aliphatic surface species
were low in intensity.
3.4. In situ Raman–MS measurements
The in situ Raman–MS measurements were performed for
the zirconia-, alumina-, and zirconia/alumina-supported chro-
mia catalysts to further study the formation of the carbonaceous
surface species under isobutane at high temperature. In
accordance with the activity measurements the MS measure-
ments showed that the catalysts deactivated with time on stream

2.1(15)CrZrAl and 0.8CrZr catalysts under isobutane at 570 8C.
The spectrum of the quartz window has been subtracted from
the spectra. For the alumina-supported catalyst no spectra could
be obtained due to intense ﬂuorescence under the dehydro-
genation conditions in accordance with Weckhuysen and
Wachs
[32].
In
accordance
with
the
in
situ
DRIFTS
measurements the chromates reduced immediately after the
start of the isobutane feed. Carbonaceous surface species were
observed for both zirconia- and zirconia/alumina-supported
catalysts at 1585 and 1339 cm1. These bands were
assigned to pregraphitic deposits (coke) in accordance with
Kuba and Kno
¨zinger [33]. Additional bands with lower
intensities were also observed at 2880 cm1 (not shown),
assigned to C–H vibrations of the carbonaceous species [34].
The bands were formed for the 0.8CrZr already after 2 min on
stream, whereas for the 2.1(15)CrZrAl their formation required
a longer time. For alumina-supported chromia catalysts with
high chromium loadings similar bands have been observed
during propane dehydrogenation, but only after 20 min on
stream [34]. With increasing time on stream the bands of
monoclinic zirconia disappeared from the spectra for the
0.8CrZr. A similar behavior was also observed by Kuba and
Kno
¨zinger [33] for sulfated- and tungstated-zirconia catalysts
in the isomerization of n-pentane, and was assigned to the
darkening of the sample due to coke formation.
4. Discussion
The dehydrogenation reaction and the formation of car-
bonaceous surface species on the zirconia/alumina-, alumina-,
and zirconia-supported chromia catalysts were studied by
activity and by in situ DRIFTS and in situ Raman spectroscopic
measurements.
The zirconia/alumina and alumina supports were slightly
active in dehydrogenation and cracking of isobutane, whereas
the zirconia support was active in dehydrogenation only. The
amount of coke formed was highest for the alumina, somewhat
lower for the 4.4ZrAl support, and lowest for the zirconia. This
can be compared with the methanol adsorption–desorption
results on the Lewis acidic properties of the supports. Our
methanol adsorption–desorption measurements [17] indicated
that alumina had the highest Lewis acidity, i.e. the lowest
temperature for the formation of dimethylether (DME). The
deposition of both chromia and zirconia on the alumina
decreased the Lewis acidity, i.e. increased the temperature of

DME formation. No DME was formed for the pure zirconia
support or for the 0.8CrZr catalyst. Therefore, the amount of
coke on the different supports followed the order of Lewis
acidity of the support materials rather than the order of
dehydrogenation activity. Furthermore, the higher cracking
activity can be assigned to the Lewis acidity of the alumina and
the zirconia/alumina.
The in situ DRIFTS temperature-dependent studies showed
similarities between all studied catalysts. The main reason for
the similar behavior is that the observed oxygenated species are
mainly spectators that are formed during the reduction of the
Cr5+/Cr6+ species. Fig. 9 presents a summary of the formation
of the different oxygenated species from isobutane for the
calcined catalysts during the temperature-dependent measure-
ments. The scheme has been adapted from the results presented
by Finocchio et al. [25,27] and Ermini et al. [35]. Similar results
have also been reported for the interactions of propane [34] and
isobutane [36] on chromia/alumina catalysts with a high
chromium loading. The main route for the formation of the
oxygenated species, i.e. acetone, formate, and carboxylate-type
species, is due to the reduction of the Cr5+/Cr6+ species.
However, Ermini et al. [35] also observed that the Brønsted
acidic hydroxyl groups of pure alumina were able to convert
propane into the oxygenated species. In our experiments the
monoclinic zirconia was the most active support both in the
formation of oxygenated surface species and in the dehy-
drogenation reaction. Since no reaction products of the basic or
Lewis acidic surface sites were observed for zirconia in our
earlier methanol adsorption–desorption experiments [17], the
Brønsted acidic hydroxyl groups or the acid-base pair (Zr4+–
O2) would seem likely sites for the reactivity of zirconia.
However, the observed oxygenated carbonaceous surface
species are not directly related to the formation of the
dehydrogenation reaction products but are spectators.
On the prereduced catalysts the formation of water, acetone,
and formates were suppressed mainly due to the absence of
Cr5+/Cr6+ species. However, some formates were observed for
the 0.8CrZr, but their formation required higher temperatures
suggesting that these species were formed for the prereduced
catalysts as the support reacted with the isobutane feed. The
hydrogen prereduction also suppressed the formation of the
other carbonaceous surface species (aliphatic and unsaturated/
aromatic) for the alumina-containing catalysts. In addition, the
activity measurements showed that the dehydrogenation
activity of these catalysts was lower after the prereduction.
The results suggest that, especially, for the alumina-containing
supports, hydrogen prereduction was able to inhibit the
formation of both the surface species and the dehydrogenation
products. The inhibition might originate from the formation of
higher concentrations of surface bound water on the alumina-
containing catalysts [21], although it is not possible to conclude
this from the DRIFTS results.
The 0.8CrZr was the most active catalyst in the dehy-
drogenation of isobutane even though it had the lowest
chromium content in weight percentage. The zirconia deposi-
tion on alumina decreased the dehydrogenation activity since
the 2.2CrAl catalyst was more active than the two chromia/
zirconia/alumina catalysts. On the contrary, Gaspar and
Dieguez [15] reported a slightly higher dehydrogenation
activity, reported in TON (turn over number), for their
chromia/zirconia/alumina catalyst – containing a low surface
density of zirconia and no XRD observable zirconia crystallites
similar to our zirconia/alumina supports – compared with that
for their chromia/alumina catalyst. However, they did not
speculate on the reasons for the higher activity, and the
characterization results they reported do not allow this to be
done here. In agreement with our results, Burch and Loader
[18] found the use of zirconia/alumina as the support to
decrease the activity of their rhodium catalysts in the
combustion of methane and in the reduction of nitrogen oxide
compared with the use of zirconia or alumina, respectively, as
the support. They suspected that an incomplete monolayer of
zirconia on alumina caused rhodium to interact with both
oxides instead of just with zirconia modifying the active
species. This incomplete coverage of alumina by zirconia could
also be true with our catalysts.
Our results suggested that the support Lewis acidity
increased the cracking activity and the coke deposition rate
for the bare supports. For the chromia catalysts this effect was
not apparent because the formation of cracking products was
mainly a thermal reaction and did not depend on the catalyst.
The amount of deposited coke, on the other hand seemed to
depend on the dehydrogenation activity suggesting that coke
was formed from adsorbed isobutene. Similar results have been

et al. [35] and Finocchio et al. [25,27]. The in situ DRIFTS bands observed for the 0.8CrZr are presented for each species.

reported for the dehydrogenation of propane on vanadia/
alumina catalysts [37]. Infrared bands assigned to adsorbed
isobutene were observed for all zirconia-containing chromia
catalysts. These bands were observed at slightly lower
temperatures for the chromia/zirconia than for the chromia/
zirconia/alumina suggesting that the dehydrogenation reaction
occurred more readily on the chromia/zirconia catalyst. In
accordance with the activity results the higher coke deposition
rate for the 0.8CrZr catalyst was observed by in situ DRIFTS
and in situ Raman spectroscopy.
The higher activity of chromia/zirconia compared with the
activities of the alumina- and zirconia/alumina-supported
chromia catalysts might originate from more easily available
chromium species or from a beneﬁcial interaction between the
zirconia support and the chromium species. However, the
activity of the chromia catalysts is not governed by the acidity
of the material only, but the phase of the zirconia seems
important as well, and this may account for differences with
previous literature reports [15]. A higher zirconia loading on
alumina,
exceeding
the
monolayer,
might
increase
the
dehydrogenation activity of the zirconia/alumina-supported
chromia catalyst. However, the surface area of the support
decreases (see Table 1) with increasing zirconia loading
gradually canceling the beneﬁcial effect on the surface area. In
addition the formation of zirconia crystallites may lead to an
inhomogeneous surface, where both alumina and zirconia are
able to interact with the chromium species. Therefore, the
deposition of zirconia on alumina does not seem to be the
solution (i) to increase the activity of chromia/alumina catalysts
in the dehydrogenation, or (ii) to increase the surface area of
chromia/zirconia catalysts. Nevertheless, the rate of coke
deposition decreased for the pure supports suggesting that the
deposition of zirconia on alumina might be beneﬁcial for
applications where the support acidity has a more direct
inﬂuence on the performance of the catalyst.
5. Conclusions
The effect of zirconia deposition on alumina was studied for
chromia dehydrogenation catalysts by activity measurements
and by in situ DRIFT and in situ Raman spectroscopic
measurements. The results were compared with the perfor-
mance of chromia/zirconia and chromia/alumina catalysts all
containing chromium below 2 atCr/nm2. The in situ DRIFTS
measurements revealed the formation of spectator species
(acetone, formates, and carboxylate-type species) and coke
(aliphatic and unsaturated/aromatic hydrocarbon species) from
isobutane. By in situ Raman measurements the formation of
pregraphitic deposits was observed for zirconia- and zirconia/
alumina-supported catalysts. Hydrogen prereduction sup-
pressed the formation of all surface species and dehydrogena-
tion products for the alumina-containing catalysts, whereas the
zirconia-supported one was less affected.
The performance of the bare supports was inﬂuenced by the
Lewis acidity of the material. The zirconia deposition
decreased the Lewis acidity of alumina decreasing the rate
of coke deposition for zirconia/alumina compared with
alumina. The addition of chromia on the supports increased
the dehydrogenation activity of all materials, but the chromia/
alumina catalyst was more active than the chromia/zirconia/
alumina catalysts. The highest dehydrogenation activity was
observed for the chromia/zirconia catalyst. In contrast to the
supports, the coke deposition rate for the chromia catalysts
followed the activity of the catalysts. For the dehydrogenation
activity of the chromia catalysts it seems that the Lewis acidity
of the support is not the only inﬂuential factor, but that the phase
of the zirconia is also important.
