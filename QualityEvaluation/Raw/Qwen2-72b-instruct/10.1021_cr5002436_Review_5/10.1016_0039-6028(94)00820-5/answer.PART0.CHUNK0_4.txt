1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The focus of the literature is on the conversion of di-o-bonded ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt(111) and the identification of an intermediate species, ethylidene or ethyl, during this process. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is not directly discussed in the context of this specific reaction.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论。文献的重点是Pt(111)上二氧键合乙烯转化为乙炔的过程，以及在此过程中识别出的中间物种，乙基或乙基。Horiuti-Polanyi机制没有直接在这个特定反应的背景下进行讨论。
