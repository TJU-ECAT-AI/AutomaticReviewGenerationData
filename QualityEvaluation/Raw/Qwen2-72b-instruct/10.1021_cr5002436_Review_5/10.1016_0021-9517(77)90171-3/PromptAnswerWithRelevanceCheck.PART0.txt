Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, describing its four main steps and analyzing the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. Additionally, discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The document focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts and does not discuss the broader context of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its relevance to scientific interest and controversy.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪个步骤被认为是限速步骤的持续争论。该文件专注于丙烷在铬酸铝钾氧化物催化剂上的脱氢，没有讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机制的更广泛背景，也没有讨论其与科学兴趣和争议的相关性。

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The literature focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane and the hydrogenation of propylene over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts, describing the experimental methods, results, and the proposed reaction mechanism. The proposed mechanism involves the adsorption of hydrogen molecule but not hydrogen atom, which may agree with the experimental results obtained by Burwell et al. that the deuteration of cis- and trans-Zbutene over chromium oxide gel produced meso- and dl-butane-2,3-c&, respectively. The literature does not discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续争论。文献重点描述了丙烷的脱氢和丙烯的氢化在铬酸铝钾催化剂上的实验方法、结果和提出的反应机制。提出的机制涉及氢分子的吸附，而不是氢原子，这可能与Burwell等人获得的实验结果一致，即顺式和反式Z丁烯在铬氧化物凝胶上的氘化分别产生了间和对丁烷-2,3-c&。文献没有讨论为什么这个机制在近一个世纪的研究后仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题。
