Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, describing its four main steps and analyzing the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. Additionally, discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.The literature does not provide information on the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The focus of the literature is on the development of a novel experimental set-up for characterizing supported metal oxide catalysts under working conditions, combining product analysis using on-line mass spectrometry with catalyst characterization by time-resolved operando UV-VIS and Raman spectroscopy. The potentials of this approach are illustrated by the propane dehydrogenation over a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst. The study provides operando spectroscopic information on the short- and long-term deactivation process of the catalyst.

1.文献没有提供有关Horiuti-Polanyi机制在催化脱氢反应中的信息，也没有提及关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续辩论。文献的重点是开发一种新型的实验装置，用于在工作条件下表征负载金属氧化物催化剂，结合使用在线质谱进行产物分析和使用时间分辨原位UV-VIS和拉曼光谱进行催化剂表征。该方法的潜力通过丙烷在氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂上的脱氢反应得到说明。该研究提供了原位光谱信息，关于催化剂的短期和长期失活过程。
