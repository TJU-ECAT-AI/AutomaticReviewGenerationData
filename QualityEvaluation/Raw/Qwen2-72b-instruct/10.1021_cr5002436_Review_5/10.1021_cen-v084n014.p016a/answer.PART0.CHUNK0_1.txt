1. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the provided literature. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of its four main steps or analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in understanding catalytic processes, but this information is not directly supported by the literature.
