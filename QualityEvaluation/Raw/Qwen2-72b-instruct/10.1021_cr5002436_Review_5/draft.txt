1. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions: A comprehensive analysis of its four main steps, the ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step, and its enduring significance in scientific literature

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, a cornerstone in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, particularly on metal surfaces, encompasses four pivotal steps: adsorption, hydrogen dissociation, hydrogen migration, and desorption \[10.1021/jp909163z\]. The identity of the rate-limiting step remains a subject of contention due to the intricate nature of the mechanism and the influence of external factors \[10.1021/jp909163z\]. Despite extensive scrutiny, the mechanism's significance endures in scientific literature, as it underpins the understanding of a critical process in the petrochemical industry \[10.1021/jp909163z\].

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation, exemplified by ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3, involves end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site, followed by ethene and hydrogen desorption \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\]. Ethane adsorption is posited as the rate-determining step, supported by transient kinetic data and the absence of isotopic scrambling, indicating no involvement of coke deposits \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\]. The ongoing debate over the rate-limiting step persists, contributing to the mechanism's enduring scientific interest and controversy \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\].

Studies on the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, particularly over Pt and Pt-Sn alloy clusters, reveal the rate-determining step as the initial CH bond cleavage upon alkane adsorption \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. The presence of an adsorbed H atom facilitates alkene desorption over further dehydrogenation \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Substituting a Sn atom in a Pt3Sn cluster lowers the activation barrier for the rate-limiting step, enhancing catalyst activity \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. The mechanism's enduring scientific interest stems from understanding factors influencing alkene production versus coke precursor formation, a topic of ongoing debate and research \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\].

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation comprises four steps: adsorption of isobutane (i-C4H10) to form a half-hydrogenated species (i-C4H9/), conversion to chemisorbed isobutene (i-C4H8/), desorption of isobutene (i-C4H8), and formation of hydrogen (H2) from hydrogen atoms (H/) \[10.1016/0021-9517(92)90248-g\]. The rate-limiting step is debated, with some studies suggesting the conversion to chemisorbed isobutene, while others propose desorption or hydrogen formation \[10.1016/0021-9517(92)90248-g\]. This mechanism remains scientifically intriguing due to its implications for catalyst design and the unresolved nature of the rate-controlling step \[10.1016/0021-9517(92)90248-g\].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, despite nearly a century of study, continues to be a topic of scientific interest and controversy. Its enduring significance is rooted in its foundational role in understanding catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in the petrochemical industry. The ongoing debate over the rate-limiting step highlights the complexity of the mechanism and the influence of external factors such as metal nature, hydrocarbon type, and reaction conditions \[10.1021/jp909163z, 10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7, 10.1039/c3cp53796j, 10.1016/0021-9517(92)90248-g\]. Future research endeavors might focus on advanced computational methods to simulate the reaction dynamics and elucidate the role of surface intermediates in CC bond cleavage \[10.1021/ie800361a\]. Additionally, the development of novel catalysts with tailored properties could provide insights into the factors influencing alkene versus coke precursor formation, potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalytic systems \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. The exploration of alternative catalytic materials, beyond noble metals and transition metal oxides, might also offer new perspectives on the mechanism and its rate-limiting step \[10.1021/cr5002436_5\]. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism could pave the way for advancements in petrochemical processes and the production of light alkenes \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\].
