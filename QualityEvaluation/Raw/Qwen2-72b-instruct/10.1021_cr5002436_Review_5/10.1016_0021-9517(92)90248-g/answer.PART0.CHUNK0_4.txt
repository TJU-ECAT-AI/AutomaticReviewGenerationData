1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) Adsorption of isobutane (i-C4H10) onto the catalyst surface, forming a half-hydrogenated species (i-C4H9/); (2) Conversion of the half-hydrogenated species to chemisorbed isobutene (i-C4H8/); (3) Desorption of isobutene (i-C4H8) from the catalyst surface; and (4) Formation of hydrogen (H2) from two hydrogen atoms (H/). The debate regarding the rate-limiting step centers on whether the conversion of the half-hydrogenated species to chemisorbed isobutene or the desorption of isobutene is the slowest step. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in understanding the kinetics of dehydrogenation reactions and the role of catalysts in these processes, despite nearly a century of study.

The mechanism involves four elementary steps: (1) Adsorption of isobutane onto the catalyst surface, forming a half-hydrogenated species (i-C4H9/); (2) Conversion of the half-hydrogenated species to chemisorbed isobutene (i-C4H8/); (3) Desorption of isobutene from the catalyst surface; and (4) Formation of hydrogen (H2) from two hydrogen atoms (H/). The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction and the difficulty in directly observing the intermediate steps. Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of its importance in understanding the kinetics of dehydrogenation reactions and the role of catalysts in these processes.

1.关于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：(1) 异丁烷（i-C4H10）吸附到催化剂表面，形成半氢化物种（i-C4H9/）；(2) 半氢化物种转化为化学吸附的异丁烯（i-C4H8/）；(3) 异丁烯（i-C4H8）从催化剂表面解吸；(4) 从两个氢原子（H/）形成氢气（H2）。关于速率限制步骤的争论集中在半氢化物种转化为化学吸附的异丁烯或异丁烯的解吸是否是最慢的步骤。尽管近一个世纪的研究，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它在理解脱氢反应的反应动力学和催化剂在这些过程中的作用方面的重要性。
