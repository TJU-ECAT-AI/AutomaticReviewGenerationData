[1] "The overall reaction is i-C4Hr0 = i-C4H8 + H2."
[2] "It consists of the following elementary steps:i-C4H10 + 2l - i-C4H9/+ HI (9) i-C4H91 + l - i-C4H8/+ HI (10) i-C4H81 --- i-C4H 8 + l (11) 2H/ H2l+l (12) H21 H2+l."
[3] "Here I denotes a site for chemisorption."
[4] "For this reaction both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation may be conveniently con- ducted at a temperature near 623 K over chromia gel catalyst."
[5] "The molecular species involved when 13C is used as a tracer are i- C4Hlo, i-C4H9/,i-C4H8/,and i-C4H 8 ."
[6] "Each of these molecular species constitutes one pool in a transient-tracing compartmental model (Fig. 2a)."
[7] "The ordinary differential equations associated with this four-pool model are obtained by material balances for tracer species over each of the compartments (1):"
[8] "Only five parameters must be evaluated."
[9] "Two of them are the surface concentrations of i-C4Hgl and i-C4H81 on the catalyst."
[10] "The remaining three can be taken as V+l, v+2,and u+3."
[11] "The corresponding step velocities v_i can be computed from the three v+i be- cause the overall rate of dehydrogenation V = v+ z - v_i is independently determined."
[12] "All parameters have been shown in (I1) to be structurally globally identifiable."
[13] "From results of this type, it was clear that the last step is very close to equilibrium, so we next considered a reduced model lump- ing the last two compartments to obtain the (16) three-compartment model shown in Fig. 2b."
[14] "The equations of the resulting three-pool model are W dt + U+l zA (17) Ff a a "Jr- U_lZ 2 -Jr- -Zin ,(18) . dz2 C4H9l--- = O+lZ A - (v-1 + v+2)z2 + V-2ZE, (19) --'- = U+2Z 2 in" - + v-2 ZE + -Z (20)"
[15] "The parameters appearing in this reduced three-pool model are consistent with those of the original four-compartment model."
[16] "The estimated velocity of i-C4H10 chemi- sorption v+l is still so high that it can be reasonably considered to be at equilibrium."
[17] "Consequently we further reduced the model by lumping the first and second steps as shown in Fig. 2c."
[18] "The resulting two-pool model contains one less parameter and is described by"
[19] "The parameters to be estimated are now i- C4H9/, i-C4H81, and u+2 ; all of them are structurally globally identifiable (11)."
[20] "In Fig. 2c, C4H10 = flCA/W and C4H8 = flCE/W."
[21] "Table 4 gives a typical comparison between the parameters estimated for the three-pool and two-pool models."
[22] "Again the parameters appearing in this two-pool model compare very closely with those obtained from the three- and four-pool models."
[23] "This simplest model therefore gives results consistent with those of the more complex models."
[24] "Moreover, it correlates the data in a manner almost iden- tical to those with more complex structures."
[25] "As shown in Tables 2 to 6, employing several models and estimation methods, the concentration of i-C4H9/ species is higher than that of i-C4Hsl during the dehydrogena- tion and the reverse is true during hydroge- nation."
[26] "Such an accumulation in a catenary reaction path is consistent with the simulta- neous occurrence of small differences be- tween values of rate constants for forward and reverse velocities of the rate-controlling step, along with small differences between the concentrations of unoccupied catalyst sites and those occupied by chemisorbed hydrogen atoms."
[27] "Additional auxiliary experiments were conducted to furnish independent confir- - i i 5 10 Time (rain) 5 1."
[28] "ZE (isobutene) HYDROGENATION 0 i I 5 10 15 Time (rain) Fro."
[29] "7. Data and best two-pool model in the sense of unweighted least-squares for Run 0717B88."
[30] "Because of the fact that the simulations of the outputs of the models described in Tables 5 and 6 are almost identical, the infor- mation presented in Figs. 3 to 8 also applies to the models described in Table 6."
[31] "As shown in Tables 2 to 6, employing several models and estimation methods, the concentration of i-C4H9/ species is higher than that of i-C4Hsl during the dehydrogena- tion and the reverse is true during hydroge- nation."
[32] "Such an accumulation in a catenary reaction path is consistent with the simulta- neous occurrence of small differences be- tween values of rate constants for forward and reverse velocities of the rate-controlling step, along with small differences between the concentrations of unoccupied catalyst sites and those occupied by chemisorbed hydrogen atoms."
[33] "Experiments were also conducted to fur- nish independent information concerning adsorbed species."
[34] "The catalyst was reduced and purged with helium as described under experimental procedure."
[35] "A mixture of argon and isobutene in the ratio 1 : 1 together with helium carrier gas was then passed over the catalyst as 338C (15-20C lower than the usual hydrogenation-dehydrogenation ex- periments)."
[36] "A delay in isobutene concentra- tion appearance in the CSTR was observed."
[37] "This was considered to be due to adsorption ofisobutene from the gas phase."
[38] "The differ- ence between the curves for isobutene and argon was integrated and corresponded to 0.08 ml NTP g-1."
[39] "At the end of this adsorp- tion period the flow of the argon-isobntene mixture was stopped and the system was purged with He carrier gas until no isobu- tene would be detected in the effluent."
[40] "The purpose of this procedure was to remove physically adsorbed isobutene, leaving iso- butene chemisorbed on active catalyst sites."
[41] "Hydrogen was then injected into the CSTR at a rate of 4 ml NTP rain- 1 along with car- rier gas."
[42] "Two or three min after hydrogen injection commenced, isobutane was ob- served in the effluent and this phenomenon proceeded for about 6 min as shown in Fig."
[43] "9. By integrating the isobutane curve with respect to time, the amount of chemisorbed isobutene reacted with hydrogen was found to correspond to 0.04 ml NTP g-l."
[44] "This cor- responds approximately with values re- ported in Tables 5 and 6 for the sum of con- centrations of i-C4H81 and i-C4H9l."
[45] "In regular tracer experiments less than 1% of CH4 rela- tive to C4's was detected in the effluent,indicating absence of cracking."
[46] "No methane or other hydrocarbons were detected in the adsorption experiments."
[47] "Isobutane in con- trast to isobutene adsorbs dissociatively producing hydrogen, adsorption of which can then compete for surface sites, so inter- pretation of results is more complicated in that case and there is less hydrocarbon ad- sorption (about 0.02 ml NTP g-1 at 337C)."

1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) the adsorption of isobutane (i-C4H10) onto the catalyst surface, forming a half-hydrogenated species (i-C4H9/); (2) the further dehydrogenation of the half-hydrogenated species to form chemisorbed isobutene (i-C4H8/); (3) the desorption of isobutene from the catalyst surface; and (4) the recombination of hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen gas. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction and the difficulty in directly observing the intermediate steps. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it is fundamental to understanding the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, which is important for industrial processes such as the production of olefins.

1. Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤：(1) 异丁烷(i-C4H10)吸附在催化剂表面，形成半氢化物种(i-C4H9/)；(2) 半氢化物种进一步脱氢形成化学吸附的异丁烯(i-C4H8/)；(3) 异丁烯从催化剂表面解吸；(4) 氢原子的重组形成氢气。关于哪一步是速率限制的争论是由于反应的复杂性和直接观察中间步骤的困难。该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它对于理解烷烃的催化脱氢是基本的，这对于工业过程如烯烃的生产非常重要。
