[4] "For this reaction both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation may be conveniently con- ducted at a temperature near 623 K over chromia gel catalyst."
[5] "The molecular species involved when 13C is used as a tracer are i- C4Hlo, i-C4H9/,i-C4H8/,and i-C4H 8 ."
[6] "Each of these molecular species constitutes one pool in a transient-tracing compartmental model (Fig. 2a)."
[7] "The ordinary differential equations associated with this four-pool model are obtained by material balances for tracer species over each of the compartments (1):"

1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The overall reaction is the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene and hydrogen. The elementary steps include the chemisorption of isobutane to form a half-hydrogenated species, the conversion of this species to chemisorbed isobutene, the desorption of isobutene, and the recombination of hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen gas. The debate regarding the rate-limiting step is ongoing, with some studies suggesting that the conversion of the half-hydrogenated species to chemisorbed isobutene is the rate-controlling step. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in understanding the kinetics of dehydrogenation reactions and the role of catalysts in these processes.

1.霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤。总反应是异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯和氢气。基本步骤包括异丁烷的化学吸附形成半氢化物种，该物种转化为化学吸附的异丁烯，异丁烯的解吸，以及氢原子的重组形成氢气。关于速率限制步骤的争论仍在继续，一些研究表明，半氢化物种转化为化学吸附的异丁烯是速率控制步骤。由于理解脱氢反应的反应动力学和催化剂在这些过程中的作用的重要性，该机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题。
