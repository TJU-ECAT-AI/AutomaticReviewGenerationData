[1] "The overall reaction is i-C4Hr0 = i-C4H8 + H2."
[2] "It consists of the following elementary steps:i-C4H10 + 2l - i-C4H9/+ HI (9) i-C4H91 + l - i-C4H8/+ HI (10) i-C4H81 --- i-C4H 8 + l (11) 2H/ H2l+l (12) H21 H2+l."
[3] "Here I denotes a site for chemisorption."
[4] "For this reaction both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation may be conveniently con- ducted at a temperature near 623 K over chromia gel catalyst."
[5] "The molecular species involved when 13C is used as a tracer are i- C4Hlo, i-C4H9/,i-C4H8/,and i-C4H 8 ."
[6] "Each of these molecular species constitutes one pool in a transient-tracing compartmental model (Fig. 2a)."
[7] "The ordinary differential equations associated with this four-pool model are obtained by material balances for tracer species over each of the compartments (1):"

1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The overall reaction is the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene and hydrogen. The elementary steps are: isobutane adsorbs on the catalyst surface and loses two hydrogen atoms to form a half-hydrogenated species; this half-hydrogenated species loses another hydrogen atom to form adsorbed isobutene; adsorbed isobutene desorbs to form gaseous isobutene; two hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface combine to form hydrogen gas. The debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is ongoing. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in understanding the kinetics of dehydrogenation reactions and the role of catalysts in these processes.

1.霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制涉及催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤。总体反应是异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯和氢气。基本步骤是：异丁烷吸附在催化剂表面并失去两个氢原子形成半氢化物种；半氢化物种失去另一个氢原子形成吸附的异丁烯；吸附的异丁烯脱附形成气态异丁烯；催化剂表面的两个氢原子结合形成氢气。关于哪一步是速率限制的争论仍在继续。由于理解脱氢反应的反应动力学和催化剂在这些过程中的作用的重要性，该机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题。
