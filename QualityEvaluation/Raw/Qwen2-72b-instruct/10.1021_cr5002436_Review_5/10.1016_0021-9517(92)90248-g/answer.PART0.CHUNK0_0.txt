[1] "The overall reaction is i-C4Hr0 = i-C4H8 + H2."
[2] "It consists of the following elementary steps:i-C4H10 + 2l - i-C4H9/+ HI (9) i-C4H91 + l - i-C4H8/+ HI (10) i-C4H81 --- i-C4H 8 + l (11) 2H/ H2l+l (12) H21 H2+l."
[3] "Here I denotes a site for chemisorption."
[4] "For this reaction both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation may be conveniently con- ducted at a temperature near 623 K over chromia gel catalyst."
[5] "The molecular species involved when 13C is used as a tracer are i- C4Hlo, i-C4H9/,i-C4H8/,and i-C4H 8 ."
[6] "Each of these molecular species constitutes one pool in a transient-tracing compartmental model (Fig. 2a)."
[7] "The ordinary differential equations associated with this four-pool model are obtained by material balances for tracer species over each of the compartments (1):"
[8] "Only five parameters must be evaluated."
[9] "Two of them are the surface concentrations of i-C4Hgl and i-C4H81 on the catalyst."
[10] "The remaining three can be taken as V+l, v+2,and u+3."
[11] "The corresponding step velocities v_i can be computed from the three v+i be- cause the overall rate of dehydrogenation V = v+ z - v_i is independently determined."
[12] "All parameters have been shown in (I1) to be structurally globally identifiable."
[13] "From results of this type, it was clear that the last step is very close to equilibrium, so we next considered a reduced model lump- ing the last two compartments to obtain the (16) three-compartment model shown in Fig. 2b."
[14] "The equations of the resulting three-pool model are W dt + U+l zA (17) Ff a a "Jr- U_lZ 2 -Jr- -Zin ,(18) . dz2 C4H9l--- - = O+lZ A - (v-1 + v+2)z2 + V-2ZE, (19) --'- = U+2Z 2 in" - + v-2 ZE + -Z (20)"
[15] "The parameters appearing in this reduced three-pool model are consistent with those of the original four-compartment model."
[16] "The estimated velocity of i-C4H10 chemi- sorption v+l is still so high that it can be reasonably considered to be at equilibrium."
[17] "Consequently we further reduced the model by lumping the first and second steps as shown in Fig. 2c."
[18] "The resulting two-pool model contains one less parameter and is described by"
[19] "A + U-2ZE + V zin' (21)"
[20] "The parameters to be estimated are now i- C4H9/, i-C4H81, and u+2 ; all of them are structurally globally identifiable (11)."
[21] "In Fig. 2c, C4H10 = flCA/W and C4H8 = flCE/W."
[22] "Table 4 gives a typical comparison between the parameters estimated for the three-pool and two-pool models."
[23] "Again the parameters appearing in this two-pool model compare very closely with those obtained from the three- and four-pool models."
[24] "This simplest model therefore gives results consistent with those of the more complex models."
[25] "Moreover, it correlates the data in a manner almost iden- tical to those with more complex structures."
[26] "As shown in Tables 2 to 6, employing several models and estimation methods, the concentration of i-C4H9/ species is higher than that of i-C4Hsl during the dehydrogena- tion and the reverse is true during hydroge- nation."
[27] "Such an accumulation in a catenary reaction path is consistent with the simulta- neous occurrence of small differences be- tween values of rate constants for forward and reverse velocities of the rate-controlling step, along with small differences between the concentrations of unoccupied catalyst sites and those occupied by chemisorbed hydrogen atoms."
[28] "The catalytic properties of chromia have been studied extensively by Burwell and co- workers (14-16) and Molina (17), so it is of interest to compare their findings with those of this study."

1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) Adsorption of isobutane (i-C4H10) onto the catalyst surface, forming a half-hydrogenated species (i-C4H9/). (2) Conversion of the half-hydrogenated species to chemisorbed isobutene (i-C4H8/). (3) Desorption of isobutene (i-C4H8) from the catalyst surface. (4) Formation of hydrogen (H2) from two hydrogen atoms (H/). The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction and the difficulty in directly observing the intermediate steps. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides insights into the catalytic process and can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact rate-controlling step is still under debate, with some studies suggesting that the conversion of the half-hydrogenated species to chemisorbed isobutene is the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the desorption of isobutene or the formation of hydrogen may be the critical step.

1.霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制(Horiuti-Polanyi机制)涉及催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤:(1)异丁烷(i-C4H10)吸附到催化剂表面,形成半氢化物种(i-C4H9/).(2)半氢化物种转化为化学吸附的异丁烯(i-C4H8/).(3)异丁烯(i-C4H8)从催化剂表面解吸。(4)从两个氢原子(H/)形成氢气(H2).关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的,正在进行的争论是由于反应的复杂性和直接观察中间步骤的困难。尽管近一个世纪的研究,确切的速率控制步骤仍在争论中,一些研究建议半氢化物种转化为化学吸附的异丁烯是速率限制步骤,而其他研究则提出异丁烯的解吸或氢气的形成可能是关键步骤。这一机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题,因为它提供了对催化过程的见解,并可以指导更有效催化剂的设计。
