[10] "The remaining three can be taken as V+l, v+2,and u+3."
[11] "The corresponding step velocities v_i can be computed from the three v+i be- cause the overall rate of dehydrogenation V = v+ z - v_i is independently determined."
[12] "All parameters have been shown in (I1) to be structurally globally identifiable."
[13] "From results of this type, it was clear that the last step is very close to equilibrium, so we next considered a reduced model lump- ing the last two compartments to obtain the (16) three-compartment model shown in Fig. 2b."

1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) Adsorption of isobutane (i-C4H10) onto the catalyst surface, forming a half-hydrogenated species (i-C4H9/). (2) Conversion of the half-hydrogenated species to chemisorbed isobutene (i-C4H8/). (3) Desorption of isobutene (i-C4H8) from the catalyst surface. (4) Formation of hydrogen (H2) from two hydrogen atoms (H/). The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction and the difficulty in directly observing the intermediate steps. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides insights into the catalytic process and can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact rate-controlling step is still under debate, with some studies suggesting that the conversion of the half-hydrogenated species to chemisorbed isobutene is the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the desorption of isobutene or the formation of hydrogen may be the critical step.

1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The overall reaction is the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene and hydrogen. The elementary steps are: isobutane adsorbs on the catalyst surface and loses two hydrogen atoms to form a half-hydrogenated species; this half-hydrogenated species loses another hydrogen atom to form adsorbed isobutene; adsorbed isobutene desorbs to form gaseous isobutene; two hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface combine to form hydrogen gas. The debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is ongoing. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in understanding the kinetics of dehydrogenation reactions and the role of catalysts in these processes.

1.关于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：(1) 异丁烷（i-C4H10）吸附到催化剂表面，形成半氢化物种（i-C4H9/）；(2) 半氢化物种转化为化学吸附的异丁烯（i-C4H8/）；(3) 异丁烯（i-C4H8）从催化剂表面解吸；(4) 从两个氢原子（H/）形成氢气（H2）。关于速率限制步骤的争论集中在半氢化物种转化为化学吸附的异丁烯或异丁烯的解吸是否是最慢的步骤。尽管近一个世纪的研究，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它在理解脱氢反应的反应动力学和催化剂在这些过程中的作用方面的重要性。
2.Horiuti-Polanyi机制描述了在接近623 K的温度下，异丁烷在铬胶催化剂上的脱氢。该机制涉及四个基本步骤：(1) 异丁烷吸附到催化剂表面，形成半氢化物种（i-C4H9/）；(2) 半氢化物种转化为化学吸附的异丁烯（i-C4H8/）；(3) 异丁烯从催化剂表面解吸；(4) 从两个氢原子（H/）形成氢气（H2）。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的争论是由于反应的复杂性和直接观察中间步骤的困难。尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为其在理解脱氢反应的反应动力学和催化剂在这些过程中的作用方面的重要性。
