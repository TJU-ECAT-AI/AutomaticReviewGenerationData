1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The focus of the literature is on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica, which largely follows the proposal by Weckhuysen and Schoonheydt, where CH activation of the alkane takes place through direct interaction with chromium. The literature does not discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制对催化脱氢反应的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪一步被认为是限速步骤的持续争论。文献的重点是Cr(III)硅酸盐单核上乙烷脱氢的机制，这在很大程度上遵循了Weckhuysen和Schoonheydt的提议，其中烷烃的CH活化通过与铬的直接相互作用发生。文献没有讨论为什么这个机制尽管近一个世纪的研究，仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题。
