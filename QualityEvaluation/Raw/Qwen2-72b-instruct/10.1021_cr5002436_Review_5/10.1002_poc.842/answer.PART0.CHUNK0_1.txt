1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or discuss the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The focus of the literature is on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica surface sites, which involves three main reaction steps: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. An alternative mechanism is also explored, in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex. The importance of the local structure of the chromium surface sites is explored by means of a number of idealized surface models and electronic energy profiles for the reactions. The literature does not discuss why the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有讨论关于哪一步被认为是限速步骤的持续争论。文献的重点是单核Cr(III)硅酸盐表面位点上乙烷脱氢的机制，涉及三个主要反应步骤：(1) 根据-bond metathesis进行乙烷的CH活化，伴随OH和CrC键的形成，(2) -H转移到铬，随后失去乙烯，(3) 在H2的演化下再生铬位点。还探讨了一种替代机制，其中CH活化发生在反应性的氢化铬复合物上。通过一系列理想化的表面模型和反应的电子能谱，探索了铬表面位点的局部结构的重要性。文献没有讨论为什么Horiuti-Polanyi机制在近一个世纪的研究后仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题。
