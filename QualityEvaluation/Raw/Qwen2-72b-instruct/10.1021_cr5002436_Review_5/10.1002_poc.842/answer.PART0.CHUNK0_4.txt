1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The literature focuses on studying the mechanism of dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica by means of quantum chemistry. A reaction mechanism consisting of three main steps is found to be viable: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis, accompanied by formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site by means of -bond metathesis with subsequent loss of H2. The second reaction step, involving -hydrogen transfer to the metal, is found to be rate determining based on free-energy calculations. An alternative mechanism is formulated in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex formed in reaction (2), rather than at more stable chromium species with three oxygen ligands. The importance of this alternative mechanism relies on the ability to maintain a reactive hydridochromium site, which is a sensitive function of the local structure about chromium. The literature does not discuss why the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制对催化脱氢反应的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪个步骤被认为是限速步骤的持续争论。文献主要通过量子化学研究了单核Cr(III)硅酸盐上乙烷脱氢的机制。发现一个由三个主要步骤组成的反应机制是可行的：(1) 根据-bond metathesis激活乙烷的CH，伴随形成OH和CrC键，(2) -H转移到铬，随后失去乙烯，(3) 通过-bond metathesis再生铬位点，随后失去H2。根据自由能计算，发现第二个反应步骤，涉及-H转移到金属，是决定速率的步骤。提出了一个替代机制，其中CH激活发生在反应(2)中形成的反应性hydridochromium复合物上，而不是在具有三个氧配体的更稳定的铬物种上。这个替代机制的重要性取决于维持反应性hydridochromium位点的能力，这取决于铬周围局部结构的敏感性。文献没有讨论为什么Horiuti-Polanyi机制尽管近一个世纪的研究，仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题。
