1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The focus of the literature is on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica, which largely follows the proposal by Weckhuysen and Schoonheydt, where CH activation of the alkane takes place through direct interaction with chromium. The mechanism consists of three main reaction steps: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. An alternative mechanism is also explored, in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex. The importance of this alternative mechanism relies on the ability to maintain a reactive hydridochromium site, i.e. to prevent formation of more stable species in which chromium is covalently bonded to three oxygen ligands. This ability is a sensitive function of the local structure about chromium.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪一步被认为是限速步骤的持续争论。文献的重点是单核Cr(III)硅酸盐上乙烷脱氢的机制，这在很大程度上遵循了Weckhuysen和Schoonheydt的提议，其中烷烃的CH活化通过与铬的直接相互作用发生。该机制包括三个主要反应步骤：(1)根据-bond metathesis活化乙烷的CH，并伴随形成OH和CrC键，(2) -H转移到铬，随后失去乙烯，(3)在H2的演化下再生铬位点。还探讨了一种替代机制，其中CH活化在反应性hydridochromium复合物中发生。这种替代机制的重要性取决于维持反应性hydridochromium位点的能力，即防止形成铬与三个氧配体共价键合的更稳定物种。这种能力是关于铬的局部结构的敏感函数。
