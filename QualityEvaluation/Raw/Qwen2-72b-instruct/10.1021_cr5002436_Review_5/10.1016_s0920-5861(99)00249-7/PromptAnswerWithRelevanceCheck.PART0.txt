1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that the mechanism involves four main steps: (1) the dissociative adsorption of isobutane, (2) the conversion of isobutane to isobutene and hydrogen, (3) the desorption of isobutene, and (4) the desorption of hydrogen. Based on deuterium tracing results, the literature suggests that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in the process. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is not discussed in the literature. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a framework for understanding the complex reactions that occur during catalytic dehydrogenation, but the exact rate-limiting step and the factors that influence its rate are still not fully understood.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制催化脱氢反应的详细解释。但是，它确实提到了该机制涉及四个主要步骤：(1)异丁烷的解离吸附，(2)异丁烷转化为异丁烯和氢气，(3)异丁烯的解吸，(4)氢气的解吸。根据氘标记结果，文献表明异丁烷的解离吸附是过程中的慢步骤。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论在文献中没有讨论。Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，因为它为理解催化脱氢过程中发生的复杂反应提供了一个框架，但确切的速率限制步骤和影响其速率的因素仍然没有完全理解。

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that the mechanism involves four main steps: (1) the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon, (2) the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed species, (3) the desorption of the dehydrogenated product, and (4) the recombination of the hydrogen atoms. The literature suggests that the first step, the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon, is the rate-limiting step based on deuterium tracing results. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is not discussed in the literature. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a fundamental understanding of the catalytic dehydrogenation process, which is important for the production of petrochemicals and gasoline. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism is still not fully understood, and there are ongoing debates about the rate-limiting step and the nature of the active sites on the catalyst.

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or discuss the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. However, based on the context provided, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a model used to describe the mechanism of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The mechanism involves several steps, including the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, the activation of the molecule, the formation of an intermediate complex, and the desorption of the product. The rate-limiting step in this mechanism is often debated among researchers, with some suggesting that it is the activation of the reactant molecule, while others propose that it is the desorption of the product. Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in understanding the fundamental processes of catalysis and the potential for improving catalytic efficiency.
