1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that the mechanism involves four main steps: (1) the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon, (2) the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed species, (3) the desorption of the dehydrogenated product, and (4) the recombination of hydrogen atoms. The literature suggests that the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon is the rate-limiting step in the process. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is not discussed in the literature. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it is a fundamental mechanism for understanding catalytic reactions, and its rate-limiting step has implications for the design of catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制催化脱氢反应的详细解释。但是，它确实提到了该机制涉及四个主要步骤：(1) 烃的解离吸附，(2) 吸附物种的脱氢，(3) 脱氢产物的解吸，(4) 氢原子的重组。文献表明，烃的解离吸附是过程中的速率限制步骤。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续争论在文献中没有讨论。Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它是一种理解催化反应的基本机制，其速率限制步骤对催化剂的设计和反应条件的优化有影响。
