1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that the mechanism involves four main steps: (1) the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon, (2) the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed species, (3) the desorption of the dehydrogenated product, and (4) the recombination of the hydrogen atoms. The literature suggests that the first step, the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon, is the rate-limiting step based on deuterium tracing results. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is not discussed in the literature. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a fundamental understanding of the catalytic dehydrogenation process, which is important for the production of petrochemicals and gasoline. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism is still not fully understood, and there are ongoing debates about the rate-limiting step and the nature of the active sites on the catalyst.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释。但是，它确实提到了涉及四个主要步骤：(1) 烃的解离吸附，(2) 吸附物种的脱氢，(3) 脱氢产物的解吸，以及(4) 氢原子的重组。文献建议，基于氘示踪结果，第一步，即烃的解离吸附，是速率限制步骤。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续争论在文献中没有讨论。Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它为催化脱氢过程提供了基本的理解，这对石化产品和汽油的生产很重要。尽管近一个世纪的研究，该机制仍然没有完全理解，关于催化剂上的活性位点的性质和速率限制步骤的性质，仍然存在持续的争论。
