          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon (specifically isobutane in some explanations), (2) the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed species (conversion of isobutane to isobutene and hydrogen), (3) the desorption of the dehydrogenated product (isobutene), and (4) the recombination of hydrogen atoms or the desorption of hydrogen. Based on deuterium tracing results, the literature suggests that the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon (isobutane) is the rate-limiting step in the process. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is not discussed in detail. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a framework for understanding the complex reactions that occur during catalytic dehydrogenation, but the exact rate-limiting step and the factors that influence its rate are still not fully understood. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism is still not fully understood, and there are ongoing debates about the rate-limiting step and the nature of the active sites on the catalyst. The mechanism is important for the production of petrochemicals and gasoline, and its rate-limiting step has implications for the design of catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions.

          Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制涉及四个主要步骤：(1) 烃（特别是异丁烷）的解离吸附，(2) 吸附物种的脱氢（异丁烷转化为异丁烯和氢气），(3) 脱氢产物（异丁烯）的解吸，以及(4) 氢原子的重组或氢气的解吸。根据氘示踪结果，文献表明烃（异丁烷）的解离吸附是过程中的慢步骤。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续争论在文献中没有详细讨论。Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，因为它为理解催化脱氢过程中发生的复杂反应提供了一个框架，但确切的速率限制步骤和影响其速率的因素仍然没有完全理解。尽管近一个世纪的研究，该机制仍然没有完全理解，关于催化剂上的活性位点的性质和速率限制步骤的性质，仍然存在持续的争论。该机制对石化产品和汽油的生产很重要，其速率限制步骤对催化剂的设计和反应条件的优化有影响。
