1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or discuss the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. However, based on the context provided, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a model used to describe the mechanism of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The mechanism involves several steps, including the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, the activation of the molecule, the formation of an intermediate complex, and the desorption of the product. The rate-limiting step in this mechanism is often debated among researchers, with some suggesting that it is the activation of the reactant molecule, while others propose that it is the desorption of the product. Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in understanding the fundamental processes of catalysis and the potential for improving catalytic efficiency.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制对催化脱氢反应的详细解释，也没有讨论关于哪一步被认为是速率限制的持续争论。然而，根据提供的上下文，Horiuti-Polanyi机制是一种用于描述催化脱氢反应机制的模型。该机制涉及几个步骤，包括反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附，分子的活化，中间复合物的形成，以及产物的解吸。在这一机制中，速率限制步骤往往是研究人员争论的焦点，一些人认为是反应物分子的活化，而另一些人则认为是产物的解吸。尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题，因为了解催化的基本过程和提高催化效率的潜力对其至关重要。
