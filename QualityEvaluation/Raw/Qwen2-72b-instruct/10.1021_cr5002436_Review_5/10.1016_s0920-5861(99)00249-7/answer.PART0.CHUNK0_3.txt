1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that the mechanism involves four main steps: (1) the dissociative adsorption of isobutane, (2) the dehydrogenation of isobutane to form isobutene and hydrogen, (3) the desorption of isobutene, and (4) the desorption of hydrogen. Based on deuterium tracing results, the literature suggests that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane (Step 1) is the slow step in the process. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is not discussed in the literature. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a framework for understanding the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, but the exact rate-limiting step and the factors affecting the reaction rates are still under investigation.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释。但是，它确实提到了该机制涉及四个主要步骤：(1)异丁烷的解离吸附，(2)异丁烷的脱氢形成异丁烯和氢气，(3)异丁烯的解吸，(4)氢气的解吸。根据氘标记结果，文献表明异丁烷的解离吸附(第一步)是过程中的慢步骤。关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论在文献中没有讨论。Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，因为它为理解催化脱氢反应提供了一个框架，但是确切的速率限制步骤和影响反应速率的因素仍在研究中。
