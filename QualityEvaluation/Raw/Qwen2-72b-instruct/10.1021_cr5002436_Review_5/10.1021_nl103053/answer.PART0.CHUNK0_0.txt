<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1.The literature does not provide information on the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or discuss its rate-limiting step. The focus of the literature is on the growth of graphene on Rh(111) via temperature-programmed growth of C2H4, identifying size-selective carbon nanoclusters as precursors to graphene growth.
