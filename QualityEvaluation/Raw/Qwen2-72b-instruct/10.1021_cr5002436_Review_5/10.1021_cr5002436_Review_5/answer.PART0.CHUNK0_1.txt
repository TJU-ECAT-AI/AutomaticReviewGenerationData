[1] "The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."
[3] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."
[4] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "Even though the dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, the exact mechanism is still a topic under debate, particularly because this reaction is catalyzed by a vast array of materials as different as noble metals and transition metal oxides."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is widely used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, following Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics. It comprises four main steps: the dissociative adsorption of paraffin, the cleavage of a second hydrogen atom from the molecule, the formation of a hydrogen molecule, and the desorption of hydrogen and the olefin product. The debate over which step is rate-limiting continues, with both the CH cleavage steps and the dissociative adsorption of paraffin being proposed as candidates. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the diverse range of catalyst materials used in dehydrogenation reactions, including noble metals and transition metal oxides.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制于1934年提出，广泛用于描述催化脱氢反应，遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood动力学。它主要包括四个步骤：石蜡的解离吸附，从分子中裂解第二个氢原子，氢分子的形成，以及氢和烯烃产物的脱附。关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的争论仍在继续，CH裂解步骤和石蜡的解离吸附都被提议为候选步骤。尽管近一个世纪的研究，由于脱氢反应中使用的催化剂材料范围广泛，包括贵金属和过渡金属氧化物，确切的机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。
