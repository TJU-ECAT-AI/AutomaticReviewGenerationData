[1] "The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."
[3] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."
[4] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "Even though the dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, the exact mechanism is still a topic under debate, particularly because this reaction is catalyzed by a vast array of materials as different as noble metals and transition metal oxides."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, following Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics where all catalyst surface sites are considered identical. The mechanism comprises four steps: the dissociative adsorption of paraffin, the cleavage of a second hydrogen atom (CH bond), the formation of a hydrogen molecule, and the desorption of hydrogen and olefin. Both the CH bond cleavage steps and the dissociative adsorption of paraffin have been debated as potential rate-limiting steps. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact mechanism remains a topic of debate due to the diverse materials that can catalyze the reaction, including noble metals and transition metal oxides.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制于1934年提出，常用于描述催化脱氢反应，遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood动力学，其中所有催化剂表面位点都被认为是相同的。该机制包括四个主要步骤：石蜡的解离吸附，第二个氢原子（CH键）的裂解，氢分子的形成，以及氢和烯烃的脱附。CH键裂解步骤和石蜡的解离吸附都被认为可能是脱氢反应的速率限制步骤。尽管脱氢反应已经研究了近一个世纪，但确切的机制仍然是一个有争议的话题，特别是因为这种反应可以被各种材料催化，包括贵金属和过渡金属氧化物。
