1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or discuss the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The focus of the literature is on the computational study of the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and butane over Pt and Pt-Sn alloy cluster catalysts, using density functional theory (DFT). The rate-determining step is identified as the cleavage of the first CH bond upon alkane adsorption. The selectivity towards alkene production is explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom and low alkene binding energies. The co-feeding of hydrogen and the replacement of a Pt atom by Sn are shown to influence the reaction pathway and catalyst performance. Despite the lack of discussion on the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, the literature highlights the importance of understanding the factors that influence the formation of gas-phase alkenes versus further loss of hydrogen from adsorbed alkene leading to formation of coke precursors, which remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有讨论关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论。文献的重点是使用密度泛函理论（DFT）对乙烷、丙烷和丁烷在Pt和Pt-Sn合金簇催化剂上的脱氢反应的计算研究。识别出的速率决定步骤是烷烃吸附时第一个CH键的断裂。对烯烃生产的高选择性是通过第三个氢原子断裂的较高能垒和低烯烃结合能来解释的。共喂氢和用Sn取代Pt原子被证明会影响反应途径和催化剂性能。尽管没有讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机制，文献强调了理解影响气相烯烃形成与从吸附烯烃进一步失去氢导致焦炭前体形成的因素的重要性，这仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题。
