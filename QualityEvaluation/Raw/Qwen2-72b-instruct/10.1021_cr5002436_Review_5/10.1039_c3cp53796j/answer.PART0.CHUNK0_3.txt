1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does analyze the reaction pathways for the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and butane over Pt nanoparticles represented by a tetrahedral Pt4 cluster. The objectives of the work were to establish the rate-limiting step and the selectivity for forming alkenes versus further dehydrogenation leading to catalyst deactivation due to coking. The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. Substitution of a Sn atom in the cluster to produce a Pt3Sn cluster leads to a downward shift of the potential energy surface for the reaction and causes an increase in the activity of the catalyst due to the lower net activation barrier for the rate-limiting step. The introduction of Sn does not alter the relative activation barriers for gas-phase alkene formation versus loss of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkene, the process leading to the formation of coke precursors.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制催化脱氢反应的详细解释。但是，它确实分析了乙烷、丙烷和丁烷在Pt纳米粒子上的脱氢反应途径，这些粒子由四面体Pt4簇表示。这项工作的目标是确定速率限制步骤以及形成烯烃与进一步脱氢导致催化剂因焦化而失活的选择性。在簇上吸附的H原子的存在促进了烯烃的解吸，相对于吸附的烯烃的脱氢。将Sn原子替换到簇中以产生Pt3Sn簇导致反应的势能面的向下移动，并且由于速率限制步骤的较低的净活化能垒，导致催化剂活性的增加。然而，Sn的引入并没有改变气相烯烃形成与从吸附的烯烃中失去氢的相对活化能垒，这一过程导致焦炭前体的形成。
