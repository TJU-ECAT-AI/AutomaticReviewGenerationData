1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The document focuses on Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies of C1 and C2 hydrocarbons species on Pt clusters, and does not discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its relevance to scientific interest and controversy.

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The focus of the literature is on Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies of C1 and C2 hydrocarbons species on Pt clusters, specifically on the interactions of ethylene and acetylene with platinum surfaces and the energetics of various hydrocarbon fragments postulated to be intermediates in the hydrogenolysis of ethane over platinum. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, which describes the adsorption, activation, and desorption steps involved in the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, is not directly discussed in the context of this study. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its fundamental importance in understanding catalytic reactions, particularly in the context of hydrocarbon conversion reactions over metal catalysts like platinum. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact rate-limiting step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism can still be debated, as it may depend on the specific reaction conditions, the nature of the hydrocarbon substrate, and the properties of the catalyst surface.

1.文献没有详细解释Horiuti-Polanyi机制在催化脱氢反应中的作用，也没有分析关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续争论。文献的重点是密度泛函理论（DFT）对Pt簇上的C1和C2烃类的研究，特别是乙烯和乙炔与铂表面的相互作用，以及被假设为乙烷在铂上氢解过程中中间体的各种烃类片段的能学性质。Horiuti-Polanyi机制描述了烃类催化脱氢中涉及的吸附、活化和解吸步骤，但在这项研究中没有直接讨论。由于其在理解金属催化剂如铂上的烃类转化反应中的基本重要性，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制中的确切速率限制步骤仍然可以争论，因为它可能取决于特定的反应条件、烃类底物的性质和催化剂表面的特性。
