Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide information on the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or discuss its rate-limiting step. The document focuses on the adsorption of ethylene on Pt/SiO2 and PtSn/SiO2 catalysts, detailing the experimental methods, results, and quantum chemical calculations. It does not address the mechanism of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or the ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

1.文献没有提供关于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制的信息，也没有讨论其速率限制步骤。该文件专注于乙烯在Pt/SiO2和PtSn/SiO2催化剂上的吸附，详细介绍了实验方法、结果和量子化学计算。它没有涉及催化脱氢反应的机制，也没有讨论关于Horiuti-Polanyi机制速率限制步骤的持续争论。
