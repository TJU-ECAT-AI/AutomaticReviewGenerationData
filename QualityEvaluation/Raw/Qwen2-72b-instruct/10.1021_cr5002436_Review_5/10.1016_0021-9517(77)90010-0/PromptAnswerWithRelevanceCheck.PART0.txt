Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, describing its four main steps and analyzing the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. Additionally, discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or discuss its four main steps. It does not analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The literature also does not discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or discuss the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The document focuses on the experimental results and conclusions regarding the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over platinum and platinum-gold alloys, rather than the theoretical mechanisms.
