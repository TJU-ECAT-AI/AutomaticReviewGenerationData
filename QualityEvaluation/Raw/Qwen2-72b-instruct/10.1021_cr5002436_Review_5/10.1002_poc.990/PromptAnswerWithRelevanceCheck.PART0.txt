1.The literature does not provide information on the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The focus of the study is on the mechanism of CH activation by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation over Cr(III)silica surface sites. The mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) was located on the seam between the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III) and the doublet spin potential energy surface of Cr(V). Subsequent to the change of spin state, the CH activation path passes through a transition state on the doublet potential surface, leading to the formation of an ethylhydridochromium(V) complex. This complex represents only a shallow minimum on the potential energy surface and -hydrogen transfer to complete the catalytic cycle must therefore take place in the extension of the CH activation step. The combination of a significant activation energy and a small pre-exponential factor in the rate constant makes CH activation by oxidative addition an unlikely mechanism for dehydrogenation in this system.

1.文献没有提供关于Horiuti-Polanyi机制催化脱氢反应的信息。研究的重点是CH激活的机制，通过氧化加成作为可能的途径催化脱氢在Cr(III)硅表面位点。该机制涉及铬的正式双重氧化，并在Cr(III)的四重自旋势能面和Cr(V)的双重自旋势能面之间的接缝上定位了最低能量交叉点(MECP)。随后自旋状态的改变，CH激活路径通过双重势能面上的过渡状态，导致乙基氢化铬(V)复合物的形成。该复合物在势能面上仅代表一个浅的最小值，因此必须在CH激活步骤的延伸中进行氢转移以完成催化循环。显著的活化能和速率常数中小的前指数因子的组合使得通过氧化加成的CH激活在该系统中成为不太可能的脱氢机制。

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The focus of the literature is on the study of CH activation in ethane by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation over Cr(III)silica surface sites. The mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) was located on the seam between the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III) and the doublet spin potential energy surface of Cr(V).

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制对催化脱氢反应的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪一步被认为是速率限制的持续争论。文献的重点是研究CH在乙烷中的氧化加成作为催化脱氢可能途径的Cr(III)硅表面位点。该机制涉及铬的正式双重氧化，并在Cr(III)的四重自旋势能面和Cr(V)的双重自旋势能面之间的接缝上定位了最小能量交叉点(MECP)。随后自旋状态的改变，CH活化路径通过双重势能面上的过渡态，导致乙基氢化铬(V)复合物的形成。这个复合物在势能面上只代表一个浅的最小值，因此，为了完成催化循环，-氢转移必须在CH活化步骤的延伸中进行。显著的活化能和速率常数中小的前指数因子的结合使得通过氧化加成的CH活化在这个系统中成为不太可能的脱氢机制。
