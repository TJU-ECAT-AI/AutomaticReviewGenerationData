1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The focus of the literature is on the study of CH activation in ethane by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation over Cr(III)silica surface sites. It does not discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续争论。文献的重点是研究CH在乙烷中的氧化加成作为催化脱氢可能途径的Cr(III)硅表面位点。它没有讨论为什么这个机制在近一个世纪的研究后仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题。
