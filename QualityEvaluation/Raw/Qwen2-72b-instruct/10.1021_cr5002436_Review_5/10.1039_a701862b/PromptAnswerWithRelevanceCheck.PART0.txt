Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The document focuses on the in situ IR spectroscopic study of the adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethene on a platinum-on-silica catalyst between 100 and 294 K. It describes the design of a new cell capable of obtaining infrared spectra of molecules adsorbed on catalysts within a wide temperature range. The study reports on the spectra of the chemisorbed species attributed to the presence of p-adsorbed ethene species and other adsorbed species on the catalyst. The document does not discuss why the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续争论。该文件专注于在100至294K之间对硅胶上的铂催化剂上乙烯的吸附和脱氢的原位红外光谱研究。它描述了一种新型单元的设计，能够在宽温度范围内获得吸附在催化剂上的分子的红外光谱。该研究报告了归因于催化剂上p-吸附乙烯物种和其他吸附物种的化学吸附物种的光谱。该文件没有讨论为什么Horiuti-Polanyi机制尽管近一个世纪的研究，仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题。

It describes the design of a new cell capable of obtaining infrared spectra of molecules adsorbed on catalysts within a wide temperature range. The study identifies the presence of p-adsorbed ethene species, di-r* and di-r adsorbed species, and the transformation of the di-r species into ethylidyne species on [111] surface facets of the metal particles. The document does not discuss why the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

The document focuses on the in situ IR spectroscopic study of the adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethene on a platinum-on-silica catalyst between 100 and 294 K. It describes the cell used for obtaining infrared spectra, the preparation and characterization of the catalyst, and the spectroscopic procedure. The results and discussion section interprets the IR spectra of the ethene multilayer on the catalyst at 100 K and identifies the chemisorbed species from ethene on the catalyst between 100 and 294 K. The document concludes by comparing the results with other IR spectroscopic studies on finely divided oxide-supported platinum catalysts.
