1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it discuss the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The document focuses on the effects of Sn promotion on Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation, the origins of methane formation, and the role of hydrogen addition to the feed. It does not delve into the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or the scientific interest and controversy surrounding it.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有讨论关于哪一步被认为是速率限制的持续争论。该文件专注于Sn对Pt/Mg(Al)O和PtSn/Mg(Al)O催化剂在乙烷脱氢中的作用，甲烷形成的原因，以及向进料中添加氢气的作用。它没有深入探讨Horiuti-Polanyi机制或围绕它的科学兴趣和争议。
