1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The document focuses on the effects of Sn promotion on the local environment of dispersed Pt, catalyst activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation, and the formation of coke during ethane dehydrogenation to ethene. It does not discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or the reasons for its scientific interest and controversy.
