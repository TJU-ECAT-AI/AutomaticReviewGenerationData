Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The document focuses on the effects of Sn promotion on the local environment of dispersed Pt, catalyst activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation, and the formation of coke during ethane dehydrogenation to ethene. It does not discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or the reasons for its scientific interest and controversy.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续争论。该文件重点讨论了Sn促进对分散Pt的局部环境、催化剂活性和选择性以及脱氢过程中乙烷脱氢至乙烯时焦炭形成的影响。它没有讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机制，也没有讨论其科学兴趣和争议的原因。
