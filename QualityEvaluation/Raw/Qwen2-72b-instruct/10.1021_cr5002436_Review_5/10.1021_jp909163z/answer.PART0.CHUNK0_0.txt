1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. However, it does discuss the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation steps of C1 and C2 species, as well as the CC bond cleavage reactions and isomerization reactions between C2 species on Pt(111) and Pt(211) surfaces. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, which describes the adsorption, activation, and desorption of molecules on a catalytic surface, remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it is fundamental to understanding catalytic reactions, and the rate-limiting step can vary depending on the specific reaction and catalyst used.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制对催化脱氢反应的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续争论。然而，它确实讨论了C1和C2物种在Pt(111)和Pt(211)表面上的脱氢和氢化步骤，以及C2物种之间的CC键裂解反应和异构化反应。Horiuti-Polanyi机制，描述了分子在催化表面上的吸附、活化和解吸，仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为它对于理解催化反应是基础性的，而速率限制步骤可能根据特定的反应和所使用的催化剂而变化。
