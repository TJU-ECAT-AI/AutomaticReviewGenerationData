1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. However, the literature does discuss the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions of C1 and C2 species on Pt(111) and Pt(211) surfaces, as well as the CC bond cleavage reactions and isomerization reactions between C2 species. The stability of various C2 species on these surfaces is also discussed, with CH3C found to be the most stable species on both Pt(111) and Pt(211). The barriers for various reactions are calculated, and it is noted that isomerization reactions do not appear to be energetically favored on Pt. The literature remains a topic of scientific interest due to its comprehensive DFT study of the reaction intermediates and reaction barriers of elementary-like reaction steps in both hydrogenation of ethylene and its reverse (ethane dehydrogenation) and hydrogenolysis of ethane on Pt(111) and Pt(211).

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制对催化脱氢反应的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续争论。但是，文献确实讨论了C1和C2物种在Pt(111)和Pt(211)表面上的脱氢和氢化反应，以及C2物种之间的CC键裂解反应和异构化反应。还讨论了这些表面上各种C2物种的稳定性，发现CH3C在Pt(111)和Pt(211)上都是最稳定的物种。计算了各种反应的能垒，并指出异构化反应在Pt上似乎在能量上并不有利。由于文献对乙烯氢化及其逆反应(乙烷脱氢)和Pt(111)和Pt(211)上乙烷氢解的反应中间体和反应能垒的初级反应步骤进行了全面的DFT研究，因此它仍然是科学界感兴趣的话题。
