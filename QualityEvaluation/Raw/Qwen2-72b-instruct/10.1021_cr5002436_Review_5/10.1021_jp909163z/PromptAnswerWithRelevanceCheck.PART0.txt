1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. However, it does discuss the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation steps of C1 and C2 species, as well as the CC bond cleavage reactions and isomerization reactions between C2 species on Pt(111) and Pt(211) surfaces. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, which describes the adsorption, activation, and desorption of molecules on a catalytic surface, remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it is fundamental to understanding catalytic reactions, and the rate-limiting step can vary depending on the specific reaction and catalyst used.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制对催化脱氢反应的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续争论。然而，它确实讨论了C1和C2物种在Pt(111)和Pt(211)表面上的脱氢和氢化步骤，以及C2物种之间的CC键裂解反应和异构化反应。Horiuti-Polanyi机制，描述了分子在催化表面上的吸附、活化和解吸，仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为它对于理解催化反应是基础性的，而速率限制步骤可能根据特定的反应和所使用的催化剂而变化。

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. However, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a widely accepted model for the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons on metal surfaces. It consists of four main steps: (1) adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the metal surface, (2) dissociation of the hydrogen atoms from the hydrocarbon molecule, (3) migration of the hydrogen atoms across the metal surface, and (4) desorption of the hydrogen atoms and the dehydrogenated hydrocarbon from the metal surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the mechanism and the influence of various factors such as the nature of the metal, the hydrocarbon, and the reaction conditions. Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it is fundamental to understanding the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, which is an important process in the petrochemical industry.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制对催化脱氢反应的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪一步被认为是限速步骤的持续争论。然而，Horiuti-Polanyi机制是广泛接受的模型，用于描述金属表面烃类的催化脱氢。它主要包含四个步骤：(1)烃类分子吸附在金属表面，(2)氢原子从烃类分子中解离，(3)氢原子在金属表面迁移，(4)氢原子和脱氢烃类从金属表面解吸。关于哪一步是限速步骤的持续争论是由于机制的复杂性以及金属、烃类和反应条件等各种因素的影响。尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它是理解烃类催化脱氢的基础，这是石化工业中一个重要的过程。

However, the literature does discuss the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions of C1 and C2 species on Pt(111) and Pt(211) surfaces, as well as the CC bond cleavage reactions and isomerization reactions between C2 species. The stability of various C2 species on these surfaces is also discussed, with CH3C found to be the most stable species on both Pt(111) and Pt(211). The barriers for various reactions are calculated, and it is noted that isomerization reactions do not appear to be energetically favored on Pt. The literature remains a topic of scientific interest due to its comprehensive DFT study of the reaction intermediates and reaction barriers of elementary-like reaction steps in both hydrogenation of ethylene and its reverse (ethane dehydrogenation) and hydrogenolysis of ethane on Pt(111) and Pt(211).
