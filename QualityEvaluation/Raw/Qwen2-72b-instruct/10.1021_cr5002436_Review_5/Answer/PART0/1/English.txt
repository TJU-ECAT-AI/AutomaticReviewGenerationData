The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a widely accepted model for the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons on metal surfaces. It consists of four main steps: (1) adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the metal surface, (2) dissociation of the hydrogen atoms from the hydrocarbon molecule, (3) migration of the hydrogen atoms across the metal surface, and (4) desorption of the hydrogen atoms and the dehydrogenated hydrocarbon from the metal surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the mechanism and the influence of various factors such as the nature of the metal, the hydrocarbon, and the reaction conditions. Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it is fundamental to understanding the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, which is an important process in the petrochemical industry.

The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. Ethane dehydrogenation proceeds via an end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site at the catalyst surface. This is followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen. Ethane adsorption is suggested to be the rate-determining step of the reaction. The absence of isotopic scrambling of ethylene indicates that coke deposits formed during the initial activation of the catalyst material are not involved in the ethane dehydrogenation cycle. Transient kinetic data suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of the reaction. The absence of significant differences in the tailing of the m/e 27 and m/e 28 fragments during a transient experiment indicates that neither beta-H transfer of an ethyl species nor ethene desorption is the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is not discussed in the literature. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in the development of chemical industries and the production of light alkenes.

The literature focuses on computational studies of the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and butane over Pt and Pt-Sn alloy cluster catalysts using density functional theory (DFT). The rate-determining step is identified as the cleavage of the first CH bond upon alkane adsorption. The selectivity towards alkene production is explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom and low alkene binding energies. The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. Substitution of a Sn atom in the cluster to produce a Pt3Sn cluster leads to a downward shift of the potential energy surface for the reaction and causes an increase in the activity of the catalyst due to the lower net activation barrier for the rate-limiting step. Despite the lack of discussion on the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, the literature highlights the importance of understanding the factors that influence the formation of gas-phase alkenes versus further loss of hydrogen from adsorbed alkene leading to formation of coke precursors, which remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) Adsorption of isobutane (i-C4H10) onto the catalyst surface, forming a half-hydrogenated species (i-C4H9/). (2) Conversion of the half-hydrogenated species to chemisorbed isobutene (i-C4H8/). (3) Desorption of isobutene (i-C4H8) from the catalyst surface. (4) Formation of hydrogen (H2) from two hydrogen atoms (H/). The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction and the difficulty in directly observing the intermediate steps. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides insights into the catalytic process and can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact rate-controlling step is still under debate, with some studies suggesting that the conversion of the half-hydrogenated species to chemisorbed isobutene is the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the desorption of isobutene or the formation of hydrogen may be the critical step.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, following Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics where all catalyst surface sites are considered identical. The mechanism comprises four steps: the dissociative adsorption of paraffin, the cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, the formation of a hydrogen molecule, and the desorption of hydrogen and the olefin product. Both the CH cleavage steps and the dissociative adsorption of paraffin have been debated as potential rate-limiting steps. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact mechanism remains a topic of debate due to the diverse materials that can catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction, including noble metals and transition metal oxides.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts. For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are: (1) Adsorption of ethane on the metal surface, (2) Dissociative adsorption of ethane to form C2H5 (ads) and H (ads), (3) Dehydrogenation of C2H5 (ads) to form C2H4 (ads) and H (ads), (4) Desorption of ethene and hydrogen from the metal surface. At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step over a range of metal catalysts, and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the degree of dehydrogenation of the C2Hx surface species that are important in the CC bond scission. In particular, over supported and unsupported Pt surfaces, C2Hx adsorbed species with x in the range 05 have been reported to be the surface intermediates responsible for cleavage of the CC bond. The number of hydrogen atoms in the adsorbed C2Hx in which CC bond cleaves may differ from one surface to another. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because of the lack of consensus on the detailed mechanism of CC bond cleavage and the role of different surface intermediates in the reaction.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps. The first step involves the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon substrate, which is considered rate-limiting in this study. Steps 2 to 4 are quasi-equilibrated, involving the adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting stems from the complexity of the reaction mechanism and the influence of catalyst properties. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides insights into the fundamental surface chemistry of catalytic reactions, which is crucial for the development of more efficient catalysts.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction and the difficulty in directly observing the intermediate steps. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides insights into the catalytic process and can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact rate-controlling step is still under debate, with some studies suggesting that the conversion of the half-hydrogenated species to chemisorbed isobutene is the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the desorption of isobutene or the formation of hydrogen may be the critical step.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, following Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics where all catalyst surface sites are considered identical. The mechanism comprises four steps: the dissociative adsorption of paraffin, the cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, the formation of a hydrogen molecule, and the desorption of hydrogen and the olefin product. Both the CH cleavage steps and the dissociative adsorption of paraffin have been debated as potential rate-limiting steps. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact mechanism remains a topic of debate due to the diverse materials that can catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction, including noble metals and transition metal oxides.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts. For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are: (1) Adsorption of ethane on the metal surface, (2) Dissociative adsorption of ethane to form C2H5 (ads) and H (ads), (3) Dehydrogenation of C2H5 (ads) to form C2H4 (ads) and H (ads), (4) Desorption of ethene and hydrogen from the metal surface. At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step over a range of metal catalysts, and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the degree of dehydrogenation of the C2Hx surface species that are important in the CC bond scission. In particular, over supported and unsupported Pt surfaces, C2Hx adsorbed species with x in the range 05 have been reported to be the surface intermediates responsible for cleavage of the CC bond. The number of hydrogen atoms in the adsorbed C2Hx in which CC bond cleaves may differ from one surface to another. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because of the lack of consensus on the detailed mechanism of CC bond cleavage and the role of different surface intermediates in the reaction.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps. The first step involves the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon substrate, which is considered rate-limiting in this study. Steps 2 to 4 are quasi-equilibrated, involving the adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting stems from the complexity of the reaction mechanism and the influence of catalyst properties. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides insights into the fundamental surface chemistry of catalytic reactions, which is crucial for the development of more efficient catalysts.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon (specifically isobutane in some explanations), (2) the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed species (conversion of isobutane to isobutene and hydrogen), (3) the desorption of the dehydrogenated product (isobutene), and (4) the recombination of hydrogen atoms or the desorption of hydrogen. Based on deuterium tracing results, the literature suggests that the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon (isobutane) is the rate-limiting step in the process. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is not discussed in detail. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a framework for understanding the complex reactions that occur during catalytic dehydrogenation, but the exact rate-limiting step and the factors that influence its rate are still not fully understood. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism is still not fully understood, and there are ongoing debates about the rate-limiting step and the nature of the active sites on the catalyst. The mechanism is important for the production of petrochemicals and gasoline, and its rate-limiting step has implications for the design of catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a widely accepted model for the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons on metal surfaces. It consists of four main steps: (1) adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the metal surface, (2) dissociation of the hydrogen atoms from the hydrocarbon molecule, (3) migration of the hydrogen atoms across the metal surface, and (4) desorption of the hydrogen atoms and the dehydrogenated hydrocarbon from the metal surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the mechanism and the influence of various factors such as the nature of the metal, the hydrocarbon, and the reaction conditions. Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it is fundamental to understanding the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, which is an important process in the petrochemical industry.

The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. Ethane dehydrogenation proceeds via an end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site at the catalyst surface. This is followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen. Ethane adsorption is suggested to be the rate-determining step of the reaction. The absence of isotopic scrambling of ethylene indicates that coke deposits formed during the initial activation of the catalyst material are not involved in the ethane dehydrogenation cycle. Transient kinetic data suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of the reaction. The absence of significant differences in the tailing of the m/e 27 and m/e 28 fragments during a transient experiment indicates that neither beta-H transfer of an ethyl species nor ethene desorption is the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is not discussed in the literature. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in the development of chemical industries and the production of light alkenes.

The literature focuses on computational studies of the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and butane over Pt and Pt-Sn alloy cluster catalysts using density functional theory (DFT). The rate-determining step is identified as the cleavage of the first CH bond upon alkane adsorption. The selectivity towards alkene production is explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom and low alkene binding energies. The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. Substitution of a Sn atom in the cluster to produce a Pt3Sn cluster leads to a downward shift of the potential energy surface for the reaction and causes an increase in the activity of the catalyst due to the lower net activation barrier for the rate-limiting step. Despite the lack of discussion on the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, the literature highlights the importance of understanding the factors that influence the formation of gas-phase alkenes versus further loss of hydrogen from adsorbed alkene leading to formation of coke precursors, which remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.
