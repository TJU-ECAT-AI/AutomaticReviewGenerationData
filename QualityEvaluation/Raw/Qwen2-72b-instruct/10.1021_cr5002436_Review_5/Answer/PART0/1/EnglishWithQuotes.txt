{"Quotes": "", "English": "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a widely accepted model for the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons on metal surfaces.

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. Ethane dehydrogenation proceeds via an end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site at the catalyst surface. This is followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen. Ethane adsorption is suggested to be the rate-determining step of the reaction. The absence of isotopic scrambling of ethylene indicates that coke deposits formed during the initial activation of the catalyst material are not involved in the ethane dehydrogenation cycle. Transient kinetic data suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of the reaction. The absence of significant differences in the tailing of the m/e 27 and m/e 28 fragments during a transient experiment indicates that neither beta-H transfer of an ethyl species nor ethene desorption is the rate-limiting step of the reaction.

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The literature focuses on computational studies of the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and butane over Pt and Pt-Sn alloy cluster catalysts using density functional theory (DFT). The rate-determining step is identified as the cleavage of the first CH bond upon alkane adsorption. The selectivity towards alkene production is explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom and low alkene binding energies. The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. Substitution of a Sn atom in the cluster to produce a Pt3Sn cluster leads to a downward shift of the potential energy surface for the reaction and causes an increase in the activity of the catalyst due to the lower net activation barrier for the rate-limiting step.

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. Ethane dehydrogenation proceeds via an end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site at the catalyst surface. This is followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen. Ethane adsorption is suggested to be the rate-determining step of the reaction. The absence of isotopic scrambling of ethylene indicates that coke deposits formed during the initial activation of the catalyst material are not involved in the ethane dehydrogenation cycle. Transient kinetic data suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of the reaction.

The rate-determining step is identified as the cleavage of the first CH bond upon alkane adsorption. The selectivity towards alkene production is explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom and low alkene binding energies. The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. Substitution of a Sn atom in the cluster to produce a Pt3Sn cluster leads to a downward shift of the potential energy surface for the reaction and causes an increase in the activity of the catalyst due to the lower net activation barrier for the rate-limiting step.
