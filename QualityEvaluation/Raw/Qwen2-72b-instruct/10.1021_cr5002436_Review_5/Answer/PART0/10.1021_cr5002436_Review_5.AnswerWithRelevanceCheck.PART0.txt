          [1] "The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
          [2] "This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."
          [3] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."
          [4] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [5] "Even though the dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, the exact mechanism is still a topic under debate, particularly because this reaction is catalyzed by a vast array of materials as different as noble metals and transition metal oxides."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, following Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics where all catalyst surface sites are considered identical. The mechanism comprises four steps: the dissociative adsorption of paraffin, the cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, the formation of a hydrogen molecule, and the desorption of hydrogen and the olefin product. Both the CH cleavage steps and the dissociative adsorption of paraffin have been debated as potential rate-limiting steps. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact mechanism remains a topic of debate due to the diverse materials that can catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction, including noble metals and transition metal oxides.

          Horiuti-Polanyi机制于1934年提出，通常用于描述催化脱氢反应，遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood动力学，其中所有催化剂表面位点都被认为是相同的。该机制包括四个主要步骤：石蜡的解离吸附，从分子中裂解第二个氢原子，氢分子的形成，以及氢和烯烃的后续解吸。关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，存在持续的争论，CH裂解步骤和石蜡的解离吸附都被认为是可能的。尽管近一个世纪的研究，由于可以催化脱氢反应的材料种类繁多，包括贵金属和过渡金属氧化物，确切的机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。
