          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a widely accepted model for the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons on metal surfaces. It consists of four main steps: (1) adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the metal surface, (2) dissociation of the hydrogen atoms from the hydrocarbon molecule, (3) migration of the hydrogen atoms across the metal surface, and (4) desorption of the hydrogen atoms and the dehydrogenated hydrocarbon from the metal surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the mechanism and the influence of various factors such as the nature of the metal, the hydrocarbon, and the reaction conditions. Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it is fundamental to understanding the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, which is an important process in the petrochemical industry.

          Horiuti-Polanyi机制是广泛接受的模型，用于描述金属表面烃类的催化脱氢。它主要包含四个步骤：(1)烃类分子吸附在金属表面，(2)氢原子从烃类分子中解离，(3)氢原子在金属表面迁移，(4)氢原子和脱氢烃类从金属表面解吸。关于哪一步是限速步骤的持续争论是由于机制的复杂性以及金属、烃类和反应条件等各种因素的影响。尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它是理解烃类催化脱氢的基础，这是石化工业中一个重要的过程。
