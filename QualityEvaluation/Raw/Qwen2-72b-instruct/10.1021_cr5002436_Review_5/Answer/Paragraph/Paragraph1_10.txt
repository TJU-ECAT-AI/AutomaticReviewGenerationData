The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, a cornerstone in the field of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, has been extensively studied and debated in scientific literature for its intricate four-step process and its rate-limiting step. This mechanism involves the initial adsorption of a hydrocarbon onto a metal surface, followed by the abstraction of hydrogen atoms, the formation of a carbon-metal bond, and finally, the desorption of the dehydrogenated product. The ongoing debate centers around identifying the rate-limiting step, which is crucial for understanding the reaction kinetics and optimizing catalytic efficiency. Some researchers argue that the hydrogen abstraction step is the slowest, while others propose that the desorption of the product could be the bottleneck. Despite this debate, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a fundamental concept in catalysis, guiding the development of new catalysts and the improvement of existing ones. Its enduring significance is evident in the continuous research efforts aimed at elucidating its complexities and enhancing its practical applications in various industrial processes.
