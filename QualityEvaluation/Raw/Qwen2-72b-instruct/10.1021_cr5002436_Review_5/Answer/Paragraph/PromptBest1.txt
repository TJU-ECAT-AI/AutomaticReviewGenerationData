Ethane adsorption is suggested as the rate-determining step, supported by transient kinetic data and the absence of isotopic scrambling, indicating no involvement of coke deposits in the cycle \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\]. The ongoing debate over the rate-limiting step remains unresolved, contributing to the mechanism's enduring scientific interest and controversy, given its importance in chemical industries and light alkene production \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\]. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation involves four steps, with the rate-limiting step identified as the first CH bond cleavage upon alkane adsorption \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Selectivity towards alkene production is due to higher barriers for third hydrogen atom cleavage and low alkene binding energies \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. An adsorbed H atom facilitates alkene desorption over further dehydrogenation \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Substituting a Sn atom in a Pt3Sn cluster lowers the activation barrier for the rate-limiting step, enhancing catalyst activity \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Understanding factors influencing alkene versus coke precursor formation remains a scientific interest, highlighting the mechanism's enduring significance despite extensive study \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\].

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, pivotal for catalytic dehydrogenation on metal surfaces \[10.1021/jp909163z\], encompasses four main steps: adsorption, hydrogen dissociation, hydrogen migration, and desorption. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step reflects the mechanism's complexity and the influence of variables like metal type, hydrocarbon, and conditions \[10.1021/jp909163z\]. Despite extensive study, its significance endures due to its foundational role in understanding hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, a critical petrochemical process \[10.1021/jp909163z\].

                The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation, exemplified by ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\], involves end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site, followed by ethene and hydrogen desorption. Ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step, as indicated by transient kinetic data and the absence of isotopic scrambling, suggesting no involvement of coke deposits in the cycle \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\]. The debate over the rate-limiting step persists, contributing to the mechanism's enduring scientific interest and controversy, due to its relevance in chemical industries and light alkenes production \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\].

                The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation involves four steps, with the rate-determining step identified as the first CH bond cleavage upon alkane adsorption \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Computational studies using DFT highlight the importance of this step in ethane, propane, and butane dehydrogenation over Pt and Pt-Sn alloy catalysts \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. The selectivity for alkene production is due to higher barriers for third hydrogen atom cleavage and low alkene binding energies \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. The presence of an adsorbed H atom facilitates alkene desorption over further dehydrogenation \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Substituting a Sn atom in the cluster to form a Pt3Sn cluster shifts the potential energy surface, enhancing catalyst activity by lowering the activation barrier for the rate-limiting step \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Despite extensive study, understanding factors influencing alkene versus coke precursor formation remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\].

                The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation involves four steps: adsorption of i-C4H10 to form i-C4H9/, conversion to i-C4H8/, desorption of i-C4H8, and formation of H2 \[10.1016/0021-9517(92)90248-g\]. The rate-limiting step is debated, with some studies suggesting the conversion to i-C4H8/ is critical, while others propose desorption or H2 formation. This mechanism remains scientifically intriguing due to its insights into catalysis and potential for improving catalyst design, despite nearly a century of study \[10.1016/0021-9517(92)90248-g\].

The ongoing debate over the rate-limiting step, influenced by factors such as metal type, hydrocarbon nature, and reaction conditions, underscores the complexity of the mechanism and the need for further investigation. Future research endeavors might focus on advanced computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), to better understand the energetics of the reaction steps and the role of surface intermediates. Additionally, the development of novel catalysts, particularly those that can selectively enhance the rate-limiting step, could lead to significant improvements in catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The integration of transient kinetic data with computational models could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism, potentially leading to the design of more efficient catalysts for petrochemical and gasoline production processes.
