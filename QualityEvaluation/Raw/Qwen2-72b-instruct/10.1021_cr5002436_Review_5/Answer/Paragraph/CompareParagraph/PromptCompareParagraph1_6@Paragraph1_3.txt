The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, pivotal for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, comprises four main steps: adsorption, hydrogen dissociation, hydrogen migration, and desorption \[10.1021/jp909163z\]. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step underscores the mechanism's complexity, influenced by metal, hydrocarbon, and reaction conditions \[10.1021/jp909163z\]. Despite extensive study, its significance endures due to its foundational role in understanding petrochemical industry processes \[10.1021/jp909163z\]. Ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 exemplifies the mechanism, involving end-on dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site, followed by ethene and hydrogen desorption \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\]. Ethane adsorption is suggested as the rate-determining step, supported by transient kinetic data and the absence of isotopic scrambling \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\]. The enduring scientific interest in this mechanism stems from its role in chemical industries and light alkenes production \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\]. Computational studies focusing on the dehydrogenation of alkanes over Pt and Pt-Sn alloy catalysts using DFT reveal the cleavage of the first CH bond upon alkane adsorption as the rate-determining step \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. The presence of an adsorbed H atom facilitates alkene desorption over dehydrogenation \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Substituting a Sn atom in the cluster to create a Pt3Sn cluster lowers the potential energy surface, enhancing catalyst activity by reducing the net activation barrier for the rate-limiting step \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. The enduring scientific debate centers on the factors influencing the formation of gas-phase alkenes versus coke precursors, highlighting the mechanism's significance \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, despite nearly a century of study, remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its foundational role in understanding catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step, influenced by metal, hydrocarbon, and reaction conditions, underscores the complexity of the mechanism and highlights the need for advanced computational methods and experimental techniques to resolve the controversy. Future research endeavors might focus on developing more sophisticated models that incorporate the dynamic nature of catalytic surfaces and the influence of reaction conditions on the rate-limiting step. Additionally, the mechanism's enduring significance in chemical industries and light alkenes production ensures its continued relevance. The potential for enhancing catalyst activity by modifying the catalyst structure, as demonstrated by the substitution of Sn in Pt clusters, opens new avenues for catalyst design. Understanding the factors that influence the formation of gas-phase alkenes versus coke precursors remains a critical area of research, with implications for improving the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic dehydrogenation processes.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, a cornerstone in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, involves four principal steps: adsorption, hydrogen dissociation, hydrogen migration, and desorption \[10.1021/jp909163z\]. The identity of the rate-limiting step remains a subject of debate due to the mechanism's complexity and the influence of various factors \[10.1021/jp909163z\]. Despite nearly a century of study, its significance endures, as it underpins hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, a critical process in the petrochemical industry \[10.1021/jp909163z\].

                The mechanism's application to ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 exemplifies its four steps: end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site, followed by ethene and hydrogen desorption \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\]. Ethane adsorption is proposed as the rate-determining step, supported by transient kinetic data and the absence of isotopic scrambling, indicating no involvement of coke deposits \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\]. The ongoing debate over the rate-limiting step contributes to the mechanism's scientific interest and controversy \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\].

                Computational studies using DFT highlight the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for dehydrogenation reactions, identifying the cleavage of the first CH bond upon alkane adsorption as the rate-determining step \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Selectivity towards alkene production is attributed to higher barriers for third hydrogen atom cleavage and low alkene binding energies \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Adsorbed H atoms facilitate alkene desorption over further dehydrogenation \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Substituting Sn in Pt clusters enhances catalyst activity by lowering the activation barrier for the rate-limiting step \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Understanding factors influencing alkene versus coke precursor formation remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\].

                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism's enduring relevance in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions underscores the need for advanced computational methods and experimental techniques to resolve the identity of the rate-limiting step. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with tailored active sites to enhance selectivity and efficiency in dehydrogenation reactions. The integration of machine learning algorithms with DFT calculations could offer new insights into the complex interplay between catalyst structure and reaction kinetics. Moreover, exploring the role of surface intermediates in CC bond cleavage could open avenues for designing catalysts that optimize the balance between alkene production and coke precursor formation, potentially revolutionizing petrochemical processes.
