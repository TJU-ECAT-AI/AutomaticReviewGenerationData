The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, pivotal for catalytic dehydrogenation on metal surfaces \[10.1021/jp909163z\], encompasses four main steps: adsorption, hydrogen dissociation, hydrogen migration, and desorption. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step reflects the mechanism's complexity and the influence of variables like metal type, hydrocarbon, and conditions \[10.1021/jp909163z\]. Despite extensive study, its significance endures due to its foundational role in understanding hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, a critical petrochemical process \[10.1021/jp909163z\].

                The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation, exemplified by ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\], involves end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site, followed by ethene and hydrogen desorption. Ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step, as indicated by transient kinetic data and the absence of isotopic scrambling, suggesting no involvement of coke deposits in the cycle \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\]. The debate over the rate-limiting step persists, contributing to the mechanism's enduring scientific interest and controversy, due to its relevance in chemical industries and light alkenes production \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\].

                The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation involves four steps, with the rate-determining step identified as the first CH bond cleavage upon alkane adsorption \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Computational studies using DFT highlight the importance of this step in ethane, propane, and butane dehydrogenation over Pt and Pt-Sn alloy catalysts \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. The selectivity for alkene production is due to higher barriers for third hydrogen atom cleavage and low alkene binding energies \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. The presence of an adsorbed H atom facilitates alkene desorption over further dehydrogenation \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Substituting a Sn atom in the cluster to form a Pt3Sn cluster shifts the potential energy surface, enhancing catalyst activity by lowering the activation barrier for the rate-limiting step \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Despite extensive study, understanding factors influencing alkene versus coke precursor formation remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\].

                The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation involves four steps: adsorption of i-C4H10 to form i-C4H9/, conversion to i-C4H8/, desorption of i-C4H8, and formation of H2 \[10.1016/0021-9517(92)90248-g\]. The rate-limiting step is debated, with some studies suggesting the conversion to i-C4H8/ is critical, while others propose desorption or H2 formation. This mechanism remains scientifically intriguing due to its insights into catalysis and potential for improving catalyst design, despite nearly a century of study \[10.1016/0021-9517(92)90248-g\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, despite its age, remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its foundational role in understanding catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The ongoing debate over the rate-limiting step, influenced by factors such as metal type, hydrocarbon nature, and reaction conditions, underscores the complexity of the mechanism and the need for further investigation. Future research endeavors might focus on advanced computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), to better understand the energetics of the reaction steps and the role of surface intermediates. Additionally, the development of novel catalysts, particularly those that can selectively enhance the rate-limiting step, could lead to significant improvements in catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The integration of transient kinetic data with computational models could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism, potentially leading to the design of more efficient catalysts for petrochemical and gasoline production processes.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, a cornerstone in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, involves four principal steps: adsorption, hydrogen dissociation, hydrogen migration, and desorption \[10.1021/jp909163z\]. The identity of the rate-limiting step remains a subject of debate due to the mechanism's complexity and the influence of various factors \[10.1021/jp909163z\]. Despite nearly a century of study, its significance endures, as it underpins hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, a critical process in the petrochemical industry \[10.1021/jp909163z\].

                The mechanism's application to ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 exemplifies its four steps: end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site, followed by ethene and hydrogen desorption \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\]. Ethane adsorption is proposed as the rate-determining step, supported by transient kinetic data and the absence of isotopic scrambling, indicating no involvement of coke deposits \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\]. The ongoing debate over the rate-limiting step contributes to the mechanism's scientific interest and controversy \[10.1007/s10562-005-6521-7\].

                Computational studies using DFT highlight the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for dehydrogenation reactions, identifying the cleavage of the first CH bond upon alkane adsorption as the rate-determining step \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Selectivity towards alkene production is attributed to higher barriers for third hydrogen atom cleavage and low alkene binding energies \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Adsorbed H atoms facilitate alkene desorption over further dehydrogenation \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Substituting Sn in Pt clusters enhances catalyst activity by lowering the activation barrier for the rate-limiting step \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Understanding factors influencing alkene versus coke precursor formation remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\].

                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism's enduring relevance in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions underscores the need for advanced computational methods and experimental techniques to resolve the identity of the rate-limiting step. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with tailored active sites to enhance selectivity and efficiency in dehydrogenation reactions. The integration of machine learning algorithms with DFT calculations could offer new insights into the complex interplay between catalyst structure and reaction kinetics. Moreover, exploring the role of surface intermediates in CC bond cleavage could open avenues for designing catalysts that optimize the balance between alkene production and coke precursor formation, potentially revolutionizing petrochemical processes.
