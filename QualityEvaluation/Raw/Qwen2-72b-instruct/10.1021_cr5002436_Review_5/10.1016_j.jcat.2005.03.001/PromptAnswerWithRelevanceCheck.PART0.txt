Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, describing its four main steps and analyzing the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. Additionally, discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The literature focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane over different polymorphs of gallium oxide in the presence or absence of CO2. It does not discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论。文献的重点是不同形态的镓氧化物在二氧化碳存在或不存在的情况下对丙烷的脱氢作用。它没有讨论为什么这个机制在近一个世纪的研究后仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题。

1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The literature focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane over different polymorphs of gallium oxide in the presence or absence of CO2. It suggests that the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, which is different from the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. The reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2 account for the enhanced catalytic activity and stability in the presence of CO2. The surface acidity of the gallium oxides, related to the presence of tetracoordinated GaIV ions, facilitates the conjugated effect of protons and oxide and promotes the reaction.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有分析关于哪一步被认为是速率限制的持续争论。文献集中于在CO2存在或不存在的情况下，不同形态的氧化镓对丙烷的脱氢作用。它表明脱氢反应通过异裂解离反应途径进行，这与Horiuti-Polanyi机制不同。CO2的逆水煤气变换反应和Boudouard反应解释了在CO2存在下催化活性和稳定性的增强。氧化镓的表面酸性，与四配位GaIV离子的存在有关，促进了质子和氧化物的共轭效应，促进了反应。
