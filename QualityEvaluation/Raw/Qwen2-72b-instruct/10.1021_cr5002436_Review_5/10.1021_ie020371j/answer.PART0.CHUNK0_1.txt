1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the kinetics and mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on chromia/alumina catalysts, suggesting that the rate-determining step is isobutane adsorption, possibly on a pair of chromium and oxygen ions. The isobutene and hydrogen adsorption parameters are required in the kinetic equation for a satisfactory description of the reaction rate. The activation energy of the dehydrogenation reaction is estimated to be 133-142 kJ/mol. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is not addressed in the literature. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the lack of consensus on the rate-determining step and the need for further understanding of the reaction mechanism.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制对催化脱氢反应的详细解释。然而，它确实讨论了在铬酸铝催化剂上烷烃脱氢的反应动力学和机制，表明速率决定步骤可能是异丁烷在铬和氧离子对上的吸附。异丁烯和氢的吸附参数在动力学方程中是必需的，以获得对反应速率的满意描述。脱氢反应的活化能估计为133-142 kJ/mol。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的争论在文献中没有得到解决。由于对速率决定步骤缺乏共识以及对反应机制的进一步理解的需要，该机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题。
