1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the kinetics and mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on chromia/alumina catalysts. The rate-determining step in the dehydrogenation of isobutane has been suggested to involve alkane adsorption. The dehydrogenation activity of chromia catalysts is most often attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ ions. The active site of the catalyst has generally been described as a single ion, but if both the chromium and oxygen ions take part in the reaction, the active site should be described as a CrO pair. The findings of studies on the kinetics and mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on chromia/alumina catalysts have not always been in agreement, with different mechanisms, rate-determining steps, and kinetic models being proposed. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction mechanism and the difficulty in elucidating it with kinetic modeling of reaction rate data. Isotopic tracer studies might prove helpful in deciding among the different mechanisms.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机制催化脱氢反应的详细解释。但是，它确实讨论了在铬铝催化剂上烷烃脱氢的反应动力学和机制。异丁烷脱氢的速率决定步骤被建议涉及烷烃吸附。铬催化剂的脱氢活性通常归因于配位不饱和的Cr3+离子。催化剂的活性位点通常被描述为一个单独的离子，但如果铬和氧离子都参与反应，活性位点应该被描述为CrO对。关于铬铝催化剂上烷烃脱氢的动力学和机制的研究结果并不总是一致，提出了不同的机制、速率决定步骤和动力学模型。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的争论，是由于反应机制的复杂性和通过反应速率数据的动力学建模来阐明它的困难。同位素示踪研究可能有助于在不同的机制中做出决定。
