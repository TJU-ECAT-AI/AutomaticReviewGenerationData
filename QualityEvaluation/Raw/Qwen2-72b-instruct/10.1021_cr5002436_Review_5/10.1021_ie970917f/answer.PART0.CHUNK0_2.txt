1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps. The first step involves the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon, which is considered rate-limiting in this study. Steps 2 to 4 are quasi-equilibrated, involving the adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting stems from the fact that different studies may find different steps to be rate-limiting under different conditions. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a framework for understanding the complex surface chemistry of catalytic reactions, but the exact rate-determining step can vary depending on the catalyst, reactants, and reaction conditions.

1.霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制对于催化脱氢反应主要包括四个步骤。第一步涉及烃类的解离吸附，在本研究中被认为是限速步骤。步骤2到4是准平衡的，涉及氢气和异丁烯的吸附。关于哪一步是限速步骤的持续争论源于不同的研究在不同条件下可能发现不同的步骤是限速的。这一机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题，因为它为理解催化反应的复杂表面化学提供了一个框架，但确切的速率决定步骤可能根据催化剂、反应物和反应条件的不同而变化。
