1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps. The first step involves the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon substrate, which is considered rate-limiting in this study. Steps 2 to 4 are quasi-equilibrated, involving the adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step is not directly addressed in the literature, but the deuterium tracing results suggest that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides insights into the surface chemistry of catalytic reactions, which is crucial for the development of more efficient catalysts.

1.霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制对于催化脱氢反应主要包括四个步骤。第一步涉及烃类底物的解离吸附，本研究中认为这是速率限制步骤。步骤2到4是准平衡的，涉及氢气和异丁烯的吸附。关于速率限制步骤的持续争论在文献中没有直接提及，但根据氘示踪结果，异丁烷的解离吸附是缓慢步骤。这一机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题，因为它提供了催化反应表面化学的见解，这对于开发更高效催化剂至关重要。
