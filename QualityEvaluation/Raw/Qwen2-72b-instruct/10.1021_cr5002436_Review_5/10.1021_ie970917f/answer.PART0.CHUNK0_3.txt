1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps. The first step involves the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon substrate, which is considered rate-limiting in this study. Steps 2 to 4 are quasi-equilibrated, involving the adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is not directly addressed in the literature, but the deuterium tracing results suggest that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in understanding the catalytic processes for dehydrogenation of light paraffins, which are crucial for the production of olefins like propylene and isobutene.

1.霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制对于催化脱氢反应包含四个主要步骤。第一步涉及烃类底物的解离吸附，本研究中认为这是速率限制步骤。步骤2到4是准平衡的，涉及氢气和异丁烯的吸附。关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的持续争论在文献中没有直接提及，但氘示踪结果表明，异丁烷的解离吸附是慢步骤。该机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题，因为理解轻石脑油的脱氢催化过程对于生产像丙烯和异丁烯这样的烯烃至关重要，这些烯烃的生产非常重要。
