[1] "A four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene."

[2] "The kinetic data for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts could be described by a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene."

[3] "On the basis of the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process."

[4] "Therefore, we may assume that steps 24 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study, leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenationdehydrogenation reactions:"

1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps. The first step involves the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon substrate, which is considered rate-limiting in this study. Steps 2 to 4 are quasi-equilibrated, involving the adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting stems from the complexity of the reaction mechanism and the influence of catalyst properties. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides insights into the fundamental surface chemistry of catalytic reactions, which is crucial for the development of more efficient catalysts.
