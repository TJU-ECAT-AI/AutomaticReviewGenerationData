[2] "The kinetic data for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts could be described by a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene."

[3] "On the basis of the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process."

[4] "Therefore, we may assume that steps 24 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study, leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenationdehydrogenation reactions:"

1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps. The first step involves the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon, which is considered rate-limiting in this study. The subsequent steps involve the quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting stems from the fact that different studies may find different steps to be rate-limiting under different conditions. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a framework for understanding the complex surface chemistry involved in catalytic reactions, but the exact rate-determining step can vary depending on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst properties.

1.霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制将催化脱氢反应分为四个主要步骤。第一步涉及烃的解离吸附，本研究中认为这是速率限制步骤。后续步骤涉及氢和丁烯的准平衡吸附。关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的争论源于不同研究在不同条件下可能发现不同的步骤是速率限制步骤。这一机制之所以仍然是科学界关注和争议的焦点，是因为它为理解催化反应中复杂的表面化学提供了一个框架，但确切的速率决定步骤可能根据特定的反应条件和催化剂性质而变化。
