1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or discuss the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The document focuses on the mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation on a platinum surface, which is different from the dehydrogenation process. However, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is mentioned as the first proposed mechanism for the hydrogenation of ethylene over a platinum surface in the 1930s. The mechanism involves the chemisorption of ethylene on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carbon-carbon double bonds, forming two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate. This is followed by stepwise hydrogenation through an ethyl intermediate to ethane. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it is a fundamental model for understanding the catalytic hydrogenation of olefins, and its validity and limitations are still being explored through modern experimental techniques and theoretical calculations.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有讨论关于哪个步骤被认为是限速步骤的持续争论。该文件专注于乙烯在铂表面氢化机制，这与脱氢过程不同。然而，Horiuti-Polanyi机制被提及为1930年代首次提出的乙烯在铂表面氢化的机制。该机制涉及乙烯在干净的金属表面上的化学吸附，通过断裂一个碳-碳双键，与底层金属基底形成两个σ键。随后通过乙基中间体逐步氢化为乙烷。该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它是一个理解烯烃催化氢化的基本模型，其有效性和局限性仍在通过现代实验技术和理论计算进行探索。
