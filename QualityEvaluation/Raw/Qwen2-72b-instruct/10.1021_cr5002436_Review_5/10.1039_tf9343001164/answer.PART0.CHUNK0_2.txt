1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it describe the four main steps of the mechanism or analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The literature focuses on exchange reactions of hydrogen on metallic catalysts, specifically between benzene, ethylene, and hydrogen, and between water and benzene or ethylene. It discusses the experimental methods and results of these reactions, and the conclusions drawn about the mechanisms of these reactions. The literature does not address why the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

1.文献没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制的详细解释，也没有描述该机制的四个主要步骤，或分析关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制的持续争论。文献主要关注氢在金属催化剂上的交换反应，特别是苯、乙烯和氢之间的反应，以及水和苯或乙烯之间的反应。它讨论了这些反应的实验方法和结果，以及由此得出的关于这些反应机制的结论。文献没有涉及为什么Horiuti-Polanyi机制在近一个世纪的研究后仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题。
