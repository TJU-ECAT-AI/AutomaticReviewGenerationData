1.The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not explicitly described in the provided literature. The literature discusses the catalytic replacement of hydrogen atoms in hydrocarbons on catalytic surfaces, presenting two mechanisms (I and II) for the atomic exchange between hydrogen and benzene or ethylene. Mechanism I involves the dissociation of hydrogen or hydrocarbon molecules on the catalyst surface, while mechanism II involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms between adsorbed molecules. The authors conclude that mechanism II is responsible for the atomic exchange reactions. The rate-limiting step for these reactions is not discussed in the literature. The ongoing debate regarding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism likely concerns the details of the steps involved in mechanism II and which step is rate-limiting. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its importance in understanding catalytic reactions and the potential for improving catalytic processes.

1.在提供的文献中没有明确描述Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制。文献讨论了催化表面上烃类中氢原子的催化置换，提出了两种机制(I和II)来描述氢和苯或乙烯之间的原子交换。机制I涉及氢或烃分子在催化剂表面的解离，而机制II涉及吸附分子之间的氢原子转移。作者得出结论，机制II是负责原子交换反应的。这些反应的速率限制步骤在文献中没有讨论。关于Horiuti-Polanyi机制的持续争论可能涉及机制II中步骤的细节以及哪一步是速率限制的。由于理解催化反应的重要性以及改进催化过程的潜力，该机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题。
