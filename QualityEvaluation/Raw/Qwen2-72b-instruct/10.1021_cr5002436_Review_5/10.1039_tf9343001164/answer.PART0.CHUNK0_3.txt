1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it describe the four main steps of the mechanism or analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The literature focuses on exchange reactions of hydrogen on metallic catalysts, specifically discussing the mechanisms of atomic exchange between hydrogen and benzene or ethylene. It does not delve into the specifics of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions or the scientific interest and controversy surrounding it.
