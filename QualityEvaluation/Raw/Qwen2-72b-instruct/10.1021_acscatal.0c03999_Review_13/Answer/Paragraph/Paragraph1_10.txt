Sulfur, as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling, presents a unique set of thermodynamic properties, reaction mechanisms, and catalytic performance that distinguish it from traditional oxygen-based systems. Thermodynamically, sulfur offers a lower activation barrier for methane oxidation, potentially leading to higher yields of desired products such as methanol and acetic acid. The reaction mechanisms involving sulfur are complex, involving the formation of sulfur intermediates that can activate methane more efficiently than oxygen. This can result in improved catalytic performance, with sulfur-based catalysts showing higher activity and selectivity under certain conditions. However, the use of sulfur as an oxidant also poses significant challenges, including the potential for sulfur poisoning of catalysts and the need for sulfur recovery and recycling to maintain process efficiency and environmental sustainability. Despite these challenges, the future prospects of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling are promising, as ongoing research aims to develop more robust catalysts and optimize reaction conditions to fully harness the potential of sulfur-based systems.
