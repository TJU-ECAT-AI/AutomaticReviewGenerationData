The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling has been explored by Zhu et al. as a less active oxidant compared to traditional oxygen-based systems. The thermodynamic well for sulfur oxidation to CS2 is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV, compared to 13.41 eV for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2. This indicates a lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation with sulfur. An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C. However, high temperatures are required due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides. These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. The performance of this catalyst is relatively modest and far from practical consideration, but future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening. The MS bond energy is observed to be a good descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers.
