          [1] "Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for alkane conversion, specifically for methane oxidative coupling."
          [2] "The authors note that the thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is 13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV."
          [3] "An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C."
          [4] "High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides."
          [5] "These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2."
          [6] "While the performance of this catalyst is found to be relatively modest and far from practical consideration, it is conceivable that future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening."
          [7] "In particular, the authors have observed the MS bond energy to be a good descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers."

          The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling has been explored by Zhu et al. as a less active oxidant compared to traditional oxygen-based systems. The thermodynamic well for sulfur oxidation to CS2 is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV, compared to 13.41 eV for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2. This indicates a lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation with sulfur. An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C. However, high temperatures are required due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides. These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. The performance of this catalyst is relatively modest and far from practical consideration, but future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening. The MS bond energy is observed to be a good descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers.

          朱等人探索了硫作为另一种较不活跃的氧化剂在甲烷氧化偶联中的可能性，与传统的基于氧气的系统相比，硫是一种较不活跃的氧化剂。硫氧化至CS2的热力学井的能量显著较高，为3.45 eV，而氧气氧化甲烷至CO2的能量为13.41 eV。这表明硫的过氧化的热力学驱动力较低。在1050 C的PdS催化剂上，可以达到高达18%的乙烯选择性。然而，由于反应的热力学和硫化物催化剂上相对较高的CH活化能垒，需要高温，这些催化剂作为氢抽象剂与金属氧化物相比较差。这些能垒在MoS2上为1.91 eV，在TiS2上为2.68 eV。虽然这种催化剂的性能相对温和，远未达到实际应用的考虑，但未来的研究可以通过基于描述符的理论筛选来识别具有更高转化率的催化剂。观察到MS键能是CH活化和CC偶联反应能垒的良好描述符。
