[1] "Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for alkane conversion, specifically for methane oxidative coupling."

1.The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling has been explored by Zhu et al. as a less active oxidant compared to traditional oxygen-based systems. The thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for sulfur, with the energy barrier for sulfur oxidation to CS2 being considerably higher than that for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2. An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C. High temperatures are required due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides. The CH activation barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. The performance of this catalyst is relatively modest and far from practical consideration, but future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening. The MS bond energy is observed to be a good descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers.

1.朱等人探索了硫作为另一种较不活跃的氧化剂在烷烃转化中的可能性，特别是甲烷氧化偶联。与氧气氧化甲烷至二氧化碳的13.41 eV的热力学势相比，硫氧化至CS2的能量势要高得多，为3.45 eV。在1050 C的PdS催化剂上，可以达到高达18%的乙烯选择性。由于反应的热力学和硫化物催化剂上相对较高的CH活化能垒，需要高温进行此过程，硫化物催化剂作为氢抽象剂的性能较差，与金属氧化物相比。这些能垒在MoS2上为1.91 eV，在TiS2上为2.68 eV。虽然这种催化剂的性能相对温和，远未达到实用考虑的范围，但未来的研究可以通过基于描述符的理论筛选来识别具有更高转化率的催化剂。特别是，作者观察到MS键能是CH活化和CC偶联反应能垒的良好描述符。
