1.The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling has been explored by Zhu et al. as a less active oxidant compared to traditional oxygen-based systems. The thermodynamic well for sulfur oxidation to CS2 is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV, compared to 13.41 eV for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2. This indicates a lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation with sulfur. An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C, but high temperatures are required due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts. These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. The performance of the catalyst is relatively modest and far from practical consideration, but future studies may identify catalysts with higher conversion rates through theoretical screening.

1.朱等人探索了硫作为另一种较不活跃的氧化剂在甲烷氧化偶联中的应用，与传统的基于氧气的系统相比，硫是一种较不活跃的氧化剂。硫氧化至CS2的热力学井的能量显著较高，为3.45 eV，而氧气氧化甲烷至CO2的热力学井的能量为13.41 eV。这表明硫的过氧化的热力学驱动力较低。在1050 C的PdS催化剂上，可以达到高达18%的乙烯选择性，但由于反应的热力学和硫化物催化剂上相对较高的CH活化能垒，需要高温。这些能垒在MoS2上为1.91 eV，在TiS2上为2.68 eV。催化剂的性能相对温和，远未达到实用考虑，但未来的研究可能通过理论筛选识别出转化率更高的催化剂。
