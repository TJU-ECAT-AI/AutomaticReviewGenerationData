The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling presents a different thermodynamic profile compared to traditional oxygen-based systems. The thermodynamic well for sulfur oxidation to CS2 is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV, compared to 13.41 eV for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2. This suggests a lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation with sulfur. The reaction mechanism involves the use of gaseous sulfur flow on transition metal sulfides, with the gaseous sulfur regenerating vacancies on the surface formed from H2S desorption during methane coupling. An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C, but high temperatures are required due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts. These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. The current performance of the catalyst is modest and far from practical consideration, but future studies may identify catalysts with higher conversion rates through descriptor-based theoretical screening. The MS bond energy is observed to be a good descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers.

使用硫作为替代氧化剂在甲烷氧化偶联中的应用与传统的基于氧气的系统在热力学上呈现出不同的特征。硫氧化至CS2的热力学井的能量显著较高，为3.45 eV，而氧气氧化甲烷至CO2的能量为13.41 eV。这表明使用硫时，过度氧化的热力学驱动力较低。反应机制涉及在过渡金属硫化物上使用气态硫流，气态硫再生了在甲烷偶联过程中H2S脱附形成的表面空位。在1050 C的PdS催化剂上，可以达到高达18%的乙烯选择性，但需要高温，因为反应的热力学和硫化物催化剂上相对较高的CH活化能垒。这些能垒在MoS2上为1.91 eV，在TiS2上为2.68 eV。目前催化剂的性能较为温和，远未达到实用考虑的水平，但未来的研究可能通过基于描述符的理论筛选识别出具有更高转化率的催化剂。观察到MS键能是CH活化和CC偶联反应能垒的良好描述符。
