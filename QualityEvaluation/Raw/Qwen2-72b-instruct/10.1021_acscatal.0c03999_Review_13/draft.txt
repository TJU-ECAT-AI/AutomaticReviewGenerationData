1. Comparative analysis of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling: thermodynamics, reaction mechanisms, catalytic performance, challenges, and future prospects in contrast to traditional oxygen-based systems.

Comparative analysis of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling, as explored by Zhu et al. \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_13\], reveals a lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation compared to traditional oxygen-based systems. The thermodynamic well for sulfur oxidation to CS2 is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV, contrasting with 13.41 eV for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2. This indicates a potential for improved selectivity towards alkene products. An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C, albeit high temperatures are required due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides. These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. The performance of this catalyst is relatively modest and far from practical consideration, but future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening. The MS bond energy is observed to be a good descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The exploration of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling offers a promising avenue for improving alkene selectivity and reducing overoxidation. Future research should focus on developing catalysts with lower CH activation barriers and improved hydrogen abstraction capabilities. Descriptor-based theoretical screening could be a powerful tool in identifying such catalysts. Moreover, the MS bond energy's role as a descriptor for CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers suggests that tailoring the metal-sulfur bond strength could be a viable strategy for enhancing catalytic performance. The development of novel sulfide catalysts with optimized metal-sulfur interactions and improved hydrogen abstraction properties could lead to significant advancements in the field of alkane conversion.
