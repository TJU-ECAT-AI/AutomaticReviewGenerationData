A novel hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor for oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH) was fabricated by integrating BaBi0.05Co0.8Nb0.15O3-δ (BBCN) perovskite hollow fiber membrane with silica-supported isolated Co2+ catalyst. Two other modes of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) were studied for comparison, non-oxidative dehydrogenation (NPDH), and conventional OPDH reaction via co-feed method. The results showed excellent performance of the catalytic membrane reactor, with C3H6 yield of  50% and C3H6 selectivity of  74% ob- tained at 650 C over a 50-h long-term stability test, which are significantly higher than values obtained in the other two conventional reaction modes. Currently, this BBCN catalytic membrane reactor showed the highest C3H6 yield and best long-term stability as compared to other perovskite membrane reactors reported in litera- ture. Propane feeding rate should be adjusted to match the oxygen permeation through the membrane thus maintaining the optimum ratio between propane to oxygen; excess oxygen permeation leads to combustion of propylene product and loss of propylene selectivity, while low oxygen permeation leads to low propane con- version. High temperature favors oxygen permeation through perovskite membranes but also increases the probability of cracking reaction. Therefore, if there is enough oxygen permeation through the membrane, it is preferred to operate this reaction at a lower temperature to increase the selectivity of propylene.
1. Introduction
Propylene is an essential chemical intermediate for production of more valuable chemical products (mainly polypropylene). Catalytic propane dehydrogenation is an increasingly popular process which can be used to produce propylene [1]. Catofin (CrOx based catalyst) and Oleflex (Pt-Sn based catalyst) are most used commercialized dehy- drogenation processes for propane dehydrogenation. Both the processes show good selectivity of > 85% with once-through conversion of 40% [2]. However, there are several problems limiting the propylene production via PDH: (1) PDH reaction is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium; (2) PDH reaction is a highly endothermic reaction (Reac- tion (1)) requiring a large amount of energy; (3) the activity of the commercial catalysts show rapid deactivation due to the severe coke deposition on the catalysts surface. Hence, the commercial catalysts require frequent regeneration step within a short interval of time (1030 mins) [2,3].
C3H8C3H6+H2, ΔH(298k)=+124 kJ/mol (1) C3H8+1/2O2C3H6+H2O, ΔH(298k)=-117 kJ/mol (2) Oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH) is a promising alter- native for propylene production which can help to alleviate the lim- itations of PDH. The combination of exothermic OPDH reaction with endothermic PDH reaction helps to overcome the thermodynamic limitations of PDH, and to reduce the problem of catalyst coking thereby prevents deactivation of the catalyst. Generally, steam, CO2 and O2 are used as oxidants, with oxygen being the most efficient oxidant.
However, as olefins (C3H6) are more active than alkanes (C3H8), oxygen will also further oxidize the desired products to COx [4]. Hence, the selectivity of propylene via OPDH reaction with O2 as oxidant is much lower than that via PDH reaction.
Oxygen permeable perovskite membrane reactors have shown no- teworthy advantages to overcome aforementioned shortcomings of OPDH reaction [57]. Firstly, oxygen permeable perovskite membranes show distinctive oxygen permeability via oxygen ion conduction, offer 100% theoretical O2 selectivity through the membrane [812]. The catalytic perovskite membrane reactor integrates oxygen separation with reaction in one unit, synergistically enhances both membrane permeability and catalytic activity, resulting in process intensification [1315]. Recently, our group developed BBCN perovskite hollow fiber membranes with excellent oxygen permeability [1618].

permeation through BBCN membranes can be observed at as low as 600 C, matching the required temperature for PDH reaction [1921].
The configuration of hollow fiber membranes also provides the ad- vantage of having a significantly higher ratio of membrane surface area per reactor volume when compared to disk or tubular membranes [2232]. Moreover, oxygen can be uniformly distributed along the hollow fiber membrane to the catalyst bed resulting in improved pro- pylene selectivity.
Despite the promising benefits oxygen permeable perovskite mem- brane reactors can offer, few studies have investigated OPDH reaction via oxygen permeable perovskite membrane reactors [6,7,33,34]. To date, the best reported performance was obtained in a multistep per- meating hollow fiber membrane reactor, with a maximum propylene yield of 36%, and selectivity of 48% at 675 C [33]. However, this performance is still insufficient for industrial applications. Furthermore,none of the studies investigated the long-term stability of their per- ovskite membranes. In this work, BBCN hollow fiber membrane was integrated with silica-supported isolated Co2+ catalyst to fabricate a novel catalytic BBCN hollow fiber membrane reactor to investigate OPDH reaction (Fig. 1). The results show excellent performance with C3H6 yield of 4651% and C3H6 selectivity of 6874% obtained at 650 C, as well as excellent (50 h) long-term stability of the membranes.
So far, this BBCN catalytic membrane reactor showed the highest C3H6 yield and best long-term stability as compared to other perovskite membrane reactors reported in literature.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of BBCN hollow fiber membrane and Co (II) ions catalysts
The synthesis of BaBi0.05Co0.8Nb0.15O3-δ (BBCN) perovskite powders and the fabrication of BBCN hollow fiber membrane precursor can be found in our previous work [16,17]. Ceramic BBCN hollow fiber membranes were obtained by sintering the membrane precursor at 1175 C for 5 h. Silica-supported isolated Co2+ catalyst was synthesized via surface organometallic grafting (SOG) method with 5 wt% cobalt doping ratio, the details can be found in the literature [35].
2.2. Catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor and PDH reaction
The performance of PDH reaction via the three catalytic reactor types were tested and measured as shown in Fig. 2. Reactor (a) (R (a)):conventional packed bed reactor for non-oxidative propane dehy- drogenation (NPDH) as shown in Fig. 2(a); Reactor (b) (R (b)): con- ventional packed bed reactor with propane and O2 co-feed mode for oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH) as shown in Fig. 2(b); Reactor (c) (R (c)): catalytic BBCN hollow fiber membrane reactor for OPDH reaction as shown in Fig. 2(c). Catalyst was packed around the middle section of BBCN hollow fiber membrane and fixed by quartz wool, giving an effective membrane area of around 1 cm2. This mem- brane reactor was then placed in a tubular furnace to control the temperature. The catalyst for R (a), R (b) and R (c) is silica-supported isolated Co2+ from the same synthesis batch, with the same catalyst loading of 0.5 g in each reactor. 10 ml/min of 10% propane feed was used for all three reactors by using pure propane feed rate of 1 ml/min mixed with a pure He feed rate of 9 ml/min. For the catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor, propane was fed on the shell side of the hollow fiber membrane, and air was introduced into the lumen side of the hollow fiber membrane with flow rate of 200 ml/min. The flow rate of all inlet gases (C3H6, He and Air) were controlled using mass flow controllers (Brooks 5850E). Both inlet and outlet gas flow rates were also measured using a bubble flow meter. OPDH reaction via the cat- alytic membrane reactor was initiated at 600 C with the reactor tem- perature slowly ramped up to 700 C. All reaction products were passed through a condenser held at 5 C to condense any moisture before being injected to a Gas Chromatography (GC) system equipped with a thermal conductivity (TCD) detector.

2.3. Characterization
The crystal phase structures of fresh and spent membranes after reaction were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD- 6000 power diffract meter) using Cu K-α radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).
Continuous scan mode was used to collect 2θ data from 20 to 80 at room temperature. Specific surface area of this catalyst was also de- termined via nitrogen physical adsorption at 77 K with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system, using the BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) method.
The specific area of the silica-supported isolated Co2+ catalyst was measured to be about 1026 m2/g. Carbon residue on the spent catalyst after PDH reaction was measured via thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). Around 10 mg spent catalyst was used for TGA analysis and heated in static air while the temperature was increased to 900 C at a ramping rate of 10 C/min. Surface morphology and element compo- sition for fresh and spent membranes were measured using a Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX, JEOL, JSM-6701F). The samples were degassed under va- cuum condition to remove impurities. Platinum coating (about10nm thickness) was carried out at 20 mA for 60 s to increase the electron conductivity for SEM-EDX. UVvisible absorption spectroscopy mea- surements for the fresh and spent catalysts were also carried out on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer using barium sulfate as a reference.
3. Results and discussion
The performances of all three types of reactors are shown in Fig. 3.
As shown in Fig. 3(c), the novel catalytic membrane reactor (R (c)) showed excellent performance, with C3H6 yield of 4651%, C3H8 con- version of 6275%, and C3H6 selectivity of 6874% achieved at 650 C in the long-term (50 h) stability test. In contrast, it can be seen from Fig. 3(a) that the reaction mode R (a) showed initial C3H8 conversion increases to 70% in 6 h duration, and then sharply decreases to 24% after 50 h duration, corresponding to a 66% loss in activity. Meanwhile, C3H6 selectivity was observed to drop from 81% to 67% in the same time-period. This phenomenon is attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface during PDH reaction, which will be illustrated using TGA analysis. In reaction mode R (b), using the co-feed mode for OPDH reaction, the flow rate of oxygen introduced was same as the total oxygen permeation through BBCN hollow fiber membrane in R (c),which is around 0.40.5 ml/min. As apparent in Fig. 3(b), the OPDH reaction in co-feed mode showed a stable performance over 50 h. C3H8 conversion was around 52% and 48% while C3H6 selectivity is around 39% and 46% when the flowrate of O2 was at 0.5 and 0.4 ml/min re- spectively. Generally, OPDH reaction delivers higher conversion and lower selectivity compared to non-oxidative PDH (NPDH) reaction.
However, the C3H8 conversion from R (b) was less than that from R (a).
This could be due to the Co (II) ions getting partially oxidized to cat- alytically inactive Co (III) ions which do not have catalytic activity for PDH reaction [3638]. Oxygen could not be distributed uniformly in the catalyst bed in the co-feed mode for OPDH reaction, with oxygen concentration at the inlet expected to be higher than that at the outlet as it gets consumed by the reaction. After reaction, the color of the catalyst bed was not uniform and showed a color gradient from light gray near the inlet to black near the exit of the catalyst bed. Hence, it can be inferred that the inlet part of the catalyst bed might be oxidized to Co (III) under a comparably higher oxygen concentration. In con- trast, oxygen was distributed uniformly along the catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor resulting in a lower oxygen concentration, which prevents further oxidation of Co (II) ions. This conclusion will be fur- ther illustrated using UVvis spectrophotometric analysis.
The selectivity of side products from the three reactor types are shown in Fig. 4. In all three types of catalytic reactors, C2H4, C2H6 and CH4 were found to be side products which are attributed to thermal cracking reaction. It also can be found from Fig. 4(b) and (c) that CO and CO2 were produced from R (b) and R (c) due to combustion Fig. 3.

4 2 3 8 reaction. Regarding NPDH reaction, it can be seen from Fig. 4(a) that all side products increased with time. Due to coke deposition on the sur- face of the catalyst, active sites are blocked leading to the weaker ad- sorption of propane, and there is a possibility for thermal cracking being prominent in the absence of availability of active sites at 650 C.
In OPDH reaction (R (b)), it can be seen from Fig. 4(b) that CO se- lectivity was around 16% and 12%, while CO2 selectivity was around 10% and 8% under the two different oxygen feed rates. In contrast, it can be seen from Fig. 4(c) that CO and CO2 selectivity was around 46% in R (c). This shows that COx side products from deep combustion can be effectively inhibited using the catalytic hollow fiber membrane re- actor over the oxygen co-feed reactor.
It is well known that oxygen permeation through perovskite mem- brane increases with increasing temperature. For OPDH reaction, low oxygen permeation will be insufficient in improving reaction activity while excess oxygen permeation will lead to combustion of desirable products to undesirable side products (COx). Hence, appropriate oxygen permeation is required to match propane feeding rate. As seen from Fig. 5, low conversion and high selectivity can be obtained at 600 C. At this temperature, the oxygen permeation through BBCN membrane was very low, which suggests that most of the reaction happening was the NPDH reaction. On the other hand, high conversion but low selectivity was obtained at 700 C. At this temperature, excess of oxygen leads to formation of undesirable combustion products, and the high tempera- tures also leads to severe propane cracking [3638]. Both high con- version and high selectivity was achieved at 650 C. At this tempera- ture, the oxygen permeation was optimal for OPDH reaction, trading off some selectivity for an increase in conversion. Moreover, the catalytic activity of the catalyst was also maintained due to the removal of carbon residue on the catalyst by permeated oxygen.
In addition, 24% H2 can be detected in the products of OPDH re- action via BBCN catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor. This suggests that both the true OPDH reaction (Reaction (2)), NPDH reaction (Re- action (1)), as well as combustion are happening at the same time [1].
Even though increasing oxygen permeation could enhance the con- version of propane and the stability of the catalyst, the loss of propene selectivity may make the process uneconomical. Hence, oxygen Fig. 4. The selectivity of side products from PDH reaction via three types of catalytic reactors: a) PDH reactor, b) OPDH reactor with O2 co-feed, c) BBCN catalytic membrane reactor.

The spent catalysts of three type catalytic reactors show different color after reaction as shown in Fig. 2. The spent catalyst after long- term NPDH reaction in R (a) shows a uniform black color; the one after long-term conventional OPDH reaction in R (b) shows a color gradient from light gray (inlet part of the catalyst bed) to black (outlet part of the catalyst bed); the one after long-term OPDH reaction via the novel catalytic membrane reactor R (c) shows a uniform gray color. To measure the carbon residue on the catalyst, all spent catalysts were analyzed by TGA. Spent catalyst near the inlet and outlet sections of reactor R (b) were individually collected for TGA analysis. The results are shown in Fig. 6. It was observed that R (a) experiences the most weight loss of almost 50%. This severe weight loss suggests that a large amount of carbon was deposited on the spent catalyst after long-term NPDH reaction, which could explain why the conversion sharply de- creased after 6 h of reaction. The carbon residue can be inhibited via catalytic oxygen permeable membrane reactor R (c), as seen from the reduced weight lost to around 20%. Further increase of oxygen per- meation could further prevent the formation carbon residue, but at the cost of selectivity, as shown in Fig. 5. Spent catalyst extracted from R (b) at the inlet and outlet part of the catalyst bed show different weight loss, with 3.2% weight loss in the inlet part and 32% weight loss in the outlet part. This result was consistent with the explanation from Fig. 3 that oxygen concentration decreases as it passes through the catalyst bed due to it being consumed as the reactant gases travel down the reactor.
The micro-morphology and elemental composition of fresh and spent membranes were detected by SEM-EDX analysis. It can be seen from Fig. 7(a) that the SEM image of fresh membrane showed free from voids or other defects was formed - all ceramic grains were interlinked with clear grain boundaries visible. After the reaction, on the outer surface of spent membrane, the boundaries of ceramic grains became indistinctive as shown in Fig. 7(b). Comparison with EDX spectrums of the fresh membrane with that of spent membrane, a large amount of carbon element are shown on the spent membrane after long-term reaction, which could be attributed to some carbon residue on the surface of spent membrane. It also can be observed from EDX spectrums that barium element was enriched on the spent membrane after long- term reaction which could be attributed to the formation of barium carbonate as barium in the perovskite membrane reacts with CO2 produced from OPDH reaction. Similar findings were reported in our previous work for other reactions via catalytic reactors [14,15]. How- ever, the change only happened on the surface of the membrane, the bulk of membrane was still intact as shown in Fig. 8. XRD analysis of the spent membrane showed the same XRD patterns as the fresh membrane, showing cubic perovskite phase structure without any im- purity phase. This result confirms that the membrane remains intact even after long-term reaction.
The UVvis spectra of both fresh and spent catalysts in the reaction mode R (b) are shown in Fig. 9. The UVvis spectra for both samples exhibit three absorption peaks at around 525, 590 and 640 nm, which can be assigned to the 4A2(F) 4T1(P) transition of Co (II) ions in tet- rahedral structure [39,40]. However, one broad peak can be found on the UVvis spectra of spent catalysts after reaction in R(b), which can be assigned to the charge transfer from O (II) to Co (III) in Co3O4[41,42]. This suggests that the isolated Co (II) ions are partially oxidized to Co (III) ions which are catalytically inactive in the PDH reaction. This also explains the decrease of propane conversion after gas phase oxygen was introduced into the packed bed catalytic reactor. Pre- mixed propane and gas phase oxygen leads to an oxygen concentration gradient along the catalyst bed, and the initial high oxygen con- centration leads to the oxidization of functional Co (II) ions near the reactor inlet. In contrast, oxygen can be uniformly distributed along the catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor, which allows for controlled introduction of oxygen into the PDH reaction to prevent undesirable combustion of products and oxidation of catalysts.
The performance of BBCN catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor was compared with that of other perovskite membrane reactors re- ported in literature for OPDH reaction, the comparison of performances was summarized in Table 1. The catalytic BBCN membrane reactor shown in this work has a better performance than any other reactor reported in literature, both in selectivity and yield. In addition, our study is the first study to carry out a long-term stability test and showed a stable performance of the hollow fiber membrane reactor during a 50 h test for OPDH reaction.
4. Conclusions
The catalytic BBCN perovskite hollow fiber membrane reactor was investigated for OPDH reaction. The results show that high C3H6 yield ( 50%) and selectivity ( 74%) can be achieved from the catalytic membrane reactor, which was more than twice the yield and selectivity that was obtained from the conventional co-feed mode reactor. In ad- dition, the catalytic membrane reactor shows a good stability over 50 h,a marked improvement over conventional packed bed reactor for NPDH reaction. To achieve the optimum performance via this catalytic per- ovskite hollow fiber membrane reactor for OPDH reaction, it is im- portant to maintain the proper propane feed to oxygen permeation ratio. If oxygen permeation is sufficient, the operating temperature should be further decreased to prevent undesirable cracking. Therefore,the development of low temperature oxygen permeable membrane is Fig. 9. UVvis spectra of fresh and spent catalysts of R (b).
