How does the use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling compare to traditional oxygen-based systems in terms of thermodynamics, reaction mechanisms (including surface vs. gas-phase reactions), catalytic performance, and alkene selectivity, and what are the key challenges and opportunities for future improvements in this approach?
