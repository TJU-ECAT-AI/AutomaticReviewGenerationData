A similar reaction cycle is claimed by ARCO to occur with tetra-alkylammonium salts of the anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid in aqueous methanol, giving good yields of propylene epoxide.570 Following the methodology of generating H2O2 in situ, the most direct way to make this would be using O2 and H2. This is done by carrying out the propylene epoxidation on a bifunctional catalyst formed by Pd and Pt on TS-1. The noble metal catalyzes the formation of H2O2 from H2 and O2, while the TS-1 will react the formed H2O2 with propylene to give the epoxide. An optimized catalyst gives propylene oxide with selectivities up to 85% at conversions between 15 and 20%.75 Two drawbacks of this process is the need to operate under conditions close to the explosion limit, and the formation of propane coming from hydrogenation of propylene.It is interesting to point out that when a catalyst formed by gold dispersed on TS-1 is used to epoxidize propylene with H2O2 formed in situ by reacting H2 and O2 at low temperature, no propane is formed and the selectivity to epoxide is high (99%), but conversion is low (<2%).571 There is no doubt that this system deserves further work trying to find the reasons for the low conversion obtained.Transition metal substituted molecular sieves have also been used as selective catalysts for oxidizing saturated hydrocarbons using molecular oxygen. For instance, V-containing silicalite showed activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. In this sense, Zatorski et al.572 have carried out selectively the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with O2 and N2O. The success of vanadium silicalite for the above reaction is attributed to the presence of vanadium (V) as the sole site of oxygen activation together with the absence of Brnsted acidity and a limited tendency for oxygen insertion or alkene activation at allylic positions due to the presence of stable VOSi bonds containing nonelectrophilic bridging oxygen ions, and a stable coordination of vanadium.573 Transition metals such as Cr3+, CoIII, MnIII, FeIII substituted in molecular sieve AlPO type structures could, in principle, in the presence of oxygen and saturated hydrocarbons favor the production of the free radicals involved in the oxyfunctionalization process. The existence of a radical mechanism for the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons using transition metals substituted AlPOs has been demonstrated by observing not only the reaction induction period and the diminishing of this when small amounts of a free radical initiator (TBHP) are added, but also by the reaction inhibitor effect of the well-known free radical scavenger hydroquinone.574,575 Indeed, chromium substituted aluminophosphate-5 (CrAPO-5) was active for the liquid-phase autoxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone with O2, in the presence of small amounts of alkyl hydroperoxide initiator. Tetralin, indone, and ethylbenzene have also been converted to the corresponding ketones.452,454,574 Unfortunately, the system is not fully heterogeneous due to some leaching of Cr3+ occurring during the reaction. Similarly, the use of acetic acid solvent during the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid using CoAPO-5 results in leaching of cobalt, being the leached cobalt responsible for the catalytic activity.576 There is an interesting study on CoAPO-5 showing that in the presence of a strong apolar solvent, only an extremely low amount of Co is leached at conversion levels below 10% that cannot explain the autoxidation activity.523 When conversion level increases the acids formed in consecutive reactions enhances considerably Co leaching.The interest of cyclohexane oxidation to produce cyclohexanone (for production of ε-caprolactam) and adipic acid (for producing polyamide fibers and polyurethane resins) strongly justify further efforts in looking for a selective heterogeneous catalyst for cyclohexane autoxidation. Recently, MnAPO-18 and MnAPO-36 have been reported to be stable catalysts for the autoxidation of cyclohexane when using the substrate as solvent.577,578 In this case, the influence of the level of conversion on leaching should also be carefully addressed.A novel concept and very promising system to effect the oxidation of alkanes and unsaturated hydrocarbons consists of taking advantage of the electrostatic fields experienced inside the zeolite supercages, particularly those ion-exchanged with alkaline-earth cations, to stablize the collisional charge-transfer complexes between molecular oxygen and alkanes, alkenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. 579-585 The hydrocarbon oxygen complexes undergoes a considerable stabilization (up to 8 kcal/mol). This stabilization can be experimentally demonstrated by measuring in the UVVis spectrum the λmax of the corresponding CT complexes and observing a gradual shift toward longer wavelengths as the Coulombic fields inside the zeolite cages increase. By selective excitation of these CT complexes with visible red light, the corresponding hydroperoxides are formed with almost complete selectivity. The course of the irradiation can be followed and the reaction intermediates characterized by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy of zeolite wafers in which the hydrocarbon and oxygen have been coadsorbed from the vapor phase. In this way, cyclohexane can be oxidized by oxygen to cyclohexane hydroperoxide with an almost complete selectivity at very high cyclohexane conversion. The proposed reaction mechanism is indicated in Scheme 46 and is thought to involve and initial electron transfer within the alkaneoxygen complex followed by hydrogen abstraction with the formation in a cage of a geminate carbon centered radical and a hydroperoxyl radical. This radical pair readily recombines to the alkylhydroperoxide. In this hydrocarbon selective oxidation, the zeolite plays a passive role merely defining a highly polar reaction cavity in which the CT complex becomes stabilized. Clearly, it would be worth exploring the promising opportunities of this remarkable stabilization of the contact charge transfer complex in continuous flow operation. Also, the development of the thermal version of this originally photochemical reaction will be of large interest due to the problem of reactor design using light as reagent and the economy of the process. 586 Scheme 46 Following with catalytic photochemical irradiation to oxidize alkanes, it has been established that the IR photolysis of alkanes on the surface of a solid can also promote their oxidation. Thus, laser stimulated isobutane selective oxidation to methacrylic acid over mixed lithium, lead phosphate has been reported. 587 For samples containing 5% Li3PO4, surface characterization indicates that the main crystal phase exposed to isobutane is Pb3(PO4)2 in which Li3PO4 is dispersed like in molecular state. Lewis basic sites are oxygens of the PO and POP groups, and Lewis acid sites are Pb2+ and Li+. The two terminal methyl groups are supposed to be chemisorbed on the terminal oxygen of neighboring Lewis basic sites. Laser photons at 1048 cm-1 in the IR region excited the PO bonds and after 1000 laser pulses the conversion of isobutane is about 8.2%. The product distribution is isobutene, methacrylic alcohol, and methacrylic acid, the selectivity to the latter exceeding 66%.587 Analogously, methanol undergoes IR laser-stimulated oxidative coupling to ethylene glycol on solid Li3PO4, FePO4, and Li3PO4 (5%)/FePO4. 588,589 Spectroscopic and desorption techniques support that there are two kinds of methanol adsorption on the surface of these phosphates. Adsorption through the interaction of CH on PO groups of the catalyst and dissociative adsorption of •CH2OH radicals on Lewis acid sites located on metal ions. Then, selective excitation of the solid surface PO bonds using a IR 1077 cm-1 laser pulse causes the vibrational activation of the surface lattice oxygen which on reaction with adsorbed CH3OH leads to hydrogen atom abstraction forming •CH2OH and enhancing of the oxidative coupling to ethylene glycol.588,589 The increase in the reaction temperature promotes product desorption, but also thermal reactions with formation of byproducts such as dimethyl ether, formaldehyde, and ethylene. Given the higher penetration power of IR radiation on solids, it would be of much interest to expand and explore the possibility to apply IR irradiation to promote alkane oxidation and other types of catalytic reactions.A heterogeneous cobalt catalyst based on an immobilized trimeric cobalt complex on MCM-41 has been claimed for the conversion of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in an aerobic system using the substrate as solvent. The turnover numbers are modest (2 mol/site/h). Again leaching may be an issue when adipic acid will be formed at higher conversion levels.An active epoxidation catalyst based on silica and MCM-supported metal complexes with the triazacyclononane ligand system has been prepared. 590 One of the N atoms is covalently linked to the silica wall through a glycidyl or chloropropyl linker. The other two N atoms were reacted with propylene oxide. Using the epoxidation of styrene as a test reaction, it was found the selectivities and turnover numbers are higher for MCM-derived materials than for silica.590 Liquid-phase partial oxidation of alkyl aromatic compounds by air at atmospheric pressure has been conducted in the presence of chemically modified mesoporous silica containing chromium ions strongly coordinated to a carboxylate group covalently attached to the silica surface. 591 The preparation procedure is indicated in Scheme 47. This solid catalyst can effect the oxidation of neat ethylbenzene in air at reflux temperature with an isolated acetophenone yield of 50%. The catalyst was reused twice without any regeneration or conditioning treatment, by simply decanting the liquid from the reactor and adding fresh substrate. No leaching of the chromium was observed. The same catalyst also performs successfully for p-chlorotoluene and p-xylene.591 It was claimed that the activity of this mesoporous silica-supported chromium catalyst is significantly higher than the commercially supported chromium catalyst.Scheme 47 In the case of n-alkane oxyfunctionalization, oxidation at low temperatures and at the terminal carbon is highly preferred. A recent work has showed that Co and MnAlPO-18 is a regioselective oxidation catalyst for n-alkanes. Because of the end-on approach of the n-paraffin in ALPO-18, owing to the pore dimensions and topology of this molecular sieve, only the C1 and C2 positions are preferentially oxidized. When other structures with larger pore dimensions (AlPO-36 and AlPO-5) are used, oxyfunctionalization is predominant at the C3 and C4 positions.301 b.Catalyst for Epoxidation of Propylene. The oxidation of olefins by molecular oxygen was applied commercially to ethylene, but oxygen epoxidation for larger olefins has been mostly unsuccessful using transition metal substituted molecular sieves as catalysts. The failure to directly epoxidize allylic olefins to their corresponding epoxides, and more specifically the case of propylene, can be related to the fact that the bond dissociation energy of the allylic CH bond in propylene is 77 kcal mol-1 much smaller than the corresponding dissociation energy of the vinylic CH bond in ethylene that is 112 kcal mol-1. 592 Then, abstraction of the allylic CH bond by O2 in propylene is considerably favored compared to the case of ethylene and consequently the selectivity to the epoxide is lower.A large effort has been done for the development of soluble metal and metal complexes able to oxidize long chain olefins in liquid phase using O2 as a direct oxidant. In general it can be said that the most important limitations for the use of liquid-phase olefin epoxidation using solid catalysts are the low rates and low turnover frequencies, together with the too low selectivity to the desired epoxide owing to the presence of less desired free radical chain reactions. 593 Molten salt mixtures of LiNO3, NaNO3 have been used for epoxidation of propylene with O2 in vapor phase. However, it is not proven that molten salts apart from being the solvent act as catalysts. It is believed that the reaction is mainly thermal while some of the propylene oxide can also be produced from the co-oxidation of C3H6 by the peracids formed as subproducts in the thermal process.We have discussed above about the indirect way of using O2 as an oxidant to generate in situ H2O2 and using Ti-containing molecular sieves, as catalysts. Besides these interesting results, it has been recently described a non-molecular sieve oxidation catalysts formed by gold supported on TiO2. 594,595 This catalyst is able to generate in situ H2O2 and then to oxidize propylene to epoxide when a reactant mixture of propylene, O2, and H2 is used. An important catalyst characteristic is that Au particles must have a hemispherically shape with sizes between 2.0 and 4.0 nm in diameter. The formation of small Au particles on the surface of TiO2 is achieved by depositionprecipitation of Au(OH)3, starting from a basic solution of chloriauric acid at pH = 710. After washing the sample, the catalyst is calcined at 400 C to form the gold particles.The catalyst active sites are believed to be TiAu bridged sites that would form the activated molecular oxygen species. Reaction with H2 forms the hydroperoxo species that will be responsible for the epoxidation of propylene.332 This mechanism implies that the active sites for the reaction must exist at the interfacial edge of the hemispherical Au particles and the TiO2 support. This, indeed, would be consistent with the observation that the activity of an Au-supported TiO2 catalyst is higher than that of Au/TS-1 at the same Au weight loadings and crystallite size.571 Despite the high selectivities to propylene oxide obtained with the Au/TiO2 system, conversions are low, and turnover frequencies with this system for propylene epoxidation are on the order of 20200 times lower than for the epoxidation of ethylene with silver catalysts. An additional drawback of the Au/TiO2 catalyst is deactivation. Nevertheless, a considerable effort is currently being devoted to improve catalyst life and activity by means of modifying the Ti-containing support and catalyst preparation procedures. 596-599 Direct epoxidation of propylene with O2 has been carried out using silver catalysts. If the silver ethylene oxidation catalyst is used directly for the epoxidation of propylene very poor results are obtained. However, activity and selectivity improve when silver powder is slurred with group IIA metal halides, or when silver is combined with K+ and CaCO3. 600-603 Promising catalytic systems based on the above ideas have been described by Gaffney et al. 604-608 These systems use silver catalyst modified by K, Cl, Mo, Re, W as promoters and CaCO3, together with the introduction in the reactor of chlorine (in the form of ethyl chloride, up to 500 ppm) and up to 500 ppm of NO. With this catalytic system, 3.2% conversion levels with 59% selectivity to propylene oxide are achieved, the yield being not high enough for commercial application. The activity of the above catalyst has been explained by the authors assuming selective sites at the interface of Ag and CaCO3. If this is so, then the introduction of high levels of K and Cl that are responsible for increasing catalyst selectivity may be due to the selective poisoning of the less selective Ag sites at the surface of the silver surface in benefit of the desirable, more selective Ag sites at the interface of silver and CaCO3. If this hypothesis is true, increasing the surface contact between silver and CaCO3 should result in an increase of the active and selective sites and therefore in an increase in propylene yield.Silver on alumina modified with Cs or Tl is a selective catalyst for the epoxidation of higher olefins that do not contain reactive allylic hydrogen atoms. 609-616 This catalyst was specially useful in the epoxidation of 1,4-butadiene (Scheme 48). The epoxidation of butadiene results in a selectivity to 1,2-epoxybutene of 95% with conversions close to 13%.Scheme 48 The process uses a lower hydrocarbon as an inert co-feed that lowers the reaction temperature from 220 to 200 C. This process is commercially used today.Besides butadiene, Monnier610 has reported the selective epoxidation of other higher nonallylic olefins as the ones summarized in Table 5 using Csl, CsCl, and RbCl promoted Ag/Al2O3 silver on alumina catalysts.Table 5. Epoxidation of Olefins with CsCl Promoted Ag/Al2O3 Catalystsa aTaken from ref 610.This catalytic system offers great potential and deserves further studies to determine which are the active sites and then to introduce rational catalyst modifications trying to increase their turnover number, activity, and selectivity. c.Oxidation of Ethane and Ethylene. A catalytic process for the direct oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid started commercially in 1997. 617-619 In this context, a metal catalyst with the composition TiPd0.01K0.03POx has been claimed to convert a mixture of ethylene and air at 205 C and 180 psi to acetic acid in 72.8% and ethylene glycol. Analogously, propylene was oxidized to acetone and propylene glycol using the same catalyst. 620,621 Ethane can also be directly oxidized to acetic acid using Re0.117VO0.254Nb0.067Sb0.03K0.05, Mo56Re6V26Nb7Sb3Ca2, a titania modified VPO catalyst, or a metal modified VPO catalysts. 622-625 A recent process gives high conversions and yields of acetic acid with a feed composed by 2% ethylene98% ethane in a fluidized bed of Mo0.37Re0.25V0.26Nb0.7Sb0.03Ca0.02Ox using a gas recycle to obtain at 500 C and 400 psi, high selectivities at ethane/ethylene conversion of 97% (Table 6).Table 6. Product Distribution for the Ethane/Ethylene Oxidation by O2 at 500 C, and 400 psi in the Presence of Mo0.37Re0.25V0.26Nb0.7Sb0.03Ca0.02Oxa product selectivity/mol% aceticacid 88.9 ethanol 0.2 ethylacetate 0.2 carbondioxide 7.2 carbonmonoxide 3.5 aTaken from ref 625.It is interesting to point out that despite the extensive and excellent work carried out by BP on the production of acetic acid using solid catalysts, it was announced that they are commercially introducing an Ir carbonylation catalyst called CATIVA.Catalytic oxidation of paraffins and olefins to products such as maleic anhydride, methacrylic acid, acrolein and acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile is a very active area of research and it has been discussed in part when commenting on the vanadium-containing catalysts.
IV. Application of Lewis Acid Catalyzed Oxidations in Various Fields
A. Examples of Catalytic Oxidations with Lewis Acids in Biochemistry
Lewis acid catalyzed oxidations have also a wide occurrence in biochemistry. Cellular oxidative stress has recently attracted considerable interest since it has been blamed, among other effects, as one of the main factors responsible for aging. The biomolecules involved in the oxidative stress, the transformations that they undergo, and the natural protecting mechanisms are the main aspects recently investigated related to catalytic oxidation. Also relevant to this review are those enzymatic systems that catalyze biochemical oxidations. Given the extension of these topics, only some pertinent contributions will be covered.
Transition metals in trace amounts have been found to be responsible for the oxidation of some biomolecules. Biomolecules can be damaged by oxidation and lose their function. A water-soluble salen Mn(III) or Ni(II) complex can act as efficient catalyst for the oxidative cleavage of DNA by magnesium monoperoxyphthalate at concentrations as low as 1 μM. 626 In contrast, other metal complexes do not induce any significant DNA damage at micromolar concentrations.626 It can be a metal ion interaction in the oxidative stress process. Thus, Zn2+ ions acts as inhibitors of the Cu2+ and Fe2+-initiated lipid oxidation, but do not prevent other oxidation processes that are promoted by other initiators such as azo compounds, UV irradiation, superoxide, or peroxinitrite. 627 The presence of Zn2+ does not change the physical properties of bilipidic membranes, but its mechanism of oxidation inhibition is related to its binding to the negative sites of the bilipidic membranes preventing Cu2+ and Fe2+ in occupying these negative positions on the membrane.627 The previous examples demonstrate that appropriate analytical techniques are necessary to quantify metal ions at low concentrations. In the context of assessing the presence of trace metal concentrations with, however, catalytic activity, it has been proposed that the lack of occurrence of ascorbate (vitamin C) autoxidation in aerated aqueous solutions at neutral pH is a test reaction to assess the total absence of transition metal ions in aqueous buffer solutions for biomedical applications. Vitamin C is an important water-soluble natural antioxidant. It was found that in metal-free, air-saturated aqueous solutions, the first-order rate constant of ascorbate disappearance at pH 7 has to be lower than 6 × 10-7 s-1. 628 Acceleration of ascorbate oxidation indicates the presence of transition metals even in trace amounts. 629 In a parallel way to ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol (vitamin E) is the most important lipid soluble antioxidant in human plasma. However, α-tocopherol has been found to promote oxidation of lipoproteins as it was demonstrated by the transformation of cholesteryl esters into their hydroperoxides. 630 In vitro and in vivo α-tocopherol-depleted lipoproteins and plasma lipids were highly resistant to hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals peroxidation at mild radical flux. Wherever tested (in vivo or in vitro), the oxidability of low-density lipoproteins increases with α-tocopherol content. However, under high fluxes of ROO• and •OH, the influence α-tocopherol changes from pro- to antioxidant, with the switching point for •OH being lower than for ROO•.630 Highly reactive radicals (such as •OH) promote oxidative stress in biomolecules under aerobic conditions. The oxidative stress is initiated by hydrogen abstraction or even electron transfer from an electron-rich moiety of the biomolecule to the aggressive radical. Hydroxyl radicals can be formed in solutions containing oxygen or hydrogen peroxide when trace transition metals are present. From there, it derives the importance to determine the presence of peroxides in biochemical fluids. A procedure developed for the detection of hydrogen peroxide in biological fluids involves contacting the solution with a redox indicator and an iron metal complex of creatinine or guanidine. 631 Amino acids of peptides and proteins can undergo irreversible modification, activity loss, and increased susceptibility to proteolysis and fragmentation initiated by hydroxyl radicals generated from hydrogen peroxide in the presence of metals. For instance, it has been reported that histidine amino acid undergoes very easily a chemical degradation by hydroxyl radicals. 632 Related with the understanding of amyloid β deposits that appear in Alzheimer and mad cow diseases, it was reported that these amyloids were able to generate free radicals detectable by conventional ESR spectroscopy. It was even proposed that these radicals produce the neurotoxicity manifested in these diseases. Subsequent studies, however, have shown that these radicals are indeed formed by traces of transition metals present as impurities in the commercial di-N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone reagent used as the ESR detectable radical source. 633 There is one type of liquid chromatography to separate biomolecules based on metal affinity. In this chromatography, the stationary phase contains an immobilized transition metal complex that interacts with the biomolecule. Using lactate dehydrogenase as a probe enzyme, it was demonstrated that liquid chromatography based on a metal affinity column using immobilized Cu2+-iminodiacetic acid may produce the partial or total inactivation of a enzyme when oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or reducing agents such as ascorbate are present in the eluate. In the absence of redox reagents, no decrease in the enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenase was observed. The results show that one has to be aware of the possibility that this type of liquid chromatography alters a biomolecule during the purification process. 634 Magnesium can act as Lewis acid and through binding with a carbonyl group can control the stereochemistry of the oxidation of NADH analogues by p-benzoquinones. 635 The axis of the carbonyl group bound to the dihydropyridine heterocycle forms a dihedral angle of 55. Without Mg2+ ion, the anti hydrogen with respect to the carbonyl group is 3 to 30 times much more reactive than the corresponding syn hydrogen. In contrast, when Mg2+ binds to the carbonyl group the selectivity is shifted toward syn preference.635 This is a good example of Lewis acid assisted oxidation in which the product stereoselectivity is controlled by the Lewis acid interaction with a remote group.
Frequently, enzymes have an active center surrounded by a proteinic backbone that modulates the activity of the center and defines the reaction cavity in which the transformation is going to occur. In many aspects, this situation is similar to that occurring in some porous solid catalysts, in which the active site is embedded in the interior of a rigid matrix. In some way, enzymes have inspired some advances in heterogeneous catalysis. 636-639 Manganese is an essential bioelement that is present in the active site of a large number of enzymes, such as citochromes. In this case, the enzyme contains a manganese complex with a porphyrin ligand. It is widely accepted that manganese plays two functional roles. 640 Mn2+ acts as Lewis acid like other divalent ions such as Mg2+, Ca2+, or Zn2+ like in arginase, glutamine synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate synthase, and pyruvate carboxylase. On the other hand, at higher oxidation states (Mn3+ or MnIV), manganese acts as oxidation site, like copper, iron, or cobalt. The most well-known enzymes of this type are manganese superoxide dismutase, manganese peroxidase, and manganese catalase. The last enzyme is responsible for one of the most important reactions occurring in green plants, namely, the light driven oxidation of water to oxygen and protons.640 A study on the role of non-heme iron cluster present on the flavoprotein 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA deshydratase has shown that this enzyme contains a flavin FAD unit that undergoes reversible reduction/reoxidation during the catalytic cycle, but there was not equilibration with the non-heme [4Fe-4S] cluster, iron being difficult to reduce as assessed by EPR spectroscopy. 641 Apparently, the iron cluster serves as a Lewis acid site facilitating the oxidation process by interaction with the substrate.641
B. Contribution of Permanganate to Green Chemistry
Permanganate has been the most popular oxidant whose reactions are studied in general organic chemistry textbooks,151 and its chemistry has a long and extensive story. Permanganate is frequently proposed as the prototypical stoichiometric oxidant giving metal ion or oxide products for which green chemistry is searching replacement using catalytic oxidations. The main problem of the use of permanganate arises from the need of stoichiometric amounts and the production of large amounts of metal byproducts, rather than from its toxicity. Indeed, recycling of manganese dioxide, by reducing the product in basic media can help to circumvent the problem of wastes making the use of permanganate more environmentally attractive for industrial applications. 642 In this way, there is a process in which after the use of KMnO4, the reduced Mn2+ and other manganese species are separated by adsorption on diatomite, decalite, or fuller's earth. 643 Subsequent treatment of the material retained in the filter with 1.52.5 M nitric acid solution solubilizes the K2O and transforms the Mn species into γ-MnO2 which is adequate to be used in dry cell batteries643 or can be recycled. Alternatively, dissolved manganese from industrial water can be recovered using oxidizing agent such as ClO2 or NaClO or even KMnO4 to convert Mn ions into MnO2 followed by microfiltration or ultrafiltration of the treated water. 644 One aspect of green chemistry is pollution abatement. Permanganate can contribute to the development of green chemistry by helping to degrade pollutants. 645 In this context, potassium permanganate has been widely used in drinkable water treatment plants, although its use seems to decline. According to the American Water Works Association 646 up to 40% of the water plants used KMnO4 for predisinfection/oxidation and organic removal, since it is effective to deal in potable waters with problems of iron, manganese, hydrogen sulfide, reservoir algae, and zebra mussels, while at the same time it improves the organoleptic properties of water in terms of color, odor, and taste.646 In addition, KMnO4 also produces the inactivation of bacteriophage and Legionella pneumophila. In a totally different aspect of water treatment, chemical oxygen demand is an important parameter to assess the organic content of a wastewater. Standard methods to determine such values are based on the KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7 oxidizability of wastewaters. 647 Permanganate is a strong oxidant that has been used for the degradation of industrial pollutants and metal ions in effluents. 648-650 Thus, it is particularly suitable to oxidize phenols that are organic pollutants refractory to biological water remediation with bacteriae. Phenols are found in high concentration in industrial wastewaters from the petrochemical industry and paint stripping. Also, permanganate has been reported as a chemical oxidant for laboratory scale degradation of 1,1,2-trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene organic compounds present in contaminated soils and groundwater.645 Dimethyl and diethyl sulfides in industrial wastewaters can be removed for deodorization by extraction with toluene and oxidation of the extracted sulfides with an aqueous solution of KMnO4. 651 The organic solvent is separated from the aqueous solution in which oxidation has occurred and recycled.651 On a larger scale, potassium permanganate solutions have been injected into low-permeability, contaminated soils for in situ chemical oxidation of trichloroethene at a former industrial site. 652 After the treatment, the concentration of trichloroethene was below detection limit. However, the procedure suffers from an inhomogeneous distribution of KMnO4 in the soil to achieve overall treatment performance.652 One of the industrial processes in which large quantities of oxidants are consumed is in the pulp and paper industry to remove lignin. Permanganate has been considered as a bleaching reagent for chlorine-free bleaching of kraft pulps. 653 Permanganate oxidizes lignin and is converted to MnO2, which remains in the treated pulp fibers because of its insolubility in water.653 Addition of oxalic acid as a reducing agent transforms MnO2 into manganese ion after the pulp bleaching.653 Using lignin models such as veratraldehyde, it was found that the pH of the bleaching liquor has to be kept over 2 to effectively degrade nonphenolic lignin.A procedure to evaluate the quality of bitumens, petroleum resids, and asphaltics is based on the consumption of permanganate that is proportionally related to the content of structural elements. 654 The wide interest of permanganate has promoted a series of studies to find effective ways of insolubilizing the oxidant allowing separation and reuse. In this way, it has been found that the activity and selectivity of permanganate can be modulated by adsorption on various solid supports. 655 In contrast to the products obtained when an inert support such as bentonite is used, permanganate adsorbed on moist alumina cleaves CC bonds with the formation of aldehydes in good yields (7095%) under mild conditions (Scheme 49). Apparently, the Lewis acidity of alumina participates in the proton-transfer steps that accompanies the oxidation reactions. Systematic studies on the specific reactivity of supported permanganate have, however, not been undertaken. Supported permanganate may be an interesting oxidant, provided that a recycling/reoxidation procedure is devised making possible its reuse.Scheme 49 Highly toxic, volatile dimethylselenide can be completely transformed into nonpurgable dimethylselenoxide by reaction with δ-MnO2 which is converted into Mn2+ ions. 656 Permanganate and chromate were found less efficient for this process. It is proposed that dimethylselenide acts as Lewis base and donates a lone electron pair to unoccupied orbitals of surface manganese atoms of MnO2 that would act as Lewis acid site.656 Oxidative degradation of pyridine on the surface of hydrated manganese dioxide occurs through a two-step process. Fast adsorption of pyridine on the solid Lewis acid sites is followed by slower oxidation. 657 Autoclaving at about 150 C for 2 days of a layered structure of Mn oxide obtained by reaction of MnO4- and Mn2+ in strong basic medium gives a thermally stable (500 C) molecular sieve corresponding to natural todorokite, having 6.9 Å of pore diameter. 658 The solid exhibits Lewis and Brnsted acidity and has been proposed to have application as oxidation catalyst and as a sensor.658 However, the porous structure of the Mn oxide collapses at 600 C. Other porous manganese oxides having activity to oxidize alcohols to aldehydes or ketones have been recently reported. 659 Selective oxidation of NH3 by NOx operating at temperatures below 200 C in the presence of water at NOx conversions higher than 80% at space velocities of 3000050000 h-1 have been reported with a MnO2 catalyst prepared by egg-shell precipitation around NaY zeolite particles. 660
C. Catalytic Oxidations for Degradation of Pollutants
As we have been commenting on in the previous section, one important field in environmental science and technology is that devoted to pollution abatement and remediation of waste efluents. This field certainly will attrack more interest in the forthcoming years. A general methodology to treat wastes containing organic compounds is to perform a chemical oxidation of these effluents at the deepest possible degree of oxidation. Many of these processes are catalyzed by transition metals.
Although these catalytic oxidations are generally devised to degrade chemicals, transition metals may play a negative, unforeseen role in atmospheric pollution. In relation to acid rain and cloud acidity, it has been found that SO2 oxidation by oxygen is catalyzed by aqueous Co, Cu, Mn, and Fe ions, this oxidation enhancing the damage of the acid rain. 661 The presence of simple carboxylic acid such as acetic, formic and oxalic acids inhibits this oxidation, an effect that was explained as reflecting the formation of Fe(III)-oxalate complex that leads to a depletion of catalytically active free Fe(III) cation. 662 In this context, a hypothesis has been proposed in which the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels produces humic-like compounds that will form part of air particulates, conferring them the capacity to complex first-row transition metals. These complexes present in the air would participate in the production of free organic radicals by cycling these transition metals through two valence states. 663 Therefore, the concentration of transition metals and oxidizing power of air pollution particulates would increase with the content of humic-like substances associated to the pollution. This theory was supported by using filters to collect air-borne particulate and subsequently extracting the humic-like substances with alkali. There was a correlation between the concentration of metal in the particulate and the amount of humic-like present in the particulate. These analyses may explain the way in which substances derived from incomplete fuel combustion enhance the free radical ability of air particulate.663 On a more positive side of catalytic oxidations, aqueous solutions of transition metals have been used as catalysts in the remediation of polluted waters by promoting the oxidative degradation of the organic contaminants. Generally, the process requires the addition of a strong oxidizing reagent to produce a substantial degree of decomposition. Examples are the degradative oxidation of 4-aminopyridine by ozone in the presence of catalytic amounts of sulfates of V, Fe, or Cu 664 and the degradation of 1,4-dioxan as a model organic compound in water by ozone using first-row transition metal oxides as catalysts. 665 Cyanide is also oxidized to environmentally acceptable compounds by H2O2 with a heterogeneous catalyst containing Ag, Cu, or Ni on alumina, silica, or in a zeolite. 666 A procedure in which phenol, chlorinated phenols, and hydroquinolines are removed from wastewaters using high oxygen pressure and a large excess of alkali metal carbonates (typically over 20 mol of carbonate × mol of phenol) in the presence of a transition metal phthalocyanine, porphyrin, or salicylidene complex as catalyst has been reported. 667 In the absence of oxygen, a related treatment of phenol with transition metal-catalyzed has been reported to effect the formation of polyphenylene ethers. 668 Polluting polyamine chelating agents can be removed from aqueous solutions by oxygen oxidation in the presence of equivalents amounts of transition metal ions followed by biological treatment with denitrifying and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The process can be completed by optional membrane filtration. 669 Transition metals are also able to act as catalysts for the complete oxidation of volatile organic compounds. 670 LaMnO3+ perovskite has shown activity for the total catalytic degradation of chlorinated C2 hydrocarbons to COx, mainly CO2, and HCl. 671 The presence of water has a positive effect on the degree of degradation, decreasing the amount of chlorinated byproducts and enhancing carbon dioxide formation.671 Oxygen must also be present in the system to maintain the activity of the perovskite which should contain overstoichiometric amounts of oxygen.671 Likewise oxidation of CH2Cl2 with oxygen gas has been studied over δ-alumina and Al2O3SiO2 in a wide range of different compositions. 672,673 Pure SiO2 shows no activity.
Heavily polluted aqueous effluents cannot be treated realistically with oxidants other than oxygen. For these cases, the most common remediation procedure is wet air oxidation, in which wastewater and oxygen or air are heated at high temperatures (150400 C) and pressures (20 MPa). Catalytic wet air oxidation can be an interesting alternative to classical wet air oxidation. The presence of a catalyst should make it possible to conduct more efficiently the degradation under not so extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. Low molecular weight carboxylic acids, which are the intermediary products formed in the course of some advanced oxidation techniques, are good model compounds to test the efficiency improvement of catalytic wet air oxidation. These simple carboxylic acids are among the most recalcitrant organic compounds to undergo further oxidative mineralization. Using transition metal ion-exchanged Y zeolites as catalysts and hydrogen peroxide as oxidizing reagent, it has been possible to effect the oxidation of acetic acid in aqueous solutions below the water boiling point. 674,675 A particularly effective catalyst for this catalytic, a wet air oxidation process was Cu2+-exchanged Y zeolite in where the Cu2+ was complexed with oxalic acid.674,675 On the other hand, wastewaters containing both organic material and heavy metal ions, such as those from the photographic industry, can be treated with a combination of chemical oxidation and electrolysis. 676 Some alkyl- or aryl-phosphonates are used as insecticides, and they may be present in surface waters in certain areas and periods. The decomposition can be carried out using air as oxidant at temperatures between 200 and 400 C. Dimethyl methylphosphonate can be oxidatively decomposed using amorphous manganese oxide or alumina-supported manganese oxide as catalysts. 677 FTIR analysis suggests that dimethyl methylphosphonate strongly binds to the Mn Lewis acid sites on the manganese oxide surface through phosphoryl oxygens.677 Studies on the mechanisms of the oxidative degradation of organic compounds are scarce due to the complexity of the problem and the need to apply fast spectroscopic techniques. A pulse radiolysis study on the one electron oxidation of 1,2-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone and its Cu(II), Ni(II), and Fe(III) complexes by hydroxyl radicals has provided evidence that in this case there are two reaction pathways involving the intermediacy of semiquinone radical cation or the OH-adduct, respectively. 678 The former path undergoes disproportionation, while the transition metal coordinated OH adduct leads to trihydroxyanthraquinone.
Photocatalytic oxidative degradation uses a semiconductor oxide such as TiO2 or ZnO in combination or not with an organic dye that upon light absorption in aqueous medium generates hydroxyl radicals (OH•) and other reactive oxygen species (superoxide, singlet oxygen, etc.) that attack the organic material present in water and initiates its oxidative degradation. 679,680 Despite the general applicability of photocatalytic techniques, the two major limitations are the high energy costs associated to the irradiation, the need for more efficient photocatalysts and the requirement of transparency of the effluents.
The mechanism of acetonitrile photooxidation on TiO2 has been investigated using IR spectroscopic. 681 At temperatures higher than 73 C, the adsorption of CH3CN on both isolated TiOH groups and Ti4+ Lewis acid sites was observed. Under UV irradiation (hν 350 nm), CH3CN is oxidized in the presence of O2 to form CO2, H2O, surface carbonate, and an intermediate isocyanate species. Photooxidation of the CH3 moiety of acetonitrile occurs more easily than that of the CN.681 The effect of doping with transition metals on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 has been studied mechanistically by means of femtosecond pumpprobe diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and also from preparative studies. 682 It was found that the second-order recombination rate constant of photogenerated electron and holes markedly increases with loading of the transition metal, even at low doping level (0.3%), and this correlates with the decrease in the rate of formation of the main products (H2, CO2, etc.) of the photocatalytic degradation.682 The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 toward the decomposition of 1,4-dichlorobenzene in aqueous solution can be largely improved by loading with WO3. 683 It was found that WO3 covers the surface of TiO2 with a monolayer. The resulting WO3/TiO2 disperse better in the aqueous solution than the pure TiO2. For the gas-phase photooxidation of benzene and 2-propanol WO3/TiO2 shows 3.65.9 times the photocatalytic activity of pure TiO2.683 In situ FT-IR studies during the gas-phase photocatalytic oxidation of ethanol over TiO2 have revealed that the photoactivity correlates with the surface acidity and the concentrations of Ti3+ and carbonate surface concentration.59 Further improvements are still needed in the field of photocatalysis in terms of more efficient lamps, better match between lamp emission and photocatalyst absorption and higher quantum yields of OH• generation.
Aerated aqueous solutions of Fe2(SO4)3 have been reported to effect desulfuration of mineral raw materials, particularly coal, by oxidizing the sulfur to sulfate. A catalytic process to eliminate low-valent sulfur compounds present in water by adding hydrogen peroxide and a transition metal supported on alumina or silica has been patented. 684 Polysulfide can also be obtained by oxidation using oxygen containing gases in the presence of transition metals. 685,686 A method and an apparatus to perform the biogas purification based on the aqueous oxidation of H2S to S at acidic pH has been devised. 687 The system uses Fe3+ chelates of nitrilotriacetic and ethylendiaminotetracetic assisted by minor amounts of Cu or Ni salts and operates by reoxidizing the Fe after biogas treatment and recycling of the Fe-containing solution. Analogously, H2S and SO2 can be removed from a gas stream by oxidation using a transition metal complex solution in water an a flotation cell. 688,689 Homo- and copolymers derived of acrylamide can gelate aqueous solutions. It has been reported an interesting system in which one of such poly acrylamide hydrogels containing Fe, Ni, or Co salts is able to act as catalyst for the oxidation of Na2S with O2 in aqueous solutions at 40 C. 690 In aqueous solution, the activity of a series of transition metal oxides supported on carbon has been determined for the catalytic oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur. 691 It was found these carbon-supported transition metal oxides have comparable activities to that of Co-phthalocyanines.691 The acid rain is caused by the burning of fuels with high S content. To avoid this serious environmental problem, legislations have been implemented to limit the maximum S content in fuels. A strategy to decrease the sulfur content in fuels is to oxidize the sulfur compounds transforming them in less volatile sulfoxides or sulfones that can be more easily separated from the fuel.
A procedure for sweetening the hydrocarbon feedstock by removing sulfur has been patented in which the catalyst is prepared by impregnation on active carbon or other solid support of an alcoholic solution of the catalyst that is a chelate of bis-salicylamide. 692 In a related process for purifying liquid organosulfur-containing hydrocarbons, an aqueous sulfuric acid solution containing transition metal is submitted to electrolysis to oxidize the metal ions to their highest oxidation state and, subsequently, the electrolyzed aqueous solution emulsified with the feedstock. This treatment removes organosulfur compounds from the hydrocarbon by converting them into a gas, or water soluble or resinous products. 693 The acid aqueous solution is separated and recycled via electrolysis.693 Molybdenum oxide supported on alumina (MoO3/Al2O3 12.5 wt %) has been nitrided by temperature programmed reaction with ammonia at various temperatures and their activity toward hydrodesulfuration of dibenzothiophene studied. 694 It was concluded that metallic Mo0 and Mo2+ are the most active species for the hydrodesulfuration.694 After international treaties to destroy chemical warfare stockpiles, there has been an interest in determining a suitable procedure to degrade mustard gas, one of the most widespread warfare chemicals. 695 Bleach is a suitable decontamination procedure for treating contaminated people or material, 696 but the proposed procedure for large scale destruction of contaminated material is incineration. This poses problems from the point of view of the environment. It has been reported that mustard gas can be transformed into the nontoxic corresponding sulfide and sulfone in aqueous media by hydrogen peroxide using metal meso-tetraarylporphyrin and imidazole or ammonium acetate as cocatalyst (Scheme 50). 697 The activity of metalloporphyrin depends markedly on the nature of the metal (Fe3+ more efficient than Mn3+). With the Fe metal complex, the oxygen transfer is fairly good (up to 95%) and the substrate/catalyst concentration ratio can be high (420).697 Scheme 50 The kinetics of the aerobic oxidation of SO2 in water at different pHs in the presence of transition metal ions has been studied. 698 Highly active clay composite for the removal of SOx from flue gas streams was obtained by precipitating CaCO3 or Ca(OH)2 onto the clay from an aqueous clay slurry and incorporating a transition metal oxide as finely divided metal oxide powder, metal salt or as clay-intercalated metal cation. 699 The clay acts as a dispersing agent for the base and the transition metal decreasing particle agglomeration and increasing the SOx uptake.
D. Domestic and Technical Applications of Catalytic Oxidations
Besides the production of chemicals, Lewis acid catalyzed oxidations have also other curious applications that have impact in our daily life. In this section, we will provide some examples to give a flavor of the vast potential of catalytic oxidations.
A domestic application that takes advantage of the ability of catalytic oxidations by transition metal ions to effect the degradation of organic compounds is self-cleaning coatings for ovens. Besides water binders, hardening agents, and surfactants, the coating contains transition metal oxides deposited on activated alumina. 700,701 The ability of transition metal ions in intermediate oxidation states to react with oxygen has been used in the formulation of adsorbent compositions to remove simultaneously oxygen and water from gas mixtures. A solution of a salt of Cr, Mn, V, or Mo in their higher oxidation states is adsorbed onto SiO2 gel, alumina, or pumice stone and then reduced with H2, CO, or coal gas. 702 On the other hand, a kit to determine quantitatively the oxygen content for aquarium application has been devised based on the presence of an oxidizable transition metal and a redox indicator capable of a color change upon oxidation of the metal salt. The resulting color is visually compared with a graduated scale. 703 The combination of a bivalent transition metal or a transition metal complex of Mn. Co, Cu, Fe, and Ru with a peroxy compound or sodium perborate has been patented as a bleach-enchancer agent for cloth or dish washing, cleaning and disinfection. 704-706 After treating aqueous solutions of alkyl polyglycoside surfactants with a peroxide-decomposing transition metal, addition of hydrogen peroxide can be used to bleach the color of these solutions. 707 Catalytic oxidation at temperatures below 100 C and atmospheric pressure is the key step in a procedure for the treatment of malodorous gas. First, the gases are contacted with a scrubbing water to adsorb the malodorous components. The aqueous medium contains an alkali, alkaline-earth, or transition metal ion as catalyst and optionally a solid oxide as support. 708 Another use of transition metal-catalyzed oxidation is in shrink proofing fibers to effect the decomposition of the keratin layer on natural fibers using H2O2 as oxidizing reagent. 709 Transition metal ions can also catalyze the explosive decomposition of inorganic oxidizer salt. Thus, the major component of a detonator has been manufactured by adding significant amounts (0.210%) of transition metals (Cr, Co, Cu, and Mn) as a mixed alkali metal phosphate or as a complex to hot aqueous solutions of NH4NO3 and filtrating the precipate upon cooling the solution to ambient temperature. 710 Triazole and tetrazole in combination with an oxidizer, a transition metal oxide, and chlorates or perchlorates are the chemical components of the gas generating charges for airbag inflation. 711 Triazole or tetrazole have replaced more toxic and unstable azide-based compounds as propellant in airbag inflation devices. A transition metal oxide such as CuO is required to catalyze the explosive autoignition decomposition of the nitrogenated pentacyclic heterocycle at around 170 oC. 712,713
V. Conclusions
In this review, we have shown the evolution from homogeneous Lewis acids as catalysts to solid oxidation catalysts. The simplest strategy in which the Lewis acid is deposited on a solid surface has evolved to more elaborate ones in which the Lewis site forms part of the solid framework. Titanium silicalite is the most emblematic example of this type of solid oxidation catalysts.
Soon, it can be foreseen that the lead initiated by TS-1 will continue. New solids in which framework transition metals exhibit Lewis acidity will be synthesized and tested as oxidation catalysts. The acid strength and oxidation activity of the Lewis site will be modulated and adjusted to the reaction requirements by careful control of the chemical composition of the coordination sphere. The substrate and reagent concentration around the site will be controlled by modifying the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the solid.
The centers will be designed inspired not only on homogeneous Lewis acids, but also learning from the active centers of enzymes and biomolecules. Bioinspiration and molecular modeling will emerge as powerful strategies in catalyst design. These tools will be accompanied by new synthetic procedures in which the solids will be manipulated at the atomic level to assemble clusters that could act as active centers. For multifunctional catalysts, the sites will be located at the required distance and with the necessary strength. The combination of all these new approaches will necessarily result in more efficient, active, and environmentally friendly solid catalysts, particularly for the selective oxidation of alkanes or using oxygen as an oxidant.

<questions>


Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
