<questions>

Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

[1] "For instance, one deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic CH bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a)."
[2] "More recently, it was shown that CH bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts."
[3] "The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b)."
[4] "The resulting allyl hydride intermediate could then react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which could either regenerate the catalyst via α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or degraft via abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand (β-H abstraction)."

1.The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization catalysts based on lanthanides and actinides involves the activation of the allylic CH bond instead of propene insertion, leading to the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes. For silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, the deactivation mechanism includes the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, involving a β-H transfer process. The resulting allyl hydride intermediate can react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which can either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or lead to degrafting through β-H abstraction by the siloxy ligand. These deactivation pathways can significantly impact the performance and longevity of the catalysts.

1.基于镧系和锕系元素的支撑烯烃聚合催化剂的失活途径之一是激活烯丙基CH键而不是丙烯插入，从而形成不活跃的π-烯丙基表面复合物。对于基于Re的硅胶支撑烯烃复分解催化剂，失活机制包括在金属环丁烷中间体的β位激活CH键，涉及β-H转移过程。生成的烯丙基氢化物中间体可以与乙烯反应形成高反应性物种，该物种可以通过在两个相邻烷基配体之间α-H抽提来再生催化剂，或者通过硅氧配体的β-H抽提导致脱附。这些失活途径可能对催化剂的性能和寿命产生重大影响。

1.对于基于镧系和锕系元素的支撑烯烃聚合催化剂，分子内C-H键活化在失活过程中起作用，通过激活烯丙基CH键而不是插入丙烯，导致形成不活跃的π-烯丙基表面复合物。对于硅胶支撑的Re基烯烃复分解催化剂，CH键活化导致失活，关键步骤涉及在金属环丁烷中间体的β位激活CH键，这是一个称为β-H转移的过程。由此产生的烯丙基氢化物中间体可以与乙烯反应形成高度反应性的物种，该物种可以通过两个相邻烷基配体之间的α-H抽提再生催化剂，或者通过硅氧配体的β-H抽提导致脱附。这些失活途径可能通过降低催化活性和稳定性，对催化剂性能和寿命产生重大影响。
