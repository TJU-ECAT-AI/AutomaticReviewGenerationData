[1] "For instance, one deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic CH bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a)."
[2] "More recently, it was shown that CH bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts."
[3] "The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b)."
[4] "The resulting allyl hydride intermediate could then react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which could either regenerate the catalyst via α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or degraft via abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand (β-H abstraction)."

1.In the case of lanthanide and actinide-based supported alkene polymerization catalysts, intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a role in deactivation through the activation of the allylic CH bond instead of propene insertion, leading to the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes. For silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, CH bond activation contributes to deactivation by activating the CH bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, involving a β-H transfer process. The resulting allyl hydride intermediate can react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which can either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or lead to degrafting via β-H abstraction by the siloxy ligand.

1.对于基于镧系和锕系元素的支撑烯烃聚合催化剂，分子内C-H键活化在失活过程中起作用，通过活化烯丙基CH键而不是丙烯插入，导致形成不活跃的π-烯丙基表面复合物。对于支撑的Re基烯烃复分解催化剂，CH键活化通过在金属环丁烷中间体的β位激活CH键，涉及β-H转移过程，导致失活。由此产生的烯丙基氢化物中间体可以与乙烯反应形成高反应性物种，该物种可以通过在两个相邻烷基配体之间进行α-H抽象来再生催化剂，或者通过硅氧配体的β-H抽象导致脱附。
