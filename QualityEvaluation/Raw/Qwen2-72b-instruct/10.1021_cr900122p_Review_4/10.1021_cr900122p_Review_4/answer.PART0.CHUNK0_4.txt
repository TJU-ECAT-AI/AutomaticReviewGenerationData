[1] "For instance, one deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic CH bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a)."
[2] "More recently, it was shown that CH bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts."
[3] "The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b)."
[4] "The resulting allyl hydride intermediate could then react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which could either regenerate the catalyst via α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or degraft via abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand (β-H abstraction)."

1.The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization catalysts based on lanthanides and actinides is likely due to the activation of the allylic CH bond instead of propene insertion, leading to the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes. For silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, CH bond activation can lead to deactivation. The key step in this process is the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, involving a β-H transfer process. The resulting allyl hydride intermediate can react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which can either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or degraft via abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand.

1.基于镧系和锕系元素的支撑烯烃聚合催化剂的失活可能是因为激活了烯丙基CH键而不是丙烯插入，导致形成不活跃的π-烯丙基表面复合物。对于基于Re的硅胶支撑烯烃复分解催化剂，CH键的激活可以导致失活。这个过程的关键步骤是激活在金属环丁烷中间体β位的CH键，涉及一个β-H转移过程。生成的烯丙基氢化物中间体可以与乙烯反应形成高反应性物种，该物种可以通过在两个相邻的烷基配体之间α-H抽提来再生催化剂，或者通过硅氧配体抽提乙基片段的β-H来脱植。
