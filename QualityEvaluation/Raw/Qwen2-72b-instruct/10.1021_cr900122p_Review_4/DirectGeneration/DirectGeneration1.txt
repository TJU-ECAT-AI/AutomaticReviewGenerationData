Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a critical role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, particularly in lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based systems. This process involves the cleavage of a C-H bond within the catalyst's ligand or support, leading to the formation of a new chemical bond with the metal center. The mechanisms of C-H bond activation are complex and can be influenced by various factors, including the nature of the metal, the ligand environment, and the presence of co-catalysts. The consequences of this activation can be significant, often leading to catalyst deactivation through the formation of stable, non-reactive species. In lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, C-H bond activation can result in the formation of metal-carbon bonds, which can irreversibly deactivate the catalyst. Similarly, in silica-supported Re-based systems, C-H bond activation can lead to the formation of Re-C bonds, which can also result in catalyst deactivation. Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of intramolecular C-H bond activation is crucial for the development of more stable and efficient catalysts for alkene polymerization and metathesis reactions.
