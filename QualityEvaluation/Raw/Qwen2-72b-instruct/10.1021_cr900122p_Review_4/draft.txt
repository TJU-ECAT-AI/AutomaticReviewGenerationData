1. Mechanisms and consequences of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, with emphasis on lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based systems

The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization catalysts, particularly those based on lanthanides and actinides, is intricately linked to the activation of the allylic CH bond, a process that supersedes propene insertion and culminates in the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. This mechanism elucidates a critical pathway for catalyst deactivation. Similarly, silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts undergo deactivation through the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, a process that involves β-H transfer \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. The resulting allyl hydride intermediate can engage with ethene, forming a highly reactive species. This species has the dual potential to either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or lead to degrafting through β-H abstraction by the siloxy ligand \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. These deactivation pathways have profound implications for the performance and longevity of the catalysts.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: In light of the detailed mechanisms of intramolecular C-H bond activation leading to the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, there is a compelling need for the development of novel strategies to mitigate these deactivation pathways. Future research endeavors might focus on engineering catalysts with enhanced stability against C-H bond activation, potentially through the design of ligands that sterically or electronically hinder these processes. Additionally, the exploration of alternative activation modes that bypass the allylic CH bond activation could lead to the creation of more robust and long-lasting catalyst systems. The integration of computational chemistry with experimental findings could also provide deeper insights into the deactivation mechanisms, guiding the rational design of catalysts with improved performance and longevity.
