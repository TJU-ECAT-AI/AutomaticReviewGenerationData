Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The provided literature does not contain information about the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, nor does it discuss the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The literature focuses on the selective oxidation of paraffins and the design of catalysts for this purpose, not on the deactivation pathways of alkene polymerization or metathesis catalysts.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
提供的文献没有包含关于分子内C-H键活化在支撑烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂失活中的作用的信息，也没有讨论镧系/锕系元素基和硅胶支撑铼基催化剂的具体机制。该文献专注于石蜡的有选择性氧化及为此目的设计的催化剂，而不是烯烃聚合或复分解催化剂的失活途径。
