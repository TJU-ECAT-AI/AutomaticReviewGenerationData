1. Introduction
In this review what is known about the chemistry of hydrocarbon molecules on transition metal sur- faces will be surveyed. A battery of new surface science techniques has been used to study the solid- gas interface, but only recently has a picture started to emerge for the surface chemistry of adsorbed organic molecules. Even though a few reviews have already been published on this a compre- hensive and systematic description of these systems is still lacking. Here we will discuss the results reported to date on the structure and reactivity of the different types of hydrocarbon moieties that form on transition metal surfaces. One of the goals of this review is to provide an organometallic guide for the possible interactions of hydrocarbons with transition metals with the idea of examining their relation to the corresponding surface chemistry. We will how- ever limit our review of the organometallic literature to the information relevant to the surface systems,and also narrow the field to cover only molecules with carbon and hydrogen atoms; compounds containing other atoms (0, S, N) will be excluded.
It is our belief that there is a close relation between organic ligands in organometallic compounds and their counterparts on solid surfaces in terms of both structure and reactivity. Even though physicists originally described the behavior of metals in terms of a completely delocalized electronic structure, later studies have differentiated between the sp delocalized band responsible for the electrical conductivity and other physical properties of the metals and the d electrons, which were found to be reasonably local- ized in terms of both energy and space (Figure l).6-9 Since the chemistry of most transition metals is dominated by their d orbitals, the localization of those orbitals around the individual atoms of a solid surface is then expected to lead to localized bonding. Several experimental observations have proven this true in many systems. For one, the vibrational normal modes associated with bonds between surfaces and adsorbates usually display well-defined frequency value,O- and there are well-defined electronic 0 1995 American Chemical Society 2652 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 Francisco Zaera received nis oegree 01 - cenc ate in Chemislly fmm M e

It is this geometrical and energetic localization of the d orbitals in surfaces that explains the localized nature of the bonding in adsorbates and that allows for the building of a close analogy between surface and organometallic systems. levels associated with those bonds as In addition, molecules chemisorbed on single crystals often arrange themselves in periodic patterns in registry with the substrate structure; analysis ofthe diffraction patterns obtained from those systems show that the local geometry of the adsorbed mol- ecules is well defined.16.17 All this means that, to a first approximation, we can expect to see the same type of organic moieties on surfaces and in organo- metallic systems. This analogy has of course some limitations, since there are other parameters that need to be taken into consideration when interpreting the chemistry observed in both surfaces and discrete compounds, namely, coordination numbers (or the Zaera number of metal atoms bonded to one molecule), the effect of ligands on the electronic structure of the central atom, and steric effects. Surfaces may also offer additional bonding sites not available in discrete clusters and can even reconstruct to accommodate adsorbates. We will address those issues briefly in this review as well.The present review is organized in the following manner. First, a brief discussion of the experimental techniques used to characterize both organometallic and surface systems is presented. A discussion of the coordination and structure of the different types of organic moieties, first in organometallic compounds and then on metal surfaces, follows. Here the systems are classified according to the type of bond- ing between the molecules and the metals: both u- and n-bonded ligands are described according to their coordination number. Next, the different elementary steps that such systems can undergo are sum- marized: C-H and C-C bond-breaking and bond- forming reactions, isomerizations,and others. Again,the chemistry of organometallic compounds is dis- cussed first, and the surface chemistry is presented subsequently. A brief description of a few key nonelementary reactions is also given, including some catalytic processes. Lastly, a brief discussion on the main similarities and differences found so far be- tween surface and organometallic systems, and on possible future directions for this field, is offered. 1 1 .Experimental Methods Even though bonding in most chemisorption sys- tems is localized, the different local structures of the metal atoms present on the surface of a given solid make these systems intrinsically more complex than their organometallic analogs. The use of single crystals with well-characterized structures has there- fore been adopted in recent years in order to simplify surface studies. In addition, most chemisorption experiments are nowadays performed under so-called ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions, that is, under pressures in the 10-9-10-10

range, in order to keep the substrates clean for reasonably long periods of This is the type of work reviewed here.
The characterization of organometallic systems relies on well-developed techniques such as X-ray and neutron diffraction, NMR,and infrared spectroscopies.
Unfortunately, most of those probes are not ap- plicable to the small single-crystal systems described above. A group of alternative surface-sensitive tech- niques based on the use of electrons and other particles has been developed in recent years for surface studies. These include low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and surface-extended X-ray ab- sorption fine structure ( S E W S ) for structural de- terminations, photoelectron (UPS and XF'S), electron energy-loss (EELS) and work function measurements for characterization of electronic levels, secondary ion mass (SIMS), Auger electron (AES) and ion scattering

This is why a good understanding of both the similarities and the differences between surface and organometallic systems is crucial in developing the chemical intuition needed to interpret the data from surface studies.

On the one hand, both the low metal-carbon stretching frequency observed in vibrational s t  d i e s   - and some theoretical calculations80-82 suggest that alkyls may adsorb on hollow sites, but other calculations explain the experimental results by an on-top con- figuration i n  t e a d .   , There have been several attempts to develop alternative synthetic routes for alkyl groups on metal surfaces. A few research groups have used chemi- sorbed azocompounds as alkyl precursors, but since the surface chemistry of those compounds is far more complex than initially expected, there have been no cases where alkyl moieties have been produced cleanly in this manner.85-91 A second approach consists of dosing alkyl radicals produced in the gas phase by decomposition of the same azocompounds.9293 This route has proven to work quite well for generat- ing methyl groups, but has so far not been extended to other alkyl moieties. A third method involves the preparation of alkyl groups by using alkane molec- ular beams,94 but again, only methyl moieties have been synthesized this way. Other attempted proce- dures include the soft landing of alkyl cations,95 the direct deposition of organometallic complexes con- taining alkyl ligand,-OO the hydrogenation of ole- fins, either with gaseous hydrogen atom via an Eley- Rideal reaction,lol or by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism with adsorbed hydrogen,lo2 and the bom- bardment of adsorbed alkanes with low-energy elec- t r o n  .
All these methods are in their initial stages of development.
Finally, a few words need to be said about the stability of alkyl fragments. As mentioned earlier,metal-carbon c 7 bonds are not inherently weak;compounds with alkyl ligands are kinetically un- stable only because there are a number of decomposi- tion routes readily available to them.lo4J05 The metal-carbon dissociation energy for gas-phase metal-CH3 fragments ranges from about 30 kcaVmo1 (for Mn and Fe) to 60 kcaYmol (for Ni and Cu).lo6 In organometallic compounds those energies vary from 28 kcal/mol in Pt(CH2)3C12107 to 30 kcal/mol in Mn(CH3)(C0)5,18 39 kcaVmol in Pt(CH3)3(r5-CsH),lo9 and 53 kcal/mol in Re(CH3)(C0)5.18 On surfaces, to the best of our knowledge, values for metal-alkyl bond energies exist only for methyl and ethyl moi- eties, and only for surfaces of four transition metals,namely, Pt( 11 l),llo,lll Ni(100),40,41J12J13 Cu( 11 11, Cu(lOO),and C U (   O ) ,   ,and Fe(100);102 in all those Ill.

1. Alkyls
The synthesis of organometallic compounds with alkyl ligands via the direct oxidative addition (C-H bond scission) of saturated hydrocarbons to metal atoms is in general not practical because of the low reactivity of those alkanes. There are, however,several easier routes for the synthesis of alkyl-metal organometallic complexes, such as, for instance, the oxidative addition of alkyl halides to metal  center.- For years metal alkyls other than (CH&PtI could not be isolated, but it is now known that this was not due to a weak metal-carbon bond, but to the fact that there are a number of facile decomposition pathways available for these compounds (which will be discussed later). By coordinating deactivating ligands to the metal center, many alkyl metallic compounds have been isolated since.Most alkyl groups form a single c 7 bond with one metal atom through a two-electron donation, and occupy a single coordination site. However, there are also cases where those groups bond to multicenter complexes in a bridge configuration. Bridging alkyl groups are common among main-group elements such as aluminum,26 but have also been observed in a few transition metal complexes. There seems to be a competition between this bridging of alkyl groups, which has been seen mainly with first-row metals, and the formation of metal-metal multiple bonds, which is favored by 4d and 5d  element.- Apart from the simplest bridging configuration pos- sible, via a two-electron three-center bond between the metals and the carbon atom,27-29 two other types of bridging compounds have been observed with transition metals, one where the carbon atom coor- dinates to one of the metal atoms while the C-H bond displays an agostic interaction with a second,and another where the alkyl group is in a planar configuration, sandwiched between the two metal.O- Alkyl halide insertion reactions can also be induced on transition metal surfaces.33 There have been a large number of studies reported recently on the chemistry of simple alkyl halides over well-defined surfaces for a variety of transition metals, including tungsten,34 iron,35 r  t h e n i u m ,cobalt,37 rhodium,38 n i  k e l ,   - p a l l a d i  m ,   - p l a t i n  m ,   + c o  p e r ,   - i l v e r ,   - and g  l d .   , At liquid nitrogen temper- atures alkyl halides usually adsorb molecularly, but in most cases they can be easily activated, either thermally3 or phtolytically,to produce alkyl groups on the surface. The cleavage of C-I bonds in particular generally requires activation energies of 2654 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 cases the metal-carbon energy is approximately 30 kcallmol. The numbers listed above are within the range predicted by extrapolating the known values for M-N and M-0 bond strengths, and are suf- ficiently large to allow for the isolation of alkyl complexes provided that their decomposition can be suppressed. Also worth noticing is the fact that the bond energies for a given metal have similar values regardless of the type of system being studied,whether it is a gas-phase radical, a gas or a liquid organometallic complex, or a hydrocarbon moiety adsorbed on a solid surface, as long as the oxidation state of the metal is not changed. Finally, it is interesting to point out that, at least in the case of copper, the metal-methyl bond energy (33 kcallmol) is much closer to that for the cation Cu-CH3+ (30 kcallmol) than for the neutral Cu-CH3 molecule (58 kcavmol), and since the main difference between the two gas-phase molecules is the lack of s electrons in the ionized metal, it could be argued that on the surface the alkyl-metal bond involves an s electron from the metal.Zaera
2. Vinyls, Acetylides, and Aryls
In addition to alkyl groups, unsaturated hydrocar- bons can also a bond to one or more metal centers to form alkenyl (vinyl), alkynyl (acetylide), or aryl ligands. Homoleptic vinyl complexes (containing only one type of ligand) are common among main ele- ments,114J15 but rare on transition m e t a l  .    J  ' Other vinyl compounds can be prepared by oxidative addi- tion of vinyl halides,118-120 by insertion of coordinated acetylene,121J22 by transmetalation,122 or by decar- bonylation of acrylic compounds.123 When coordi- nated to one metal center, the metal-carbon bond has a pure a character,l17 but this type of ligand is more commonly seen in clusters, and in those com- pounds an additional interaction between the n orbital and a second metal atom is usually ob- There are, to the best of our knowledge, only four examples where vinyl groups have been cleanly isolated and well characterized on solid transition- metal surfaces. In one case the vinyl moieties were prepared by thermal dehydrogenation of ethylene on Ni(100) around 175 K. The formation of the surface vinyl species was first inferred from laser-induced desorption (LID) kinetic experiments with partially labeled and later confirmed using vibrational spectroscopy.128 By using near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (NEXAFS), the C-C axis was determined to be at 35" to the surface normal,and the molecular plane oriented at 60" from that surface (Figure 2).129 Although the exact coordina- tion of the carbon to the surface was not determined,the observed geometry does suggest some n interac- tion with the metal surface. The other examples come from recent reports on the synthesis of vinyl groups by direct decomposition of chemisorbed vinyl halides on Pt(lll),130J31

and Ag(111P surfaces. Other reports claim to have isolated sur- face vinyl species after either electron bombard- ment133 or thermal decompsitionlJ of adsorbed ethylene, on Ag(ll1) and Pt(100), respectively, but the thermal desorption and photoelectron spectros- -

spectra from vinyl species adsorbed on Ni(1001,as produced by heating a layer of about 15% of saturation of ethylene on that surface to 180 K.lZ9 These data were used to determine that vinyl moieties bond to the surface with their molecular plane at 60" and their C-C bond tilted about 35" from the normal. copy data presented in those cases was not ac- companied by any structural or vibrational charac- terization of the surface species.
Acetylide compounds behave in general in a way similar to that of the vinyl counterparts. Acetylides are most often prepared either by substitution of a coordinated halide with an acetylenic anion (such as in a Grignard reagent),23 or by the oxidative addition of the acetylenic C-H bond in coordinated alkenes.136 The metal-carbon bond in mononuclear acetylide compounds has a single a character,137 but in clusters these a-bonded acetylides are capable of additional n bonding with neighboring metal atoms.138 The stability of the mononuclear compounds depends on the nature of the R group in the p position, which follow the order aryl > hydrogen > These changes can be explained by the greater electro- negativity of aryl groups compared to that of either H or alkyls and by the reduction in negative charge of the triple bond in the aryl case by virtue of its resonant delocalization. Many acetylides tend to polymerize, and acetylides of the form M2C2 are frequently explosive,especially when the metal is Cu, Ag, or A U .
The formation of acetylides on metal substrates has usually been seen in association with the decomposi- tion of chemisorbed ethylene, acetylene, or benzene molecules, but in most cases the evidence offered for the presence of this moiety on the surface has not been compelling. High-resolution electron energy- loss spectroscopic (HREELS) data has been inter- preted as to indicate the presence of acetylide moi- eties in the following cases: (1) after decomposition of ethylene on Pd(ll1) and Pd(100) at 450
K,139
on Ni(100) and Ni( 110) around 300 K,140J41 on Ru(0001) Chemistry of Hydrocarbon Moieties at 360 K,142 on Ir(ll1) around 500 K,143 and on Rh- (100) at 300 K144J45 (2) following dehydrogenation of propylene on Rh(111);144J46 (3) after fragmentation of chemisorbed benzene on Rh(ll1) above 400 K147 and (4) after decomposition of acetylene on Ni(100)140 and Rh(lll).148 Although these assignments have been based on only a few vibrational modes, the proposed structures are consistent with similar clus- ter compounds.
Finally, there are a substantial number of known a-bonded transition metal aryl  compound.- Transition metal aryl bonds can be made by a variety of synthetic methods, such as the use of aryl Grig- nard, lithium, or mercury r e a g e n t  , l   J and the oxidative addition of aryl h a l i d e  l   - l (or even aryl C-H bonds157) to metal complexes. The monometal- lic compounds usually display M-C distances typical of single bonds, but in a few cases a considerable shortening of this bond has been found,15s presum- ably because of the significant amount of back donation of the metal d electrons into the n *
phenyl orbital. Aryl compounds are quite reactive, readily converting to biphenyl derivatives and other prod- u c t  .
The decomposition mechanism for this is not well understood, but seems to involve the hydrogens in the ortho position, because adding ortho substit- uents to an aryl ligand results in a higher kinetic stability of the organometallic compound.23 Aryl compounds are also believed to be intermediates in the formation of y6-arene complexes in some cases.149 Almost no examples are known for aryl fragments on surfaces. Thus far phenyl groups have been prepared via the decomposition of halobenzenes on copper, silver, and nickel  u r f a c e s ,   O - by thermal decomposition of benzene on O S ( O O O  ) and Ni- (1 and by electron bombardment of adsorbed benzene on Ag(lll).133J60 On the basis of HREELS and NEXAFS data, a tilted geometry has been suggested for those systems.Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 2655
6. Multiple Metal-Carbon 0 Bonding
1. Carbenes
Saturated hydrocarbon moieties can also bond to metal centers via multiple a bonds. For example, CR2 fragments can coordinate directly to one metal atom in organometallic complexes to form what nominally would be a double bond.167J68 These compounds are generically called carbenes, but in cases where the R groups are composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen atoms they are referred as either alkylidenes or (substituted) methylidenes.
There are in fact two types of metal-carbene com- plexes, those where bonding occurs through the donation of the electron lone pair of the carbene free radical into the d orbitals of the metal (the so-called Fischer type),167 and those in which the double bond is formed by the sharing of electrons between the carbon and the metal atom(s) (the Schrock type).169 This separation is more than just a question of semantics, since each type displays a quite distinct reactivity pattern. The "true carbene" (Fischer) type is stabilized by keeping the metal in a low oxidation state, and is readily attacked by nucleophilic reagents at the carbene carbon atom. The Schrock type, on the other hand, exists mostly in metals in high oxidation states and can react either with an elec- trophilic reagent at the carbon atom or with a nucleophilic group at the metal  e n t e r .   J  O The difference can alternatively be viewed in terms of the nature of the interaction between the ligand and the metal: while the first type is formed by electrophilic carbene ligands which exist as singlets in their free radical state, the second type, the most common for alkylidenes, originates from nucleophilic radicals in their triplet, most stable gas-phase state.llg Single-metal carbene compounds are fairly un- stable and commonly require the presence of at least one element other than carbon (usually oxygen,sulfur, or nitrogen) on the carbene carbon.16s There are very few examples of stable monometallic alkyl- idene complexes,171 even though a theoretical study does suggest that the carbene-metal bond energy should be of the order of 50 kcallmol, higher than that in coordinated ethylene, acetylene, N2, or C0.172J73 Some Schrock carbene complexes with less than 18 electrons are further stabilized by having the proton on the carbene atom bend backward toward the metal, so the C-H bond becomes longer and interacts strongly with the metal center while the metal- carbon double bond becomes  h 0 r t e r . l A more stable form of carbenes exists in metal clusters with the carbon atom bonded in a bridge configuration between two metal atoms.175 Bridged methylenic structures can be prepared by the addi- tion of a variety of reactants to metal complexes,including dihalo a l k a n e  , l   J diazo compounds,178 and even ketenes,179 although the use of this last reagent is not advisable because of its lack of selectivity. A few additional indirect synthetic meth- ods, such as the addition of olefins and acetylenes and the use of organolithium and dimethyl magne- sium reagents, have been reported in the literature as well.175 The bridging carbene structures are usually symmetric, with an internal M-C-M angle of about 80" and an external R-C-R angle around 105". Molecular orbital calculations have revealed an electronic structure for these systems best de- scribed by a CR2 unit formally added to a metal- metal double bond: apart from a 0 donation from the methylene group into the metal orbitals, there is also an electron transfer from the M-M a bond to a carbon orbital with n symmetry which reduces the formal metal-metal bond from double to single character.lgO This interpretation is supported by results from photoelectron spectroscopy experi- ments.ls1 There have only been a handful of examples reported for the isolation and characterization of alkylidene groups on solid surfaces. Vibrational spectroscopic data from studies on the decomposition of diazo methane on Ru(0001) were initially assigned to the formation of methylene on the surface,182 but later reinterpreted as possibly resulting from dimer- ization to ethylene. Additional vibrational results have been reported for methylene formation from ketene on Fe(l10),lg3
R U ( O O O  ) ,
and Pt(lll),185 and from diiodo methane on Rh(111)lS6 and M o (   O ) . ' Supporting SSIMS data has been reported for the 2856 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Val. 95, No. 8 formation of methylene from ketene on Pt(ll1):S and indirect evidence for the synthesis of CH2 surface moieties has been obtained by TF'D from diazo methane on Pt(lll),lss from diiodo methane on Mo- (llO),lS7 Ni(100),112 Pd(100),190
C U (   O ) , '
and Cu- (100),192 and from chloro iodo methane on Pt(111).193 In most cases the decomposition of the precursor takes place at low temperatures: methylene forma- tion from either ketene or diazo methane on Ru- (OOOl), or from diazo methane on Pt(lll), occurs immediately upon adsorption around 100 K, and C-C bond scission in ketene takes place below 150 K on Pt(ll1). The decomposition of CHzIz is pre- sumed to be equally facile; it probably occurs below 200 K. Only in the case of ketene on Fe(ll0) has methylene formation been proposed to occur at higher temperatures (still below 390 K). Ethylidene moi- eties have also been isolated and characterized by infrared spectroscopy a h r thermal activation of 1,l- diiodoethane on Pt(lll).lg4
2. Cahynes
Similar to C& moieties, it is also possible to attach CR groups directly to metal atoms. The resulting complexes are called carbynes in general, and alkyl- idynes when R is a carbon-containing fragment. As in the case of carbenes, it is also possible to dif- ferentiate between two types of coordination, namely,one in which the carbyne donates its two free electrons in the sp orbital to the metal center@) and shares the third p electron with three other in two of the d orbitals of the metal, and another in which it forms what would be nominally considered LL tnple bond by sharing its three electrons (one in each of the one sp and two p orbitals) w i t h
the metal at0ms.2 There have been reports of stable alkylidyne com- pounds in complexes with one170Js5 and tw0138J96 metal centers, but by far the most stable type is one where the alkylidyne is located at the center of the triangle formed by three metal  atom.'-' These compounds can be prepared by using the correspond- ing l,l,l-trihaloalkanes, by decomposition of acety- lenic or alkylidene complexes, or by substitution of R groups in existing alkylidyne compounds.1s8 Their electronic configuration is still a matter of some debate, but it is by and large believed that the carbon atom attached to the metal is sp hybridized and bonds to all three metal atoms via delocalized mo- lecular orbitals.2020' Alkylidyne species are also quite common in chemi- sorption systems.

The general findings from this work can be summarized as follows (Figure 3): (1) ethylidyne chemisorbs with Zaera Ethylidyne I Pt(ll1) Structure from RAIRS and LEED 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 Frequency I cm" Figure 3 .

from a saturation layer of ethylidyne on Pt(lll),prepared by exposing the surface to ethylene at room temperature.55g The three vibrational modes characteristic of ethylidyne moieties are clearly seen here, namely, the C-C stretching at 1118 em-', the symmetric methyl deformation (umbrella mode) at 1339 em-', and the sym- metric C-H stretching at 2883 em-'. Also shown in this figure is the structure of the carbon backbone of ethylidyne,as determined by low-energy electron dieaction experi- ments:217 the C-C bond stands in the middle of a $-fold hollow site perpendicular to the surface, and is about 1.49 k,long (a distance typical of single bonds) and 1 . 2 1

A recent microcalorimetric study of ethylidyne on (1 x2)-Pt- (110) estimates the overall binding energy of the metal-carbon interaction to be about 160 kcaVmo1.222 The formation of larger alkylidynes (n-propylidyne,n-butylidyne, isobutylidyne, and n-pentylidyne) by thermal conversion of the corresponding olefins was initially inferred from TPD and LEED r e s  l t s *   - and later corroborated by vibrational spectros- copy.146226-229 Studies on long-chain alkylidyne have so far been carried out only on Pt(lll), Rh(lll),and Ru(0001) surfaces.
3. Viny/idenes
and Meta//acyc/es Metal complexes containing unsaturated carbenes such as vinylidenes are quite reactive, but can nevertheless be isolated. They are usually prepared either by conversion of terminal alkynes, or by protonation or alkylation of metal acetylides.210 Many mononuclear vinylidene complexes are now known,but the metal cluster version is generally more stable, Chemistry of Hydrocarbon Moieties to the point that conversion of the former to the latter can sometimes be driven by just heating the initial omp pound., The M-C-C bond angle in mono- nuclear compounds is usually linear, even though bent configurations with angles as acute as 167 have been r e p  r t e d ,    ,but in clusters with three or more metal atoms the coordination is essentially bridged.
Bonding in vinylidene complexes is similar to that in other carbenes, namely, via a simultaneous a donation from the ligand to the metal and back- donation from the metal d orbitals to the x * orbital of the C-C double bond. The interaction with the n system fures the molecular plane of the vinylidene moiety at a tilted configuration with respect to the metal plane of the complex,235-238 and creates an activation barrier for its rotation of the order of 5 kcaVmo1.239,240 On metal surfaces vinylidenes are likely intermedi- ates in the decomposition of chemisorbed alkenes or alkynes. The most convincing report of the isolation of vinylidene moieties on surfaces is that on Pd- (111),204,241 in which vibrational and X-ray absorption data were interpreted as indicative of a di-a bonded species with additional x interaction to a third metal atom. This structure is consistent with that observed in organometallic clusters: the vibrational data was successfully compared to that of the model com- pounds H2Osz(p-C=CHz)(CO)g and Ru2(C2H&(p-
C=CH2)(C0)3.124,126,138
In another example, infrared data showed that the decomposition of vinyl iodide on Pt(ll1) yields a mixture of vinylidene and acety- lene on the surface around 140
K.I3l Vinylidene was
also postulated to be one of a group of compounds present on an unreconstructed Pt(100) surface after annealing adsorbed ethylene at 300 K, but the data analysis in that case was complicated by the overlap of vibrational bands from other species in the spec- tra.209 On supported platinum catalysts, NMR mea- surements have been interpreted as to reflect the conversion of acetylene to vinylidene.242 Vinylidene species may also be stabilized on surfaces by coad- sorption with other species: the formation of vi- nylidene from both ethylidyne at 350 K on oxygen- passivated R u ( O O O  ) and ethylene decomposition on CO-covered Ni( have both been suggested in the literature. Finally, early claims on the forma- tion of vinylidene from ethylene on Pt(111),245,246 Ni- (111),247 and Fe(100)248 have been reconsidered.Metallacycles containing three to seven atoms are also well known in organometallic chemistry,249 the most common being those with either three or four carbon atoms. Although these cyclic compounds could be regarded as metal complexes with a chelat- ing alkyl group occupying two coordination positions,their chemistry is usually quite different than that of dialkyl compounds. Cyclic compounds can be made by a variety of synthetic routes, including the use of Grignard type249 or other bifunctional alkylating agents (such as d i h a l i d e  ) ,the reduction of allyl or four-carbon rings,251,252 the use of cyclometallation reaction,- and the addition of either cyclopro- panes (for the formation of metallayclobutanes) or two olefins (for metallacyclopentane).The rings in most metallacycles have all carbon atoms in the same plane, but in many instances that plane Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 2657 does not include the metal. This often results in either puckered258 or open envelope 259 type con- figurations which, in the case of rings with five or more atoms, are usually unstable toward the forma- tion of either cyclic organic compounds260 or olefins.261 Unsaturated cyclic compounds in which the x elec- trons are delocalized around the ring are also quite common,262,263 although cis-butadiene ligands may also bond via two single bonds and form metallacy- lopent-3-enes.A number of metallacycles with more than one metal atom where alkyl chains one to four carbon atoms long act as bridging agents be- tween the metal centers have also been character- i  e d .A recent elegant piece of work has shown how cis- 3,4-dichlorocyclobutene can be used to prepare a C4& group on Pd(ll1) surface., Metallacycles have also been prepared by thermal decomposition of diiodoalkanes on aluminum268 and, more recently, on Ni(100)269 surfaces. In the latter case, the formation of cyclic surface species with three to six carbon atoms was inferred from TPD experiments.269 Many other reports claim to have isolated metallacycles on surfaces as well, but those experiments have by and large been based on the decomposition of heterocycles such as thiophene, and such systems are so complex that the many techniques used to characterize them have not yielded definitive proof for the formation of the proposed intermediate.O- The general belief is that when thiophene decomposes on surfaces such as Pt(lll), Pt(100), Pt(2101, Ni(100), Rh(ll1) or Ru- (OOOl), it loses the sulfur atom and forms a five- membered ring with a metal atom. This ring usually retains both its aromaticity and its planarity, and is tilted with respect to the surface. Bonding to the substrate involves the first and fourth carbon atoms,and has di-a character. The degree of dehydrogena- tion of the a-C atoms is not known, but it appears to be extensive. It is worth mentioning that this thiophene decomposition pathway is not universal:on other surfaces the first step has been suggested to be the removal of an a hydrogen with retention of the sulfur atom.275,276 This latter mechanism has some support in the organometallic 1iteratu1-e.

1. Olefins
Since the preparation in 1827 of Zeises salt, K[(r- C2Hd)PtCl&H20, a large number of complexes with side-bonded olefins have been isolated for virtually all transition metals. Given that this field has already been extensively reviewed,278 only the most salient points relevant to the surface systems will be mentioned here. Some of the most important syn- thetic routes to alkene complexes are (1) direct coordination of olefins to unsaturated metal atoms,(2) ligand substitution, and (3) P-hydride elimination of alkyl complexes. The structural details of the products can be summarized as follows:279 (1) the C-C bond distance in the coordinated olefin is significantly longer than in the free molecule; (2) the substituents around the double bond bend away from the metal, breaking the original planarity of the molecule (that is, the carbon atoms rehybridize); (3) 2658 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 the carbon atoms involved in the olefin double bond are essentially equidistant from the metal atom; (4) the double bond aligns in one of four geometries depending on the structure of the overall complex,namely, in the plane of trigonal planar compounds,perpendicular to the plane of square planar com- plexes, in the equatorial plane of trigonal bipyramidal configurations, or parallel to one of the axes of octahedral compounds. In all cases the bonding is sideways and is described by the Dewar-Chatt- Duncanson model where the filled n molecular orbital of the olefin donates electron density to an empty valence d orbital of the metal while another filled metal d orbital back-donates into the empty n* antibonding orbital of the double According to this model, the degree of back-donation determines the strength of both the metal-carbon and the carbon-carbon bonds, which in fact follow opposite trends: one weakens at the expense of the other. All kinds of complexes can be obtained this way, from compounds with a pure n interaction, to molecules with an essentially metallacyclopropane character.In metal clusters olefins usually coordinate in the same way as in mononuclear complexes, that is, via a n donatiodn back-donation to one of the metal atoms, but in those cases the ligand is quite fluxional,as it can both rotate and twist about its metal-ligand axis as well as move to other metal In addition, multimetal olefin complexes can also bind in a di-o configuration to two metal atoms with additional II interaction to a third metal center.z272z Ethylene chemisorption on transition metal sur- faces has been studied extensively as Two types of molecularly adsorbed species have been identified, in analogy to the two bonding extremes mentioned above: di-o metallacyclic, and n-bonded olefinic. The degree of double-bond character re- tained upon adsorption varies smoothly from one end to the other with the nature of the metal systems;by using a criteria based on the relative values of the frequencies for the C-C stretching and CHz defor- mation vibrational modes,Z85,286 systems have been found for the whole range of rehybridization. The reported cases to date go from essentially C-C single- bonded species, as on Pt(lll),287 Rh(100),2s6 Fe- (11 1),288 Ru(OO01),212 Ni(l1 1),289 Ni(l10)>4' W(100),2w and Pd(100),25 to adsorbates with a large double- Zaera bond character, as on CU(OO),' C  ( l f 1 ) , 2 Cu- (110),293 Ag(100),294 Pd(lll),295 Pd(l10),296 Fe(110),297 and Ni(100).12s As it can be seen from this list,ethylene adsorption normally leads to significant rehybridization toward a single-bond character, and retention of the double-bond character occurs mainly in late transition metals, but this trend can be modified by coadsorption of species such as oxygen or carbon It is also interesting to note that sometimes both types of adsorption are observed on the same surface: on Pt(lll),for instance, a transition from z- to di-u-bonded ethylene takes place around 50 K302 and both species presumably coexist at saturation coverages around liquid nitrogen tem- peratures.Much less information is available on the adsorp- tion of heavier olefins.

Three vibrational modes are seen in those spectra,namely, the out-of-plane CHz deformation at 910 cm-1, the in-plane (scissors) CHz deformation at 1261 em-', and the C-C stretching at 1522 em-'. However, the relative intensities of the three bands within each spectrum are dramatically different.On the basis of the surface selection rule that applies to RAIRS on those changes can be related to changes in adsorption geometry. It was determined that while the molecular plane of ethylene is oriented parallel to the surface on Cu(lll), it seems to be standing up in a perpendicular configuration on Cu(ll0). adsorb in di-a configurations on F't(lll), at least above 100

A spz-to-sp3 rehybridization occurs in all those compounds during adsorption, and the appearance of soft C-H modes in the vibrational spectra of the cyclic structures suggests a slight puckering of the ring.m Propene chemisorbed on Rh- (111) seems to have more of a n character in the same temperature range,146 and both II and di-u species were detected on RU(OOO).
Lastly, isobutene binds in a tilted triple-coordinated state on Ni(111).306 There has been a reasonably large amount of work carried out on the structural characterization of chemisorbed olefins on metal surfaces. Most systems are believed to have the C-C double-bond plane parallel to the surface regardless of the electronic configuration for bonding.220307-312 There are only two known exceptions to this rule reported to date.
The first is ethylene on Ni(100) which, according to NEXAFS studies, binds with its C-C bond parallel to the surface but with its molecular plane tilted by 50",suggestive of a di-oh three-atom interactin.' The second example refers to ethylene on copper (Figure 4), where vibrational studies have shown flat adsorption on C  ( l l l ) 2 and C U (  O O ) ,but perpen- dicular on Cu(110).293.313 This last case has been recently contested, because results from photoelec- tron diffraction experiments suggest that the olefin may lie flat even on the Cu(ll0) surface,3I4 but it is possible that this discrepancy is due to the recon- struction of the Cu(ll0) surface under some circum- stances. Whatever the actual situation may be, these data suggest that crystallographic orientations play an important role in determining adsorption geom- etries, perhaps because they control the spatial orientation of the d orbitals of the metal.Chemistry of Hydrocarbon Moieties
2. Alkynes, Dienes, and Allyls
Alkynes bind to metals in a similar manner as olefins. However, because of their larger electro- negativity, there is more back-donation of metal d electrons to the empty X* antibonding orbitals in the alkynes, and therefore, the bonding to the metal is stronger. In organometallic compounds, two main observations support this statement: (1) the substit- uents in the C-C triple bond tend to fold away from the metal by up to 40", and (2) the metal-carbon distances shorten by as much as 0.07 A compared to the corresponding alkene Moreover,although alkynes coordinated to one metal-atom center are generally regarded as two-electron donors,the extra x bond allows for a four-electron donation,especially in coordinatively unsaturated com- plexe.l-l' This is even more likely in compounds with more than one metal atom, where acetylenic compounds tend to coordinate in a bridging config- uration. In two-center complexes, for instance, two types of geometries have been observed, with the C-C bond oriented either paralle1318,319 or perpen- d i c  l a r to the metal-metal axis (the latter being the most common). In clusters with three or more metal atoms, the basic di-o bridging coordination is complemented by a x interaction to one or two additional atoms. In these latter compounds the alkyne can still be considered a four-electron donor,even though it is clear that both the metal-alkyne interaction and the C-C bond distance increase with increasing number of metal atoms, indicating that the electron-density transfer is larger than in the case of one or two metal centers.321-324 The molecular adsorption of acetylene has been characterized for a number of  surface., Based mainly on vibrational data, two types of adsorption geometries have been proposed: coordination to four atoms (for W(110), Fe(lll), Fe(llO), Ru(0001), Ni- (lll), Ni(100), Pd(100), Cu(lll), Cu(lOO), and Cu- (110)2021284),in a similar way as in Os and Co tetrametallic c o m  l e x e s ,    - and di-o bridging co- ordination to either one or two adjacent metal centers with extra n interaction to the side atoms (on Ru- (OOOl), Rh(lll), Ni(llO), Pd(lll), Pd(ll0) and Pt- (111) surfaces), like in ( C  H  ) O S  ( C O )   .The first class is best exemplified by the adsorption of acety- lene on Ni(lll),for which structural information has been obtained by using both LEED and photoelectron p e c t r o s c o p i e s .In that case the acetylene mol- ecule was found to sit parallel to the surface and in a crossed bridge site such that the two carbon atoms occupy nonequivalent hollow sites (Fi re 5). The C-C distance ranges from 1.44 to 1.50 r (essentially a single bond), while the spacing between the mol- ecule and the first nickel layer has been reported to be either 2.0326 or 1.4 A.327 The second coordination type is illustrated by the adsorption of acetylene on Pt(lll),where a LEED structural analysis places the molecule lying flat on the surface but coordinated to a single metal atom (Figure 5),328 with metal-carbon and carbon-carbon bond distances of 2.5 and 1.3 A respectively (in line with what would be expected for a carbon-carbon double bond). A more recent NEX- AFS determination sets the C-C bond length at about 1.45

Figure 5. Structural details for acetylene adsorption on transition metal surfaces.
The results from photoelectron diffraction experiments on Ni(ll1) exemplify one type of adsorption where the molecule sits on a bridge site with its carbon atoms on %fold hollow sites.312 The molecular axis lies flat 1.36 A above the surface lane, and the C-C bond distance, which is about 1.44 1 ,
corresponds to a single bond. Another adsorption configuration is illustrated by the results from low-energy electron diffraction
(LEED)
experiments on Pt(lll),where the acetylene sits on top of a single platinum atom.328 The C-C in that case is also parallel to the surface plane, but the molecule sits at a larger distance from the metal, at about 2.36 A, and the C-C bond is much shorter,about 1.3

Neither technique allowed for the determination of the position of the hydrogen atoms. measured from LEED and outside the range expected from what is known in the organometallic literature,but this may be explained by the complications in the X-ray absorption measurements arising from the weak cross section of the shape resonance associated with this system.329 The flat adsorption geometry for acetylene on Pt(ll1) has also been confirmed by ARUPS data.220 For acetylene on Pd(lll), on the other hand, a combination of UPS and N E W S measurements led to the conclusion that the C-C axis is tilted by more than 20,330 with a CCH angle of about 117", and a C-C bond length close to 1.3
A
(the same as on platinum). Other UPS studies have shown that the hybridization of the carbon atoms in acetylene changes from essentially sp2 on Ni( 11 11, Pd(lll), and Pt(lll),which corresponds to a C-C bond length of the order of 1.35-1.40 A and a HCH angle between 120 and 130",to close to a sp structure on Ni(llO),which corresponds to values of about 1.3 A and 150" for the parameters mentioned above.331 Conjugated alkenes such as butadiene could be considered as four-electron donors, since both olefinic bonds can coordinate to the central metal atom, but the actual bonding is better regarded as the result of the interaction of the delocalized x system of the diene with the d orbitals of the metal, especially when the ligand is in the cis c  n f i g u r a t i o n .    , The main structural features of inorganic conjugated-alkene complexes can be summarized as follows: (1) the bond between the inner carbon atoms of the diene is shorter than the average of the outer ones; (2) both inner and outer carbon atom pairs are each equidis- tant from the metal; (3) the inner carbons are closer to the metal center; (4) the four carbons are coplanar,with C-C-C bond angles ranging from 114 to 121";and (5) the substituents in the C 1 and C4 positions tend to be twisted out of the four-carbon plane. All of these observations can be rationalized by a struc- 2660 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 ture somewhere between a bent di-a cis-metallacyclo- 3-pentene with some additional n interaction and a c i s -   - d i e n e .
Binding of butadiene in the trans configuration is rare, but it has been observed in a few circumstances, both in mononuclear com- p l e  e s    ,and in clusters.336 Bonding in those cases is likely to be via a n interaction, and their conversion to the cis configuration is facile.
Only a few studies have dealt with the determina- tion of the structural details of butadiene adsorbed on metal surfaces. Vibrational data for butadiene on Pt(ll1) was interpreted in terms of a 1,2-di-o species,which supposedly forms at 170 K and converts into a tetra-a coordinated moiety by 300 K.228 This hypothesis is supported by some theoretical calcula- tions done for Pt(110).337 On Mo(100), on the other hand, both N E W S and ARUPS data suggest that the molecular orbitals are only minimally perturbed upon adsorption at low temperatures, and that the butadiene plane is oriented at about 40" from the surface plane; heating of this layer to 200 K induces a transformation to a moiety with an electronic configuration similar to that of gas-phase trans-2- butene.338 Finally, the adsorption of 1,3-cyclohexa- diene on Pt(ll1) is accompanied by a significant rehybridization of the carbon atoms involved. The adsorbate-surface interaction in that case seems to be better described by assuming two separate di-o coordinations rather than one overall n bond to the surface. 339 Allyl ligands usually bind to a metal center in either q3 or a n coordination modes; in both cases the neutral allyl ligand acts as a three-electron do- nor.174,279 Discrete compounds with allyl ligands are quite easy to make: they can be prepared by treating metal complexes with Grignard, allyl halide, or allyl alcohol reagents, by hydride abstraction from coor- dinated alkenes, or by protonation of 1,3-diene Structural studies have indicated that,as long as there is no clear asymmetry imposed on the molecule by other ligands, the allyl group itself is quite symmetric: both C-C bonds are about the same length, the C-C-C bond angle has a value around 120" (typical of a sp2 hybridization), and the metal atom is located approximately at the centroid of the allylic triangle. In substituted allylic ligands the substituents are in general bent away from the C3 plane, most commonly toward the meta1.315-317 In cyclic ligands such as cyclopentadienyls,however, the part of the ring that does not contribute to the allylic interaction usually bends away from the Allyl ligands are also well known to bridge two metal atoms, but the details of the geometrical arrangement in these cases depend on the overall structure of the c o m p  u n d .    , The best examples for well-characterized allylic species on metal surfaces are those on Ag(llO),where allyl chloride decomposes to form an allylic moiety around 180 K,345 and where isobutene reacts with oxygen to produce a small amount of a n-2-methyl allyl species.346 The vibrational data from the first study was interpreted as being the result of a r3-n coordination with the molecular plane parallel to the surface. On Al(lOO), the decomposition of 3-bromo- 1-propene around 310 K yields the same allylic Zaera species.268 An intermediate allylic species has also been observed during the dehydrogenation of both cyclohexane and cyclohexene on Pt( 1 1
1 ).3043347,348
3. Arenes
Many aromatic ligands, cyclopentadienyl ions and benzene rings in particular, n bond quite easily to metal complexes.320 Arene metal compounds are readily prepared by reacting metal complexes directly with the aromatic molecule, a procedure that can lead to the displacement of three terminal carbonyls or other more labile ligands.349 In metal clusters, the benzene ring usually coordinates in a similar geom- etry to that of the mononuclear complexes,350 but there are some multicenter metallic compounds where the aromatic ligands coordinate in either a bridge, on-edge position within a metal triangle,351-354 or by capping a triangular f a  e .    - Alternative (and perhaps more interesting) synthetic routes for arene complexes start from either dienes359 or alkynes;llg we will discuss the dimerization and trimerization reactions involved in those processes in a subsequent section.
Arenes (benzene complexes) usually bind to transi- tion metals in a r6 six-electron n-donating configu- ration which depletes most of the n electron cloud of the molecule and therefore reduces its aromaticity.
The benzene ring usually retains its planar config- uration, but occasionally this charge donation causes Kekul6 bond distortions where either the C-C bond distances become  n e q u a l   l - or the ring bends into boat360 or geometries, and where any groups directly attached to the benzene ring bend away from their normal planar position.279 A few cases have been reported where the aromatic ligand coordinates in either q4 361,362 or r2 3633364 configura- tions; in the former case the bonding resembles that of any other cis-diene.
It is generally accepted that benzene adsorption on metal surfaces at low temperatures is molecular,that the aromatic ring usually orients itself flat on the surface, and that the adsorption process can induce noticeable changes in the shape of the ring.365 A flat adsorption geometry has been reported for benzene on C U (  O O ) ,
C U (   O ) ,
Cu(111),367,368 Ag(110),369370 Ag( 1 11),366 Ni(lll),371 Ni( 110),372,373 Pd(111),3741375 Pt(111),376,377 Pt(100),378 Rh(111),379 Ir(lll),380,381 and M o (   O ) .
Vibrational data indicates that the sym- metry of the molecule can be lower than the pseudo (local) c 6 " expected for top-site coordination on (111) surfaces of fcc metals, suggesting that it may involve more than one metal atom (either a bridge or a hollow site). Structural LEED studies on Rh(ll1) and Pt(ll1) surfaces have not only corroborated that conclusion, but have also shown that not all the C-C bonds within the molecule have the same length (Figure 6). Alternating values were seen in the case of Rh,382,383 and two opposite shorter bonds were observed on Pt (a bridge configuration).384 There is some controversy about the length of the C-C bonds in these systems: the LEED studies yielded average values ranging from 1.52 to 1.72 A (the latter being significantly longer than a single bond), but more recent N E W S  studies on Pt(ll1) resulted in a value of 1.40 A.367,376 C3" symmetry has also been

h e m i c a l Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 2661 examples have been reported in the literature for the conversion of saturated molecules to other com- pounds, both in organometallic complexes and on solid surfaces. The initial chemical interaction of an alkane with a metal center has been proposed to involve a three-center two-electron bond between a filled C-H bonding orbital and an unfilled metal d orbital. Theoretical calculations indicate that dl0- ML3 and d'O-MLz systems should be particularly effective in activating alkanes and that such a reaction may take place by first forming an interme- diate with a M-H-C angle larger than 130".404 This idea is supported by the large number of stable complexes displaying this type of intramolecular interaction (the so-called agostic bonding) that have been i s  l a t e d . '   .Kinetic studies on intramolecular activation reac- tions also suggest the formation of a reactive $(C- H) alkane intermediate.47.408 Although such an alkane complex has not yet been isolated, evidence is accumulating for its formation during reductive elimination reactions (C-H bond-forming steps) and,as required by the principle of microscopic revers- ibility, during alkane oxidative additions (C-H bond- breaking steps). For instance, recent isotope-labeling studies have shown that the reductive elimination of methane from methyl tungsten hydride complexes is intramolecular and that hydrogen scrambling between the methyl and the hydride ligands is faster than methane elimination. This suggests that such scrambling requires the formation of a weakly held methane-tungsten c0mplex.4 Also, intermolecular reactions between organometallic intermediates and saturated hydrocarbons are usually favored over activation of C-H bonds within coordinated l i g a n d  . 4   -  ' A feature common to all these reactions seems to be the generation of a low-coordination,highly reactive complex with high electron density at the central metal. Such an unstable intermediate can in fact be photolytically generated in situ in an alkane solvent.41 Oxidative addition of alkanes has also been induced on bare metal atoms, either by radiating the metal in an alkane matrix,413.414 or by gas-phase generation of metal-alkane cIsters.4'.Evidence is also available for the complexation of alkanes on surfaces. Any molecule can, of course, be condensed at low enough substrate temperatures, but the fact that many metal-based catalysts are good promoters for alkane H-D exchange and hydro- genolysis reactions is a clear indication that the alkane-metal interaction is stronger than a purely van der Waals attraction. Alkane activation has also been reported on single-crystal surfaces under vacuum, in some cases via the formation of a weakly bonded alkane-metal intermediate. On Ni(100) surfaces, for instance, molecular beam experiments have shown that while the angular distribution of the scattered methane has the specular shape typical of direct inelastic scattering, butane displays a cosine dependence indicative of complete energy exchange with the surface, and both ethane and propane exhibit a behavior intermediate between those two extremes."?
More recent studies have extended these conclusions to other surfaces, and have helped in the estimation of some adsorption energies.

In high-symmetry cases, however, there could still be some rehybridization on the carbon atoms and some bending of the C-H bonds upward from the molec- ular plane.374 Lastly, a combination of NEXAFS, UPS, and XPS studies have led to the conclusion that at low temperatures and high coverages benzene adopts a tilted configuration on both P d ( l I P 6 and Pd(110),395 with the molecular plane inclined between 10" and 30" with respect to the metal surface.
Much less is known about the coordination of other aromatic compounds to metal surfaces.37739z397-399 On the basis of vibrational data it was concluded that toluene adsorbs molecularly on Pt(ll1) with the ring parallel to the surfae,3 but a NEXAFS study suggested that the ring is tilted instead, at least at 300 K.377 These two claims could be reconciled if it is assumed that the high-temperature species is in fact a u-bonded benzyl moiety; indirect evidence for this has been recently reported by Domagala et a 1 . 4

where the molecular ring is believed to be oriented parallel to the surface, but no low C-H stretching frequencies have been seen in smaller  ring.'," 2 .
Others Although no metal-alkane inorganic adducts have hitherto been isolated, there is ample evidence for the intramolecular interaction of C-H bonds with metallic centers in complexes with saturated ligands.
Early studies on a number of compounds containing polypyrazolyl ligands resulted in the observation of both unusual NMR chemical shifts and low C-H stretching freqencies.4 Further proof of the inter- action of aliphatic hydrogens with metal centers came from the observation of short M-HC distances in neutron-diffraction structural s t  d i e s , 4 and clear evidence for the existence of agostic interactions in metal compounds with a l k  l i d e n e and ligands was presented soon after. Agostic interac- tions have since been observed in a large number of compounds and are now well acepted.4"," Metal clusters with agostic interactions have been isolated as well; one particularly interesting example of this relates to the interconversion of methyl to methylene reported in a triosmium c l u  t e r . 4 ks in the case of alkanes, the structural and spectroscopic data for agostic systems reported thus far are consistent with the description of the metal- HC system in terms of a three-center, two-electron bond. Ab initio calculations have provided a theo- retical framework to support this hypothesi.4," The minimum requirement for agostic interactions is for the metal center to have an empty orbital to receive the two electrons of the C-H bond. It is presumed that this orbital has essentially d character and that its energy and disposition approach those of the C-H bonding orbital. Moreover, the metal atom could not have reached its maximum coordina- tion number; on the basis of steric considerations it is expected that the formation of agostic bonds is favored in metals having coordination numbers of six or less. Calculations for the agostic interaction between the / 3 C-H and the metal in ethyl ligands indicate that the coordination geometry is optimized when the M-C,-Co angle is on the order of go",the M-H distance is short (around
2.23 8
,
for Ti and 2.13 8, for Pd), and the C HB distance is large (1.11-
1.13 A, about 0.05 llonger than the other C-H
bonds within the same ligand). Agostic distortions have in fact been seen experimentally in coordinated methyl groups. In one example, the Ta-C,-H,angle was measured to be close to In spite of the relatively strong nature of the agostic interaction,which has a binding energy of the order of 10 kcaY mo1,406 agostic hydrogens are easily displaced by other donor groups if there are no steric constraints.
The existence of agostic interactions on surfaces has again been suggested by computer calcula- t i o n   . and supported by the appearance of soft modes in the C-H stretching region of the vibrational spectra. For methyl groups on Ni(11Ug4 and Pt(111)49,442,443 surfaces, broad bands have been re- ported around 2600-2700 cm-'. On the other hand,a series of theoretical calculations for the CH$ Ni(ll1) system has suggested that there is little Figure 7. High-resolution electron energy-loss spectrum (HREELS) for cyclohexane adsorbed on Pt(ll1) at low temperatures."' The broad and intense "sofbmode" seen around 2500 cm-' io this spectrum was initially assigned to an agostic interaction between some of the C-H bonds of the molecule and the surface atoms, but has later been reinterpreted as the result of a mild repulsive interaction between the metal and each of the three C-H bonds oriented directly toward the surface (the molecule is believed to maintain its chair configuration). found that the heat of molecular adsorption starts around 4-5 kcaYmol for methane, and increases at the rate of an additional 1-2 kcaYmol per methylene group in heavier Because this trend parallels that of the heats of vaporization of alkanes,it is reasonable to assume that the alkane chains adsorbs approximately flat on the surface. Infrared data support this conlusion.4 Temperature-programmed desorption experiments have confirmed the molecular beam results men- tioned above. They have also shown that the prob- ability for alkane decomposition (relative to its desorption) increases with increasing molecular The extent of this decomposition de- pends on the structure of the surface: open, "cor- rugated" surfaces can be several orders of magnitude more reactive than flat, "smooth" ones.418 Further evidence of a chemical interaction between the mol- ecule and the metal atoms comes from the develop- ment of a new, intense and broad band in the C-H stretching region of the vibrational spectra for cyclic alkanes (Figure 7). These new "soft" modes, which have frequency values as low as 2600 cm-' (more than 200 em-' below those of the gas-phase mol- ecule), have been observed for cyclohexane on pt(100),427 Cu(lll),4z8 and Cu(100).429 It was initially suggested that these modes were due to an attractive interaction between the C-H bond and the metal,but more recently they have been explained in terms of a geometrical match between the axial C-H bonds and the surface lattice.430 It is now believed that the cyclohexane molecules adsorb in their chair config- uration, with three of the axial hydrogens directed straight down to the surface and that the interaction between each C-H bond and the surface is in fact mildly repulsive. Similar soft modes have also been observed for cyclopentane chemisorbed on Pt(111),430"' (0001),423 Ni(111),424 d(ii1),425 Pt( 1 1

Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 2663 hydride similar to the one expected to form in the initial alkane activation step of that Ad- ditional kinetic and mechanistic studies of intramo- lecular alkane activation by metal complexes have also supported the idea of the formation of a reactive intermediate prior to the C-H bond-breaking step.407,408 In most cases the scission of saturated C-H bonds requires complexes with labile ligands,so they can be easily released to produce the electron- deficient electrophilic metal centers needed for three- center two-electron agostic interactions.323 Alkane activation can also be induced on solid metal surfaces. Most alkanes physisorb on metal surfaces at low temperatures, but they usually desorb molecularly upon heating of the sample;419,420 as mentioned above, alkane chemisorption requires the breaking of at least one C-H bond. One indication of the ability of metal surfaces in activating saturated C-H bonds is the fact that they are good catalysts for H-D exchange, dehydrogenation, isomerization,and hydrogenolysis of Vacuum studies on the adsorption and activation of alkanes on metal surfaces, by molecular beams as well as by more conventional adsorption-desorption techniques, have raised several issues related to the nature of the activation step. For one, the C-H bond scission may occur directly upon collision of the incoming gas molecule with the surface, or, alternatively, it may involve the formation of a weakly adsorbed interme- diate trapped on the surface. Many molecular beam studies have provided evidence for the first mecha- nism and have shown that the critical factor in determining the efficiency of the activation is the rate of energy transfer from the translational and internal degrees of freedom of the molecule to a particular C-H bond; the energy stored by the surface seems to be of little importance for this process.77,417,P56,457 An early study by Stewart and Ehrlich revealed that vibrational modes are the most likely source of energy for the dissociation of methane on rhodium (which provide about 7 kcal/m01),and Rettner et al. found that only the normal component of the translational energy of methane is important for the C-H bond breaking on W(l10).456 This latter conclusion has been later extended to the activation of both methane459-462 and other  alkane,,, on a variety of metal surfaces (Figure 8).
It has been suggested that direct alkane activation occurs via a tunneling mechanism.461,465-467 For one,the sticking probability of the alkane often increases monotonically with increasing kinetic energy, it does not display the threshold expected for cases where the kinetics are dominated by an activation barrier (Figure In addition, the observed shifts in the translational energy needed to activate CH4 vs CD4,or C2H6 vs C2D6, are usually on the order of 5 kcaV mol, much larger than the differences in their zero- point energies.468 Kinetic arguments, on the other hand, have been used to propose that the energy and angle dependence of the sticking coefficient of meth- ane observed experimentally may be related to the strongly peaked desorption profile of methane de- sorption from reductive elimination of methyl with hydrogen (the reverse of the oxidative addition of methane) i n  t e a d .    , In any case, most of these
IV. Reactivity
A. C-H Bond Activation
1. Alkanes
Developing methods to convert alkanes into other more useful compounds has proven to be a great challenge. Any reaction that involves alkanes must start with the scission of one of its C-H bonds, a process that requires energies of about 100 kcaVmo1.
It was reported some time ago that saturated hydro- carbons could be activated by soluble platinum salts at relatively high  temperature,,' but since no hydrido-alkyl metal complexes were detected in any of those studies, the reaction was proposed to require the formation of free radicals. The first reported example of an intermolecular addition of an alkane C-H bond into a metal compound was that induced by an intermediate produced via the photolytic activation of (Me&p)Ir(PMe3)(H)2.410 This reaction yields a hydrido-metal complex with the increase in coordination number and nominal oxidation state of the metal center expected in oxidative addition reactions. A few more reports have appeared in the literature for this type of C-H bond a d d i t i  n ,    ,but such a reaction is still regarded as difficult.The mechanism by which organometallic com- plexes activate alkanes is still far from understood.For instance, it is not entirely clear why C-H bonds do not add as readily as hydrogen molecules. It is currently believed that the main reason for this difference is that M-C bonds are in general weaker than M-H bonds.449,450 Indeed, oxidative addition is favored in systems where the resulting M-C bond is strong.451 The activation of arenes by (Me5Cp)Ir- (PMe3)(H)2,for example, is about four times faster than the activation of cyclohexane with the same complex,410 and primary carbon atoms in aliphatic alkanes are about three times more reactive than those in secondary positions (in spite of their higher bond energy), in this latter case perhaps because of the difference in steric hindrance.Much research points to the idea that alkane activation by organometallic compounds requires the formation of a weak intermediate complex. Although direct evidence for the formation of alkane-metal adducts is not yet available, the initial metal-HC interaction is believed to be agostic. For one, there are a large number of examples of stable complexes containing intramolecular agostic interactions.405 In particular, the characterization of catalytic cyclic dehydrogenation reactions with Ir(H)z(P(p-PhF)&-

Initial sticking coefficients for the dissociative adsorption of methane on Pt(lll),462 W(l10),456 and Ni(lll).94 These data, obtained by using supersonic mo- lecular beams, displays the exponential dependence of the sticking coefficient on the perpendicular component of the translational energy of the impinging methane molecules that argues for a direct tunneling mechanism for methane activation at high energies. Other evidence, however,suggests the possibility of a second, precursor-mediated,pathway at lower energies where the actual C-H bond scission is preceded by an agostic interaction between one of the C-H bonds of a weakly adsorbed methane and a metal atom. experiments used supersonic beams with narrow distributions of high energies, and given that only a small fraction of the gas molecules in a typical catalytic mixture (those at the high energy tail of the Boltzmann distribution) have such energies, the probability of any collision-induced alkane activation process would be expected to be low. This has been confirmed by high-pressure experiments, which have yielded values for the sticking probability of methane Other molecular beam work has provided evidence for a precursor-mediated alkane activation mecha- nism. The trapping probability of ethane on Ir(ll0)- (1x2), for instance, shows only a weak dependence on the angle of incidence of the beam, suggesting that the momentum of the incoming molecules is rapidly transferred to the surface.464 In some cases alkane dissociation is also assisted by an energy transfer from the surface: on both platinum and rhodium, for example,the sticking probability of methane depends on the temperature of the surface in an Arrhenius manner when the kinetic energy of the gas molecules is low, and displays an activation energy of between 5 and 10 k  a l / m o l .   l , Lastly, physisorbed methane can be activated by collisions with other impinging molecules (a "hammering" effect),477 and some chemi- sorbed heavier alkanes can be activated directly by heating of the s  b s t r a t e .  '  - Trapping-mediated surface reactions most likely proceed via a three-center two-electron intermediate similar to that proposed in organometallic sys- t e m  .   ,   ,    ,    , The activation barrier associated with the decomposition of alkanes on metal surfaces is in most cases lower than 20 kcal/mo1,471-474,484 less than one-fifth of the C-H bond energy in hydrocar- as low as 10-10-10-12 471-475 bon molecules. This suggests that an initial elec- tronic interaction between the alkane and the surface weakens these C-H bonds prior to reaction. In addition, chemical trends similar to those reported for organometallic systems have also been observed on surfaces. First, alkane activation is facilitated by electron deficiency at the metal center. There is a clear correlation between the position of the metal in the periodic table and its reactivity: early transi- tion metals are particularly efficient in dissociating medium-size alkane chains,422 and iridium dissociates both methane and ethane more efficiently than platinum.418 Second,there is a structure sensitivity associated with this reaction: for any given metal,rough surfaces are in general more active than close- packed ones.418,421 Lastly, the coadsorption of addi- tives such as alkali metals or chalcogens can activate nominally inert substrates for alkane decomposi- t i  n .On the other hand, an isotope labeling study of alkane decomposition on Pt(llO)-(l x2) indicated that secondary and tertiary carbon atoms within aliphatic hydrocarbons react faster than primary carbon,, an order opposite to that in organome- tallic complexes but in accord with the differences in bond energy.The oxidative addition of alkanes into metal sur- faces most likely leads to the formation of chemi- sorbed alkyl groups. Thus far this has been corrobo- rated only in one instance, for the case of methane on Ni(lll),where vibrational spectroscopy was used to identify the resulting methyl groups.488
2. Alkyls
By far the most common decomposition pathway in complexes with alkyl ligands is the loss of a hydrogen atom from the second carbon from the metal center (the /3 p o s i t i  n ) .    -   l This so-called P-hydride elimination reaction is believed to take place in a concerted step, via a planar four-center transition state which decomposes to form an (r2- alkene)metal-hydride complex. Normally this com- plex then releases a free alkene,492,493 but in some cases the coordinated olefin intermediate can be i s  l a t e d .    ,/3-Hydride elimination reactions are usually revers- ible,23,496 and in many cases part of isomerization497 and WD s  r a m b l i n g 4 processes. In cases where hydrogen scrambling is not a problem, isotopic label- ing experiments have successfully proven that hy- drogen abstraction is usually highly selective at the p position, and that the reaction displays a normal kinetic isotope effect.500 In dialkyl complexes the decomposition products normally consist of a 1:l alkane/alkene mixture, which is produced by a P-hy- dride elimination step followed by the reductive elimination of the second alkyl ligand.493,501 Several aspects of the mechanism for the P-H elimination have already been elucidated. First, the leaving hydrogen atom has a negative ion character.
This has been shown by studies on the effect that changing the substituent groups on the / 3 carbon has on the r e a c t i  n :    ,electron-withdrawing substit- uents suppress the reaction, while electron-donating groups enhance its rate. Second, the large negative entropy changes associated with the transition state Chemistry of Hydmcarbon M o i e t i e s
are consistent with a cyclic intermediate!04 And third, the stereochemistry for the reaction is also consistent with a syn elimination from that interme- diate.505 One of the key features of the mechanism for j3-hydride elimination is that it leads to an increase in the coordination number of the metal center. The reaction is therefore inoperative in coordinatively saturated compounds: any 18-electron complex has to lose at least one ligand in order to open a site for the elimination p r o d   t s . 4           - In 16-electron complexes, on the other hand, an additional coordi- nation site is usually available, except in Pd(I1) and
WII)
compounds, which tend to avoid the 18-electron c0diguration.4 8-Hydride elimination may also be hindered by steric effects when the alkyl groups are either too bulky,Sog or have a rigid structure not capable of arranging into the planar configuration required for the transition state!I0 Cyclopentyl groups, for instance, dehydrogenate at a rate several orders of magnitude faster than cyclohexyl ligand.', The activation energy for the &hydride elimination reaction ranges from 5490 to 30 kcaV mol,50g depending on the magnitude of these elec- tronic and steric effects. Its selectivity may also be affected by these parameters, and the preferential formation of 1-alkenes (the most common product),trans-2-alkenes (in some Cr compounds513),or even the less stable cis isomers (in bulky clusters514) may all be observed depending on the specific case. ,%Hydride elimination is also the most favorable alkyl decomposition reaction on surfaces. One of the best early examples of this was provided by temper- ature-programmed desorption studies on the decom- position of partially labeled ethyl iodides on Pt(ll1).It was shown that the thermal activation of ethyl groups on that surface leads to the exclusive release of a deuterium atom in the case of CDsCHzI, but of normal hydrogen from CH3CDzI in.tead.J* The preference for the 8-H elimination pathway has since been established for ethyl groups on AK100) and Al- (111),516,517 Fe(100),02 Ni(100),41 Pd(100),8 Wlll),ii1J551s Cu(lOo), Cu(ll1) and C  ( 1 1 0 ) ,  ,and Au(100) and Au(lll).71.521 Larger alkyl groups decompose by the same mechanism. The selectivity for 8- over either a- or y-hydride elimination was clearly demonstrated on both Cu(llO)M and Ni(100)42 surfaces by isotope labeling studies (Figure 9), and additional studies highlighted the ease with which 8-elimination occurs on other surfaces for straight alkyl chains of up to six  a r b o n s , 4  ,  ,   ,as well as for branched species such as isopropyl and isobu- The details of the mechanism for 8-H eliminations on metal surfaces have been addressed by a few research groups. An elegant series of experiments using fluorine-substituted propyl groups on Cu(ll1) have demonstrated the anionic nature of the leaving hydrogen in the same way as previously reported for organometallic The positive charge that develops on the 8 carbon in the transition state is also stabilized by electron-donating groups such as alkyls, making the reaction on either propyl or butyl species faster than on ethyl g r 0  p s .
