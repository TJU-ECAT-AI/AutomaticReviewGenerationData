I  An investigation of the radioactive emanation produced by thorium compounds. I. By E. Rutherford, M.A., D .

and
F. Soddy, B.A.
The main questions examined by the authors are (1) Can thoria, the emanating power of which has been largely destroyed by ignition,have this property restored to it by chemical treatment ? (2) Is eman- ating power to be regarded as a specific property of thorium, or is it due to the presence of a foreign material!
(3) Does the radioactive emanation itself resemble in chemical nature any known substance ?
The electrical methods employed for the measurement of emanating power and radioactivity depend on the universal property of the radiations from substances known as radioactive of ionising or producing charged carriers from the gas through which they pass whereby the gas is rendered capable of conducting a current of electricity.
The amount of the current, measured by means of a quadrant electrometer, affords the means of comparing the intensities of radiations, and the method is capable of a degree of precision and rapidity impossible with the better known photographic method.
Use was made of the rate of decay of the radiation from the emanation with lapse of time to recognise and distinguish between different types of emanation, and the study of the phenomena is thus rendered qualitative as well as quantitative in character.
The means Published on 01 January 1902. Downloaded by University of Pittsburgh on 24/10/2014 00:53:13.
View Article Online 3 employed for eliminating the effects of the emanation from the effects of the straight line radiation and vice versa were explained.
The first question is conclusively answered in the affirmative. After solution and reprecipitation,no difference was observed in the emanating powers of thorium compounds prepared from ordinary thoria and thoria de-emanated as completely as possible by intense ignition.
The latter process must therefore be regarded as an obliteration of the effect rather than a removal of the cause. The de-emanation of thoria by ignition leaves the straight line radioactivity quite unaffected.
With regard to the second question, the-attempts first made to sep- arate from thorium a substance to which the emanating power could be traced were not successful. These included a fractionation of the sulphate and a precipitation of thoria by potassium azoimide ac- cording to the method of Dennis.
No change in either the emanating power or radioactivity was observed in thoria prepared by these methods.
Subsequently, results of a different character were obtained.
It was found that water vapour increases and desiccation decreases the normal value of the emanating power, the extremes varying in the ratio of 2 to 1. Cooling acts powerfully in the opposite direction to illcrease of temperature.
At - 78O, the emanating power was only one-tenth of the normal, but no permanent alteration in value is pro- duced. The lapse of time in increasing the emanating power of freshly prepared thorium hydroxide is very striking. A maximum value appears to be attained after some days, and this is not much affected by sealing up the substance in glass.
An investigation of the third point, the chemical nature of the emanation itself, showed that this possesses the property of chemical inertness which characterises the members of the argon family. Using in the different cases suitable gases to carry the emanation from the thoria, it was subjected to the action of the following reagents on its way to the testing apparatus : red-hot lead chromate, white-hot plat- inum, platinum black raised gradually to a white heat, red-hot mag- nesium, zinc dust, and palladium black. I n each case the radioactivity of the gas current was quite unaffected, proving that, not only is the emanation not absorbed by these reagents, but also that its radio- activity is not thereby affected, The possible explanation that the emanation is the manifestation of excited radioactivity on the surround- ing atmosphere was shown to be untenable by a crucial experiment.
Since the only known gases which would survive in unaltered amount the action of all the reagents employed are the gases of the argon family, the authors conclude that the emanation is allied in properties to the elements of this group.
The emanating power of thorium nitrate, which in the solid state is only 1.8 per cent, of that of thoria, is increased 200 times by Published on 01 January 1902. Downloaded by University of Pittsburgh on 24/10/2014 00:53:13.

A remarkable observation has been made on the solutions from which thorium has -been precipitated with ammonia ; although these should be free from thoria, they still possess both emanating power and radioactivity in considerable amounts.
This has led to the preparation of substances free from thorium, but possessing radioactivity and emanating power indistinguishable from that of thorium, many hundred, in some cases over a thousand, times as active. The identity extended to the penetration power of the rays for metals and the rate of decay of the emanation. The fact that those processes in which a portion of the emanating material is certainly removed from thorium does not much affect the value of the emanating power of the latter, taken in conjunction with the very great variations which this value suffers in different circumstances and often spontaneously with time, leads to the bdief that emanating power is the manifestation of a dynamical change rather than a function of matter in the static condition.
I n  the same way as in chemical reaction, the active mass of a reacting solid appears indepen- dent of its quantity, so the rate of the change, of which emanating power is a measure, does not depend solely or even mainly on the quantity of emanating material present, The removal of the latter is consequently not accompanied by corresponding changes in the eman- ating power. The straight line radioactivity, on the other hand, is apparently unaffected by any of the causes which so profoundly alter the value of the emanating power, and appears much more likely to be additive with regard to mass. The effect of the removal<of an intensely radioactive and emanating material from thorium is found, in accord- ance with this view, to reduce the straight line radioactivity of the thorium very materially, These results show that thorium is partially separated from ThX, the constituent responsible for its activity, and the latter can be obtained free from thorium, The chemical examination of the thorium-free active substances pre- pared in the manner described showed the presence of an unknown substance, precipitated from its solutions by sodium phosphate.This the authors regard as merely an accidental impurity. The actual ThX is probably present only in minute quantity, exhibiting the behaviour of being dragged down by precipitates, without reference to its true analytical bohaviour.By evaporation of water with which thoria has been shaken for some time, small deposits are obtained which are often of the order of a thousand fold Another method of separation confirms this view, Published on 01 January 1902.

The washed sample exhibits a considerable reduction of radioactivity after the process, whilst the character of the radiations as before is identical with the ordinary thorium radiation.A careful chemical examination failed to reveal the presence of any other element besides thorium. The view that the radioactivity and emanating power of thorium is to be ascribed to the presence of a minute amount of a constituent ThX of correspondingly great activity is thus confirmed.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. VERNON
HARCOURT
had previously read two papers by Professor Rutherford in the Philosophical Magaaine which explained the apparatus used by the authors. The authors conclusion that the influence upon the conducting power of air or other gas interposed between oppositely electrified surfaces is due, not to an imponderable force radiating from the molecules of thoria, but to the escape in minute quantity of some substance which is mixed with the thoria, and which can be dissolved and precipitated, was of very great interest,. H e might recall the observations and conclusions of Dr. Russell, who had investigated the photographic effect of the emanation from a number of substances, and had similarly concluded that the results were due, not to such an agent as light or electricity, but to the action of hydrogen peroxide. *2. L L  The constitution of hydrocyanic, cyanic, and cyanuric acids.
By F. D. Chattaway and J. M. Wadmore.
A study of the behaviour of cyanogen chloride, bromide, and iodide shows that they possess the typical and characteristic properties of compounds in which halogen is attached to nitrogen.
They react, for example, quantitatively with solutions of hydriodic acid, sulphurous acid, and hydrogen sulphide, hydrocyanic acid being in each case reformed, whilst iodine, sulphuric acid, and sulphur respec- tively are produced.
They must consequently be regarded as imino-derivatives and be represented by the constitutional formuh,
C:N*Cl
C:N*Br
C:N*I.
The ease with which the cyanogen halogen compounds can be formed from hydrocyanic acid and its salts and again transformed into them makes it in the highest degree probable that these also have the imino-constitution and must be represented by formulae such as

Cyanuric acid also yields a derivative in which all its hydrogen is replaced by chlorine and which has the composition C,O,N,CI,.
It is formed by the action of chlorine on a solution of potassium cyanurate.
It is a white powder, insoluble or soluble only with decomposition in most ordinary solvents, which under the microscope is seen to consist of short prisms, m, p. 245'.Its behaviour shows that the whole of its chlorine is attached to nitrogen. It liberates chlorine when treated with hydrochloric acid,iodine with hydriodic acid, and oxidises sulphurous to sulphuric acid ;it reacts explosively with a strong solution of ammonia, nitrogen being evolved, and also with a solution of hydrogen sulphide, setting free sulphur ;cyanuric acid is in each case reformed.Since cyanurates are readily and completely converted into this tri- chlorimino-derivative, and the latter in many reactions equally readily and completely again into cyanuric acid, the conclusion is justified that the latter and its derivatives are imino- and not hydroxy-com- pounds, and assuming the ring structure, they must therefore be re- presented by the formulae :8

A similar study of the behaviour of cyanuric chloride and bromide shows that in them the halogen is attached to carbon and not to nitrogen.
DISCUSSION.
Professor DOBBIE said that in a paper (Hartley, Dobbie, and Lauder, Twns., 1901, 79, 848) on the absorption spectra of cyanogen com- pounds, it had been pointed out that il cyanuric acid possessed the formula usually assigned to it, it differed from all substances hitherto examined in which carbon and nitrogen atoms were united by alternate double and single bonds in showing no selective absorption.
This was the case, however, not only with the derivatives of cyanuric, but also of those of isocyanuric acid, so that if cyanuric acid possessed the imino-structure attributed to it by the authors, there still remained Published on 01 January 1902. Downloaded by University of Pittsburgh on 24/10/2014 00:53:13.
View Article Online 7 the difficulty of satisfactorily representing the constitution of the iso- derivatives.
All that spectroscopic examination proves is that it is extremely unlikely that any of these compounds possess a structure analogous to that of pyridine or dimethylpyrazine.
Mr. C. E. GROVES said that the very interesting substance, C,O,N,Cl,,to which the authors had given the name of trichloraminocyanuric acid, seemed to have rather the properties of a hypochlorite.
Several ring compounds were known somewhat analogous to it in properties,o f which the constitutions mere accurately known in so far that the chloriue was certainly not attached to nitrogen ;such, for instance,was the compound obtained by chlorinating trichloro-orcinol, C,CI,Me(OH),,which might be represented by the hypochlorite formula, C,Cl,Me(OCl),.
I
f this view were adopted, the formula of the new substance might be represented as C,N,(OCl),, in harmony with that usually assigned to cyanuric acid, C,N,(OH),.
Dr. LAPWORTH thought that, even if the halogen derivatives re- ferred to had the constitutions which it was proposed to assign to them, it did not follow that the acids from which they are obtained had the same structure.
The conclusions drawn were no doubt cor- rect, but this had been decided by physical methods.
Reasqning based on the assumption that a substituting atom or group takes up the position originally occupied by the atom displaced could only be accepted with the utmost caution when the molecule is of a labile type.
Thus, in the replacement of the metal in ethyl sodioacetoacetate by alkyls, the new group becomes attached to the carbon atom, but it is not generally conceded that the metal in the original compound occupied that position.
Again, by the action of bromine water on phenol, a tetrabromo-substitution product having the structure - o: C<CBr: CH>C<Br * is obtained (Beqe., 1900, 3 3 ,
674), but this is CBr:
C H
Br not a sufficient reason for representing phenol by the formula O : C <   $  > G H , .  I n  such cases the reactions are open to several interpretations, and in the present case the substitution experiments may be explained equally well by using the alternative formulae for the acids.
Dr. FORSTER pointed out that the conversion of cyanuric acid into the chloro-derivative by the action of chlorine on a solution of the acid in potassium hydroxide is an argument which supports the hydroxylic representation of cyanuric acid quite as strongly as the iminic, the change represented by the formula, Published on 01 January 1902.

View Article Online 8 leading easi derivative. from hydroxylic cyanuric acid to the nitrogen chloride Dr. TRAVERS remarked that though the authors had referred to the work of Hartley and others as supporting their theory, the re- searches of these same investigators on isatin and its methyl deriva- tives pointed to the danger of accepting such conclusions.
Since ketonic isatin gives rise, by treating its salts with methyl iodide, to enolic methyl isatin, obviousIy no conclusion could be drawn from such a reaction, which they explain on the basis of the ionic theory.
Professor DUNSTAN was of opinion that in general the tautomerism of these cyanogen derivatives renders it impossible to assign to any one of them a formula which will satisfactorily account for all its reactions. The authors had obtained a very interesting chlorine derivative of cyanuric acid, but its behaviour did not appear to be inconsistent with its being regarded as containing chlorine in the place of the hydrogen of three hydroxyl groups.
He considered im- probable the authors explanation of its decomposition by hydro- chloric acid giving free chlorine.
Dr. CHATTAWAY in reply said that their work neither proved nor disproved the cyclic constitution of cyanuric acid ;it only showed that,whatever the formula, the whole of the hydrogen was attached to nitro- gen, and therefore the hydroxylic formula was not possible.
The stability of the chlorine derivative of cyanuric acid and the analogy of its reactions with those of substances such as nitrogen iodide and cyanogen iodide showed that it could not contain -0-GI groups.

4.  A
n e w colour reaction of hydroxylamine. By W. C. Ball, During the course of some experiments on the action of hydroxyl- amine salts on nickel sulphide, the author obtained an intense purple coloration, which proved eventually to be independent of the presence of nickel or any other metal.
The production of this colour is a very delicate test for hydroxyl- amine, as solutions so dilute as no longer to reduce Fehlings solution perceptibly, either in the cold or on boiling, easily respond to this test.
The best method of applying the reaction is to boil the hydroxyl- amine solution with one or two drops of yellow ammonium sulphide solution until a precipitate of sulphur is produced ;two or three cubic centimetres of 0.880 ammonia solution are then added, and finally an equal volume of strong pure alcohol.
The purple colour thus developed exhibits a characteristic absorption spectrum, consisting of a wide band covering the yellow, orange and part of the green. In stronger solutions, the violet an3 blue are absorbed, and in very strong solutions the green rays also, so that the only light transmitted is a band in the red.
With a dilution of 1 part of hydroxylamine in 2000 of water the coloration is intense and the band very distinct; with a dilution of 1 part in 300,000 of water, the coloration is still strong, and the band perceptible in 3 centimetres thickness of the solution. By means of this test hydroxylamine may be detected when the dilution does not exceed 1 part in 500,000 of water.
The production of the colour is well adapted for showing the form- ation of hydroxylamine by the action of metals, for example, tin, on nitric acid. It also serves as a very good means of distinguishing hydroxylamine from hydrazine, as the latter base does not produce the colour.
The coloured substance is also produced, and can be obtained in the solid form, by the action of dry ammonia on an alcoholic solution of sulphur monobromide, or an acetone solution of nitrogen sulphide in presence of a little hydrogen sulphide.
The colouring matter seems to be the same as that observed by Fordos and GBlis when nitrogen sulphide containing sulphur is treated with alcoholic potash.
The absorption spectrum of the compound appears to be identical with that of Moissans sulphammonium, obtained by the action of liquid ammonia on sulphur.
The author is endeavouring to obtain the substance pure enough for analysis.

The following details have been recorded, as it is not generally known within what small limits of temperature a bath may be kept constant,using gas heating and the ordinary form of regulator. The glass ' horse- shoe ' reservoir was of the usual form, with a capacity of 390 C.C. and an outer surface of about 650 sq. cm. ;to this reservoir the ordinary U-form regulating tube which contains mercury, was fused on and the glass con- nections so bent that all the tubes containing enclosed liquid were under the water of the bath.As toluene was used for the expanding liquid,the stopcock that closes one limb of the U-tube was lubricated with syrupy phosphoric acid.The bath held 14 litres and was of enamelled iron, with no jacket.The stirrer was driven by a small electromotor, and care was taken that a portion of the vibration of the motor was communicated to the regulator, thus aiding the free move- ment of the mercury in response to the pressure of the toluene. The gas supply to the bye-pass was adjusted by a screw-clip in such a way that the bye-pass flame alone was nearly sufficient to maintain the temperature.Using a tube o f
3.1 mm. bore for the outer limb of the
regulator, the temperature of the bath can be kept constant at 18' within a total range of 0*008",that is, 0.004 on each side of the middle point.
After 24 days, using unfiltered coal-gas, the actual tempera- ture was the same as a t  starting, and the closeness of regulation was found still within the above limits. I f narrower tubes be used, i t is well to dry and filter the gas. The inlet tube that leads the gas down to the surface of the mercury is cut off square and should be so wide that on trial the mercury rises higher in it than in the space be- tween it and the regulator tube. A bore of 1.9 mm. for the outer limb of the regulator gave a temperature variation in the bath of not more (though probably less) than 0.0025 (total range).
The difference of temperature between bath and room was 6-7';if the flame mere removed, the bath was found to cool 0.1' in 4.5 minutes.With this regulator, a well-tapped calorimetric thermometer by Golaz, divided into fiftieths of a degree, remained apparently stationary to an esti- mated tenth-division, as also did a " Beckmann " thermometer graduated directly to hundredths.
The limits actually registered by two large special alcohol thermometers (one with a bulb of extremely thin glass 180 mm. long and 5 mm. in diameter) mere less than those stated above, which are given after making due allowance for the sluggishness of action of such thermometers.

The action of methylene iodide on aryl- and naphthyl-amines :diarylmethylenediamines,acridines, and naphthacridines." By
A. Senier and W. Goodwin.
The compounds obtained by the interaction of methylene iodide and arylamines (Trans., 1901, 72, 254) were believed to be arylmethylene- diamines. The study of these compounds now proves that in the case of the reaction with aniline, the toluidines, and xylidine, such diamines are formed. With +-cumidhe, however, the well-defined, beautiful, yellow,crystalline compound which results is shown to be a condensation pro- duct. Its analysis, vapour density, the fluorescence of its solutions,and the analogy of its formation to the anthracene synthesis of Friedel and Crafts (Ann. Phys., 1887, [ vi], 11, 263) and the acridine synthesis of Bernthsen and Bender (Ber., 1883, 1 6 ,
1802), indicate it to be an acridine :-hexamethylacridine.
This view is confirmed by the exactly parallel behaviour of both a- and P-naphthylnmine with methylene iodide,giving rise to similar compounds, and the identity of the P-compound with the P-naphthacridine already known. This naphthacridine was discovered by Reed, using a different reaction (2 pr. Chem.,[ii], 1886,3 4 ,
160; 1887, 3 5 ,
298), and has led to interesting results in the hands of Morgan (Trans., 1898, 73, 536).

The polymerisation of cyanic acid : cyanuric acid and cyamelide. By A. Senier and T. Walsh.
I n  the polymerisation of liquid cyanic acid, cyamelide is not the only product.
The two isomerides, cyamelide and cyanuric acid, are formed. These may be separated by treatment with water.
Pure cyamelide so obtained is soluble in water to the extent of 0.01 per cent. at 15.
The solubility of cyanuric acid a t  15 is from 0.145 to
0.16 per cent. Phosphorus pentachloride has no action on cyamelide.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.
