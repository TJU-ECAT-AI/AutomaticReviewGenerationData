The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization catalysts based on lanthanides and actinides involves the activation of the allylic CH bond instead of propene insertion, leading to the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes. For silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, the deactivation mechanism includes the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, involving a β-H transfer process. The resulting allyl hydride intermediate can react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which can either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or lead to degrafting through β-H abstraction by the siloxy ligand. These deactivation pathways can significantly impact the performance and longevity of the catalysts.
