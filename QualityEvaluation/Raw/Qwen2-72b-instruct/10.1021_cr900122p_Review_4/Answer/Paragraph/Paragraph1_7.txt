                    The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization catalysts based on lanthanides and actinides involves the activation of the allylic CH bond instead of propene insertion, leading to the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. For silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, the deactivation mechanism includes the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, involving a β-H transfer process \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. The resulting allyl hydride intermediate can react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which can either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or lead to degrafting through β-H abstraction by the siloxy ligand \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. These deactivation pathways can significantly impact the performance and longevity of the catalysts \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advanced insights into the deactivation mechanisms of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, there is a compelling opportunity to explore novel strategies for enhancing catalyst stability and longevity. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalyst systems that are resistant to intramolecular C-H bond activation, thereby mitigating the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer processes. This could involve the design of novel ligand architectures that stabilize the active catalyst species against deactivation pathways. Additionally, the investigation of alternative support materials that do not facilitate β-H abstraction could lead to significant improvements in catalyst performance. The development of in situ monitoring techniques to track the deactivation pathways in real-time could also provide crucial insights into the dynamic behavior of these catalysts under reaction conditions, guiding the rational design of next-generation catalysts.

                    基于镧系和锕系元素的支撑烯烃聚合催化剂的失活涉及烯丙基CH键的激活，而不是丙烯插入，导致形成不活跃的π-烯丙基表面复合物\[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]。对于硅胶支撑的Re基烯烃复分解催化剂，失活机制包括在金属环丁烷中间体的β位激活CH键，涉及β-H转移过程\[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]。生成的烯丙基氢化物中间体可以与乙烯反应形成高度反应性物种，这可以通过相邻烷基配体之间的α-H抽提再生催化剂，或通过硅氧配体的β-H抽提导致脱附\[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]。这些失活途径可能对催化剂的性能和寿命产生重大影响\[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]。
