                    The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization catalysts, particularly those based on lanthanides and actinides, is intricately linked to the activation of the allylic CH bond, rather than propene insertion, culminating in the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. This pathway diverts the catalyst from its intended function, leading to a decrease in its efficiency. Similarly, silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts undergo deactivation through the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, a process involving β-H transfer \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. The allyl hydride intermediate that results can react with ethene, forming a highly reactive species. This species has the potential to either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or lead to degrafting through β-H abstraction by the siloxy ligand \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. These deactivation pathways have significant implications for the performance and longevity of the catalysts, affecting their overall efficiency and operational lifespan.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The detailed examination of deactivation pathways in supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts reveals the pivotal role of intramolecular C-H bond activation. This insight opens avenues for the development of more robust catalyst systems that can mitigate these deactivation mechanisms. Future research might focus on the design of catalysts with tailored ligand environments that can suppress β-H transfer and stabilize π-allyl complexes, thereby enhancing catalyst longevity. Additionally, the exploration of alternative dehydrogenation pathways that bypass the formation of reactive intermediates susceptible to deactivation could lead to the discovery of novel catalysts with improved stability and efficiency. The integration of computational chemistry with experimental methods could further elucidate the mechanistic details of these processes, guiding the rational design of next-generation catalysts.

                    基于镧系和锕系元素的支撑烯烃聚合催化剂的失活与烯丙基CH键的激活紧密相关，而非丙烯插入，最终形成不活跃的π-烯丙基表面复合物\[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]。这一途径使催化剂偏离其预定功能，导致其效率下降。同样，硅胶支撑的Re基烯烃复分解催化剂通过在金属环丁烷中间体的β位激活CH键而失活，这一过程涉及β-H转移\[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]。生成的烯丙基氢化物中间体可以与乙烯反应，形成高度反应性的物种。这一物种有可能通过在两个相邻烷基配体之间进行α-H抽提来再生催化剂，或通过硅氧配体的β-H抽提导致脱植\[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]。这些失活途径对催化剂的性能和寿命有重大影响，影响其整体效率和运行寿命。
