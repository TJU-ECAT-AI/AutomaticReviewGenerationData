                    The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization catalysts, particularly those based on lanthanides and actinides, is intricately linked to the activation of the allylic CH bond, a process that supersedes propene insertion and culminates in the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. This mechanism elucidates a critical pathway for catalyst deactivation. Similarly, silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts undergo deactivation through the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, a process that involves β-H transfer \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. The resulting allyl hydride intermediate can engage with ethene, forming a highly reactive species. This species has the dual potential to either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or lead to degrafting through β-H abstraction by the siloxy ligand \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. These deactivation pathways have profound implications for the performance and longevity of the catalysts.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: In light of the detailed mechanisms of intramolecular C-H bond activation leading to the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, there is a compelling need for the development of novel strategies to mitigate these deactivation pathways. Future research endeavors might focus on engineering catalysts with enhanced stability against C-H bond activation, potentially through the design of ligands that sterically or electronically hinder these processes. Additionally, the exploration of alternative activation modes that bypass the allylic CH bond activation could lead to the creation of more robust and long-lasting catalyst systems. The integration of computational chemistry with experimental findings could also provide deeper insights into the deactivation mechanisms, guiding the rational design of catalysts with improved performance and longevity.

                    基于镧系和锕系元素的支撑烯烃聚合催化剂的失活与烯丙基CH键的激活紧密相关，这一过程优先于丙烯插入，最终形成不活跃的π-烯丙基表面复合物\[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]。这一机制揭示了催化剂失活的关键途径。同样，硅胶支撑的Re基烯烃复分解催化剂通过在金属环丁烷中间体的β位激活CH键而失活，这一过程涉及β-H转移\[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]。生成的烯丙基氢化物中间体可以与乙烯反应，形成高度反应性的物种。该物种具有双重潜力，既能通过两个相邻烷基配体之间的α-H抽提再生催化剂，也能通过硅氧配体的β-H抽提导致脱接\[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]。这些失活途径对催化剂的性能和寿命有深远的影响。

                    综合理解与未来展望: 鉴于导致支撑烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂失活的分子内C-H键激活的详细机制，迫切需要开发新的策略来缓解这些失活途径。未来的研究工作可能集中在设计对C-H键激活具有增强稳定性的催化剂上，可能通过设计在立体或电子上阻碍这些过程的配体来实现。此外，探索绕过烯丙基CH键激活的替代激活模式，可能会导致更坚固、更持久的催化剂系统的创建。计算化学与实验发现的结合也可能为失活机制提供更深入的见解，指导性能和寿命改善的催化剂的合理设计。
