                    The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization catalysts, particularly those based on lanthanides and actinides, is intricately linked to the activation of the allylic CH bond, rather than propene insertion, culminating in the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. This pathway diverts the catalyst from its intended function, leading to a reduction in its activity and longevity. Similarly, silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts undergo deactivation through the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, a process that involves β-H transfer \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. The allyl hydride intermediate generated from this process can react with ethene, forming a highly reactive species. This species has the potential to either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or lead to degrafting through β-H abstraction by the siloxy ligand \[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]. These deactivation pathways significantly impact the performance and longevity of the catalysts, underscoring the importance of understanding and controlling intramolecular C-H bond activation in the context of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The insights into the deactivation mechanisms of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts through intramolecular C-H bond activation open up new avenues for the design of more robust and efficient catalyst systems. Future research endeavors might focus on developing strategies to mitigate the deleterious effects of these deactivation pathways, such as the engineering of catalyst supports that can stabilize the active species against β-H transfer or the design of ligands that can prevent the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes. Additionally, the exploration of alternative activation modes that bypass the allylic CH bond activation could lead to the discovery of novel catalysts with enhanced stability and activity. These advancements could significantly contribute to the field of catalysis, enabling more sustainable and efficient chemical processes.

                    基于镧系和锕系元素的支撑烯烃聚合催化剂的失活与烯丙基CH键的激活紧密相关，而非丙烯插入，最终形成不活跃的π-烯丙基表面复合物\[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]。这一途径使催化剂偏离其预期功能，导致其活性和寿命的降低。同样，硅胶支撑的铼基烯烃复分解催化剂通过在金属环丁烷中间体的β位CH键的激活而失活，这一过程涉及β-H转移\[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]。从这一过程中生成的烯丙基氢化物中间体可以与乙烯反应，形成一个高度反应性的物种。这一物种有可能通过两个相邻烷基配体之间的α-H抽提来再生催化剂，或者通过硅氧配体的β-H抽提导致脱植\[10.1021/cr900122p_4\]。这些失活途径对催化剂的性能和寿命有重大影响，突显了在支撑烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂的背景下理解和控制分子内C-H键激活的重要性。
