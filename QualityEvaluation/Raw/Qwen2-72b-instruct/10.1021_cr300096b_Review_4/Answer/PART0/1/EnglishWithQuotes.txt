For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst. CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification.\"\n          [2] \"The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature.\"", "English": "CO chemisorption is a common method for determining the number of active metal sites in bimetallic catalysts. This is achieved by measuring the CO uptake using specialized instruments, such as the AMI-200ip. The process involves loading a known amount of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, reducing it with a hydrogen-containing gas mixture at a specific temperature, cooling it to room temperature, and then pulsing CO over the catalyst. The effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). To compare catalytic activity among different catalysts, reaction rates must be normalized by the CO uptake values. CO chemisorption can also estimate metal dispersion assuming a 1:1 M/CO stoichiometry, although this is an oversimplification. H2 chemisorption is also used to determine active metal sites, but caution is needed as hydrogen can desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr300096b_4"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The literature does not provide a direct comparison between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. However, it does mention the use of CO chemisorption to determine metal dispersion and CO uptake, which provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts. The dispersion values might not be very meaningful due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, but they are listed to provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion.
