[1] "CO and H2 Chemisorption One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption. The CO uptake can be measured using many specialized instruments, but as an example, an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) is a viable option. Measurements are performed by loading a known quantity of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, which is then inserted into the instrument. Catalysts are reduced with a desired H2-containing gas mixture at a specified temperature and then are cooled to room temperature. After cooling, CO is pulsed over the catalyst, and the amount of effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst. CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification."
          [2] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."



[1] "To avoid the complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption (i.e. spillover) we have employed CO chemisorption to estimate exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts."
          [2] "Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd. And, as it has been long recognized, the stoichiometry may vary, even for the same metal, with varying particle size."
          [3] "However, on platinum catalysts, the CO/Pt(surf) has been found to be unity for a wide range of dispersions."
          [4] "These losses in metal dispersion can be related to the increased color inhomogeneities observed after calcinations of the fluorinated catalysts."
          [5] "The observed trend is perfectly consistent with the EXAFS data shown below and with the cluster sizes observed by TEM (not shown)."
          [6] "The CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system."
          [7] "The impregnation method has also an effect on metal dispersion."
          [8] "The F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 sample prepared by aqueous solution resulted in higher exposed metal fraction than that of F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3(E), prepared using ethylene glycol."
