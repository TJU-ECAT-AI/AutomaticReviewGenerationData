CO chemisorption is a common method for determining the number of active metal sites in bimetallic catalysts. This is achieved by measuring the CO uptake using specialized instruments, such as the AMI-200ip. The process involves loading a known amount of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, reducing it with a hydrogen-containing gas mixture at a specific temperature, cooling it to room temperature, and then pulsing CO over the catalyst. The effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). To compare catalytic activity among different catalysts, reaction rates must be normalized by the CO uptake values. CO chemisorption can also estimate metal dispersion assuming a 1:1 M/CO stoichiometry, although this is an oversimplification. H2 chemisorption is also used to determine active metal sites, but caution is needed as hydrogen can desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. However, it does mention the use of CO chemisorption to determine metal dispersion and CO uptake, which provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts. The dispersion values might not be very meaningful due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, but they are listed to provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion. The amount of adsorbed CO is used as a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the catalysts.

CO chemisorption is used to estimate the exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of different catalysts to avoid complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption, such as spillover. CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, but direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone due to varying CO/metal stoichiometry from Pt to Pd and even for the same metal with varying particle size. On platinum catalysts, the CO/Pt(surf) ratio is unity for a wide range of dispersions. Losses in metal dispersion can be related to increased color inhomogeneities observed after calcinations of the fluorinated catalysts, which is consistent with EXAFS data and cluster sizes observed by TEM. The CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system. The impregnation method also affects metal dispersion, with the F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 sample prepared by aqueous solution resulting in higher exposed metal fraction than that prepared using ethylene glycol.
