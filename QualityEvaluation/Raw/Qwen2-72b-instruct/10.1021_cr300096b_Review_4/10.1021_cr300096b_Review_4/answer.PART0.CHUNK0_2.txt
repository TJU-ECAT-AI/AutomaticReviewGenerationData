[1] "CO and H2 Chemisorption One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption. The CO uptake can be measured using many specialized instruments, but as an example, an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) is a viable option. Measurements are performed by loading a known quantity of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, which is then inserted into the instrument. Catalysts are reduced with a desired H2-containing gas mixture at a specified temperature and then are cooled to room temperature. After cooling, CO is pulsed over the catalyst, and the amount of effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst. CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification."
[2] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."

1.CO化学吸附是一种通过测量CO吸收量来确定双金属催化剂中活性金属位点数量的技术。这通过将已知数量的煅烧催化剂装入石英管中，用含H2的气体混合物在指定温度下还原，冷却至室温，然后向催化剂脉冲CO来完成。使用热导检测器(TCD)测量排出的CO量。为了正确比较不同催化剂的催化活性，必须将反应速率归一化为每个催化剂上的CO吸收值。CO化学吸附还可以通过假设M/CO = 1:1的化学计量比(其中M = Pt, Ni, Pd等)来估计金属分散度，尽管1:1的比率显然是过度简化的。H2化学吸附也被用来确定活性金属位点的数量，但必须小心，因为氢气在室温下开始从一些双金属表面脱附。
