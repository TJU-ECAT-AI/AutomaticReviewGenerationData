[1] "CO and H2 Chemisorption One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption. The CO uptake can be measured using many specialized instruments, but as an example, an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) is a viable option. Measurements are performed by loading a known quantity of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, which is then inserted into the instrument. Catalysts are reduced with a desired H2-containing gas mixture at a specified temperature and then are cooled to room temperature. After cooling, CO is pulsed over the catalyst, and the amount of effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst. CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification."
[2] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."

1.CO chemisorption is a key technique for determining the number of active metal sites in bimetallic catalysts. It involves measuring the CO uptake using specialized instruments like the AMI-200ip.

The amount of effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst for proper comparison of catalytic activity. CO chemisorption can also estimate metal dispersion assuming a stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1, which is an oversimplification. H2 chemisorption is also used to determine active metal sites, but caution is required as hydrogen can desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature.

1.CO化学吸附是确定双金属催化剂中活性金属位点数量的关键技术。它涉及使用如AMI-200ip等专用仪器测量CO的吸收量。该过程包括将已煅烧的催化剂的已知量装入石英管中，用含H2的气体混合物在特定温度下还原，冷却至室温，然后向催化剂脉冲CO。使用热导检测器(TCD)测量排出的CO量。为了正确比较不同催化剂的催化活性，必须通过每个催化剂上的CO吸收值来归一化反应速率。CO化学吸附还可以通过假设M/CO = 1:1的化学计量比(其中M = Pt, Ni, Pd等)来估计金属分散度，尽管1:1的比例显然是过度简化的。H2化学吸附也用于确定活性金属位点，但必须小心，因为氢气在室温下会从某些双金属表面解吸。
