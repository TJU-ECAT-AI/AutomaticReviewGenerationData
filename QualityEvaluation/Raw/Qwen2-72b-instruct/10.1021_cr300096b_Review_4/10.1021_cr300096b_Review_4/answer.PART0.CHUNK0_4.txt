[1] "CO and H2 Chemisorption One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption. The CO uptake can be measured using many specialized instruments, but as an example, an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) is a viable option. Measurements are performed by loading a known quantity of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, which is then inserted into the instrument. Catalysts are reduced with a desired H2-containing gas mixture at a specified temperature and then are cooled to room temperature. After cooling, CO is pulsed over the catalyst, and the amount of effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst. CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification."
[2] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."

1.CO chemisorption is a key technique for determining the number of active metal sites in bimetallic catalysts. It involves measuring the CO uptake using specialized instruments, such as the AMI-200ip, by loading a known quantity of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, reducing it with a hydrogen-containing gas mixture, cooling it to room temperature, and then pulsing CO over the catalyst. The effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Reaction rates must be normalized by the CO uptake values for proper comparison among different catalysts. CO chemisorption can also estimate metal dispersion assuming a 1:1 M/CO ratio, which is an oversimplification. H2 chemisorption is also used to determine active metal sites, but caution is needed as hydrogen can desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature.

1.CO化学吸附是一种关键的技术，用于确定双金属催化剂中活性金属位点的数量。它涉及使用专用仪器（如AMI-200ip）测量CO的吸收量，具体方法是将已煅烧的催化剂的已知量装入石英管中，用含氢气体混合物还原，冷却至室温，然后向催化剂脉冲CO。使用热导检测器（TCD）测量流出的CO。为了在不同催化剂之间进行适当的比较，反应速率必须通过每个催化剂上的CO吸收值进行归一化。CO化学吸附还可以通过假设1:1的M/CO比率来估计金属分散度，但这是一种过度简化的假设。H2化学吸附也被用来确定活性金属位点，但需要注意的是，氢气在室温下可以从一些双金属表面解吸。
