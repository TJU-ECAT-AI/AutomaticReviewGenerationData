[1] "CO and H2 Chemisorption One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption. The CO uptake can be measured using many specialized instruments, but as an example, an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) is a viable option. Measurements are performed by loading a known quantity of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, which is then inserted into the instrument. Catalysts are reduced with a desired H2-containing gas mixture at a specified temperature and then are cooled to room temperature. After cooling, CO is pulsed over the catalyst, and the amount of effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst. CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification."
[2] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."

1.CO chemisorption is a common method for determining the number of active metal sites in bimetallic catalysts. This is achieved by measuring the CO uptake using specialized instruments, such as the AMI-200ip. The process involves loading a known amount of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, reducing it with a hydrogen-containing gas mixture at a specific temperature, cooling it to room temperature, and then pulsing CO over the catalyst. The effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). To compare catalytic activity among different catalysts, reaction rates must be normalized by the CO uptake values. CO chemisorption can also estimate metal dispersion assuming a 1:1 M/CO stoichiometry, although this is an oversimplification. H2 chemisorption is also used to determine active metal sites, but caution is needed as hydrogen can desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature.

1.CO化学吸附是一种常见的方法，用于确定双金属催化剂中活性金属位点的数量。这通过使用专用仪器（如AMI-200ip）测量CO的吸收量来实现。该过程包括将已知量的煅烧催化剂装入石英管中，用含氢气体混合物在特定温度下还原，冷却至室温，然后将CO脉冲通过催化剂。使用热导检测器（TCD）测量排出的CO。为了比较不同催化剂之间的催化活性，反应速率必须根据每个催化剂上的CO吸收值进行归一化。CO化学吸附还可以通过假设1:1的M/CO摩尔比来估计金属分散度，尽管这显然是一个过度简化的假设。H2化学吸附也被用来确定活性金属位点，但需要注意的是，氢气在室温下会从某些双金属表面解吸。
