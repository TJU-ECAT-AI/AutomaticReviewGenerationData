[1] "CO and H2 Chemisorption One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption. The CO uptake can be measured using many specialized instruments, but as an example, an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) is a viable option. Measurements are performed by loading a known quantity of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, which is then inserted into the instrument. Catalysts are reduced with a desired H2-containing gas mixture at a specified temperature and then are cooled to room temperature. After cooling, CO is pulsed over the catalyst, and the amount of effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst. CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification."
[2] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."

1.CO chemisorption is a common method for determining the number of active metal sites in bimetallic catalysts. This is achieved by measuring the CO uptake using specialized instruments like the AMI-200ip. The process involves loading a known quantity of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, reducing it with a H2-containing gas mixture at a specified temperature, cooling it to room temperature, and then pulsing CO over the catalyst. The amount of effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). To compare catalytic activity among different catalysts, reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst. CO chemisorption can also estimate metal dispersion by assuming a stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1, although this is an oversimplification. H2 dissociative adsorption is another method to determine active metal sites, but caution is needed as hydrogen can desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature.

1.CO化学吸附是一种常见的方法，用于确定双金属催化剂中活性金属位点的数量。这通过使用如AMI-200ip等专用仪器测量CO的吸收量来实现。该过程包括将已煅烧的催化剂的已知量装入石英管中，用含H2的气体混合物在指定温度下还原，冷却至室温，然后向催化剂脉冲CO。使用热导检测器（TCD）测量排出的CO量。为了比较不同催化剂之间的催化活性，必须通过每个催化剂上的CO吸收值来归一化反应速率。CO化学吸附还可以通过假设M/CO = 1:1的化学计量比（M = Pt，Ni，Pd等）来估计金属分散度，尽管这是一个明显的简化。H2的解离吸附是另一种确定活性金属位点的方法，但需要注意的是，氢气在室温下可以从一些双金属表面上解吸。
