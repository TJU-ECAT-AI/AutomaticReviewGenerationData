[1] "To avoid the complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption (i.e. spillover) we have employed CO chemisorption to estimate exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts."

[2] "Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd. And, as it has been long recognized, the stoichiometry may vary, even for the same metal, with varying particle size."

[3] "For instance, on palladium catalysts, the CO/Pd(surf) ratio has been found to vary from 0.5 to 0.8 depending on particle size [39] . However, on platinum catalysts, the CO/Pt(surf) has been found to be unity for a wide range of dispersions [40] ."

[4] "These losses in metal dispersion can be related to the increased color inhomogeneities observed after calcinations of the fluorinated catalysts."

[5] "The observed trend is perfectly consistent with the EXAFS data shown below and with the cluster sizes observed by TEM (not shown)."

[6] "The CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system."

[7] "The impregnation method has also an effect on metal dispersion."

[8] "The F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 sample prepared by aqueous solution resulted in higher exposed metal fraction than that of F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3(E), prepared using ethylene glycol."

1.CO chemisorption is used to estimate the exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of different catalysts to avoid complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption, such as spillover. CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, but direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone due to varying CO/metal stoichiometry. The stoichiometry may vary even for the same metal with varying particle size. On palladium catalysts, the CO/Pd(surf) ratio varies from 0.5 to 0.8 depending on particle size, while on platinum catalysts, the CO/Pt(surf) ratio is unity for a wide range of dispersions. Losses in metal dispersion can be related to increased color inhomogeneities observed after calcinations of the fluorinated catalysts. The observed trend is consistent with EXAFS data and cluster sizes observed by TEM. The CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system. The impregnation method also affects metal dispersion, with the F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 sample prepared by aqueous solution resulting in higher exposed metal fraction than that prepared using ethylene glycol.

1.为了避免氢化学吸附可能带来的并发症（例如溢流），我们使用CO化学吸附来估计不同催化剂的暴露金属分数（分散度）。CO吸附量随暴露金属分数的增加而增加，但由于CO/金属的化学计量比从Pt到Pd变化，因此仅从这些值本身无法直接量化分散度。众所周知，即使对于同一种金属，化学计量比也可能随着颗粒尺寸的变化而变化。例如，在钯催化剂上，CO/Pd(surf)的比率根据颗粒尺寸的不同从0.5到0.8不等，然而，在铂催化剂上，CO/Pt(surf)的比率在广泛的分散度范围内为1。金属分散度的损失可能与氟化催化剂烧结后观察到的颜色不均匀性有关。观察到的趋势与下面显示的EXAFS数据和TEM观察到的聚集体尺寸完全一致。CO吸附量值只能作为同一金属系统内差异的半定量度量。浸渍方法也影响金属分散度。使用水溶液制备的F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3样品的暴露金属分数高于使用乙二醇制备的F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3(E)。
