[1] "For the impregnation procedure, a Pt and Pd stock solutions were prepared. For the catalyst containing Pd, the appropriate amount of palladium chloride was first dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric acid while heating and stirring on a magnetic plate. Weighted Pt and/or Pd solutions were gradually added to ethylene glycol or deionized water until it reached a total volume to support mass ratio of 1.3 ml/g. After impregnation and thorough mixing, the sample that had ethylene glycol as a solvent was directly calcined at 300 C for 2 h while the catalysts prepared by aqueous solution were dried at room temperature for 4 h before drying in an oven at 110 C overnight and calcination at 300 C for 2 h."
[2] "The CO uptake measurements were performed in a 1/4 in. quartz reactor containing 0.100 g catalyst after reduction in a 50 ml/min flow of H2 at 300 C for 1 h. Before adding CO, the samples were purged in He at 300 C for 30 min and then cooled down in He to room temperature. The effluent stream was monitored online by a mass spectrometer. Injections of 250 μl of 4.1% CO in He were pulsed continuously to the catalyst bed every 5 min until identical m/e=28 peaks were observed. The exact amount of adsorbed CO was calculated by calibration with 250 μl of 4.1% CO in He."
[3] "The hydrogenation of tetralin, naphthalene, and phenanthrene as individual feed components and in diesel model feeds has been studied over a series of mono- and bimetallic Pt and Pd supported on γ-alumina at 300 C and 500 psig in excess of H2."
[4] "The addition of F has a positive impact on the activity under sulfur. Significantly higher activity was observed on the F-promoted catalyst than on the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contained 1000 ppm S."
[5] "The drawback of noble metal catalysts is their extremely low tolerance to sulfur. Some companies are contemplating a two-stage processing strategy in which the first stage employs a base-metal catalyst for hydrodesulfurization, while the second stage uses a high-activity noble metal catalyst."
[6] "The CO uptakes of all the catalysts investigated are shown in Table 1 . Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd."
[7] "The impregnation method has also an effect on metal dispersion. The F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 sample prepared by aqueous solution resulted in higher exposed metal fraction than that of F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3(E), prepared using ethylene glycol."
[8] "The CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system. For example, it is clear that the addition of F causes a decrease in exposed metal fraction for all the catalysts (Pt, Pd, and Pt-Pd)."
[9] "The observed trend is perfectly consistent with the EXAFS data shown below and with the cluster sizes observed by TEM (not shown)."
[10] "The CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd."
[11] "The CO/metal stoichiometry has been found to vary, even for the same metal, with varying particle size. For instance, on palladium catalysts, the CO/Pd(surf) ratio has been found to vary from 0.5 to 0.8 depending on particle size."
[12] "The CO/Pt(surf) has been found to be unity for a wide range of dispersions."
[13] "The CO uptakes of all the catalysts investigated are shown in Table 1 . Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd."

1. The literature does not provide a direct comparison between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. However, it does describe the CO chemisorption method in detail. The CO uptake measurements were performed in a quartz reactor containing the catalyst after reduction in a flow of hydrogen at 300 C for 1 hour. Before adding CO, the samples were purged in helium at 300 C for 30 minutes and then cooled down in helium to room temperature. The effluent stream was monitored online by a mass spectrometer. Injections of CO in helium were pulsed continuously to the catalyst bed until identical peaks were observed. The exact amount of adsorbed CO was calculated by calibration with known amounts of CO in helium. The CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system, as the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd and even for the same metal with varying particle size. The impregnation method also affects metal dispersion, with the F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 sample prepared by aqueous solution resulting in higher exposed metal fraction than that prepared using ethylene glycol. The observed trend is consistent with the EXAFS data and cluster sizes observed by TEM.

1. 文献没有直接比较CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂方面的效果。但是，它详细描述了CO化学吸附方法。CO吸收测量在含有催化剂的石英反应器中进行，催化剂在300 C下在氢气流中还原1小时。在添加CO之前，样品在300 C下用氦气冲洗30分钟，然后在氦气中冷却至室温。通过在线质量光谱仪监测流出物流。连续向催化剂床注入CO在氦气中的混合物，直到观察到相同的峰。通过与已知量的CO在氦气中的混合物进行校准，计算出吸附的CO的确切量。CO吸收值只能作为同一金属系统内差异的半定量度量，因为CO/metal的化学计量比从Pt到Pd变化，甚至对于同一金属，随着粒子大小的变化而变化。浸渍方法也影响金属分散度，F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3样品通过水溶液制备的暴露金属分数高于通过乙二醇制备的样品。观察到的趋势与EXAFS数据和通过TEM观察到的聚集体大小一致。
