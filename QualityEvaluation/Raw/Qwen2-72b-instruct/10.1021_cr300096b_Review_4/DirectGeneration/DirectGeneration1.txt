In the realm of catalysis, understanding the nature of active metal sites and metal dispersion in bimetallic catalysts is crucial for optimizing their performance. Two prominent techniques for this purpose are CO and H2 chemisorption. CO chemisorption is particularly adept at identifying and quantifying the number of active metal sites, especially those of transition metals, due to CO's strong binding affinity to these surfaces. This method involves the adsorption of CO onto the metal surface, followed by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) to determine the number and strength of the active sites. On the other hand, H2 chemisorption is more versatile, as it can be used to study a wider range of metals and can provide insights into the metal dispersion and the size of metal particles. This technique involves the adsorption of hydrogen, which reacts with the metal surface, followed by analysis through methods like TPD or temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). Both methods have their limitations; CO chemisorption can be affected by the presence of oxides and other surface species, while H2 chemisorption can be less precise in distinguishing between different types of active sites. Despite these challenges, these techniques remain indispensable tools in the characterization of bimetallic catalysts, offering valuable insights into their structure and reactivity.
