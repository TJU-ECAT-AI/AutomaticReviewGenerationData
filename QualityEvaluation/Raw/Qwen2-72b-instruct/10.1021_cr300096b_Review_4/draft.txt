1. Comparative analysis of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing active metal sites and metal dispersion in bimetallic catalysts: methodologies, applications, and limitations

Comparative analysis of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing active metal sites and metal dispersion in bimetallic catalysts reveals distinct methodologies and applications, each with its own advantages and limitations \[10.1021/cr300096b_4\]. CO chemisorption is a prevalent method for determining the number of active metal sites, involving the measurement of CO uptake using specialized instruments such as the AMI-200ip \[10.1021/cr300096b_4\]. The process entails loading a known quantity of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, reducing it with a hydrogen-containing gas mixture at a specific temperature, cooling it to room temperature, and then pulsing CO over the catalyst. The effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) \[10.1021/cr300096b_4\]. For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, reaction rates must be normalized by the CO uptake values \[10.1021/cr300096b_4\]. CO chemisorption can also estimate metal dispersion assuming a 1:1 M/CO stoichiometry, although this is an oversimplification \[10.1021/cr300096b_4\]. H2 chemisorption is also used to determine active metal sites, but caution is needed as hydrogen can desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature \[10.1021/cr300096b_4\]. The literature does not provide a direct comparison between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.01.019\]. However, it does mention the use of CO chemisorption to determine metal dispersion and CO uptake, which provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.01.019\]. The dispersion values might not be very meaningful due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, but they are listed to provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.01.019\]. The amount of adsorbed CO is used as a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the catalysts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.01.019\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comparative analysis of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts highlights the need for further research to directly compare the effectiveness of these methods in determining active metal sites and metal dispersion. Future studies might focus on developing more accurate stoichiometry models for CO/metal interactions across different metals and particle sizes, potentially leading to improved quantification of metal dispersion. Additionally, the exploration of alternative chemisorption techniques that can overcome the limitations of CO and H2 chemisorption, such as the use of isotopically labeled gases or in-situ spectroscopic methods, could provide deeper insights into the active sites and metal dispersion in bimetallic catalysts. The development of advanced data interpretation methods that can account for the complexities of bimetallic surfaces and the effects of impregnation methods on metal dispersion could also enhance the accuracy and reliability of chemisorption data.
