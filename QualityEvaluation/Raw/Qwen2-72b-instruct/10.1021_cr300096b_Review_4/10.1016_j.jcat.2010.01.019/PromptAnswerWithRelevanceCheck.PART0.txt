Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. However, it does mention the use of CO chemisorption to determine metal dispersion and CO uptake, which provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts. The dispersion values might not be very meaningful due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, but they are listed to provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion. The amount of adsorbed CO is used as a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts.

1.文献没有直接比较CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂方面的效果。但是，它确实提到了使用CO化学吸附来确定金属分散度和CO吸收，这提供了两个催化剂系列之间活性位点数量的定量比较。由于双金属催化剂的化学计量和表面组成的不确定性，分散值可能没有太大的意义，但它们被列出以提供金属分散度的相对排名。吸附的CO量被用作两个催化剂系列之间活性位点数量的定量比较。

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. However, it does mention the use of CO chemisorption to determine the carbon monoxide (CO) uptake and metal dispersion. The amount of adsorbed CO provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts. The dispersion values in Table 2 might not be very meaningful due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, but are listed to provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion.
