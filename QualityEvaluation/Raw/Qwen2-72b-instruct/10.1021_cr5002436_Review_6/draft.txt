1. Comprehensive methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, with a focus on propane and isobutane reactions, utilizing specific performance criteria while acknowledging limitations and excluded factors.

The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly focusing on propane and isobutane reactions, addresses the challenges of evaluating diverse catalysts by concentrating on specific performance criteria: olefin yield, stability, and space velocity \[10.1021/cr5002436_6\]. This approach is designed to reveal qualitative differences between various catalyst formulations. Factors such as pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support are not considered due to the lack of consistent information, absence of clear trends, and excessive variance within these variables \[10.1021/cr5002436_6\]. The methodology ensures comparability by including only those catalysts for which space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield can be determined from the original sources \[10.1021/cr5002436_6\].

Future research endeavors might focus on developing standardized protocols for catalyst preparation and testing conditions to mitigate the effects of excluded variables. Additionally, the integration of advanced computational models could offer insights into the role of pressure and temperature in catalyst performance, potentially leading to the design of more efficient catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
