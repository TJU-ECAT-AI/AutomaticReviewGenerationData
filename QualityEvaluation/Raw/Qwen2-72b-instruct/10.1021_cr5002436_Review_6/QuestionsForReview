How does the described methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly propane and isobutane reactions, address the challenges of evaluating diverse catalysts, and what are the implications of focusing on specific performance criteria (olefin yield, stability, and space velocity) while excluding other factors for understanding catalyst behavior and the overall comparative analysis?
