                The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly focusing on propane and isobutane reactions, addresses the challenges of evaluating diverse catalysts by concentrating on specific performance criteria: olefin yield, stability, and space velocity \[10.1021/cr5002436_6\]. This approach is designed to reveal qualitative differences between various catalyst formulations. Factors such as pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support are not considered due to the lack of consistent information, absence of clear trends, and excessive variance within these variables \[10.1021/cr5002436_6\]. The methodology ensures comparability by including only those catalysts for which space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield can be determined from the original sources \[10.1021/cr5002436_6\].
