                The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly focusing on propane and isobutane reactions, addresses the challenges of evaluating diverse catalysts by concentrating on specific performance criteria: olefin yield, stability, and space velocity \[10.1021/cr5002436_6\]. This approach is designed to reveal qualitative differences between various catalyst formulations. Factors such as pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support are not considered due to the lack of consistent information, absence of clear trends, and excessive variance within these variables. The methodology ensures comparability by including only those catalysts for which space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield can be determined from the original sources.

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the reference \[10.1021/cr5002436_6\], there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies in catalyst performance evaluation. Future research endeavors might focus on developing standardized protocols for data reporting to address the current lack of consistent information. Additionally, the integration of machine learning algorithms could potentially predict catalyst behavior under various conditions, thereby complementing the current methodology. This could lead to a more holistic understanding of catalyst performance, encompassing a broader range of factors while maintaining the rigor of comparative analysis.

                非氧化脱氢C2-C4石蜡中催化剂性能比较的方法，特别是关注丙烷和异丁烷反应，通过集中于特定性能标准：烯烃产率、稳定性和空间速度，来解决评估多种催化剂的挑战\[10.1021/cr5002436_6\]。这种方法旨在揭示不同催化剂配方之间的定性差异。由于缺乏一致信息、缺乏清晰趋势以及这些变量内部的过度变化，不考虑压力、温度、制备方法、促进剂和催化剂载体等因素。该方法通过仅包括那些可以从原始来源确定空间速度、失活率和初始产率的催化剂，确保了可比性。
