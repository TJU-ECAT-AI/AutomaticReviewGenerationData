[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
[2] "We have attempted this comparison focusing on three performance criteria, olefin yield (obtained at the start of the experiment), stability (expressed as the deactivation rate), and the space velocity at which the first two criteria were measured (expressed as WHSV)."
[3] "In this approach, the effects of various factors, such as pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support, are not considered."
[4] "The reasons to ignore these effects include the fact that this information is missing in many articles (pressure being a notable example), the absence of a clear trend (as tends to be the case with temperature), and an excessively large variance within a single variable to allow a meaningful comparison (catalyst preparation being an instance of such a variable)."
[5] "It is important to note that catalysts were only included in this comparison if the space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield could be determined from the information provided in the original source."

1.The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly focusing on propane and isobutane reactions, addresses the challenges of evaluating diverse catalysts by concentrating on specific performance criteria: olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. This approach aims to reveal qualitative differences between various catalyst formulations. Factors such as pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support are excluded from the comparison due to the lack of consistent information, absence of clear trends, and large variance within these variables. The focus on measurable performance criteria ensures that only catalysts with determinable space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield are included in the analysis, providing a more controlled and standardized comparison.

1.在比较C2-C4烷烃非氧化脱氢反应中催化剂性能的方法中，特别是关注丙烷和异丁烷反应，通过集中于特定的性能指标：烯烃产率、稳定性和空间速度，来应对评估各种催化剂的挑战。这种方法旨在揭示不同催化剂配方之间的定性差异。由于缺乏一致的信息、缺乏明确的趋势以及这些变量内部的巨大变化，压力、温度、制备方法、促进剂和催化剂载体等因素被排除在比较之外。通过专注于可测量的性能指标，确保只有那些能够确定空间速度、失活速率和初始产率的催化剂被纳入分析中，从而提供了一个更加受控和标准化的比较。
