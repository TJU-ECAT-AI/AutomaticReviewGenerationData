How does the described methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly propane and isobutane reactions, address the challenges of evaluating diverse catalysts, and what are the implications of focusing on specific performance criteria (olefin yield, stability, and space velocity) while excluding other factors for understanding catalyst behavior and the overall comparative analysis?

[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
[2] "We have attempted this comparison focusing on three performance criteria, olefin yield (obtained at the start of the experiment), stability (expressed as the deactivation rate), and the space velocity at which the first two criteria were measured (expressed as WHSV)."
[3] "In this approach, the effects of various factors, such as pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support, are not considered."
[4] "The reasons to ignore these effects include the fact that this information is missing in many articles (pressure being a notable example), the absence of a clear trend (as tends to be the case with temperature), and an excessively large variance within a single variable to allow a meaningful comparison (catalyst preparation being an instance of such a variable)."
[5] "It is important to note that catalysts were only included in this comparison if the space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield could be determined from the information provided in the original source."

1.The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins focuses on three specific performance criteria: olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. This approach aims to reveal qualitative differences between various catalyst formulations. Factors such as pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support are not considered due to the lack of consistent data, absence of clear trends, and large variance within these variables. Catalysts are only included in the comparison if the space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield can be determined from the original source.

1.比较C2-C4烷烃非氧化脱氢反应中催化剂性能的方法侧重于三个特定的性能指标：烯烃产率、稳定性和空间速度。这种方法旨在揭示不同催化剂配方之间的定性差异。由于缺乏一致的数据、缺乏明确的趋势以及这些变量内部的巨大差异，不考虑压力、温度、制备方法、促进剂和催化剂载体等因素。只有当可以从原始来源确定空间速度、失活速率和初始产率时，催化剂才会被纳入比较。

1.The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins focuses on three key performance criteria: olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. This approach aims to reveal qualitative differences between various catalyst formulations. Factors such as pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support are not considered due to the lack of consistent data, absence of clear trends, and high variance within these variables. Catalysts are only included in the comparison if the space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield can be determined from the original source. This methodology simplifies the analysis by concentrating on measurable and comparable aspects of catalyst performance, while acknowledging the limitations of excluding other potentially influential factors.
