This reaction is an important step in the commercial production of highly pure hydrogen from natural gas or naphtha feedstocks. It was found that the preparation method affects both the textural and catalytic properties of chromium-doped magnetite. However, chromium was able to preserve the specific surface area during the WGSR and to delay the metallic iron production, independently of the preparation method. Chromium caused a decrease in activity per area, depending on the preparation method. This fact was assigned to its ability in making the production of Fe2+ species more difficult, making the catalytic sites less active, because the redox cycle of the reaction becomes more difficult. The most active catalyst was obtained by adding chromium by impregnation, which led to a large amount of total chromium in the solid and then a catalyst with high specific surface area was produced. It was showed that the catalysts can be prepared in the active phase avoiding the reduction step, before reaction. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
It is well-known [1] that the preparation method of the cata- lysts has a strong influence on their final properties. In addition,the reactivity of the solids largely depends on the nature and on the concentration of the imperfections that can be gener- ated during their preparation. Therefore, several factors such as concentration, pH, temperature, aging time and kind of anions can affect the final product [2]. Concerning iron oxides, several works have been carried out to state the effect of the prepara- tion method on the properties of these catalysts [2,3]. With this goal in mind, the precipitation and impregnation methods in the preparation of chromium-doped magnetite (Fe3O4) were com- pared in this work. The characteristics of the solids produced were related to their catalytic activity in water gas shift reaction
(WGSR).

In recent years, the WGSR has attracted increasing interest mainly because of its application in fuel cells [4]. By WGSR,the hydrogen production from steam reforming is increased and,most importantly, the hydrogen stream is purified by the removal of carbon monoxide which often poisons most of metallic cata- lysts, including the platinum electrocatalyst for fuel cells [4,5].
The water gas shift reaction: CO + H2O CO2 + H2 has been widely investigated for different purposes, for instance,for ammonia synthesis and hydrogenation reactions. Thermo- dynamically, the WGSR is favored by low temperatures and excess of steam, since it is exothermic (H = 41 kJ mol1) and reversible. However, high temperatures are required for indus- trial applications and thus the reaction is carried out in two steps in commercial processes: a high temperature shift (HTS) in the range of 643693 K and a low temperature shift (LTS) at around 503 K. The HTS step is typically performed over an iron oxide-based catalyst while the LTS stage is carried out over a copper-based one. The most used HTS catalyst is chromium- doped hematite (-Fe2O3), which is reduced in situ to produce magnetite (Fe3O4), the active phase. In this exothermic reduc- 1381-1169/$  see front matter  2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.molcata.2007.07.042

67 tion, the production of metallic iron should be avoided, since it can promote undesirable reactions such as methanation, carbon monoxide disproportionation reactions [6] and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [7,8]. In addition, hydrogen is consumed in the pro- cess and theexothermicnatureofthesereactionscanproducehot spots in the reactor and also the weakness and physical damage to catalyst pellets [9].In industrial plants, the process gas (carbon monoxide and dioxide, hydrogen, methane and argon), from the reforming con- verters, is used to perform this reduction and large amounts of steam are added to the gas feed, in order to ensure the magnetite stability. However, this procedure increases the oper- ational costs. Therefore, there is a demand for more stable catalysts that could avoid the iron reduction to metallic state and thus do not need an excess of steam [5]. It is expected that a catalyst prepared in the active phase can inhibit the reduction step and save energy in industrial processes. With this goal in mind, the precipitation and impregnation methods were com- pared, with the aim of preparing HTS catalysts in the active form.
2. Experimental
2.1. Sample preparation
In the precipitation method, an ammonium hydroxide solu- tion (25%, m/v) was slowly added by a pump, at room temperature, to an iron nitrate (1 M) and chromium nitrate (0.1 M) solutions, previously mixed, to get the MCP sample.
In the impregnation method, the ammonium hydroxide solution was added to the iron nitrate solution to produce a gel which was further impregnated with the chromium nitrate solution, for 24 h (MCI sample). The sol produced was centrifuged and the gel was washed with an ammonium acetate solution 5% (w/v) to remove the nitrate ions and to promote the sorption of acetate species,responsible for the magnetite formation [5,10]. The solid was dried at 393 K and heated under nitrogen flow (100 mL min1) at a rate of 10 K min1 up to 773 K, and kept at this temperature for 2 h, to produce the catalysts. Pure magnetite was also pre- pared by the method described, which was used as a reference (M sample).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The catalysts were characterized by chemical analy- sis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction
(XRD),
specific surface area measurements,temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and M ossbauer spectroscopy.
The iron and chromium contents were determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in a Shimadzu model EDX-700HS equipment. The presence of acetate groups in the samples was confirmed by FTIR, using a Perkin Elmer model Spectrum One equipment, in the range of 4004000 cm1. The XRD powder patterns of the solids were obtained in a Shi- madzu model XD3A equipment, using a Cu K (λ = 1.5420
A)
radiation and nickel filter, with 2θ ranging from 10to 80.
The specific surface area measurements were carried out by the BET method in a Micromeritics model TPD/TPR 2900 equipment, using a 30% N2/He mixture. The sample was pre- viously heated (10 K min1) up to 433 K, under nitrogen flow (60 mL min1) being kept at this temperature for additional 30 min. The TPR profiles were obtained using the same equip- ment. The samples (0.05 g) were reduced at a temperature rangingfrom303upto1273 K,at10 K min1,undera5%H2/N2 mixture.
The XPS spectra were obtained with a VG Scientific spec- trometer, Escalab model 220i-XL, with X-ray source, Mg K (1253 eV) anode and 400 W power, with a hemispheric electron analyzer. This reference was, in all cases, in good agreement with the BE of the C 1s peak, at 284.6 eV.
The M ossbauer spectra, at 298 K, were measured in trans- mission geometry with a 512-channel constant acceleration spectrometer. A source of 57Co in an Rh matrix of nominally 50 mCi was used. Velocity calibration was performed against a 12 m-thick -Fe foil. All isomer shifts (δ) are referred to this standard at room temperature. The spectra were folded to minimize geometric effects, being evaluated using a commercial computer fitting program named Recoil.
2.3. Catalysts evaluation
The catalysts were evaluated using 0.2 cm3 of powder 100 mesh size and a fixed bed microreactor operating at 643 K, 1 atm and WHSV = 12,000 h1, for 6 h. A gas mixture (10% CO, 10% CO2, 60% H2 and 20% N2) and a steam to gas molar ratio of 0.6 were used. These conditions were chosen to achieve a 10% conversion (far from the equilibrium value, 46%) using a commercial catalyst (chromium-doped hematite) and also to avoid any diffusion effect. After each experiment, the reactor with the catalyst was cooled under nitrogen (with traces of oxy- gen) until reaching room temperature, to avoid the pyrophoric effects [4,11]. The spent catalysts were analyzed by XRD, spe- cific surface area measurements, M ossbauer spectroscopy and
XPS.
3. Results and discussion
The FTIR spectra of the samples before heating, shown in Fig.1(a),confirmedthepresenceofacetategroupsbytheabsorp- tion bands at 1550 and 1430 cm1 [12]. The spectra also show bands at 3400 and 1380 cm1, assigned to hydroxyl and nitrate groups, respectively [13,14], besides a broad FeO absorption band below 800 cm1 [15]. After heating at 773 K under nitro- gen, for 2 h, the bands related to acetate and nitrate groups disappeared and a band at 570 cm1 assigned to magnetite [16] appeared, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The chromia characteristic bands [16] and the typical bands of chromates [17] were not detected, in agreement with previous works [10,18].
In accordance with these results, the X-ray diffractograms showed that during heating the solids produced magnetite (JCPDF 88-0315) and no other phase was found, regardless the preparation method and the presence of chromium, as shown in Fig. 2(a). After WGSR, the X-ray patterns did not change 68

(Fig. 2(b)), indicating that the catalysts were stable during reac- tion.
The TPR of pure iron oxide showed a curve with two small reduction peaks between 543 and 673 K (Fig. 3), both attributed to the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ species; they can be related to the reduction of a maghemite layer produced on the solids due to air exposition. A high temperature peak, in the range of 7231043 K, is assigned to the reduction of Fe2+ to Fe0 species [19]. The additional peak at 1138 K can be related to the reduc- tion of the residual iron oxide in the center of the particles, which was reduced at higher temperatures. It is well-known [20,21] that thereductionofironoxideproceedsthroughasurface-controlled process; once a thin layer of iron oxide with lower oxidation state (wustite, metallic) is formed on the surface, it changes to dif- fusional control. Therefore, this residual core does not easily access the reducing gas and thus is reduced at higher temper- ature where the diffusional process is faster. The addition of Fig. 2.

It means that chromium made the production of metallic iron more difficult, suggesting that it can delay this process during WGSR, in agreement with previous works [22].
The results of the specific surface area measurements of the solids are shown in Table 1. The chromium-doped samples showed specific surface areas higher than magnetite, regardless the preparation method, showing the role of chromium as tex- tural promoter, in accordance with previous works [8,11]. In addition, the impregnated sample showed higher specific sur- face area than the precipitated one. After WGSR, the solids did not show changes in the specific surface areas, indicating that the solids were stable during reaction.
A typical Fe 2p core-level spectrum of the catalysts before reaction is shown in Fig. 4(a). A similar profile was obtained with the spent catalysts. The Fe3+ and Fe2+ species can be identified by two peaks at around 710.0 and 711.0 eV and a satellite structure located at the high binding energy side [23].
Fig. 4(b) illustrates a typical Cr 2p core-level spectrum of the catalysts before WGSR, which did not change during reaction.
The Cr3+ species were identified by a peak at around 576.0 eV and a satellite structure located at the high binding energy side [23].
In all cases, the amount of chromium on the surface was higher than in the bulk, as noted by comparing the results of EDS (bulk) and XPS (surface), shown in Table 2, in accordance with previous works [8,2426]. Therefore, the role of chromium in delaying sintering can be assigned to its action as a spacer on the surface, making the particles apart, as proposed by other authors [8,24]. During the water gas shift reaction, some chromium had migratedfromthesurfacebutitdidnotcauseasignificantchange in specific surface areas. It suggests that chromium also plays a role in the bulk, as noted previously for aluminum [27,28] and chromium-doped iron oxide [29,30]. In fact, Edwards et al.
[29] showed that Cr3+ (d3) goes into the magnetite lattice and occupies the octahedral sites because of its high crystal field sta- Table 2 Catalysts composition in the bulk and on the surface Sample Bulk molar ratio Cr/Fe Surface molar ratio Cr/Fe Surface ratio Fe2+/Fe3+ Fresh Spent Fresh Spent

In this case, chromium is supposed to cause strains in the lattice, during the spinel formation, and then shifts the equilibrium particle size towards smaller particles, since it decreases the strain to the surface effects ratio.
It can also be noted that the impregnation method led to the production of solids with higher amounts of chromium on the surface, as compared to the precipitated one. This method also led to a higher total amount of chromium in the solid, a fact which can explain the higher specific surface area of the MCI sample. This can be related to the lower rates of precipitation of chromium compounds as compared to the iron ones. It is well-known [3136] that Fe3+ and Cr3+ ions undergo hydroly- sis and polymerization in aqueous medium, as the pH increases.
Both ions exist as simple aquo-ions and form octahedral com- plexes. As the Fe3+ cation (3d5) does not show any crystal field stabilization in octahedral symmetry, the rates of hydrol- ysis and of polymerization are higher than those of the Cr3+ one (3d3) which exhibits a high crystal field stabilization in the same symmetry. Therefore, chromium cation is the least 70

As the olation reaction rates slow down as the crystal field stabilization increases, a decrease of the reactivity of the chromium cation towards the ligand exchange is expected. In agreement, the rate of dimerization of the [Fe(OH)(OH2)5]2+ ion is k = 450 L mol1 (25 C) while the rate of dimerization of the [Cr(OH)(OH2)5(C2O4)2]2+ isk = 105 L2 mol2 s1 [31].Inthe present work, one can suppose therefore that in the preparation conditions the iron compounds precipitated in a larger extension than the chromium ones. On the other hand, during impregna- tion (24 h) there was enough time for most of chromium to be sorbed on the particles.
The Fe2+/Fe3+ molar ratios on the surface are also shown in Table 2. It can be seen that chromium caused an increase of these values and this effect was more pronounced for the impregnated sample. After reaction, however, the opposite was noted and the chromium-doped catalysts showed the lowest values. A large decrease of the relative amounts of these species was noted after reaction, in the case of chromium-doped catalysts.
The M ossbauer spectrum of pure magnetite (Fig. 5(a)) was fitted with two sextets whose hyperfine parameters correspond to Fe3+ in tetrahedral sites (A sites) and Fe2.5+ in octahedral sites (B sites) of Fe3O4 (Tables 4 and 5) [37]. The chromium addition to magnetite (MCP and MCI samples) produced a decrease in the hyperfine magnetic fields in both sites. This effect can be attributed to the replacement of iron ions by chromium ones.

This decrease was more pronounced in B sites, indicating that chromium ions entered preferentially into these sites. Notwith- standing, within the experimental errors, the B/A population ratio is the same for all fresh samples. Although it is well-known that to estimate unambiguously the populations of A and B sites it is necessary to do measurements at low temperatures [38], the present results are adequate for comparative purposes. It was also noted that the amount of Fe2+ and Fe3+ species depends on the preparation method. For the spent MCP and M samples (Fig. 5(b)) the B/A ratio has been increased about 20% as com- pared to the fresh solids, while for the MCI sample this relation remains constant.
It has been pointed out [39] that magnetite goes on slow oxi- dation at low temperatures producing maghemite or hematite depending on its preparation method. Therefore, the production of an oxidized iron oxide on the magnetite particles is expected.
In the present work, this layer was detected by TPR on fresh cata- lysts and probably was also present on the spent ones. Because of this, the XPS and M ossbauer experiments were used for com- parison among samples exposed to the same conditions. The Fe2+/Fe3+ surface ratio remains the same during reaction for the M sample and thus the re-oxidation due to air exposition can be considered the same for all samples; consequently, the decrease of the Fe2+/Fe3+ surface ratio for the MCP and MCI samples dur- ing reaction should not be attributed to air exposition and can be related to chromium presence. In addition, M ossbauer spec- troscopy is less sensitive to the surface characteristics (except when the crystallites are extremely small) than XPS and then the agreements between these two techniques shows that the re- oxidation of the samples due to air exposition can be considered negligible for comparative purposes.
As expected, chromium increased the activity of the catalysts as shown in Table 3. The preparation method strongly affected the activity of the chromium-doped samples, which increased in the order: MCP < MCI. In both cases, chromium caused an increase in specific surface area, but a decrease in activity per area. The decrease in the activity per area can be assigned to the chromium ability in making the production of Fe2+ species more difficult, as shown by the M ossabuer spectroscopy and XPS results. This can decrease the activity of the catalytic sites,by making the iron redox cycle more difficult during WGSR.It is largely accepted that the WGSR on iron-based catalysts occurs by the regenerative mechanism, according to which the surface undergoes successive oxidation and reduction cycles by oxygen and water and carbon monoxide [8]. For the precipitated sample, it resulted in a large decrease in the activity per area and a catalyst with the same activity as magnetite was obtained, due to the textural action of chromium. On the other hand, for the impregnated catalyst, the decrease in the activity per area was not enough to overcome the increased activity due to the higher specific surface area and a more active catalyst was produced.Fig. 6 shows the activity of the catalysts as a function of time. It 72

4. Conclusions
The use of the precipitation and impregnation methods for preparing chromium-doped magnetite leads to catalysts with different textural and catalytic properties towards the water gas shift reaction. However, chromium is able to preserve the spe- cific surface areas during WGSR and to delay the metallic iron production, regardless the preparation method.
Chromium also causes a decrease in activity per area, depend- ing on the preparation method. This fact can be assigned to its ability in making the production of Fe2+ species more difficult and then decreasing the activity of the catalytic sites, during the redox cycle of the reaction. The most active catalyst can be obtained by adding chromium by impregnation, which leads to a large amount of total chromium in the solid and then a cata- lyst with high specific surface area is produced. Chromium is believed to act both in the bulk and on the surface preventing sintering.
Moreover, it was confirmed that it is possible to prepare the catalysts in the active phase avoiding the reduction step.
