Compare and contrast the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials, discussing how key factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance. Additionally, explain how techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials, using specific examples such as Sr0.9La0.1Ti1â€“xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation.
