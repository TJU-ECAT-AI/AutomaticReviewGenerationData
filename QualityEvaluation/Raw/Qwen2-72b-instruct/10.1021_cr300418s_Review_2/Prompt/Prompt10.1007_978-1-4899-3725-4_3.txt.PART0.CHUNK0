CATALYST DEVELOPMENT
How They Evolve
3.1. CATALYST DEVELOPMENT
Catalyst development is a process of evolution. Although cases differ,successful process implementation follows a series of logical steps. Each has well-defined objectives that require talents from established branches of science and engineering. Commercialization may involve many passes through these steps, but every proven catalyst development has, in some fashion, progressed in this manner. In this chapter we examine elements of catalyst development and offer guidelines for success.
A "flow sheet" for catalyst development is shown in Fig. 3.1. Readers will recognize their own roles in this sequence. When placed in proper perspective, contributions from others are appreciated in what must be, by necessity, a fully integrated effort.
3.2. PROCESS NEED
Every new catalyst results from a process need. Only catalyst salesmen seek new applications for existing catalysts. The author was once told by a colleague that he had invented a new catalyst and "all I need is a reaction." Humerous as this sounds, it underlines a very important point. Catalyst technology responds to needs of society and the marketplace. Economic,social, and pOlitical forces have all left their marks on today's industries.Either an entirely new process or some modification of an existing process is called for. Here we classify a process as new if it involves different 41

CATALYST DEVELOPMENT
43 feedstocks, products, processing routes, or conditions from those normally used. Direct liquefaction of coal is a recent example; low-density polyethyl- ene is another.
Modification of an existing process involves a change either in conver- sion, selectivity, lifetime, or operating conditions. The need may come from changes in economics, feedstocks, products and energy supplies or from problems encountered in established units. For example, steam reforming,as practiced until the 1960s, was a fairly low-pressure process. In order to take advantage of more economical centrifugal compressors, it was desirable to raise pressure in the reformer.(l) Higher pressures required more active and robust catalysts. It is interesting that the solution to this problem was to increase silica in the support, thereby generating a new problem. At higher steam pressures, silica, which is volatile, leaves the catalyst, and deposits on lower-temperature equipment downstream. Thus a second- generation solution was needed.(49) Whether new or existing, it is desirable at this point to make a detailed analysis of similar processes. This helps to focus upon potential problems and also define the direction of the development. For example, in direct coal liquefaction, comparison with hydrotreating of heavy petroleum frac- tions was useful to establish similarities and differences.(78) Detailed comparisons are time consuming and tedious, but well worth the effort. It is wise to follow a systematic procedure such as the "check list" in Appendix 4. Only in this way is it certain that all relevant data are included and nothing overlooked. If conscientiously carried out, the exercise is not only informative but often generates creative and innovative ideas.
3.3. DEFINE PROBLEM AND OBJECTIVES
Catalyst problems vary from case to case. Increased activity or improved selectivity may be called for, or decreased deactivation. Perhaps it is a question of devising satisfactory regeneration procedures. In some cases cost and availability of catalyst components may be the factor. Analyses of similar processes are helpful in establishing reasonable levels and limits.
Just how much activity is required? What selectivity is sufficient? What is the minimum regeneration cycle?
Next, we must define the precise objectives necessary to solve these problems, and this can be very critical. For example, activity, selectivity,and deactivation problems may exist because of either chemical or diffusional factors. Which is it? The answer determines the route of future development. If chemical properties are to be adjusted, then modification of surface composition is necessary. On the other hand, correction for 44
CHAPTER 3
diffusional resistance requires changes in pore structure and particle formu- lation. The methods for diffusional diagnosis given in Chapter 1 should be used here, even if only limited data on comparable processes are available.
Equally important are problems in particle formulation. Particle shape,size, strength, and stability must be considered. Often these features coexist with chemical and diffusional difficuIties. t )4J These first two steps require the talents of process engineers. Knowledge of process design, reaction engineering, and economics is invaluable for proper diagnosis and analysis.

YST RESEARCH
In some cases, the problems and objectives are so obvious that the path leads directly to catalyst design, for example, decreasing particle size for higher conversion or modifying formulation for extra strength. However,most situations divert to some extent into an area of research.
Catalysis research is a vast arena, utilizing specialties of many disci- plines, from surface physicists and theoretical chemists on the one hand to chemical engineers on the other.
(82) Innovative and outstanding work is being done at academic and industrial laboratories all over the world.
High-technology computers and equipment enable us to calculate and observe the behavior of real molecules on well-characterized ideal sur- faces.(8)) Preparation of powders is precisely controlled, properties exactly measured, and kinetic experiments carried out with hitherto unknown confidence. Modeling of catalyst particles and beds has reached a stage where complex reaction schemes and deactivation regimes are handled with ease.(84) The catalysis literature, documented in Appendix 1, has exploded with an influx of books and articles, attesting to the high level of research in progress.
The catalyst designer, seeking solutions to his problems, should not overlook any source of information. Not only the open literature but also patents and reports of experimental programs should be searched for relevant data. This may be enough to proceed with catalyst design, in which case the effort is justified. If nothing more, gaps in the literature indicate experimental research worth doing.
For designing and developing catalysts, the focal point of aJl research,the pay-off, is correlation between catalyst properties on the one hand and mechanisms on the other. Choice of the active components, type of support and promotion, method of preparation, pretreatment, and formulation must be related to mechanism, kinetics, adsorption, or mass transfer. Often data are incomplete or speculative. Correlations may be empirical but prove

45 extremely useful. Utilization rather than analysis is often more fruitful;success its own reward. It is not surprising that commercial solutions in catalysis almost always outdistance scientific understanding. And yet it is only through the pursuit of precise and accurate models that we advance one more step and facilitate success in future endeavors. The research phase ultimately reaches a stage where expediency or financial limitations dictate that the next step be taken with the information at hand. The better prepared we are to interpret this information, the more successful will be our designs.
3.5. CATALYST DESIGN
Catalyst design involves selecting candidates for further testing and optimization. These may be very close to the final form ifbased on previously proven catalysts. For novel designs, however, considerable adjustment lies ahead.
To the uninitiated, designing a catalyst is a mysterious process.
However, familiarization with the chemistry of the process, and especially the mechanism, narrows the choice of possible materials. By comparison with similar reactions, by use of correlations and patterns of behavior, and from current research, it is possible to arrive at fairly good estimates as a starting point.
Systematic, scientific methods for catalyst design have been pursued by researchers for many years. A recent book gives many examples(85) and more details and guidance are found in Chapter 5.
Candidate catalysts from the design may be new or novel compositions,giving the designer a proprietary position. However, commercialization takes longer since there are many steps remaining before the worthiness of the invention is demonstrated. To solve an immediate process problem, the best solution is a design already proven or commercialized. Having survived manufacturing scale-up and implementation, such a catalyst is much more readily available for dependable testing.
Another possibility is a development catalyst. These are catalysts,usually under development by catalyst manufacturers, that are not fully commercialized. All manufacturers have many available. It is worthwhile to consider these sources since subsequent steps are accelerated.
After the design phase, exploratory catalysts are made for testing.
Although small-scale preparations using colloidal laboratory procedures are used, careful records should be maintained. This not only protects patent claims but aids future reproduction and scale-up by manufacturers.
An important feature at this stage is optimization of critical properties.
Design only specifies active components, supports, and promoters. It does 46
CHAPTER 3
not provide guidance on parameters such as concentration of the active component, method of preparation, and temperature of calcination. These factors, outlined in detail in Chapter 6, must be determined empirically.
Careful planning using statistical strategy is necessary, since there are many significant variables.
3.6. CATALYST TESTING
Allied with design and preparation, catalyst testing is the exploratory screening of candidate catalysts. This phase does not yield either kinetics or process variables but merely ranks performance. Bench reactors used should be as simple and rapid as possible, for many samples are usually tested.(86) For ease in operation and interpretation, model compound reac- tions are helpful. Thus, for example, cumene dealkylation is a model for catalytic cracking, and thiophene hydrogenolysis for hydrodesulfurization.
Care must be taken to ensure that the model system does indeed parallel process performance.
Design, preparation, and testing should be treated as a unit with continuous feedback, leading to optimized performance. Characterization is important since proper evaluation of catalyst parameters is necessary.
These methods and procedures are discussed in Chapter 7.
3.7. PILOT UNIT TESTING
This stage is reached when one or more successful candidates emerge from the catalyst design. It involves testing under simulated process condi- tions, using pilot or semi commercial units. The principal objectives in using pilot units are the following:
1. To test commercial-like formulations under process conditions to
ensure that design requirements are achieved. These include activity, selec- tivity, diffusional, and mechanical properties.
2. To optimize process variables, such as space velocity, temperature,
and pressure. If activation (for example, reduction or sulfiding) is required,proper procedures are developed at this time.
3. To carry out long-term lifetime tests. The catalyst encounters com-
ponents of the feed for the first time. Although the designer may have anticipated the effect of substances such as poisons, sensitivity of the catalyst formulation can only be checked with experiment. For well-behaved proces- ses, lifetime tests of several hundred hours are necessary before long-term
CATALYST DEVELOPMENT
47 trends become apparent. Longer periods are desirable but are seldom justified economically.
4. To develop scale-up data for commerical plant design. Economic
evaluations based on projected plant configurations and unit construction are speculative up to this point. Pilot units studies provide more realistic data so that refinement of earlier estimates is possible. Also, any new reactor designs or innovations can be tested.
5. To obtain product samples. Large quantities of products may be
accumulated for specification assessment. This is useful not only for testing effectiveness of the catalytic process but also in providing data for design of downstream components, safety, or market development, and so on.
6. To train personnel. Operators and engineers for the commercial
units may be trained on pilot units, where the range of "adjustable" condi- tions is much wider and the result of misjudgments less disastrous.
Pilot units are investments and commitments of time and money. They are expensive and should not be misused. As much technical information as possible should be obtained during the laboratory work and a clear realization of the objectives of the pilot program formalized.(87) The size of the pilot unit is a very important factor in construction and operating costs.
Keeping in mind that testing commerical formulations is the key task, the reactor unit must be sized so as to simulate the final design but yet be within reasonable limits. Sometimes simulating the performance of larger beds is necessary, e.g., to determine temperature profiles in adiabatic reactors.
Heat-transfer-limited processes are best tested with commercially sized tubes since heat-transfer characteristics are difficult to estimate.
Every application has a different set of constraints. The degree of uncertainty and risk factors in the final design are important in determining the size of intermediate pilot units. It is useful at this point to simulate performance with computer models that may then be "calibrated" with pilot unit data. Such models provide very effective tools for parametric studies and assessment.
(88) The catalysts used in pilot units should be manufactured with com- merical procedures. Large, consistent quantities of the catalyst are required.
If the organization conducting the pilot program does not have access to manufacturing facilities, it is wise to engage the cooperation of catalyst manufacturers at this stage.
Automation of pilot units increases construction but reduces operating costs. Turnkey units are available for almost any size and application.
However, before embarking on this route, care should be taken to ensure that the critical objectives of the program are achieved.
We hope, at this point, that pilot unit studies justify catalyst design.
Wrong decisions in defining objectives will certainly be obvious. Unexpected 48
CHAPTER 3
problems always emerge at this stage. For example, a need for increased activity or selectivity may have been successfully treated, but the exposure to real feeds or process conditions indicates serious deactivation. A new cycle of design then evolves as this new threat is considered.
3.8. PROCESS DESIGN
The catalyst development is now ready for incorporation into the overall process design, but the story seldom stops there. After a period of long-term commerical usage, the catalyst may return with a different need encountered,and a new round of research, design, testing, and piloting begins. Loss of potassium in high-pressure steam reforming is an example. It was discovered that potassium, added to decrease carbon fouling in naphtha reforming,volatilizes too readily from the catalyst.
(49) To counter this, catalyst designers incorporated an appropriate amount of an isoluble potassium silicate com- pound, which is only slowly hydrolyzed and so maintains effective levels of volatile alkali at all times. This innovative "time release capsule" was exactly the medicine required to extend catalyst life.
In the following chapters, the background to all of these steps is given in detail. The reader should at all times consider each area in perspective with the integrated development. Never forget the objective: to solve a process need with efficiency and economy in a reasonable time.
