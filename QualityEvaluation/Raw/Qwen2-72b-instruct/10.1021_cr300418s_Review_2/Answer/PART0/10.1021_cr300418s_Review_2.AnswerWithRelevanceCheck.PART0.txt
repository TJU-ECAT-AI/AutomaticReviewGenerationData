          [1] "Molecular compounds (salts, oxides, etc.) of the host oxide and of the dopant are mechanically intermixed as solid particulates and then heated to high temperature, in oxygen, to allow the dopant to diffuse in the host oxide."
          [2] "Wet impregnation exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the precursor of the dopant. The mixture is then dried and heated in air. It is hoped that heating causes surface doping rather than a separate phase of the oxide of the dopant or a submonolayer of the dopant oxide on the host oxide."
          [3] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD. Rietveld analysis determined that the material had ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, which is considered evidence that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice."
          [4] "A mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 was prepared in the desired stoichiometry, then ball-milled in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h. The wet mixture was dried and calcined in air at 1350 C for 6 h. Further ball-milling for 12 h followed by a final heating in air at 1460 C formed a solid solution of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3. XRD measurements for materials with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure, with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping."

          Solid-state synthesis involves mechanically intermixing molecular compounds of the host oxide and dopant as solid particulates, then heating to high temperatures in oxygen to allow the dopant to diffuse into the host oxide. Impregnation, on the other hand, involves exposing the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, followed by drying and heating in air, with the goal of achieving surface doping. The structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the resulting materials can be influenced by factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature. For instance, copper-doped ceria catalysts prepared by impregnation showed no crystalline copper oxide phases when the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, and Rietveld analysis indicated that Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice. In contrast, the preparation of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 via solid-state synthesis resulted in a single-phase strontium titanate structure with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping, as confirmed by XRD measurements.

          固态合成涉及将主机氧化物和掺杂剂的分子化合物作为固体颗粒机械混合，然后在氧气中加热至高温，使掺杂剂扩散到主机氧化物中。浸渍则涉及将主机氧化物暴露在含有掺杂剂前体的液体中，然后在空气中干燥和加热，目标是实现表面掺杂。所得材料的结构特性和催化性能可受掺杂剂负载和煅烧温度等因素的影响。例如，通过浸渍制备的铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂在Cu负载低于3%（重量）时，没有观察到结晶铜氧化物相，而Rietveld分析表明Cu离子替换了CeO2晶格中的Ce离子。相比之下，通过固态合成制备的Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3在XRD测量中显示出与替代掺杂一致的单相钛酸锶结构，具有晶格常数的偏移。
