          [2] "Wet impregnation exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the precursor of the dopant. The mixture is then dried and heated in air. It is hoped that heating causes surface doping rather than a separate phase of the oxide of the dopant or a submonolayer of the dopant oxide on the host oxide."
          [3] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD. Rietveld analysis determined that the material had ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, which is considered evidence that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice."
          [4] "A mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 was prepared in the desired stoichiometry, then ball-milled in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h. The wet mixture was dried and calcined in air at 1350 C for 6 h. Further ball-milling for 12 h followed by a final heating in air at 1460 C formed a solid solution of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3. XRD measurements for materials with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure, with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping."
