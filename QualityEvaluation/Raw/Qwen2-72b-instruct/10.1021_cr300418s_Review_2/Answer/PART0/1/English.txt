The literature does not provide direct comparisons between the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials. However, it can be inferred that solid-state synthesis involves starting from a homogeneous solid precursor and transforming it to the desired catalyst at low temperatures, below the Tammann or Httig temperatures, to prevent diffusion and segregation, aiming for highly dispersed solids with controlled texture. Impregnation methods, while not detailed, generally involve depositing active precursors onto a support, which can be less effective in achieving uniform dispersion and may require higher calcination temperatures. Dopant loading and calcination temperature can significantly influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance by affecting dispersion, surface area, stability, and the formation of solid solutions or separate phases. X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials by identifying the crystal structure, phase purity, lattice parameters, and shifts in peak positions or the appearance of new peaks corresponding to the dopant or doped phases. Specific examples such as Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation can be analyzed using XRD to confirm the incorporation of La or Cu into the lattice, determine if the doping has resulted in a solid solution or a separate phase, and assess their impact on the crystal structure, indicating successful doping.

Solid-state synthesis involves mechanically intermixing molecular compounds of the host oxide and dopant as solid particulates, then heating to high temperatures in oxygen to allow the dopant to diffuse into the host oxide. Impregnation, on the other hand, involves exposing the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, followed by drying and heating in air, with the goal of achieving surface doping. The structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the resulting materials can be influenced by factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature. For instance, copper-doped ceria catalysts prepared by impregnation showed no crystalline copper oxide phases when the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, and Rietveld analysis indicated that Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice. In contrast, the preparation of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 via solid-state synthesis resulted in a single-phase strontium titanate structure with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping, as confirmed by XRD measurements.
