{"Quotes": "", "English": "The literature does not provide direct comparisons between the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials. However, it can be inferred that solid-state synthesis involves starting from a homogeneous solid precursor and transforming it to the desired catalyst at low temperatures, below the Tammann or Httig temperatures, to prevent diffusion and segregation, aiming for highly dispersed solids with controlled texture. Impregnation methods, while not detailed, generally involve depositing active precursors onto a support, which can be less effective in achieving uniform dispersion and may require higher calcination temperatures. Dopant loading and calcination temperature can significantly influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance by affecting dispersion, surface area, stability, and the formation of solid solutions or separate phases. X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials by identifying the crystal structure, phase purity, lattice parameters, and shifts in peak positions or the appearance of new peaks corresponding to the dopant or doped phases. Specific examples such as Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation can be analyzed using XRD to confirm the incorporation of La or Cu into the lattice, determine if the doping has resulted in a solid solution or a separate phase, and assess their impact on the crystal structure, indicating successful doping.", "Chinese": "文献没有直接比较和对比用于制备掺杂氧化物材料的固态合成方法和浸渍方法的信息。但是，可以推断固态合成涉及从均匀的固体前驱体开始，并在低于Tammann或Httig温度的低温下将其转化为所需的催化剂，以防止扩散和分离，旨在获得高度分散的固体和控制的纹理。浸渍方法虽然没有详细说明，但通常涉及将活性前驱体沉积在载体上，这可能在实现均匀分散方面效果较差，并且可能需要更高的煅烧温度。掺杂剂负载和煅烧温度可以通过影响分散性，表面积，稳定性以及固溶体或单独相的形成来显著影响结构特性和催化性能。X射线衍射（XRD）可用于通过识别晶体结构，相纯度，晶格参数以及对应于掺杂物或掺杂相的峰位置的偏移或新峰的出现来确认成功的掺杂并表征所得材料。例如，Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3和用于CO氧化的铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂可以使用XRD分析来确认La或Cu在晶格中的掺入，确定掺杂是否导致固溶体或单独相，并评估其对晶体结构的影响，表明成功掺杂。", "Doi": "10.1007/s10973-007-8476-y"},
