However, it can be inferred that solid-state synthesis involves starting from a homogeneous solid precursor and transforming it to the desired catalyst at low temperatures, below the Tammann or Httig temperatures, to prevent diffusion and segregation, aiming for highly dispersed solids with controlled texture. Impregnation methods, while not detailed, generally involve depositing active precursors onto a support, which can be less effective in achieving uniform dispersion and may require higher calcination temperatures. Dopant loading and calcination temperature can significantly influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance by affecting dispersion, surface area, stability, and the formation of solid solutions or separate phases.
