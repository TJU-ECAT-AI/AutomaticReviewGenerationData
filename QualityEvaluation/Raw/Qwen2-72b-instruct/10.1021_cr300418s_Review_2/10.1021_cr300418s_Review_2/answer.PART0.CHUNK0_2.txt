[1] "Molecular compounds (salts, oxides, etc.) of the host oxide and of the dopant are mechanically intermixed as solid particulates and then heated to high temperature, in oxygen, to allow the dopant to diffuse in the host oxide."
[2] "Wet impregnation exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the precursor of the dopant. The mixture is then dried and heated in air. It is hoped that heating causes surface doping rather than a separate phase of the oxide of the dopant or a submonolayer of the dopant oxide on the host oxide."
[3] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD. Rietveld analysis determined that the material had ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, which is considered evidence that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice."
[4] "A mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 was prepared in the desired stoichiometry, then ball-milled in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h. The wet mixture was dried and calcined in air at 1350 C for 6 h. Further ball-milling for 12 h followed by a final heating in air at 1460 C formed a solid solution of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3. XRD measurements for materials with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure, with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping."

1.The solid-state synthesis method involves mechanically intermixing molecular compounds of the host oxide and dopant as solid particulates, followed by heating to high temperatures in oxygen to facilitate dopant diffusion into the host oxide. In contrast, the impregnation method exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, with the mixture then dried and heated in air, aiming for surface doping. The calcination temperature and dopant loading significantly influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the resulting materials. For instance, copper-doped ceria catalysts prepared by impregnation showed no crystalline copper oxide phases in XRD when the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, indicating successful doping. However, above 3% Cu loading, phase separation was observed. Similarly, the solid-state synthesis of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 involved a series of ball-milling and calcination steps at high temperatures, resulting in a single-phase strontium titanate structure with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping.

1.固态合成方法涉及将宿主氧化物和掺杂剂的分子化合物作为固体颗粒机械混合，然后在氧气中加热至高温，以促进掺杂剂在宿主氧化物中的扩散。相比之下，浸渍方法将宿主氧化物暴露在含有掺杂剂前体的液体中，然后将混合物在空气中干燥和加热，旨在进行表面掺杂。煅烧温度和掺杂剂负载量对所得材料的结构特性和催化性能有重大影响。例如，通过浸渍制备的铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂在Cu负载量低于3%（重量）时，在XRD中未观察到结晶铜氧化物相，表明成功掺杂。然而，Cu负载量超过3%时，观察到相分离。同样，Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3的固态合成涉及一系列球磨和高温煅烧步骤，结果得到单相钛酸锶结构，晶格常数的偏移与替代掺杂一致。
