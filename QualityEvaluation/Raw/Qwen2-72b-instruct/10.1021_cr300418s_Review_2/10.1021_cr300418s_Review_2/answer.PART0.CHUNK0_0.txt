[1] "Molecular compounds (salts, oxides, etc.) of the host oxide and of the dopant are mechanically intermixed as solid particulates and then heated to high temperature, in oxygen, to allow the dopant to diffuse in the host oxide."
[2] "Wet impregnation exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the precursor of the dopant. The mixture is then dried and heated in air. It is hoped that heating causes surface doping rather than a separate phase of the oxide of the dopant or a submonolayer of the dopant oxide on the host oxide."
[3] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD. Rietveld analysis determined that the material had ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, which is considered evidence that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice."
[4] "A mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 was prepared in the desired stoichiometry, then ball-milled in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h. The wet mixture was dried and calcined in air at 1350 C for 6 h. Further ball-milling for 12 h followed by a final heating in air at 1460 C formed a solid solution of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3. XRD measurements for materials with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure, with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping."

1.Solid-state synthesis involves mechanically mixing molecular compounds of the host oxide and dopant as solid particulates, then heating them to high temperatures in oxygen to allow the dopant to diffuse into the host oxide. Incipient wet impregnation, on the other hand, involves exposing the host oxide to a liquid containing the precursor of the dopant, followed by drying and heating in air, with the aim of achieving surface doping. The structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the resulting materials can be influenced by factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature. For instance, copper-doped ceria catalysts prepared by impregnation showed no crystalline copper oxide phases in XRD when the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, indicating successful doping. In contrast, the preparation of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 via solid-state synthesis resulted in a single-phase strontium titanate structure with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping, as confirmed by XRD measurements.

1.固态合成涉及将分子化合物（如盐、氧化物等）的主体氧化物和掺杂剂作为固体颗粒机械混合，然后在氧气中加热至高温，使掺杂剂扩散到主体氧化物中。而浸渍法则是将主体氧化物暴露在含有掺杂剂前体的液体中，然后干燥并在空气中加热，目的是实现表面掺杂。所得材料的结构特性和催化性能可受掺杂剂负载量和煅烧温度等因素的影响。例如，通过浸渍法制备的铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂，在Cu负载量低于3%（重量比）时，XRD未观察到结晶铜氧化物相，表明掺杂成功。相比之下，通过固态合成制备的Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3，XRD测量结果显示为单相的钛酸锶结构，晶格常数的偏移与替代掺杂一致。
