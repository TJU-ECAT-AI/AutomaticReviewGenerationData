Compare and contrast the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials, discussing how key factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance. Additionally, explain how techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials, using specific examples such as Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation.

[1] "Molecular compounds (salts, oxides, etc.) of the host oxide and of the dopant are mechanically intermixed as solid particulates and then heated to high temperature, in oxygen, to allow the dopant to diffuse in the host oxide."
[2] "Wet impregnation exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the precursor of the dopant. The mixture is then dried and heated in air. It is hoped that heating causes surface doping rather than a separate phase of the oxide of the dopant or a submonolayer of the dopant oxide on the host oxide."
[3] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD. Rietveld analysis determined that the material had ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, which is considered evidence that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice."
[4] "A mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 was prepared in the desired stoichiometry, then ball-milled in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h. The wet mixture was dried and calcined in air at 1350 C for 6 h. Further ball-milling for 12 h followed by a final heating in air at 1460 C formed a solid solution of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3. XRD measurements for materials with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure, with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping."

1.Solid-state synthesis involves mechanically mixing molecular compounds of the host oxide and dopant as solid particulates, then heating them to high temperatures in oxygen to allow the dopant to diffuse into the host oxide. Incipient wet impregnation, on the other hand, involves exposing the host oxide to a liquid containing the precursor of the dopant, followed by drying and heating in air, with the aim of achieving surface doping. The structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the resulting materials can be influenced by factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature. For instance, copper-doped ceria catalysts prepared by impregnation showed no crystalline copper oxide phases in XRD when the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, indicating successful doping. In contrast, the preparation of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 via solid-state synthesis resulted in a single-phase strontium titanate structure with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping, as confirmed by XRD measurements.

1.固态合成涉及将分子化合物（如盐、氧化物等）的主体氧化物和掺杂剂作为固体颗粒机械混合，然后在氧气中加热至高温，使掺杂剂扩散到主体氧化物中。而浸渍法则是将主体氧化物暴露在含有掺杂剂前体的液体中，然后干燥并在空气中加热，目的是实现表面掺杂。所得材料的结构特性和催化性能可受掺杂剂负载量和煅烧温度等因素的影响。例如，通过浸渍法制备的铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂，在Cu负载量低于3%（重量比）时，XRD未观察到结晶铜氧化物相，表明掺杂成功。相比之下，通过固态合成制备的Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3，XRD测量结果显示为单相的钛酸锶结构，晶格常数的偏移与替代掺杂一致。

[4] "For low nominal Ni concentration, the XRD showed only the fluoride structure on CeO2 with no shift. This was considered an indication that no Ni is present in the bulk of the particles."
[5] "The doped material was more active for CO oxidation than the undoped oxide."

The solid-state synthesis method involves mechanically intermixing molecular compounds of the host oxide and dopant as solid particulates, followed by heating to high temperatures in oxygen to facilitate dopant diffusion into the host oxide. In contrast, the impregnation method exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, with the mixture then dried and heated in air, aiming for surface doping rather than the formation of a separate dopant oxide phase. Dopant loading and calcination temperature significantly influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the materials. For instance, copper-doped ceria catalysts prepared by impregnation showed increased catalytic activity for CO oxidation when the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, with XRD and Rietveld analysis confirming the substitution of Cu ions for Ce ions in the ceria lattice. However, in the case of Ni-doped ceria, XRD indicated no Ni presence in the bulk at low nominal Ni concentrations, suggesting surface deposition rather than substitutional doping.

固态合成方法涉及将宿主氧化物和掺杂剂的分子化合物（如盐、氧化物等）作为固体颗粒机械混合，然后在氧气中加热至高温，以促进掺杂剂在宿主氧化物中的扩散。相比之下，浸渍方法将宿主氧化物暴露在含有掺杂剂前体的液体中，随后将混合物在空气中干燥和加热，目的是实现表面掺杂，而不是形成单独的掺杂剂氧化物相。掺杂剂负载量和煅烧温度对材料的结构特性和催化性能有重大影响。例如，通过浸渍制备的铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂在Cu负载量低于3%（重量）时，显示出对CO氧化的催化活性增强，XRD和Rietveld分析证实了Cu离子在氧化铈晶格中取代了Ce离子。然而，在Ni掺杂氧化铈的情况下，XRD表明在低名义Ni浓度下，Ni在颗粒体中不存在，这表明Ni可能是表面沉积，而不是替代掺杂。
