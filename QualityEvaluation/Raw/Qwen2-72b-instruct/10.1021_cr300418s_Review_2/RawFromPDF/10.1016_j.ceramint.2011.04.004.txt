Abstract
Ceramics samples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 have been synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction method. X-ray powder diffraction
characterization indicates that all samples are of single phase with cubic symmetry. The high-temperature electrical resistivity decreases with the
increasing of tantalum content except for x = 0.05 sample. Negative Seebeck coefﬁcients have been obtained for all samples, which means
conduction mechanism being n-type. The absolute Seebeck coefﬁcient decreases with the increase of tantalum concentration. The power factor
decreases with increasing of tantalum substitution. Small amount tantalum doping can reduce the thermal conductivity. The lowest thermal
conductivity obtained is 2.9 W/mK for x = 0.03 at 1074 K. The highest thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit still observes in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3, reaches 0.29
at 1046 K, which is a relatively higher value in n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

1. Introduction
Oxide thermoelectric materials have drawn much attention
in recent years because of their high thermal stability, lower
cost and no toxicity. Both high electrical power factor and low
thermal conductivity have been found in p-type oxide materials
such as NaCo2O4 and Ca3Co4O9 materials [1–5]. On the other
hand, n-type oxide thermoelectric materials are inevitably
required as a counter-partner of the p-type oxide materials for
build-up thermoelectric modules. It has been reported that n-
type lanthanum-doped SrTiO3 single crystal exhibits high
power factor, which is comparable with that of Bi–Te alloy at
room temperature [6]. Rare earth doped SrTiO3 ceramics have
been prepared and their thermoelectric properties have been
studied [7]. The most appropriate amount of lanthanum has
been 
estimated 
as 
about 
10 mol% 
by 
considering 
the
contributions of electronic thermal conductivity. The ﬁgure
of merit can be enhanced, if its thermal conductivity could be
reduced. Fortunately, a relatively low thermal conductivity
about 3W/mK at 1000 K has been achieved in niobium-doped
SrTiO3 epitaxial ﬁlm [8]. The ﬁgure of merit for SrTi0.8Nb0.2O3
has reached 0.37 at 1000 K, which was the largest value among
n-type oxide semiconductors ever reported then. Normally the
thermal conductivity is associated to the ion mass difference
between dopant and matrix [9]. In this sense, tantalum doping
may reduce the lattice thermal conductivity in comparison with
niobium doping, hence improving the ﬁgure of merit. To
conﬁrm this issue, tantalum doped Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 ceramic
samples have been prepared in this work, and their thermo-
electric properties have been investigated.
2. Experimental
Ceramic samples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 with x = 0.00,
0.01, 0.03, 0.05 have been prepared by conventional solid state
reaction technique. The starting materials are La2O3 with purity
of 99.99%, SrCO3 of 99%, TiO2 of 99.8%, and Ta2O5 of 99.5%,
respectively. The raw materials are weighted in stoichiometric

proportions, and mixed by ball-milling in ethanol with zirconia
balls for 12 h. After the wet mixtures have been dried, they are
pressed into pellets, and calcined at 1350 8C for 6 h in ambient.
The pellets are smashed and ball-milled for 12 h. Then the
powder is repressed into pellets. These pellets are sintered at
1460 8C for 4 h in the presence of argon gas with 5 mol%
hydrogen. The sintered discs are cut into rectangular columns
with geometry 20 mm  1.8 mm  1.8 mm for measurements.
Crystal structure is characterized by X-ray powder diffrac-
tion with Cu Ka radiation (l = 0.154056 nm) utilizing a Bruker
AXS D8 advance diffractometer. The surface morphology is
obtained on a S4800 scanning electronic microscope (SEM).
Electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefﬁcient are measured
simultaneously in the temperature range of 300–1100 K using a
ULVAC ZEM-3 equipment in Helium atmosphere. Thermal
diffusivity and speciﬁc capacity are measured by a laser ﬂash
apparatus (Netzsch LFA 427) and a different thermal analyzer
(Netzsch STA 449C), respectively. The thermal conductivity is
calculated from the thermal diffusivity, the speciﬁc heat
capacity, and the sample density. The ﬁgure of merit is
calculated from above measured the electrical resistivity and
the thermal conductivity.
3. Results and discussion
X-ray powder diffraction patterns are presented in Fig. 1. It
can be seen that the XRD patterns of the ceramics with x = 0.01,
0.03, 0.05 are the same as that of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample,
indicative of tantalum element being doped into the lattice of
Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 and formed a single phase compound. Referred
to the PDF card of No. 35-0734, all samples are of single phase
in cubic symmetry. The major diffraction peaks can be indexed
with the cubic perovskite structure belonging to the Pm3m
space group. All the peaks in Fig. 1 slightly shift to small angle
position with the increase of tantalum content, implies that the
lattice is expanded by the doped tantalum. The lattice constants
and lattice volumes are calculated and presented in Fig. 2. The
lattice constant of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 is 3.9067 A
˚ , which is in
agreement with that of early report [7]. With the increase of
tantalum content, the lattice constants and lattice volumes
increase. The formation of Ti3+ can be considered by Ta doping,
using 
the 
Kroger–Vink 
notation 
as 
Sr0.9La0.1(Tax

3+)O3. Although the ionic radius for Ti4+ and
Ta5+ are same of 0.68 A
˚ , the content of Ti3+ may increase with
increase of Ta5+, and the ionic radius of Ti3+ (0.76 A
˚ ) is larger.
The theoretical density of all samples is calculated from the
lattice constants. The relative density, which is the measured
density over the theoretical density, are 89.2%, 87.6%, 85.9%,
87.8% for x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, respectively. The
ﬂuctuation of density is not much large. Therefore, we may
not consider the effect of porous on the thermoelectric
properties described in the later.Fig. 3a–d is scanning electronic
microscope (SEM) images of surface microstructures for
Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 ceramics. These images exhibit the
typical morphology of sintered ceramics obtained by the solid
state reaction. We can see from these SEM images that the grain
size decreases with the increase of tantalum. The density was
measured by the Archimedes’ method, which are 4.7024 g/cm3,
4.6850 g/cm3, 4.6195 g/cm3, 4.5819 g/cm3, 4.7394 g/cm3 for
x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, respectively.Temperature depen-
dence of the electrical resistivity of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 is
shown in Fig. 4. The electrical resistivity for Sr0.9La0.1TiO3
ceramic is lower than that in an early report [7], especially in
high temperature range. The electrical resistivity decreases
with the increasing of temperature when temperature is lower
than 500 K, but increases with further increasing of the
temperature. Their semiconductivity behavior in low tempera-
ture is in accordance with the reports of polycrystalline sample
[7]. As similar behavior has not been observed in single crystal
samples [6], the semiconductivity behavior can be due to the
scattering of grain boundaries [7]. With small mount of
tantalum substitution, the electrical resistivity is not effectively
changed, see curves for x = 0.01 and 0.03 in Fig. 4, though there
is a small reduction of the electrical resistivity in high
temperature end. The decrease of resistivity can be explained
by the Kroger–Vink equation. The Kroger–Vink reaction is
2Ta2O5 ! 4Taþ

doping 
center. 
Therefore, 
Ta 
doping 
can 
increase 
the
concentration of carriers, and decrease the electrical resistivity.

x = 0.05, the electrical resistivity is much increased. This
behavior is similar with that of the niobium and tantalum doped
CaMnO3 system [10]. Though tantalum doping can introduce
more carriers, it also introduces scattering centers, especially at
high doping level. With the increase of tantalum content, this
strong scattering may become dominating factor for electron
conduction, resulting in increase of electrical resistivity. By
ﬁtting the resistivity to a power law relationship (r(T)  r0) / Tg
[11] in high temperatures range, we obtained that g = 2.5, 2.6,
2.8, 2.9 for x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, respectively. The electrical
resistivity increases with temperature in a much quicker manner
in high temperature range. The minimum value of electrical
resistivity shifts to higher temperature as more tantalum is doped,
and the lowest value of electrical resistivity is 1.4 mV cm for
x = 0.01 of tantalum contents.
The temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefﬁcient is
shown in Fig. 5. The values of Seebeck coefﬁcient are all
negative, indicating of n-type electrical conduction. With the
increasing of tantalum content, the absolute value of Seebeck
coefﬁcient decreases. This could be attributed to the increase of
carrier concentration as more tantalum doped. In addition, we
notice that the absolute Seebeck coefﬁcient decreases with
increasing of the lattice constants as shown in Fig. 2. This
behavior is similar to what is observed in samples of
Lanthanum doped SrTiO3 single crystalline [12]. The Seebeck
coefﬁcient is nearly a linear function of temperature from
300 K 
to 
1100 K. 
The 
linear 
relationship 
of 
Seebeck
coefﬁcients with temperature implies a metallic behavior of
the electron conduction, and can be expressed as [11,13,14].

where EF is the Fermi level, and kB and e are Boltzmann
constant and electron charge, respectively. This formula indi-
cates that the Seebeck coefﬁcient is inversely proportional to
Fermi level EF. By ﬁtting the experimental data in Fig. 5 with
Eq. (1) using the least square method, we obtain the values of
the Fermi level. They are 0.348 eV, 0.367 eV, 0.372 eV,
0.378 eV for x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, respectively. This
means that the tantalum doping increases the Fermi level in
Sr0.9La0.1TiO3. When Ta5+ substitutes Ti4+ in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3,
the Ta5+ is expected to behave as donor ion. This leads to the
increase of carrier concentration, and shift of the occupied
energy level structure to higher binding energy. Therefore, the
Fermi level will increase with the increasing of tantalum
content.
The temperature dependence of the power factors are
presented in Fig. 6. The power factors for x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03
increase with the increasing temperature, reach a maximum,
and then slightly decrease with further increase of temperature.
The power factor of x = 0.05 still increases with increasing
temperature. The un-doped sample still maintains the highest
values of power factor. The power factor decreases with
increasing of tantalum content. The maximum of power factor
for ceramic samples decreases from 1247 mW/K2m for x = 0.00
to 509 mW/K2m for x = 0.05. The reduction of the power factor
with tantalum substitution is the result of the reduction of
absolute value of the Seebeck coefﬁcient.
Temperature dependence of total thermal conductivity is
shown in Fig. 7a. The electronic thermal conductivity is shown
in Fig. 7b, which is calculated from Wiedemann–Franz law
ke = LT/r, with Lorentz number L = 2.44  108 V2 K2 for
free electrons. The thermal conductivity at room-temperature is
about 6.1 W/mK for un-doped sample. This value is more or
lees the same as that from Muta et al. [15]. The thermal
conductivity decreases monotonically with increasing of
temperature. The tantalum substitution does reduce the thermal
conductivity. Doping contents of x = 0.03 has the optimized
effect for reducing the thermal conductivity. The value of the
thermal conductivity for x = 0.03 decreases from 5.5 W/mK at
328 K to 2.9 W/mK at 1074 K, which is the lowest thermal
conductivity in our samples. The lowest value of the thermal
conductivity in sample of x = 0.03 is resulted from the
reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity. Since the thermal
conductivity can be expressed by the sum of lattice contribution
(kL) and electronic contribution (ke) as k = kL + ke. As can be
seen in Fig. 6b, the electronic thermal conductivity makes a
small contribution to the total thermal conductivity, In room
temperature, we estimate the electronic contribution to the total
thermal conductivity in Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 ceramics is about
3.8%, 4.8%, 4.7%, 1.8%, for x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05,
respectively. This means that the total thermal conductivity
comes mainly from the lattice vibrations. Therefore, the
decrease of thermal conductivity mainly comes from the
decrease of lattice thermal conductivity by doping tantalum.
Temperature dependence of dimensionless ﬁgure of merit
ZT is shown in Fig. 8 for different tantalum substitutions. We
can see that ZT value for all samples increases with increasing
temperature monotonically. The ZT value for x = 0.01 sample
nearly same with that for x = 0.00, except for a slightly
reduction at the high temperatures. For x = 0.03 and 0.05
samples, the reduction of ZT values with tantalum doping is
quite obviously. That means tantalum doping in Sr0.9La0.1Ti1O3
contents do not have positive effect from point view of ZT
values. Although the thermal conductivity is reduced by
introducing of tantalum, the much more reduction of the power
factor ﬁnally reduces the ZT values. Therefore, Sr0.9La0.1TiO3

4. Summary
We prepared the Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 with x = 0.00, 0.01,
0.03, 0.05 ceramics. All the samples are of cubic perovskite
symmetry with the lattice parameter increases with increasing
tantalum content. The effects of tantalum substitution for
titanium on the thermoelectric properties are investigated at
temperatures from 300 K to 1100 K. We ﬁnd that the absolute
Seebeck coefﬁcient obviously decreases gradually with the
tantalum substitution. Therefore, the power factor is lower than
that of un-doped sample. The thermal conductivity is decreased
by tantalum substitution, and this behavior conﬁrms our
previous idea. However, the thermoelectric performance has
not been improved by the tantalum doping in our work.
