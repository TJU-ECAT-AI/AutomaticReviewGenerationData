1.The literature does not provide recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, nor does it compare the performance of various catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion. The document focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane by SO2 on carbon, obtained by ash granulation. The specific activity of this catalyst increases, which is attributed to the greater ability of oxidative condensation products (OCP) to enhance the reaction compared to that of the initial catalyst. The sulfur concentration affects significantly the catalytic properties of OCP. The persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, are not discussed in the literature. The key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes, are not elaborated on in the document.

1.文献没有提供使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展，也没有比较不同催化剂系统在选择性和转化率方面的性能。该文件专注于SO2在碳上的丙烷脱氢，碳是通过灰分造粒获得的。这种催化剂的特定活性增加，这归因于氧化缩合产物(OCP)增强反应的能力比初始催化剂更强。硫浓度对OCP的催化性能有显著影响。该领域持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性和固有反应特性，在文献中没有讨论。未来研究和发展的关键领域，包括改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程的策略，在文件中没有详细阐述。
