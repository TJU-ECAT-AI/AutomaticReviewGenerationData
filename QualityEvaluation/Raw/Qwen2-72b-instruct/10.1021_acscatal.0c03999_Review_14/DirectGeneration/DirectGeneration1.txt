Recent advances in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have significantly pushed the boundaries of catalytic efficiency and selectivity. This process, pivotal for the production of propylene, has seen improvements through the development of novel catalysts, including metal oxides and supported metal nanoparticles, which exhibit enhanced activity and stability. Performance metrics such as conversion rates, selectivity, and yield have been optimized through meticulous control of reaction conditions and catalyst design. Despite these strides, persistent challenges remain, particularly in achieving high conversion rates without sacrificing selectivity and in managing the deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation and sintering. Future research directions are likely to focus on the synthesis of multifunctional catalysts that can simultaneously activate propane and the soft oxidant, as well as on the integration of in situ regeneration strategies to prolong catalyst lifespan. Additionally, the application of computational methods to predict catalyst performance and the exploration of non-thermal plasma as a novel activation method for soft oxidants are promising avenues that could further revolutionize the ODHP process.
