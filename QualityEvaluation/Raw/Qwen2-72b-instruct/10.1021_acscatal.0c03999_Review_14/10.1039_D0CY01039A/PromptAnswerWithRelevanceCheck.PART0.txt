Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

[1] "The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2. Gaseous disulfur (S2) represents a thermodynamically softer oxidant that has been underexplored and yet offers a potential route to more selective propylene formation."
[2] "Here we describe a system for sulfur-ODHP (SODHP). We demonstrate that various metal sulfide catalysts generate unique reaction product distributions, and that propylene selectivities as high as 86% can be achieved at 450 - 550C."
[3] "For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity."
[4] "Kinetic data over a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst indicate a rate law which is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, suggesting that SODHP may occur via a mechanism analogous to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP."
[5] "The present results should motivate further studies of SODHP as a route to the selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene."

1.使用替代氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)是一种有前景的策略，可以抑制使用O2时容易发生的过度氧化为COx。二硫化物(S2)是一种热力学上较软的氧化剂，尚未得到充分探索，但可能提供一条更选择性地形成丙烯的途径。描述了一种硫-ODHP(SODHP)系统，证明了各种金属硫化物催化剂产生独特的反应产物分布，并且在450-550C下可以达到高达86%的丙烯选择性。对于6种金属硫化物催化剂的组，丙烯形成的表观活化能范围为72-134 kJ/mol，并且与相应的催化剂XPS硫结合能平行，表明M-S键强度在SODHP活性中起关键作用。在硫化ZrO2催化剂上的动力学数据表明，反应速率定律在丙烷中为一级，在硫中为零级，表明SODHP可能通过类似于传统ODHP的Mars van Krevelen循环的机制发生。目前的结果应该会激发进一步研究SODHP作为选择性和高效氧化生产丙烯的途径。

1.Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown that gaseous disulfur (S2) can be a promising alternative to O2, as it can suppress overoxidation to COx and potentially lead to more selective propylene formation. Studies on a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts have revealed that the apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol, which correlates with the catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that the strength of the M-S bond is a critical factor in SODHP activity. Kinetic data over a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst suggest a rate law that is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, pointing to a mechanism similar to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP. These findings highlight the potential of SODHP as a viable route to selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene, motivating further research in this area.
2.The persistent challenges in the field of ODHP using soft oxidants include the corrosiveness of the reaction environment and the inherent properties of the reaction that can lead to overoxidation. Key areas for future research and development include strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to improve selectivity and conversion. The use of S2 as a soft oxidant has shown promise in addressing some of these challenges, particularly in suppressing overoxidation and improving propylene selectivity. Further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanism of SODHP and to develop more active and selective catalysts.
