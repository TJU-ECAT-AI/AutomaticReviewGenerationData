[1] "The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2. Gaseous disulfur (S2) represents a thermodynamically softer oxidant that has been underexplored and yet offers a potential route to more selective propylene formation."
[2] "For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity."
[3] "Kinetic data over a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst indicate a rate law which is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, suggesting that SODHP may occur via a mechanism analogous to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP."
[4] "The present results should motivate further studies of SODHP as a route to the selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene."

1.Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown that gaseous disulfur (S2) is a promising alternative to O2, as it can suppress overoxidation to COx and potentially lead to more selective propylene formation. Studies on six metal sulfide catalysts have revealed that the apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol, and these energies are closely related to the XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that the strength of the M-S bond is crucial for the activity of SODHP. Kinetic data over a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst suggest a rate law that is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, pointing to a mechanism similar to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP. These findings highlight the potential of SODHP as a selective and efficient route for oxidative propylene production, motivating further research in this area.
2.Persistent challenges in the field of ODHP using soft oxidants include the corrosiveness of the reaction environment and the inherent properties of the reactions that can lead to overoxidation. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems are key areas for future research and development. To improve C-H bond activation, the focus should be on developing catalysts with optimized electronic and geometric properties. Enhancing catalyst regenerability can be achieved through the design of stable and reusable catalysts that can withstand the harsh reaction conditions. Optimizing reaction systems may involve the use of alternative oxidants, such as S2, and the development of more efficient reaction engineering approaches to improve selectivity and conversion.

1.最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的进展表明，二硫化物(S2)气体是一种很有前景的O2替代品，因为它可以抑制COx的过度氧化，并可能带来更选择性的丙烯形成。对六种金属硫化物催化剂的研究发现，丙烯形成的表观活化能范围为72-134 kJ/mol，这些能量与XPS硫结合能密切相关，表明M-S键的强度是SODHP活性的关键。在硫化ZrO2催化剂上的动力学数据表明，速率定律在丙烷中为一级，在硫中为零级，这表明SODHP可能通过类似于传统ODHP的Mars van Krevelen循环的机制进行。这些发现突出了SODHP作为选择性和高效氧化丙烯生产途径的潜力，激发了该领域的进一步研究。
2.在使用软氧化剂的ODHP领域持续存在的挑战包括反应环境的腐蚀性和反应固有性质导致的过度氧化。改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统是未来研究和发展的关键领域。为了改善C-H键活化，重点应放在开发具有优化电子和几何特性的催化剂上。通过设计稳定和可重复使用的催化剂，以承受恶劣的反应条件，可以增强催化剂的再生能力。优化反应系统可能涉及使用替代氧化剂，如S2，以及开发更有效的反应工程方法，以提高选择性和转化率。
