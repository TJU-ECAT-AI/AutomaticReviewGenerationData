[1] "The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2. Gaseous disulfur (S2) represents a thermodynamically softer oxidant that has been underexplored and yet offers a potential route to more selective propylene formation."
[2] "For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity."
[3] "Kinetic data over a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst indicate a rate law which is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, suggesting that SODHP may occur via a mechanism analogous to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP."
[4] "The present results should motivate further studies of SODHP as a route to the selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene."

1.Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown that gaseous disulfur (S2) can be a promising alternative to O2, as it can suppress overoxidation to COx and potentially lead to more selective propylene formation. Studies on a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts have revealed that the apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol, which correlates with the catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that the strength of the M-S bond is a critical factor in SODHP activity. Kinetic data over a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst suggest a rate law that is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, pointing to a mechanism similar to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP. These findings highlight the potential of SODHP as a viable route to selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene, motivating further research in this area.
2.The persistent challenges in the field of ODHP using soft oxidants include the corrosiveness of the reaction environment and the inherent properties of the reaction that can lead to overoxidation. Key areas for future research and development include strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to improve selectivity and conversion. The use of S2 as a soft oxidant has shown promise in addressing some of these challenges, particularly in suppressing overoxidation and improving propylene selectivity. Further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanism of SODHP and to develop more active and selective catalysts.

1.最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)方面的进展表明，二硫化物(S2)气体可以作为O2的有前途的替代品，因为它可以抑制过度氧化为COx，并可能导致更选择性的丙烯形成。对6种金属硫化物催化剂的研究发现，丙烯形成的表观活化能范围为72-134 kJ/mol，这与催化剂XPS硫结合能平行，表明M-S键强度是SODHP活性的关键因素。在硫化ZrO2催化剂上的动力学数据表明，速率定律在丙烷中为一级，在硫中为零级，这表明SODHP可能通过类似于传统ODHP的Mars van Krevelen循环的机制发生。这些发现突出了SODHP作为选择性和有效氧化生产丙烯的可行途径的潜力，激发了对该领域的进一步研究。
2.在使用软氧化剂进行ODHP领域持续存在的挑战包括反应环境的腐蚀性和反应的固有性质，可能导致过度氧化。未来研究和发展的关键领域包括改善C-H键活化的策略，增强催化剂的再生能力，以及优化反应系统以提高选择性和转化率。S2作为软氧化剂的使用在解决一些挑战方面显示出前景，特别是在抑制过度氧化和提高丙烯选择性方面。需要进一步的研究来充分理解SODHP的机制，并开发更活跃和选择性的催化剂。
