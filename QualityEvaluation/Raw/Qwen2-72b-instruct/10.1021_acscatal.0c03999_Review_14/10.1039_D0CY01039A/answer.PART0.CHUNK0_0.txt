[1] "The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2.

[2] "Here we describe a system for sulfur-ODHP (SODHP). We demonstrate that various metal sulfide catalysts generate unique reaction product distributions, and that propylene selectivities as high as 86% can be achieved at 450 - 550C."
[3] "For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity."
[4] "Kinetic data over a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst indicate a rate law which is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, suggesting that SODHP may occur via a mechanism analogous to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP."
[5] "The present results should motivate further studies of SODHP as a route to the selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene."

1.使用替代氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)是一种有前景的策略，可以抑制使用O2时容易发生的过度氧化为COx。二硫化物(S2)是一种热力学上较软的氧化剂，尚未得到充分探索，但可能提供一条更选择性地形成丙烯的途径。描述了一种硫-ODHP(SODHP)系统，证明了各种金属硫化物催化剂产生独特的反应产物分布，并且在450-550C下可以达到高达86%的丙烯选择性。对于6种金属硫化物催化剂的组，丙烯形成的表观活化能范围为72-134 kJ/mol，并且与相应的催化剂XPS硫结合能平行，表明M-S键强度在SODHP活性中起关键作用。在硫化ZrO2催化剂上的动力学数据表明，反应速率定律在丙烷中为一级，在硫中为零级，表明SODHP可能通过类似于传统ODHP的Mars van Krevelen循环的机制发生。目前的结果应该会激发进一步研究SODHP作为选择性和高效氧化生产丙烯的途径。
