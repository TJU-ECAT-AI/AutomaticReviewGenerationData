[1] "The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2. Gaseous disulfur (S2) represents a thermodynamically softer oxidant that has been underexplored and yet offers a potential route to more selective propylene formation."
[2] "For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity."
[3] "Kinetic data over a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst indicate a rate law which is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, suggesting that SODHP may occur via a mechanism analogous to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP."
[4] "The present results should motivate further studies of SODHP as a route to the selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene."

1.使用替代氧化剂,如二硫化气体(S2),进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)是一种有前途的策略,可以抑制使用O2时容易发生的过度氧化为COx。S2是一种热力学上较软的氧化剂,提供了一条潜在的更选择性形成丙烯的途径。对于一组6种金属硫化物催化剂,丙烯形成的表观活化能范围为72-134 kJ/mol,与相应的催化剂XPS硫结合能平行,表明M-S键强度在SODHP活性中起关键作用。在硫化ZrO2催化剂上的动力学数据表明,反应速率定律在丙烷中为一级,在硫中为零级,表明SODHP可能通过类似于传统ODHP的Mars van Krevelen循环的机制发生。这些结果应该激发对SODHP作为选择性和有效氧化生产丙烯的途径的进一步研究。
