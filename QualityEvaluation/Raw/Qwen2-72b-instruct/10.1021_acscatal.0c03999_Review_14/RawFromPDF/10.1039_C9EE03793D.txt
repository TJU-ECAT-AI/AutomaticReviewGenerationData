Abstract
As a promising approach for carbon dioxide capture, chemical looping combustion has been 
extensively investigated for more than two decades. However, the chemical looping strategy can be 
and has been extended well beyond carbon capture. In fact, significant impacts on emission 
reduction, energy conservation, and value-creation can be anticipated from chemical looping 
beyond combustion (CLBC). This article aims to demonstrate the versatility and transformational 
benefits of CLBC. Specifically, we focus on the use of oxygen carriers or redox catalysts for 
chemical production – a $4 trillion industry that consumes 40.9 quadrillion BTU of energy. 
Compared to state-of-the-art chemical production technologies, we illustrate that chemical looping 
offers significant opportunities for process intensification and exergy loss minimization. In many 
cases, an order of magnitude reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emission can be realized 
without the needs for carbon dioxide capture. In addition to providing various CLBC examples, this 
article elaborates on generalized design principles for CLBC, potential benefits and pitfalls, as well 
as redox catalyst selection, design, optimization, and redox reaction mechanism.
Broader context: 
The chemical industry consumes more than 40 quadrillion BTU of energy while emitting 2.5 
Gigatons of carbon dioxide each year. Meanwhile, many established chemical processes are 
extensively optimized, providing limited space for further energy savings and emission reductions. 
Chemical looping offers exciting new opportunities to the aforementioned challenges through 
process intensification. Facilitated by a redox catalyst, a rationally designed chemical looping 
scheme can reduce the number of unit operations and significantly decrease the exergy loss for 
chemical production. In some cases, the chemical looping strategy can facilitate a chemical 
conversion that would be otherwise infeasible in a conventional reaction scheme. While a number 
of chemical looping based chemical production approaches have shown promising results, this

concept can be further expanded to a significantly wider sets of products using a variety of feedstock 
and energy sources. Given the exciting opportunities offered by chemical looping beyond 
combustion (CLBC) and the emissions and energy demand in the current chemical production 
practice, the CLBC design principles and redox catalyst selection/optimization strategies covered 
in this article can provide useful information for researchers in the general areas of chemical looping, 
catalysis, particle technology, and process intensification.

1. Introduction
Although the term “chemical looping” was first minted by Richter and Knoche in 1983 in the context 
of reducing exergy loss in fossil fuel combustion,1 the concept of chemical looping (CL), i.e. 
decomposition of a chemical reaction into multiple sub-reactions facilitated by solid reaction 
intermediates, was investigated long before that.2, 3 Owing to the pressing demand for carbon 
emissions reduction,4, 5 chemical looping combustion (CLC) has been studied extensively over the 
past three decades as a new technology for power generation with integrated CO2 capture6-22, as 
evidenced by more than 2400 peer-reviewed publications to date (based on the chemical abstracts 
service). In comparison, research related to chemical looping strategies prior to 1983 was scattered 
and often dealt with concepts other than power generation and CO2 capture.2, 23-25 A good example 
is the commercially implemented steam-iron process for hydrogen production, which was later 
replaced by methane reforming in the 1930s.23 However, besides the limitations from the lack of 
global policies on fighting global warming via carbon capture and storage (CCS)-related 
technologies, the lack of fundamental understanding and absence of effective strategies to design 
and optimize the reaction intermediates, also known as (oxygen) carriers, have largely hindered the 
research progress in the “pre-CLC” era. We note that the extensive investigation of the CLC 
technology26-37 has built up significant background knowledge and fundamental insights for 
potential breakthroughs in chemical looping applications well beyond combustion and power 
generation.24, 25, 38-51 It is, therefore, not too surprising to see that the extension of the chemical 
looping strategy has drawn significant attention over the past decade. In fact, journal articles 
covering such topics increased by nearly 10-fold over this period.
Although there have been quite a few excellent reviews and books covering the topic of chemical 
looping, they tend to focus on CLC26-35 and, in some cases, chemical looping reforming (CLR) both 
with and without being integrated with CO2 or H2O splitting.38-53 A recent review by Zeng et al.21 
provided comprehensive discussions of the various aspects of chemical looping including chemical 
looping for the production of chemicals. However, CLC and CLR related topics were still the 
primary focus, and many chemical production cases, as summarized in Table 1, have not been 
covered. Another review by Bayham et al.22 gave an overview of CLC for power production with 
CO2 capture and CLR for hydrogen or syngas production with carbon capture. It mainly focused on 
the potential process configurations (reaction systems and reactor design) and applications. As a 
highly versatile and effective process intensification strategy, the chemical looping concept can be 
applied to many applications beyond CO2 capture and reforming with significant merits in efficiency 
improvements, emission reduction, and potential cost savings. This article aims to offer a 
perspective on various potential applications of chemical looping beyond combustion (CLBC) and 
the generalized design principles for oxygen carrier or redox catalysts in chemical looping processes.

2. The case for chemical looping beyond combustion
2.1. Chemical looping – the general principle
As illustrated in Table 1, chemical looping can take various forms for numerous applications. 
Generalized schematics and representative reactions of different chemical looping processes are 
summarized in Figure 1 and Table 1, respectively. As can be seen, reactive separation facilitated by 
solid (oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen) carrier particles represents an important underlying feature 
of all chemical looping reactions and processes. In chemical looping processes, oxygen carrier, 
usually composed of metal oxides, acts as an oxygen reservoir for oxygen donation and 
regeneration.21 Nitrogen carrier composed of nitride or nitride-hydride mixed compounds enables 
the storage and release of N or/and H in the redox cycle for chemical looping ammonia synthesis.98 
In a similar manner, hydride based hydrogen carrier allows the storage and release of hydrogen to 
participate in in chemical reactions or shift the reaction equilibrium.106 Although recent research on 
nitrogen,98-105, 107, 108 and hydrogen106 carriers offer significant new opportunities, the vast majority 
of the carriers investigated to date are oxygen carrying agents. In order to maintain coherency, we 
elected to focus exclusively on chemical looping approaches for chemical production using oxygen 
carriers, also known as redox catalysts. Table 1 summarizes both the key CLBC schemes reported 
to date and promising CLBC schemes for future investigations. To further illustrate the 
thermodynamic favorability of the various potential reaction pathways, Figure 2 summarizes 
potential reaction pathways and Gibbs free energy changes AKFB among various carbon-containing 
feedstock and products. To maintain consistency, 1 bar oxygen partial pressure (PO2) was assumed 
in all cases. Figure 2 is intended to be used as a screen tool to determine the thermodynamically 
favorable reactants, products, and CLBC schemes.49 It is also important to note that while one can 
anticipate similar trends in relative ease of product formation irrespective to the oxygen carrier used 
in CLBC, the equilibrium PO2 of oxygen carriers, which is dependent upon both the 
composition/phase of the redox pair and the reaction temperature, can span more than 20 orders of 
magnitudes. This large degree of freedom in PO2 and the ability of chemical looping to decouple a 
single overall reaction into multiple redox steps, provides unique flexibility in “manipulating” the 
extent and feasibility of certain chemical reactions, as will be illustrated in Section 2.2. Besides 
redox based CLBC schemes, this article also covers the use of CO2 sorbents (i.e. calcium looping) 
to enhance the oxygen carrier-based chemical looping approaches, as will be elaborated in Section 
4.4.
A typical chemical looping process involving oxygen-carrying agents is composed of two or more 
reduction and oxidation steps that form a redox loop. In its simplest form, an oxygen carrier or redox 
catalyst first donates its lattice oxygen under a low oxygen partial pressure environment. The 
reduced oxygen carrier is subsequently exposed to an oxidant for the replenishment of its lattice 
oxygen, thereby completing a two-step redox loop. As illustrated in Table 1, the use of oxygen 
carrier offers significant flexibility and opportunity for process intensification by breaking an overall 
reaction into sub-reactions because: i. besides acting as a reactant, the oxygen carrier also acts as a 
mass separation agent since the looping reactions prevent the mixing among the products from each 
sub-step; ii. the carrier’s oxygen donation properties can be tailored for improved thermal 
management of the overall process; and iii. the reduction or oxidation steps can be further broken 
into multiple sub-steps.15, 21 When designed properly, an oxygen carrier can be compatible with 
various oxidizing and reducing agents to facilitate the generation of multiple value-added products

with minimal separation requirements.
From a thermodynamic standpoint, the oxygen donation ability of oxygen carriers/redox catalysts 
can be evaluated by the equilibrium oxygen partial pressure (PO2) of the reaction 
MeOx M MeOx-1 + 1/2O2.49 Redox pairs with high PO2s, which are suitable for chemical looping air 
separation (CLAS), chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU), or CLC, can only be 
regenerated with air. As applications summarized in Table 1, CLBC can take advantage of redox 
pairs with a significantly wider range of PO2s. As such, valuable products can be produced in both 
the oxygen carrier reduction and re-oxidation steps. In the reduction or oxygen donation step, CLBC 
can valorize light alkanes, aromatics or biomass into chemicals via chemical looping partial 
oxidation (CLPOx). Although CO2 and H2O are the most stable forms of the oxidation products 
(other than carbonates), many chemical products, including hydrogen, synthesis gas, alkene, 
aromatic, alcohol, aldehyde, epoxide, or maleic anhydride, are thermodynamically feasible as 
illustrated in Figure 2b. The key challenge for high yields towards these partial oxidation products 
resides in the design of selective redox catalysts to minimize COx and other byproduct formation, 
as will be elaborated in Section 3.2. In the regeneration step, hydrogen can be produced via water 
splitting or CO from CO2 splitting. Selective hydrogenation reactions can also be carried out during 
the re-oxidation of tailored redox catalysts. Although the chemical looping cycles can be more 
complex than conventional processes in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts, they do offer 
multiple potential advantages from both product selectivity and process efficiency viewpoints, as 
will be further illustrated in the following sections.
2.2. The Case for Chemical Looping Beyond Combustion – a Second Law Perspective
As discussed in Section 2.1, a common feature of chemical looping is the ability to facilitate 
chemical reactions with in-situ product separation. With separation being the most energy-intensive 
step in the chemical industry, reactive separation enabled by chemical looping offers excellent 
opportunities for energy savings and emission reductions. The potential benefits of chemical looping, 
however, goes well-beyond the simplification of product separations. With strategically designed 
reaction scheme and intermediates, chemical looping can be intrinsically advantageous over 
conventional approaches from a second law of thermodynamics perspective. The potential second 
law (exergy) savings via chemical looping result from the following aspects:
a.
Exergy savings via reactive separation
From a separation standpoint, the redox catalyst in chemical looping acts as a (reactive) mass 
separation agent, which facilitates feedstock and/or product separation. As such, the driving force 
AXFB for the overall chemical reaction, which is broken down into two or more sub-reactions in 
chemical looping, can be utilized for separation in an integrated manner. This represents a distinct 
advantage over conventional separation, in which chemical potential gradients among the various 
components in a mixture are created via extensive cooling or heating (e.g. distillation, cryogenic 
distillation, absorption-stripping, etc.) and/or compression (e.g. membrane, adsorption, and 
cryogenic distillation). With tunable thermodynamic properties, the driving forces for sub-reactions 
(and separation) can also be adjusted in chemical looping to optimize exergy savings. This is 
exemplified by the partial oxidation (POx) of methane: Under the conventional scheme, synthesis 
gas is produced from methane in two major steps, that is, cryogenic air separation and methane 
partial oxidation. Air separation is a thermodynamically uphill process requiring a minimum work 
input of 6.2 kJ/mol O2 for a hypothetical and fully reversible separation process. The actual energy 
consumption for commercial cryogenic air separation, which requires extensive gas compression,

liquefaction, and distillation, is approximately 25 kJ/mol O2 (at 1 bar). This corresponds to an 
exergetic efficiency of ~25%.109 Even under an idealized scenario110, conventional air separation 
would still lead to an exergy loss of 5.3 kJ/mol O2, resulting in a total energy consumption of 11.5 
kJ/mol O2. As such, conventional methane POx, which consumes gaseous O2 at a CH4:O2 
stoichiometric ratio of 2:1, would consume at least 5.8 kJ of energy in air separation alone for each 
mole of methane converted. Methane POx, on the other hand, is thermodynamically highly favored 
with XF0 of -86.7 kJ/mol of methane converted. Chemical looping POx can take advantage of the 
large thermodynamic driving force for methane POx and integrate it for air separation. Using Mn2O3 
as an example, the two chemical looping sub-reactions are each favored thermodynamically:
Sub-reaction 1: 
CH4 + 3Mn2O3 M CO + 2H2 + 2Mn3O4
XF10 = -9.8 kJ/mol
Sub-reaction 2: 
2Mn3O4 + 1/2O2 M 3Mn2O3
XF20 = -76.9 kJ/mol
Overall reaction: 
CH4 + 1/2O2 M CO + 2H2
XF0 = -86.7 kJ/mol
As can be seen, the thermodynamic driving force required for air separation is embedded in the 
chemical looping reactions, thereby eliminating the associated energy consumptions and exergy loss. 
It is further noted that, even when the chemical looping scheme is used for air separation only, it 
can be significantly less energy-intensive than cryogenic air separation.54, 55 
b.
Exergy savings via in-situ conversion of byproducts
The production of value-added chemicals can be intensified by chemical looping, via selectively 
oxidizing the reaction byproducts. As exemplified in Table 1, this principle has been applied to 
olefin production via oxidative coupling of methane, oxidative dehydrogenation, and naphtha 
oxidative cracking. From a second law standpoint, chemical looping can lead to exergy savings in 
the following two ways. On one hand, the in-situ oxidation of byproducts such as hydrogen can 
compensate for the thermal energy required by endothermic reactions, e.g. the non-oxidative 
coupling of methane or ethane cracking/dehydrogenation. Compared to conventional approaches 
where hydrocarbon fuels are combusted to neutralize the reaction endothermicity via indirect heat 
transfer through cracker furnaces, in-situ combustion of hydrogen is intrinsically advantageous due 
to its lower exergy rate, i.e. the ratio between the exergy and enthalpy of a fuel compared to that of 
hydrocarbons. Figure 3 illustrates the exergy loss for ideal steam cracking and chemical looping 
oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) steps,111 assuming no heat loss in neither case. When 
practical factors, such as the temperature difference for indirect heat transfer, are considered, a 
higher exergy loss can be anticipated for conventional cracking. 
A second aspect of exergy savings via byproduct oxidation is through enhanced product yields. For 
instance, steam cracking of both ethane and naphtha are equilibrium-limited.112 In-situ combustion 
of the hydrogen byproduct significantly increases the olefin yield from 50% to nearly 70% in a lab-
scale reactor at 850 °C while decreasing the volumetric flow rate of non-condensable product gases 
by ~40%.81 The corresponding energy savings in product compression and separation alone 
correspond to 554 kJth/mol of ethylene produced.113 Due to these reasons, process analyses indicate 
that the chemical looping approach can lead to more than 80% energy savings for ethane conversion 
and 50% energy savings for naphtha cracking.112, 113

c.
Ability to circumvent second law limitations by the redox loop
Another potential advantage of dissecting an overall reaction into sub-reactions resides in a higher 
degree of freedom in terms of thermodynamic characteristics for the individual sub-reactions. 
Moreover, the operating conditions for each sub-step, e.g. temperature and pressure, can be adjusted 
independently to maximize the product yields from an equilibrium standpoint. A good example of 
using the chemical looping strategy to circumvent second law limitations of an overall reaction is 
thermochemical water-splitting to produce hydrogen:
H2O  H2 + 1/2O2
Spontaneous decomposition of water (Equilibrium constant, K ^ 1) only occurs at ~4100 °C or 
higher, making thermochemical water-splitting far from practical. This is mainly due to the high 
reaction enthalpy AX90 = 241.5 kJ/mol) and the relatively small reaction entropy AX(0 = 43.5 J/K). 
Using the chemical looping principle, however, the overall reaction is broken down into two sub-
reactions, as shown in Figure 4. Take a ceria-based oxygen carrier as an example:
Sub-reaction 1:
H2O + Ce2O3 M H2 + 2CeO2 X910 = -126.6 kJ/mol 
X(10 = -82.3 J/K 
XF10 = -104.1 kJ/mol
Sub-reaction 2:
CeO2 M Ce2O3 + 1/2O2  
X H20 = 368.2 kJ/mol 
X(20 = 125.9 J/K 
XF20 = 333.7 kJ/mol
Overall reaction:
H2O M H2 + 1/2O2 
X H0 = 241.5 kJ/mol
X(0 = 43.5 J/K

Using ceria as the oxygen carrier, the exothermic water-splitting reaction (Sub-reaction 1) is favored 
at lower temperatures114 but remains favorable up to 1300 °C (Keq _ 1). While the endothermic CeO2 
decomposition reaction is equilibrium-limited at low temperatures, the large entropy term, which 
increases with temperature, leads to spontaneous decomposition at 2300 ºC, or 1800 °C lower than 
the direct water-splitting temperature (PO2 = 1 bar). While one can argue that 2300 ºC is still too 
high, CeO2 can be decomposed at much lower temperatures (~1200 °C) in practice by: i. creating a 
low PO2 environment through inert purge or vacuum,115 and/or ii. inducing oxygen vacancy instead 
of a phase change. In this case, the chemical looping strategy, which allows “tunable”

SoA: State-of-the-Art (SoA) approaches are typically based on thermal cracking or partial oxidation 
with oxygen co-feed. SHC refers to selective combustion of hydrogen byproduct, e.g. in CL-ODH, 
chemical looping oxidative coupling of methane (CL-OCM), and chemical looping 
dehydroaromatization (CL-DHA).
2.3 Reasons for CLBC – the practical drivers
Besides the abovementioned thermodynamic “drivers”, a strong case can be made for CLBC from 
a practical standpoint. Commercial implementation of the CLC technology needs to address both 
technical challenges, in terms of scale-up, and economic challenges, resulting from the low margin 
of the utility industry and the relatively low economic incentive of the current carbon tax structure.22, 
36 A CLC power plant will be more complex and costlier than a standard pulverized coal combustion 
plant, due to large scale circulating fluidized bed operations, high solids circulation rates, and the 
need to continuously replenish degraded oxygen carrier particles.4 Meanwhile, low-cost and long-
lifetime oxygen carrier material is required to make CLC cost effective.4 In addition, concerns over 
carbon sequestration, a critical downstream step for any carbon capture technology, also limits the 
wide spread utilization of CLC as a promising carbon capture process.123-127 CLBC, on the other 
hand, has the potential to address all the limitations identified above. In contrast to CLC whose 
economics is likely to be policy driven, CLBC for chemicals production is market driven because 
the products are of higher value than electric power. As illustrated in Figure 6, the CLBC concept 
can be applied to produce chemical products that are significantly more valuable than electricity, 
thereby increasing the profit margin. In addition, CLBC based on partial oxidation is intrinsically 
more efficient from an oxygen carrier utilization standpoint. Complete combustion of carbonaceous 
fuels such as methane consumes a significant amount of lattice oxygen for power generation (four 
[O] are required for each carbon combusted in CH4). In comparison, the same amount of lattice 
oxygen is able to transform eight carbon atoms in ethane into more valuable ethylene products under 
a CL-ODH scheme (assuming 100% ethylene selectivity whereas ~90% olefin selectivity has been 
reported experimentally).79, 81, 112, 128 If oxygen carriers/redox catalysts with identical oxygen storage 
capacities are used, the CL-ODH plant would correspond to an eight-fold decrease in solids 
circulation rate compared to a CLC plant with identical feedstock processing capacity on a weight 
basis. In addition, at least an order of magnitude increase in reaction kinetics was observed for 
ethane CL-ODH when compared to methane CLC based on the experience at North Carolina State 
University.80, 81 Considering that ethylene production could significantly increase the gross margin 
compared to power generation, the “breakeven” plant size for CL-ODH would likely to be one or 
more order of magnitude smaller than that for CLC from process economics, reaction stoichiometry, 
and kinetics standpoints. An even stronger case can be made for CLBC of heavier 
feedstock/products: applying the chemical looping strategy for butane to butadiene, if successful, 
would lead to a 16 times higher lattice oxygen utilization efficiency than for methane CLC. This 
simple case study clearly demonstrates the significant advantages of CLBC from process scale up 
and economic standpoints. Another interesting point to make is that many CLBC processes 
themselves do not offer the primary benefit of CLC, i.e. CO2 capture, since the target products are 
chemicals instead of heat (Table 1). However, the process intensification and second law advantages 
offered by CLBC can still lead to significant CO2 reductions by producing less CO2 per unit amount 
of product generated. A recent study published by Haribal et al.113 indicated that CL-ODH can 
reduce the CO2 emissions for ethylene production by 84% when compared to the commercial ethane

H2 and CO2 as separate product streams.
v.
Potentially achieving higher product selectivity by using lattice oxygen as opposed to gaseous 
oxidants.
However, one must be aware of the following limitations for chemical looping when designing 
chemical looping schemes or performing process analyses:
i.
The sum of Gibbs free energies of the products from all the chemical looping sub-steps should 
be smaller than that of the feedstock;
ii.
For a two-step CL process with a single metal/metal oxide redox pair, products from an (oxide) 
reduction reactor 1 should not be able to oxidize products from an oxidation reactor 2. This 
principle would apply for both co-currently and counter-currently operated fluidized bed, fixed 
bed, and moving bed reactors. Using WSG/RWGS reactions129 as an example, one cannot 
produce a substantially pure stream of CO2 or H2O from reactor 1 while also producing a 
substantially pure stream of H2 or CO from reactor 2 if a single redox pair is used. We have to 
make a choice between a lower CO2/H2O yield in reactor 1 and a decreased CO/H2 yield from 
reactor 2. Note that this is different from the case illustrated by Metcalfe et al., in which a non-
stoichiometric metal oxide was used as the carrier91; 
iii.
A three-step CL process can allow products from reactor 1 to oxidize products from reactor 2 
(since the two reactors and redox pairs do not form a complete loop). However, this is only 
feasible with an oxidant in step 3 that, when combined with the products from step 2, exhibits 
a higher equilibrium oxygen partial pressure (PO2) than do the products from step 1;
iv.
Kinetically, chemical looping reactions are generally much slower than conventional catalytic 
oxidation/reduction reactions. This is due to the fact that the rates of redox reactions are limited 
by the removal and replenishment of lattice oxygen from/to the bulk crystal structure of the 
redox catalyst. One exception is the CL-ODH operated at thermal cracking temperatures 
(> 700 °C). In that case, the rate of hydrogen combustion by the redox catalysts can often match 
or exceed the hydrogen generation rate from the cracking reactions.80, 81
We note that many mixed oxide-based redox catalysts, e.g. perovskites, can accommodate 
significant lattice defects prior to phase transition.129, 130 As such, the redox thermodynamics of these 
redox catalysts are unique and cannot be categorized as redox pairs. That is, the equilibrium oxygen 
partial pressure of the oxide is a continuous function of the oxide’s (oxygen) vacancy concentration 
without incurring a distinct phase change.131 The unique redox properties of these mixed oxides, 
coupled with counter-current and/or multiple step chemical looping reactor design, can lead to 
interesting process configurations that are not subjected to limitations ii. and iii. presented above. 
Figure 7 illustrates a hypothetical case where a mixed oxide redox catalyst with varying equilibrium 
PO2s as a function of oxygen storage capacity can be used to break the RWGS equilibrium in a 
counter-currently operated two-step chemical looping scheme. A comparable effect can be achieved 
by using more than one redox pairs with different equilibrium PO2s. In reality, however, one must 
consider the complex relationships between the oxygen non-stiochiometry of the mixed oxide, 
which dictates the oxygen mass balance of the redox reactions, and the equilibrium PO2, which 
determines the redox thermodynamics, in addition to kinetic and transport effects.

selectivity in CLBC, the redox catalysts need to satisfy certain thermodynamic prerequisites. In 
terms of partial oxidation reactions, the oxide-based redox catalysts need to provide adequate 
oxygen chemical potential or equilibrium PO2 to facilitate product generation. Considering the large 
material design space for redox catalysts, this thermodynamic prerequisite can be used as an 
effective tool to narrow down the candidate materials. As illustrated in the Ellingham diagram in 
Figure 8, one should consider redox pairs above the equilibrium lines of the corresponding POx 
(selective oxidation) reaction. Taking oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) as an example, it is 
apparent that redox pairs such as FeO/Fe and Fe3O4/FeO should not be considered because they 
would not be sufficiently “oxidative” to facilitate chemical looping OCM at temperatures ranging 
from 650 °C to 950 °C. On the other hand, redox catalysts composed of MnO2/Mn3O4 or 
Mn3O4/Mn2O3 redox pairs would likely need surface modifications to ensure high selectivities, since 
their PO2s are well above that required for OCM. Another thermodynamic consideration for redox 
pair selection is the upper limit for PO2. For a CLBC system operated at near atmospheric pressures, 
practical requirement of > 90% O2 conversion in the air regeneration step would impose an upper 
limit of 0.02 bar for equilibrium PO2.
The thermodynamic criteria discussed above are intended for narrowing down the design space of 
the redox catalysts. Possessing suitable thermodynamic properties alone typically would not ensure 
high product selectivity. A rare exception is synthesis gas generation. As illustrated in Figure 2b, 
synthesis gas is one of the thermodynamically favored oxidation product except for CO2 and water. 
As such, synthesis gas selectivity and yield can be optimized by tuning the PO2s of redox catalysts 
using Gibbs free energy minimization, as illustrated in a few recent publications.49, 66, 67, 132 For other 
POx products with higher Gibbs free energies, however, such a thermodynamically based strategy 
would not work since the spontaneous decomposition or oxidation of oxygenates to synthesis gas 
and/or CO2/H2O is both kinetically and thermodynamically favored at elevated temperatures.
Aside from being a redox catalyst selection tool, equilibrium PO2s illustrated in the Ellingham 
diagram can be used to manage heat distributions among the redox steps involved in CLBC. Due to 
the endothermicity in the oxygen release step of redox catalysts, a large fraction of the fuel oxidation 
reactions with redox catalysts in CLBC are endothermic, even though oxidation of a fuel with 
oxygen would be exothermic. Oxides with higher PO2s tend to decrease the endothermicity in the 
fuel oxidation step while decreasing the exothermicity of the redox catalyst re-oxidation step. As 
such, rationally selected redox pairs can facilitate optimal distribution of the reaction heat in the 
redox steps to simplify heat integrations. In CLC, a bi-metallic Fe-Cu oxygen carrier composed of 
CuO and Fe2O3 was proposed to shift the endothermic reduction to exothermic or heat neutral.133, 
134 This PO2 tuning strategy has also been applied to CLBC, e.g. in ethane CL-ODH.82, 83, 128
Redox thermodynamic data for monometallic oxides are readily available, as illustrated in Figure 8. 
However, the number of suitable redox pairs are limited when considering the aforementioned 
thermodynamic criteria. Mixed oxides such as hexaaluminates, spinels, or perovskites, offer 
significantly increased tunability in terms of redox properties. Moreover, equilibrium PO2s of many 
mixed oxides are often variable without incurring phase changes, as discussed in Section 3.1. As 
such, their multidimensional redox behavior can not be illustrated by a simple redox reaction or a 
curve in the Ellingham diagram. These unique properties make mixed oxides an intriguing option 
for CLBC, as illustrated by a number of recent publications.61, 70, 135 Among the various mixed 
oxides, perovskite-type oxides represent a large family of materials that is particularly promising 
for CLBC due to their highly tunable structural, compositional, and redox properties.136-138 A recent

perspective provided a comprehensive discussion on perovskites as redox catalysts for CLBC.49
3.2.2 Surface modifications of redox catalysts
Similar to selective oxidation reactions facilitated by heterogeneous catalysts, a key challenge to 
redox catalysts in CLBC is to avoid the over-oxidation of desirable products. Recent studies have 
indicated that surface modifications can be an effective strategy to enhance redox catalysts’ activity 
and/or selectivity.79-82, 128, 139 Generally speaking, electrophilic (surface) oxygen species such as O-, 
O22- (peroxide), and O2- (superoxide) are often attributed to non-selective oxidation reactions due to 
their high activity and electron affinity.49, 140 In comparison, lattice oxygen is often believed to be 
the “selective” oxygen species in both CLBC and catalytic oxidation reactions involving oxide 
catalysts. However, such an assignment can be a rather simplistic view since the presence and 
relative abundance of these oxygen species is not only dependent on the type of oxide but also the 
reaction conditions and the degree of reduction of the oxide. Recent experimental evidences indicate 
that lattice oxygen species can be dynamically converted to electrophilic oxygen under chemical 
looping reaction conditions.58, 139 As such, the abundance of electrophilic oxygen species during the 
partial oxidation step can be affected by a dynamic balance between: i. the flux of lattice oxygen 
from the bulk oxide lattice to the surface; and ii. the rate of oxygen removal from the surface of the 
redox catalyst. More facile lattice oxygen flux to the surface would hence allow the transition or 
relaxation of O2- to electrophilic oxygen especially when such oxygen is bonded with high valency 
transition metal cations, e.g. Fe4+ or Mn4+. Therefore, one would anticipate a low product selectivity 
resulting from the dynamic formation of the electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. 
On the other hand, decreased COx formation can be achieved by facilitating more facile surface 
oxygen removal compared to the lattice oxygen flux since the formation of electrophilic oxygen 
species can be minimized. To ensure a relatively faster surface oxygen removal rate, one can either 
decelerate the O2- flux or enhance the surface activity of the redox catalyst, as illustrated in Figure 
9. Recent studies have confirmed the effectiveness of both approaches. Gao et al.79, 128 investigated 
a LaxSr2–xFeO<ca-based redox catalyst for CL-ODH of ethane to ethylene. While LaxSr2–xFeO<ca 
promoted the complete combustion of ethane, alkali metal oxide promoters enriched on the surface 
of the mixed oxide and significantly inhibited the O2- flux from the bulk. As a result, 90% ethylene 
selectivity was achieved. Besides alkali metal oxide promoters, alkali salt modification also play a 
similar role to depress O2- flux of the redox catalyst for the selective combustion of hydrogen (SHC) 
in CL-ODH of ethane to ethylene.81-83 Enhancement of redox catalyst’s surface activity was reported 
for methane partial oxidation for synthesis gas generation. Shafiefarhood et al.139 reported that 
impregnating Rh on a CaMnO3-based redox catalyst decreased the methane activation energy on 
the oxide surface by more than 95%, leading to a decrease in methane conversion temperature by 
300 °C and a significantly increased synthesis gas selectivity. Those practices reveal that tuning of 
the oxygen transfer rate from bulk of a redox catalyst to the catalytically active species on the surface 
is of great importance for POx. In a redox-involved context, Machida at Kumamoto University 
found that surface CeO2 could act as a gateway for oxygen storage in and release from various 
oxides acting as an oxygen reservoir, such as Fe2O3 or La2O2SO4.141-143
Although the abovementioned strategy for catalyst selectivity optimization has been shown to be 
effective, we note that it still represents a rather simplified view of the redox catalyst. It would be 
desirable, from both scientific and engineering standpoints, to determine the active sites and 
elementary reaction pathways of the chemical looping reactions, but such tasks can be daunting due 
to the highly dynamic nature of chemical looping reactions. In fact, both the bulk and surface of the

redox catalysts can dynamically rearrange throughout the redox cycle.144 The utilization of modern 
catalysis and surface science techniques in a few recent studies have already started to reveal 
fundamental insights on the mechanisms of the redox reactions.78, 128, 145-151 However, significant 
progress still needs to be made to gain additional fundamental insights and this should be a topic of 
focus for redox catalyst studies within the foreseeable future.
Figure 9. Schematic illustration of surface modifications of redox catalysts to improve product 
selectivity by changing the relative rates of surface oxygen removal and bulk O2- flux. The arrows 
in the three cases (a, b and c) correspond to the O2- fluxes and the colors correspond to the relative 
intensity of the O2- fluxes.
In principle, one can also combine heterogeneous catalysts or active sites with an oxygen storage 
material to achieve combined catalytic and chemical looping functions. For instance, as will be 
discussed in Section 4.2.2, Chan et al. demonstrated the CL epoxidation of ethylene over Ag/SrFeO3 
redox catalyst where Ag acts as the epoxidation catalyst and SrFeO3 acts as the oxygen storage 
material for oxygen donation.78 Ethylene was converted to ethylene oxide (with CO2 and H2O by 
products) in the reduction step and the reduced redox catalyst was then replenished with air. Many 
other CLBC systems can potentially take advantage of such a strategy. Examples include alkane 
ODH, methane dehydroaromatization, methane oxidative coupling, among others. These topics are 
discussed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.
We note that the above discussions are intended to cover the key strategies and the underlying 
principles for the design of CLBC redox catalysts and reaction schemes. From a practical standpoint, 
the redox catalyst’s activity, available oxygen storage capacity, stability, mechanical strength,152, 153 
heat management,154 cost and environmental risk should all be taken into account to optimize the 
redox catalyst. The higher margin in the chemical industry over the utility industry can afford 
significantly higher redox catalyst cost in CLBC. While the raw material cost of some redox 
catalysts can be high (e.g. ceria-based materials), the additional value created for chemical 
production can potentially accommodate higher redox catalyst costs. Under CLBC schemes, redox 
catalysts functions similar to heterogeneous catalysts in chemical production processes.155 It is 
further noted that a number of CLBC redox catalysts have shown chemical productivities (in terms 
of weight hourly space velocity) comparable to commercial catalysts.111 The aforementioned factors 
should also be considered along with reactor design parameters, operating conditions as well as the 
reactor/process economics for CLBC process development.

4. CLPOx/CLBC Process Schemes
4.1 Chemical looping for C1 valorization
CH4 is the main constituent of natural gas and an important feedstock for the production of 
commodity chemicals and liquid fuels.156 It can be converted into methanol, NH3 and other higher 
hydrocarbons either directly via a one-step process or indirectly via a synthesis gas (a mixture of 
CO and H2) intermediate. At present, the only cost-effective route to convert CH4 into valuable 
chemicals is via synthesis gas.157 Synthesis gas can be obtained from CH4 using the following three 
reactions: steam reforming (R62), dry reforming (R63) and partial oxidation (R49).158 At the 
industrial scale, the catalytic steam methane reforming (SMR) is used predominantly to produce 
synthesis gas. Although SMR is highly optimized, it is a very energy-intensive process and releases 
large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere.131 To reduce the energy demand of SMR, a part of CH4 
is combusted internally with oxygen or air. The resulting so-called autothermal reforming process 
enhances CH4 conversion and reduces CO2 emissions, but at the expense of lowered synthesis gas 
yields.57 Recently, dry reforming of methane (DRM) has received a lot of attention due to its 
potential to convert two greenhouse gases (i.e. CH4 and CO2) into an equimolar mixture of CO and 
H2 desired for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.159, 160 Although this concept has many environmental and 
economic incentives, there is currently no commercial process for DRM. Unlike reforming reactions, 
methane POx is mildly exothermic allowing for auto-thermal operation at temperatures exceeding 
1000 °C. Methane POx can be performed either at elevated temperatures (> 1200 °C) without a 
catalyst or at lower temperatures (< 900 °C) in the presence of a platinum group metal (PGM) based 
catalyst (e.g., Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, etc.).161, 162 Commercial methane POx processes incur a significant 
efficiency loss due to high operating temperatures. The catalytic route can be costly due to the high 
cost of the PGM and safety concerns. Both approaches also are challenged by the high cost and 
energy intensity of pure O2.
In 2000, Lyon and Cole163 proposed a chemical looping approach to transfer oxygen from air to a 
fuel using solid oxygen carriers for a number of applications such as pollution control, production 
of inert gases, delivery of heat to endothermic reactions, etc. Since then various chemical looping 
cycles have been proposed to address the limitations of conventional CH4 conversion processes (see 
in Table 2). Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 provide a brief summary of the chemical looping approaches 
related to indirect and direct CH4 conversion routes, respectively.
4.1.1 CL methane conversion to synthesis gas
Compared to conventional CH4 reforming processes that utilize gaseous oxidants, the two-step 
chemical looping approach, schematized in Figure 10, relies on the lattice oxygen of a solid oxygen 
carrier to partially oxidize CH4 via R3.63, 164, 165 A subsequent re-oxidation step then replenishes the 
lattice oxygen. If air is used in the regeneration step to re-oxidize the reduced oxygen carrier, via 
R4, the overall reaction is methane POx and hence the chemical looping cycle is also referred to as 
CL-methane POx.166 Unlike the conventional methane POx reaction (R49), the chemical looping 
route does not require pure oxygen, thereby eliminating the need of an energy- and cost-intensive 
air separation unit (ASU). Further, the actual CH4 conversion step using lattice oxygen (when the 
oxygen carrier is reduced) is endothermic. Depending upon the thermodynamic characteristics of 
the oxygen carrier, it can also be re-oxidized using H2O,167, 168 see R5, resulting in the so-called CL-
SMR.64, 169 Here, two separate streams of synthesis gas (with a CO:H2 ratio of 1:2) and high-purity 
H2 are produced inherently, thus intensifying the production of high-purity H2 from CH4. It is noted 
here that CL-SMR would become the CL-WGS process if CO instead of CH4 were used to reduce

the oxygen carrier.42, 96, 170, 171 Both CL-SMR and CL-WGS are also referred to as CL-water-splitting 
processes.47, 172 Recently the CL-DRM cycle, in which CO2 is used to regenerate the oxygen carrier 
(via R6), has been proposed to maximize the conversion of CO2, captured from various emission 
sources, to CO.96, 162, 167, 173-175 The modified CL-methane POx coupled with H2O-CO2 splitting176 
for the oxygen carrier regeneration allows the production of syngas with identical compositions in 
both the reduction and regeneration steps.121, 177, 178

gas.
The oxygen carriers used in the above-mentioned chemical looping processes are often called redox 
catalysts because they simultaneously act as an oxygen donor (i.e. as a reactant) and as a catalyst. 
NiO, Fe2O3, CeO2, spinel and certain perovskite-based oxides possess suitable thermodynamic 
properties that permit their use as redox catalysts for chemical looping conversion of CH4 to 
synthesis gas.41, 179-184 Among various oxygen carriers, Ni-based oxygen carriers are particularly 
attractive for CLR owing to their high catalytic activity for CH4 reforming.56, 185-191 NiO possesses 
a low selectivity towards synthesis gas, but as NiO reduces to Ni the selectivity towards synthesis 
gas increases.56 However, Ni is highly prone to deactivation via carbon deposition under low oxygen 
partial pressures187 and the formation of sulfides in the presence of feedstock containing sulfur 
species.192 Moreover, Ni is a known carcinogenic, thus possessing significant health and safety 
risks.193 Fe-based redox catalysts are also very promising for CL-methane POx owing to their 
suitable thermodynamic properties for both CH4 reforming and H2O/CO2 splitting, low cost and 
minimal environmental impact.90, 194 However, compared to Ni-based oxygen carriers, Fe-based 
redox catalysts possess a low reactivity with CH4 and a low selectivity towards synthesis gas.195 
Because of their high activity and thermal stability, La-based perovskites with Fe, Mn, or Co as B-
site cations have been widely investigated in recent years for CL-methane POx and CL-SMR.58-60, 
64, 66, 88, 89, 139, 179, 196-198 As mentioned above, the structural and compositional tailoring of the redox 
catalysts can open up extensive possibilities for improvements of CLR processes. Since the 
objective of this part of the perspective is not to present a comprehensive review of the redox 
catalysts used for CLR, we briefly summarize some of the strategies that have been demonstrated 
to enhance the reactivity and selectivity of redox catalysts in the following sub-sections.
Stabilization by a mixed conductive support

support to stabilize the metal oxide. The appropriate combinations of oxygen carriers and supports 
can potentially increase the selectivity of synthesis gas and reduce catalyst deactivation.199 For 
example, it has been demonstrated that the use of a mixed conductive support (such as 
La0.8Sr0.2FeO8ca or Ca0.8Sr0.2Ti0.8Ni0.2O3) enables fast solid state O0c and electron/hole exchange92, 
131, 200 between the metal oxide crystallites and the surface of oxygen carrier particle, thereby 
allowing effective oxygen removal and restoration during reactions R3 and R4.201, 202 Importantly, 
supports that promote the outwards diffusion of active metal should be avoided because such 
supports can potentially deactivate the redox catalysts via surface enrichment and agglomeration of 
the active metal oxide crystallites.203
Core-shell architecture
The spatial distribution of support in an oxygen carrier particle also significantly affects its activity 
and selectivity.204 For example, Shafiefarhood et al.59 demonstrated that an Fe2O3@LaxSr1-xFeO3 
(LSF) core-shell material was 10 – 200 times more active, selective and resistant to carbon formation 
than composite iron oxide-based materials comprising inert (Al2O3 and MgAl2O4), ionic-conductive 
(YSZ), and mixed-conductive (LSF) supports. Neal et al.58, 60 and Shafiefarhood et al.205 
investigated the mechanism for CH4 partial oxidation over an Fe2O3@LSF core-shell material and 
found four distinct regimes, viz. i. full oxidation of CH4 to CO2, ii. competing full oxidation to CO2 
and partial oxidation to CO, iii. partial oxidation of CH4 to CO, and iv. CH4 decomposition. During 
deep oxidation in region i. “loose” lattice oxygen from the iron oxide core transports and evolves 
into surface oxygen species. In region ii., both selective and non-selective (i.e. loose) oxygen species 
compete for CH4 oxidation, with O0c flux and overall oxygen availability determining the product 
ratio. In region iii., dissociatively adsorbed CHx species are partially oxidized by O2- species on the 
surface, resulting in an increase in metallic iron species along with a decrease in the concentration 
of oxygen surface species. Coke formation in region iv. results from the depletion of O0c in the iron 
oxide core and CH4 decomposition over metallic iron precipitated from the LSF lattice. Transient 
pulse studies showed that oxygen anion conduction and/or its evolution to electrophilic surface 
oxygen species is the rate-limiting step in all the reduction regions of interest.205 Oxygen atoms 
maintain a modified Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism throughout the reaction, while the 
mechanism of CH4 oxidation changes from the Eley-Rideal in region i. to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-
like mechanism in region iii.. These findings indicate that redox catalyst architectures that inhibit 
the formation of non-selective surface oxygen species while maintaining a steady supply of lattice 
oxygen to the surface can potentially lead to an improved performance for CL-methane POx.
Use of promotors
Ni- and Fe-based oxygen carriers have a high catalytic activity for the decomposition of CH4, via 
R64. Promotion of redox catalysts with a transition metal that is inactive for the dissociation of CH4, 
e.g. Cu, Ag, or Au, can suppress the formation of carbon during the CH4 reforming step.206 In this 
regard, Imtiaz et al.207 demonstrated that doping of Fe2O3 with CuO significantly lowers its 
propensity for coke deposition in a CH4 atmosphere. The high resistance to carbon deposition of Cu 
modified oxygen carriers was found to be due to the (partial) coverage of surface Fe with Cu. Some 
transition metals (e.g. Ru, Rh, Ir, etc.) can expedite the dissociation of C-H bonds in CH4206 and can 
therefore enhance the reforming activity of redox catalysts. Shafiefarhood et al.139 reported a 
significant improvement in the performance of Rh-promoted CaMnO3 and La2Ce2O7 redox catalysts 
for CH4 reforming. It was found that a higher concentration of CHx species on the surface of Rh-
promoted catalysts accelerates the extraction of facile oxygen resulting in an enhanced O2-

conduction through the bulk of the redox catalyst. Therefore, a higher redox activity and synthesis 
gas selectivity was observed for Rh promoted redox catalysts at temperatures as low as 500 °C than 
for pristine catalysts. Similar findings were reported by Palchelva et al.208 for Rh promoted 
La0.8Sr0.2(Fe0.8Co0.2)1–xGaxO3, which showed a 40% enhancement in CO selectivity for methane 
conversion at 600 °C. Noble metals, modification with CeO2 nanoparticles can also improve the 
oxygen storage capacity and mobility in perovskite68 or iron oxides,63, 64, 141, 209 which in turn can 
enhance the availability of lattice oxygen for the methane POx to synthesis gas.
4.1.2 CL methane to chemicals
The selective oxidation of CH4 to value-added chemicals has been studied extensively, but no 
significant breakthroughs have been achieved that would enable commercial adoption. A key reason 
lies in the thermodynamic limitations: CH4 is more favorably converted to CO2 and H2O than to C1 
oxygenates or C2+ hydrocarbons, as evident when comparing the Gibbs free energy changes for the 
respective reactions (Figure 2b).210 In consequence, the reactions must be controlled kinetically 
through suitable catalysts.211 Even if CH4 is converted successfully to the desired products, these 
products tend to be more reactive than CH4 and can get oxidized readily to COx, thus lowering the 
overall yield.
For CL-based CH4 partial oxidation, gaseous O2 is substituted by lattice oxygen. This eliminates the 
expensive air separation, ensures safer operation and inhibits non-selective oxidation reactions in 
the gas phase when carried out at high temperatures.212, 213 In addition, the use of lattice oxygen is 
also shown to potentially benefit the product selectivity.214, 215 Challenges in the design of suitable 
redox catalysts relate to the following aspects of CL-based CH4 oxidation processes:213 i. CL would 
likely to require higher operating temperature than co-feed which may negate the selectivity benefit 
of using lattice oxygen, and ii. the surface and bulk of the CL redox catalyst tend to undergo notable 
changes during the redox reactions, which makes maintaining a high product selectivity challenging. 
Below we briefly discuss several CH4 conversion schemes that were shown to be feasible in 
chemical looping mode.
Oxidative Coupling
The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is a method proposed in the early 1980s to convert CH4 
directly into ethane and ethylene according to reactions R55 and R54 at temperatures > 600 °C.216 
The exothermic reactions can be carried out either in “normal” catalytic fashion where oxygen is 
co-fed with CH4, or in a cyclic redox (chemical looping) operation expressed by reactions R7 and 
R8.212, 217, 218 For either mode, an upper limit of 25 – 30% yield for C2+ hydrocarbon products has 
been supposed based on mechanistic considerations,215, 217, 219 which is near the yields required for 
economic competitiveness220-222. Various engineering means have been suggested to improve yields, 
but no breakthroughs have been achieved to date.213, 223, 224 It is worth noting that early studies by 
Atlantic Richfield company, which operated a 12-year program on OCM focusing on the redox 
mode, reported an approximately 10% higher C2+ selectivity under the chemical looping mode 
compared to the conventional catalytic route.215
The OCM reaction occurs via a complex mechanism including coupled heterogeneous and 
homogeneous steps (depending on the catalyst) and is initiated by breaking one of the four 
equivalently strong C-H bonds of the methane molecule to form methyl radicals.224, 225 The low 
yields for C2+ hydrocarbons obtained so far are largely due to secondary oxidation reactions of these 
reactive products with oxygen weakly bound to the surface of the catalyst and with oxygen in the 
gas phase, forming a significant amount of COx.22271, 226, 227 More recently, the upper yield limit for

C2+ products in the absence of gas phase reactions was estimated to be as high as 60% at elevated 
pressure, which could possibly be achieved via chemical looping.225, 228 Experiments with doped-
Mg6MnO8 and Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2, a catalyst previously shown to attain single pass C2+ product 
yields of ~25% in co-feed mode,229, 230 gave C2+ product yields of 23.2% and 25%, respectively 
under a chemical looping mode.231-234 In these studies, the selectivity toward the coupling reaction 
was high, but the H2 molecules formed through the dehydrogenation reaction of ethane competed 
with CH4 molecules for reacting with activated oxygen on the surface of the catalyst, resulting in a 
decreasing rate of CH4 activation and consequently lower C2+ yields than expected.222 Hence, 
improving the activity of the redox catalysts without negatively affecting their selectivity is one 
important task. In addition, the reaction conditions (e.g. temperature and pressure) probably need to 
be revised to surpass C2+ product yields of 30%.235 The importance of dopants in Mg6MnO8 was 
highlighted recently,234 and it was found that Li-doping-induced oxygen vacancies reduce the 
adsorption energy of methyl radicals and increase the c9 activation barrier, resulting in an 
increased selectivity towards C2+. For doped Na2WO4 on SiO2-supported MOx catalysts (where M 
= V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co or Zn) it was found previously that their performance is correlated with their 
electrical conductivity.236
Non-oxidative Dehydroaromatization
Non-oxidative dehydroaromatization (DHA) is a promising route to produce C6H6 directly from 
CH4. Conversion of CH4 to C6H6 via reaction R65 was first reported in 1993 using a ZSM-5 zeolite 
modified with Mo or Zn.237 Since then, a wide range of metals and zeolites have been investigated 
for DHA of CH4, but Mo-modified ZSM-5-based catalysts still remain the most effective.238, 239
Figure 11. (a) Equilibrium composition of CH4 DHA as a function of temperature. (b) A potential 
configuration of methane CL-DHA process (the air regeneration step is not shown).240
Despite being a potentially attractive pathway to selectively produce high-value aromatics, CH4 
DHA has not yet been commercialized due to the following reasons: Firstly, CH4 DHA (R65) is 
endothermic and limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium. From Figure 11, it can be seen that the 
amount of C6H6 produced is only significant at high temperatures (i.e. > 600 °C). Secondly, the 
inevitable decomposition of CH4 (R64) under reaction conditions not only lowers the equilibrium 
yield of C6H6 substantially but also causes coking and catalyst deactivation.241 Consequently, C6H6 
selectivity is typically between 60 – 80% at CH4 conversions of ~10%, corresponding to net C6H6 
yields of < 10% under conditions of practical interest.239 Several strategies have been proposed to 
overcome these barriers, e.g. the use of membrane reactors to remove H2 produced during reaction242

or the periodic regeneration of the coked catalyst73. Recently, a CL approach was suggested to 
potentially address all three limitations of conventional CH4 DHA process as following (Figure 
11):145 i. the reactive separation of H2 from the products of DHA reaction to enhance the equilibrium 
CH4 conversion and C6H6 yield, ii. heat generation by selective H2 combustion to decrease the 
overall heat demand, and iii. in-situ steam generation to reduce coking. However, care must be taken 
because excessive presence of steam can negatively affect catalyst selectivity. Moreover, re-
oxidation requirements for CL may affect the active MoCx species on Mo/ZSM-5. Using 
Mo/HZSM-5 (as the DHA catalyst) and Ce0.9Gd0.1Oy (as the SHC redox catalyst) in a composite 
bed, an approximately three times higher aromatics yield was demonstrated compared to the 
conventional process employing only Mo/HZSM-5 without periodic regeneration with oxygen145. 
Besides the two-step approach, Brady et al.240 proposed a four-step approach for CL-DHA. In the 
first step, DHA reaction is performed on a Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalyst at 700 °C to obtain a mixture of 
CH4, C6H6 and H2. Subsequently, H2 present in the DHA effluent is combusted selectively using 
Fe3O4. The H2O produced in step two is then removed using a high-temperature water adsorbent, 
e.g. Zeolite 5A, which can be regenerated using a temperature swing. Finally, the reduced oxygen 
carrier is re-oxidized back to Fe3O4 using steam. To increase the conversion of CH4 and the yield of 
C6H6, the effluent from step three is fed again to the DHA unit in the subsequent cycle. Brady et 
al.240 demonstrated each of these above steps. Based on extrapolation, the upper limit of aromatics 
yield for such a process was estimated to be ~43%.240 However, an integrated CL-DHA process 
under such a multi-step scheme has yet to be demonstrated. Furthermore, the oxidation of Fe to 
Fe3O4 with steam is thermodynamically limited. It is also to be noted that the regeneration of Fe 
with water instead of air renders the overall process endothermic. The use of water for regeneration 
by Brady et al.240 may have been (partially) motivated by the lack of H2 combustion selectivity of 
Fe2O3. Although this CL-enhanced DHA scheme is quite innovative, it could be simplified while 
accounting for the aforementioned design considerations. For this, other SHC redox catalysts with 
higher H2 combustion selectivities should be considered in addition to iron oxides.83, 145 
Direct conversion of CH4 to CH3OH
Direct conversion of CH4 to CH3OH (and/or formaldehyde) via R50 is thermodynamically feasible. 
However, despite over a century of research the development of such a process remains a challenge 
owing to i. a large energy barrier associated with the activation of the C-H bonds of CH4, and ii. a 
lower stability of CH3OH than CH4, resulting in further oxidation of CH3OH to CO2.243 
Consequently, CH3OH is currently produced on a commercial scale from synthesis gas derived from 
coal or CH4.244
To date, no heterogeneous catalyst exists that can activate CH4 according to reaction R50 while 
simultaneously inhibiting CH3OH oxidation at practical yields.245 Interestingly, in nature 
monooxygenase (MMO) enzymes convert CH4 selectively into CH3OH at ambient temperature.246 
The active sites in these enzymes, i.e. binuclear iron and copper centers, can be mimicked using 
zeolite frameworks. However, so far with Fe and Cu-based zeolites a high selectivity for CH3OH is 
only achievable at very low CH4 conversions (< 0.1%).247, 248 The low CH3OH yields of the direct 
aerobic conversion of CH4 to CH3OH process is a thermodynamic feature that cannot be overcome 
by the choice of catalyst. Nonetheless, this thermodynamic constraint can be circumvented by using 
a CL approach and soft oxidants such as H2O or N2O.75, 76, 249-251 For example, using a Cu-exchanged 
mordenite zeolite, Sushkevich et al.252, 253 reported an anaerobic CL process based on the reaction

R66 to avoid the over-oxidation of CH3OH. In the proposed three-step process, the Cu-exchanged 
mordenite zeolite was first activated at 400 °C in a flow of either dry O2 or He, followed by exposure 
to CH4 at 200 °C and 7 bar to form methoxy species. Subsequently, the methoxy species were 
desorbed in the form of CH3OH under a flow of a H2O/He mixture. Once the desorption step was 
complete, the second reaction cycle was started by heating the zeolite again to 400 °C under a flow 
of dry O2 or He. This process resulted in a normalized CH3OH production rate of ~20 e 
CH3OH/gcatalyst/h (based on a cycle time of 6.7 h) with a selectivity of 97%, which is considerably 
higher than the CH3OH production rate of 1.81 µmole CH3OH/gcatalyst/h reported for a continuous 
process using O2 as the oxidant.254
4.2 Chemical looping for C2+ valorization
4.2.1 ODH of light alkanes
As illustrated in Section 2, the chemical looping strategy has been explored to intensify the 
production of ethylene,111 an important commodity chemical with a worldwide production capacity 
exceeding 150 million tonnes/year.255 Compared to the well-established, yet energy- and carbon-
intensive ethane (and naphtha) cracking processes, the CL-ODH approach (Figure 12) has the 
potential to reduce the energy consumption and CO2 emissions for ethylene production by as much 
as 87%.113 The significant process intensification of CL-ODH is enabled by: i. built-in air separation 
via chemical looping; ii. higher ethane conversion with autothermal operations via the in-situ 
oxidation of hydrogen; and iii. simplified downstream product separation due to the higher ethylene 
yield and the combustion of hydrogen.256 We note that extensive research has been conducted for 
catalytic ethane ODH in the presence of gaseous oxygen,257-260 but with limited success,261, 262 The 
key challenges for catalytic ODH resides in the cost of oxygen, safety issues related to the 
oxygen/ethane co-feed, the lack of catalysts with high activity and selectivity, and the complexity 
for the removal of oxygenate byproducts. To date, no suitable ODH catalysts have been identified 
to achieve sufficiently high olefin yields (~70%) such that ODH could replace the commercial steam 
cracking processes.263, 264 Moreover, most of ODH reactions were carried out at very low ethane 
partial pressures (< 0.1 bar) due to safety concerns. In contrast, CL-ODH avoids direct contact 
between ethane and oxygen, provides integrated oxygen separation, and has demonstrated superior 
olefin yields (> 70%)265 at practical ethane partial pressures A^ 0.8 bar). In principle, the same CL-
ODH strategy can be applied to other light alkanes such as propane and butane. The following 
discussions provide a brief account of the chemical looping studies related to ethane and propane 
conversion to light olefins.

dehydrogenation applications in combination with a DH catalyst such as supported PGM (e.g. Pt) 
and chromium oxides.259, 278, 283 Another challenge with the DH and SHC concept resides in the 
incompatibility of the catalysts and their operating conditions. While physical and chemical 
interactions between the catalysts themselves can be avoided by spatially separating them (e.g. in a 
packed bed with alternating DH catalyst and SHC redox catalyst layers), active sites and dominating 
reaction pathways on DH catalysts can be affected by the steam generated from the SHC material. 
For instance, steam can lead to undesirable reforming reactions on PGM-containing catalysts. For 
oxide-based DH catalysts, steam (or air during the regeneration step) can affect the oxidation state 
of the active metal, induce changes in the surface compositions, and hence negatively affecting the 
DH performance. Except for very few studies269, the aforementioned studies used hydrogen and a 
hydrocarbon mixture (e.g. hydrogen, ethane, and ethylene) to evaluate the redox catalysts’ SHC 
performances. The incompatibility issues between DH and SHC have largely been unaddressed to 
date. Development of DH catalysts that are stable under redox conditions and in the presence of 
steam is therefore the key to apply the DH + SHC approach for CL-ODH.
SHC redox catalysts can also be integrated with thermal cracking reactions (Route b in Figure 12). 
Unlike surface-catalyzed DH reactions, thermal cracking proceeds via gas-phase radical reactions 
and so steam generated by SHC would not negatively affect cracking reactions. Under this approach, 
the CL-ODH reactions proceed via parallel gas-phase and surface pathways, i.e. hydrogen generated 
from gas phase cracking reactions is selectively combusted on the surface of the redox catalysts.80, 
269 In some cases, the redox catalyst surface can also function as a radical initiator to enhance the 
gas phase reactions (i.e. surface-initiated homogeneous reactions).87 It is noted that the initiation of 
radicals from alkanes typically requires temperatures close to or higher than 700 °C. While such a 
temperature range is not uncommon for CLC, the inverse relationship between SHC selectivity and 
reaction temperature for most oxide redox catalysts dictates that many of the SHC catalysts reported 
for DH + SHC, which are geared towards operating at 650 °C or lower, would not be compatible 
with thermal cracking reactions. The high operating temperature can also be challenging for oxides 
or metals with low melting points or high vapor pressures. To address these challenges, Dudek et 
al.83 investigated a number of Mn-containing redox catalysts including CaMnO3, SrMnO3, and 
Mg6MnO8 for selective hydrogen combustion using hydrogen and ethylene mixtures at temperatures 
up to 850 °C. The effect of promoters was also studied by impregnating Na2WO4 on each of these 
oxides. In general, Na2WO4 was effective in inhibiting the formation of COx, but negatively affected 
the redox activity of the mixed oxide. The operating temperature windows, i.e. the optimal 
temperature ranges with a high activity and selectivity towards hydrogen combustion, for the six 
redox catalysts investigated ranged between 550 and 850 °C. The large and tunable operating 
temperature window opens up the potential opportunity for integration of a SHC redox catalyst with 
thermal cracking. The effectiveness of CL-ODH under thermal cracking conditions was confirmed 
with Na2WO4 promoted Mn-Mg and Mn-Si oxides.284 Resulting from their high activity and high 
temperature SHC selectivity, ethylene yields up to 68% were demonstrated with COx selectivities 
as low as 1.9%. Negligible coking was observed in these studies. This is not surprising considering 
the redox catalysts’ high activity for lattice oxygen donation, which can actively inhibit coke 
formation. Na2WO4 was important for obtaining a high olefin selectivity since it enriches on the 
oxide surface and suppresses the deep oxidation of hydrocarbons.285 In the case of the Mg6MnO8 
system, a mixed oxide with a cation deficient rocksalt structure, near surface Mn4+ was suppressed 
by more than 85%.80, 81 Further characterizations by low energy ion scattering (LEIS), in-situ XRD,

and differential scanning calorimetry indicated that the Na2WO4 is likely to form a molten layer on 
the oxide surface under the operating conditions and thus acts as a physical blocker to suppress 
surface catalyzed C-H bond activation.286 The corresponding process analysis further highlighted 
the advantages of CL-ODH of ethane over steam cracking.113 These include higher single-pass 
yields, a reduction in the total energy demand by > 80% and a reduction in CO2 emissions by > 80%. 
Importantly, CL-ODH is self-sufficient from a process heat requirement point of view, making it a 
highly efficient and low emission technology ideal for distributed systems.
Type II: ODH redox catalysts
Many heterogeneous catalysts used in conventional ethane ODH (where oxygen is co-fed with the 
ethane) are redox-active.287 In the presence of gaseous oxygen (or, as was shown recently, mild 
oxidants such as steam)288, the reaction proceeds through a MvK mechanism289 in which ethane is 
activated and dehydrogenated by surface metal-oxide species, thereby reducing the metal oxide and 
creating oxygen vacancies. The vacancies on the surface are subsequently replenished by gaseous 
oxygen, which is dissociated and incorporated at surface sites different from the ODH reaction 
sites.290-292 The overall reaction is therefore facilitated by the migration of oxygen anions through 
the lattice and/or on the surface. The most common redox-active heterogeneous catalysts for ODH 
of light alkanes are based on vanadium oxide293-295 with different supports, such as alumina296-299, 
alumina modified with zirconia300, 301 or silica302-305. Nickel oxides306, 307 and cobalt oxides308, 309 
have also been examined.
Since a key characteristic for the MvK mechanism is that the overall reaction can be carried out 
under a “swing mode”, i.e. separating the reduction and oxidation into two sequential steps identical 
to chemical looping operations, it is not surprising that many of the redox-active oxide catalysts can 
act as redox catalysts in CL-ODH schemes. For example, Hossain and de Lasa developed a number 
of cyclically stable VOxGg4

 catalysts for the CL-ODH of ethane in a continuous 
fluidized bed process consisting of an ODH reactor and a catalyst regenerator.298, 299, 310. Ethylene 
selectivities ranging from 80 – 90% at temperatures between 550 – 600 °C were reported. The 
corresponding ethane conversions, however, were relatively low (< 10%).300, 311, 312 The same class 
of catalysts was also used for the CL-ODH of propane in the simulated fluidized bed process and 
propylene selectivities of > 90% were obtained at up to 25% conversion of propane.313-315 The good 
performance of the most promising redox catalyst, VOx/CaO–g42O3, was attributed to an 
intermediate acidity of the catalyst and moderate active site-support interactions.85 Encouraging 
results for ethane CL-ODH were also obtained with Mo-based redox catalysts, which gave ethylene 
selectivties of 93 – 95% and conversion up to 66.5% at 600 °C.297, 316 The oxygen storage capacity 
of these Mo-based redox catalysts was relatively low (< 0.4 wt%), resulting in a decreasing 
conversion of ethane with time. Nonetheless, in a continuously operating riser reactor system, an 
ethane conversion of 12% at ethylene selectivities > 90% was obtained with a mixed Mo-Te-V-Nb 
oxide supported on g42O3 when the contact time of ethane feed and redox catalysts was 1 – 2 s at 
500 – 575 °C.317 The same authors also showed that the performance of Mo-based redox catalysts 
is strongly affected by the support material (Al2O3, Ga2O3 or Y2O3), leading to an increased ethane 
conversion and ethylene selectivity with a decrease in the content of MoO3; the best results were 
obtained with 5 wt% MoO3 on alumina, giving 90% selectivity for ethylene at an ethane conversion 
of 30%.318, 319 Novotny et al.284 investigated the effect of impregnating MoO3 onto an T42O3-based 
redox catalyst, which improved the oxygen storage capacity from 0.28 wt% to 0.62 wt%. A MoO3 
and Fe2(MoO4)3 enriched surface layer was formed upon calcination. At 600 °C, the ethylene

selectivity was as high as 62% while CO2 formation was suppressed when compared to pure T4
Fe2O3. Supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in catalytic dehydrogenation,320 e.g. 
the commercial CATOFIN® process. Chromium oxides were also shown to perform reasonably 
well in CL-ODH of propane with potential use in a moving bed process.321-323 The oxygen storage 
capacity was determined to be crucial for the performance of the redox catalyst, and slightly higher 
oxygen capacities (up to ~0.5 wt%) resulted in higher yields of propylene (~46% at 630 °C).324 More 
recently, Chen et al. used to use Mo-V-O mixed oxides as the redox catalyst for CL-ODH of propane 
to propylene.325 Attractive propylene yield (89% propylene selectivity at 36% pro-pane conversion) 
over 100 redox cycles was obtained at 500 °C due to the tailored bulk lattice oxygen via atomic-
scale doping of Mo in the redox catalyst. Although promising results were obtained from these redox 
catalysts, the toxicity of Cr and V and thermal stabilities of Mo and V oxides could affect their 
practical applicability especially in circulating bed systems.
Aside from the redox-active oxides commonly found in heterogeneous DH and ODH catalysts, 
alkali metal-promoted, Ruddlesden-Popper structured, LaxSr0cFeO<ca redox catalyst was recently 
shown to be active for CL-ODH of ethane.79, 128 Up to 90% ethylene selectivity and 61% conversion 
were observed at 700 °C, with near 100% H2O selectivity. An important finding from this study was 
that electrophilic surface oxygen species (such as O- and O2-), which limit the selectivity of the ODH 
reaction and account for the deep oxidation of the alkanes and olefins, can be suppressed by 
enrichment of alkali metal oxide on the surface of the redox catalyst. A thin layer of Li2O on the 
surface likely served as a barrier to inhibit the outward diffusion of O2- and its evolution into 
electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. 
A common challenge with these Type II ODH redox catalysts is the lack of oxygen storage capacity. 
Most of the redox catalysts reported to date exhibit < 1 wt%, and in many cases < 0.5 wt%, oxygen 
storage capacity. As noted above, the utilization of lattice oxygen in CL-ODH is significantly more 
efficient than that in CLC. For instance, combusting one mole of propane under CLC consumes ten 
moles of lattice oxygen whereas under CL-ODH it consumes only one. The order of magnitude 
increase in oxygen utilization efficiency make these low capacity redox catalysts potentially feasible 
for industrial applications, provided that high olefin selectivity, redox activity, and stability are 
demonstrated. Another challenge is the trade-off between conversion and selectivity especially in 
many of the V- and Mo-based redox catalysts, i.e. higher alkane conversion (e.g. by increasing the 
residence time) often leads to a significantly decreased olefin selectivity. This could result from the 
re-adsorption of the olefin products and/or the presence of distinct active sites for selective and non-
selective reactions. In-depth understanding of the active sites and reaction pathways would be 
crucial for rational optimization of the redox catalysts. Although a large body of literature is 
available on conventional, catalytic ODH systems, the exact mechanisms for many redox-active 
ODH catalysts are still under debate.259, 326 The dynamic nature of redox catalysts undergoing 
chemical looping reactions also makes mechanistic investigation on CL-ODH even more 
challenging than catalytic ODH. Therefore, further investigation on the mechanistic aspects of the 
redox catalysts is an important, yet challenging task. Although we did not separately discuss ethane 
and propane CL-ODH in this section, we note that propane (and C4+) is significantly less stable than 
ethane. The tendency for C-C bond cleavage makes it more difficult to develop highly selective 
redox catalysts for CL-ODH of propane and C4+ to olefins. Thus, a redox catalyst optimized for CL-
ODH of ethane may not automatically be applicable for propane and C4+ conversion.

4.2.2 Epoxidation of olefins
The epoxidation of olefins (R51) is another example for oxidation reactions where yields are 
generally low due to the non-selective oxidation of the educts and the epoxides; yet, these catalytic 
reactions are of enormous relevance for the chemical industry.327
So far, only the epoxidation of ethylene has been realized industrially using molecular oxygen as 
the sole oxidant.328 The selectivity to ethylene oxide is typically in the range of 85 – 90% at ~10% 
ethylene conversion with optimized silver-based catalysts.329, 330, 331 A chemical looping approach 
was recently explored to undertake the epoxidation reaction by substituting co-fed molecular oxygen 
with lattice oxygen.78 Here, Ag (15 wt%) was impregnated onto the perovskite SrFeO3 that 
possesses an oxygen storage capacity of up to ~2 wt%. The main rationale for selecting SrFeO3 was 
its excellent ability to spontaneously release O2 at relatively low temperatures.136 The authors 
proposed that oxygen was transported from subsurface SrFeO3 to the surface of the redox catalyst 
and thus formed oxygen adatoms on the silver surface. The vital role of atomic oxygen adsorbed on 
the silver surface for catalyzing the oxidation of ethylene has been discussed extensively in the 
literature,331, 332 as well as the availability of subsurface oxygen to achieve a high ethylene oxide 
selectivity333. Furthermore, it was found in previous studies that higher selectivities could be 
obtained with low surface area supports,334 335 a characteristic of most redox catalysts used in 
chemical looping applications. The selectivities and conversions reported by Chan et al.78 were, 
however, very low (the ethylene oxide selectivity was < 20% and the ethylene conversion was < 4% 
at 270 °C). Previous work showed that the dispersion of Ag, the morphology and temperature 
treatment of the support all affect, besides operational parameters, the performance of the 
catalyst.336-338 It is also possible that the exposed surface of SrFeO3 is largely responsible for non-
selective oxidation reactions and the activity of the oxide substrate to catalyze non-selective 
oxidation reactions should not be overlooked. Another challenge observed by Chan et al. was the 
low rate of oxidation when the redox catalyst was regenerated in air, causing a gradual loss in 
oxygen capacity.78 A similar problem was reported for vanadium phosphorous oxide redox catalysts, 
as will be discussed in Section 4.2.3. The problem was overcome by modifying the SrFeO3 with 5 
mol% CeO2, which also improved the cyclic stability and ultimately gave 60% selectivity towards 
ethylene oxide at 10% ethylene conversion.339 The authors proposed that CeO2 may have acted as 
oxygen gateway (see Section 3.2.2) and thus improved the re-oxidation of the redox catalyst. The 
challenge for further improvement will thus be to find oxygen storage materials with sufficient 
reduction/regeneration activities at temperatures < 300 °C while suppressing over-oxidation of 
ethylene. Despite the relatively low reaction temperatures of 200 – 280 °C typically employed for 
the epoxidation of ethylene, Ag-based catalysts tend to deactivate owing to the sintering of the silver 
particles,340-342 and this may be even more problematic when the redox catalysts are regenerated in 
an exothermic oxidation reaction.

Figure 13. The reaction mechanism of chemical looping epoxidation using a silver-modified 
SrFeO84a redox catalyst.
In principle, the chemical looping epoxidation approach can certainly also be applied to the selective 
oxidation of propylene, where it was shown recently that mixed metal oxides are catalytically active 
in a conventional oxygen co-fed mode. For a mixed MoO3/Bi2SiO5 catalysts supported on SiO2, 
propylene oxide selectivites of 55% were reported at a propylene conversion of 22% at 400 °C for 
a diluted feed with a molar ratio of O2/C3H6 of 4:1,343 whereas high formation rates of propylene 
oxide were observed for a RuO2/CuO catalyst supported on SiO2.344 Using a copper-manganese 
mixed metal oxide catalyst, Seubsai et al.345 found selectivities > 30% towards propylene oxide at 
up to 1.5% propylene conversion at 300 °C. These catalyst systems are structurally and chemically 
similar to typical chemical looping redox catalysts, indicating the potential for future work in this 
field.
4.2.3 Maleic anhydride production
ODH in a redox mode was demonstrated commercially by DuPont for the oxidation of n-butane to 
maleic anhydride to produce maleic acid (R53).86, 346 Up to 6500 kg/h of maleic acid were produced 
using a vanadium phosphorous oxide (VPO) redox catalyst in a circulating fluidized bed reactor 
operated at ~400 °C.347 The process was developed over a period of more than ten years, as 
summarized by Contractor, also highlighting the challenges associated with redox catalyst and 
reactor design.348, 349 Selectivity of near 80% was claimed at a conversion of 40%.327 Nevertheless, 
the plant was shut down in the early 2000s, partially owing to economic reasons related to a rapidly 
changing market situation for different raw materials and intermediates,350 but also owing to 
problems with catalyst loss through attrition 351 and deteriorating oxidation kinetics of the VPO 
catalyst, which resulted in a gradual loss in oxygen capacity during operation such that O2 had to be 
co-fed.352 We also note that the oxygen capacity of the VPO redox catalyst was rather low to begin 
with, corresponding to merely a few monolayers of lattice oxygen near the catalyst surface.353, 354
4.3 Chemical looping involving liquid and solid fuels
4.3.1 Liquid fuels driven processes
The CLBC approach can readily be extended to liquid hydrocarbons. In fact, it has been successfully 
employed to reform various liquid fuels, such as alcohols (e.g. methanol or ethanol),355-362 
glycerol,363 waste cooking oil,364 liquid alkanes (e.g. dodecane),365 kerosene,366 heavy oil,365 and 
biomass tar.367-370 In addition to reforming, liquid fuels can also decompose or completely oxidize

in the fuel reactor. For example, Ochoa et al.359 explored the nature of the surface species and 
gaseous products formed during reduction of different spinel mixed oxides using ethanol. It was 
found that ethanol always first dehydrogenates to acetaldehyde on the surface of the spinel. 
Subsequently, depending upon the spinel composition, acetaldehyde i. partially oxidizes to acetates 
(Ni-based spinel), ii. decomposes to CO and CH4 (Co-based spinel), or iii. completely oxidizes to 
CO2 and H2O (Fe-based spinel). The design criteria of redox catalysts and operating conditions for 
liquid fuels driven chemical looping processes are similar to those of the gaseous hydrocarbon-
based chemical looping processes. However, special care must be taken when using viscous liquids 
such as tar or heavy oil to avoid their condensation upstream and/or downstream of the fuel reactor. 
Similar to Type II ODH process, the chemical looping approach has been applied for the oxidative 
cracking of naphtha. Process simulations indicate that over 50% energy and CO2 savings can be 
achieved via the chemical looping route.112 Using perovskite-based redox catalysts, Dudek et al.87  
demonstrated close to 70% olefin selectivity with a COx selectivity as low as 0.3%.
4.3.2 Solid fuels driven processes
Owing to the slow rates of solid-solid reactions, using solid fuels directly for CLBC is challenging. 
Therefore, solid fuels (such as biomass or coal) are typically gasified in a separate unit and the 
resulting synthesis gas is fed to the chemical looping process designed for gaseous fuels.371-374 To 
avoid dilution of the synthesis gas with N2, the gasification reaction needs to be carried out with 
pure O2 or a mixture of O2 and steam/CO2. Therefore, an air separation unit would be required. 
Several strategies to extend CLBC to solid fuels are summarized below:
i.
The solid fuel can be gasified in-situ in the presence of a redox catalyst using steam or CO2 as 
the fluidizing gas. This strategy not only eliminates the need for a separate gasification unit but 
also enhances the rate of gasification.375, 376 However, owing to the inherently slow nature of 
the gasification reaction, it is difficult to achieve complete gasification of the solid fuel in-situ. 
ii.
Depending upon their thermodynamic characteristics, certain oxygen carriers can undergo 
spontaneous decomposition at high temperatures to release molecular oxygen.377, 378 The use of 
such oxygen carriers allows the direct combustion of a solid fuel via a gas-solid reaction, i.e. 
without an intermediate gasification step. This process configuration, typically referred to as 
chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU), significantly increases the rate of fuel 
oxidation, thereby allowing the complete combustion of the solid fuel. Furthermore, instead of 
fully oxidizing the solid fuel it is also possible to gasify it by controlling the partial pressure of 
oxygen released by the redox catalyst.379
iii.
Recently, it has been proposed to use molten oxygen carriers or reaction system for CL-methane 
POx, CLC, and CL separation to circumvent the challenges associated with the solid-based 
chemical looping systems, such as carbon deposition, thermal sintering and low reaction 
rates.380 Wang et al.381 proposed a molten slat alkali carbonate based CL-methane POx system 
for the coproduction of synthesis gas and metallic Zn. The molten reaction system enables to 
intensify heat and mass transfer during the cyclic redox, increasing the energy utlization 
efficiency. Sarafraz et al.382-384 investigated the thermodynamic feasibility of using liquid 
oxygen carriers for the partial oxidation of fuel to synthesis gas and identified Cu, Pb and Sb as 
the most promising candidates. Upham et al.385 demonstrated a molten bromide-oxide based 
chemical looping for the reactive separation of HBr in a halogen-based natural gas conversion. 
Nickle-alkali bromide and oxide were switched in molten reactor for the conversion of HBr to 
Br through the MeBr/MeO redox pair. Although the use of molten redox catalysts avoids the

aforementioned issues and enhances the rate of reaction, it also introduces new challenges such 
as evaporation or solidification of liquid oxygen carriers, continuous circulation of liquid 
metals/oxides, large pressure drops across the reactors, etc.
iv.
For solid fuels with high volatile contents, e.g. biomass or low-rank coal, it is possible that a 
redox catalyst can be used to generate value-added products via pyrolysis-type of processes – 
an area that has not been investigated extensively by the chemical looping community.44, 386 It 
is noted that pyrolysis products with less oxygenates are typically desired, which may conflict 
with typical chemical looping operations.
4.4 Synergy between oxide and calcium/carbonate looping
CaO-based sorbents, often in the form of naturally-occurring lime, are used widely in applications 
such as flue gas desulfurization387-389 and sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming (SE-SMR) 
to produce H2.390-393 In SE-SMR, CO2 is removed continuously in the WGS reaction step, thus 
shifting the equilibrium to the product side according Le Chatelier’s principle.394 The H2 yield can 
thereby be increased to ~ 97 vol.% at 550 °C.395 The WGS reaction is relevant also in gasification 
reactions, and generally in schemes where mixtures of CO, CO2, H2 and H2O co-exist at high 
temperature, and so sorbents for CO2 are conventionally used.396 Lately, CaO-based sorbents have 
also gained considerable attention for carbonate looping (CaL),397-405 a post-combustion CO2 
capture technique.402, 406 A key advantage of using CaO for the sorption of CO2 is its high theoretical 
uptake of 0.78 g CO2 per g CaO, according to reaction R68 in Table 2. The carbonation reaction is 
exothermic whereas the reverse reaction, known as the calcination reaction, is endothermic, giving 
a stream of concentrated CO2.407 Carbonate and oxide (chemical) looping processes can be 
combined to improve efficiencies of both processes, as discussed below.
4.4.1 Reaction schemes
Chemical looping with sorbent enhancement for heat-neutral sorbent regeneration
Besides permitting higher yields of H2 in the SE-SMR/gasification scheme, the exothermic 
carbonation reaction can provide a large amount of heat for the strongly endothermic methane 
reforming or the gasification reaction. Meanwhile, the regeneration of the sorbent via the highly 
endothermic calcination reaction is critical and requires high reaction temperatures (> 750 °C). 
Performing the calcination reaction in the presence of an exothermic reaction would balance the 
heat requirements. Such exothermic reaction could be the oxidation of a reduced oxygen carrier, as 
suggested by Lyon and Cole,163, 408 e.g. the simultaneous oxidation of the Ni-based reforming 
catalyst. However, a relatively high ratio of Ni to CaCO3 (> 0.75) would be required to balance the 
heats of reaction, resulting in an increase in the catalyst cost, and the CO2 produced is diluted with 
N2 when air is used for the re-oxidation of Ni. In addition, the oxidation of the reforming catalyst at 
high temperature is likely to promote its sintering and deactivation.
Chemical looping with sorbent enhancement for CO2 capture
The simultaneous oxidation and calcination reactions eliminate the benefit of CaO-based sorbents 
to produce a pure stream of CO2. In CaO-based CO2 capture architectures, the calcination reaction 
can be performed in a reactor operated in an oxy-fuel mode, where the heat is provided by 
combusting additional fuel (e.g. natural gas) in an atmosphere containing O2 diluted with CO2.409-
411 Replacing molecular oxygen with an oxygen carrier that reduces in an exothermic reaction while 
fully combusting the fuel would enable both the balancing of the endothermicity of the calcination 
reaction and generating a pure stream of CO2.412 A few redox pairs, e.g. CuO/Cu or Mn2O3/Mn3O4,

can be reduced exothermally with CH4 and other hydrocarbons.39 This feature can be applied to 
integrate the heat released from the CLC reduction step with the endothermic calcination step to 
produce concentrated CO2. A reaction scheme where CuO-based chemical looping combustion is 
combined with SE-SMR is shown in Figure 14a and at least three reactors are required to obtain 
separate streams of H2 and CO2.413
For carbonate looping as a CO2 capture technique, heat integration is vital to be economically 
competitive with other CO2 capture techniques. In analogy to the SE-SMR process, CuO-based 
oxygen carriers have mostly been investigated to render the heat exothermic during the exothermic 
calcination step.414-417
Unlike the CLC reduction step that is often endothermic, the regeneration step is always exothermic 
for monometallic oxides. Therefore, integration of the heat released in the CLC regeneration step 
with the sorbent calcination step can also result in concentrated CO2 if a heat transfer agent is used 
to avoid direct contact between the air (in the regeneration step and the oxidizer) and CO2 (from 
calcination in the calciner). Both ALSTOM and General Electric proposed and investigated such 
schemes (details on these two processes have been summarized by Fan122). In ALSTOM’s Hybrid 
Combustion-Gasification Process for hydrogen generation, a CaSO4 oxygen carrier is employed to 
generate the heat for the calcination of the CaO sorbent. Instead of oxidizing the oxygen carrier in 
the vicinity of the CaCO3, bauxite is used to transfer the heat from the oxidation reactor to the 
calcination reactor. Similarly, General Electric’s Fuel-Flexible Advanced Gasification-Combustion 
Process also adopted CLC reactions to provide the heat for calcination. In this case, an iron oxide-
based oxygen carrier was used as the heat transfer agent.
Sorption-enhanced methane reforming coupled with chemical looping conversion schemes
The thermodynamic properties of some oxygen carriers permit the splitting of CO2 or H2O to 
produce CO or H2 upon oxidation (see Sections 4.1.1). Since the rate of reduction of many oxygen 
carriers, e.g. Fe2O3, with primary fuels such as CH4 is low, it was proposed to convert CH4 first to 
a synthesis gas over a catalysts (e.g. Ni; in analogy to the dry reforming of methane (DRM)) and 
use the synthesis gas to reduce the oxygen carrier.94, 418 Depending on the oxidant used (CO2 or 
H2O) for the subsequent regeneration of the oxygen carrier, CO or H2 can readily be produced.
This reaction concept can be extended by adding a CaO-based sorbent (Figure 14b).419, 420 
Analogously to SE-SMR, the heat of sorption from the carbonation reaction (reaction R68) balances 
the endothermic reforming and reduction reactions. In the following oxidation step, CO2 is released 
from the sorbent and oxidizes the oxygen carrier while producing CO. The chemical looping concept, 
where in theory three moles of CO2 per mole CH4 are converted to four moles of CO, has been 
termed super-dry reforming of methane (R67). Importantly, in such a process the formation of an 
equilibrium mixture of CO2, CO, H2O and H2 is circumvented during the reforming step, thus 
avoiding a loss in CO yield through the RWGS reaction (R71). So far, the process has been 
demonstrated by mixing different materials, viz. CaO supported on Al2O3 as CO2 sorbent, Fe2O3 
supported on MgAl2O4 as oxygen carrier, and NiO supported on MgAl2O4 as the CH4 reforming 
catalyst, rather than multifunctional redox catalysts. While the theoretical advantages over 
conventional dry-reforming of CH4 are apparent, there is still scope for improvement (besides 
improving the materials used). For example, it was proposed to run the process isothermally. 
Equilibrium thermodynamics dictate that the release of CO2 from the CO2 sorbent requires very low 
CO2 partial pressures and for that, an inert gas would likely be needed in the oxidation step (where 
Fe is oxidized by the CO2 released from the sorbent). This will inevitably dilute the product gas CO.

The product gas CO is diluted further with CO2 because the conversion of CO2 to CO over Fe is 
thermodynamically limited and the ratio of CO/CO2 in the product gas will decrease further as the 
Fe-based oxygen carrier is oxidized via FeO to Fe3O4.

is integratedinto the SE-SMR process. (b) Reaction scheme of the super-dry reforming of methane 
with two reactors, in which the reforming catalyst (Ni) is spatially separated from the oxygen carrier 
(Fe3O4) and the CO2 sorbent.
4.4.2 Material design
The performance and function of CaO-based sorbents can be further improved by doping with active 
oxides,414, 421, 422 addition of supports,423 acid modifications,424, 425 and morphology control.421, 426 
One of the most studied combined oxide and carbonate looping schemes is CuO-based chemical 
looping combustion coupled with SE-SMR.427-430 In this process, at least three materials are required: 
A catalyst for the reforming of CH4, a sorbent for CO2, and CuO as the oxygen carrier that can be 
reduced by various fuels in an exothermic reaction. If CH4 is used as the fuel, the Cu/Ca ratio needs 
to be > 3.1 to achieve thermally neutral conditions in the calcination step based on the enthalpies of 
reaction at 900 °C. However, this figure varies somewhat and is subject to the process design, the 
type of fuel (e.g. using CO as the fuel, the ratio would be 1.3) and the heat management strategy.431, 
432
Three active components make the design of suitable, “tri-functional” materials rather 
challenging;433 current research thus focuses largely on the development and optimization of 
separate particle systems434-436 or bi-functional Ca-Cu422, 437-440 or Ca-Ni441-443 composites and uses 
commercially available Ni-based catalyst particles.444, 445 The CO2 capture capacity of the CaO-
based sorbents is linked strongly with the available surface area, which is known to decay due to 
sintering when the sorbents undergo cycling of carbonation and calcination.446-448 Producing stable 
particles with a porous CaO structure in the vicinity of low surface area CuO in a Ca-Cu composite 
material requires appropriate support materials, e.g. MgO449 or Ca12Al14O33.450 Recent works405, 414, 
451 at ETH Zürich have shown how such support materials function as structural stabilizers at the 
microscopic level and how subtle phase transitions affect the cyclic performance of the CaO-
sorbents (Figure 15). Another recent study reported an interesting phase transition based approach

Conventional design strategies aim to limit the mobility of active species and their growth by using 
inert support materials that act as physical barriers.199 New approaches have shown that the active 
species in a sorbent or redox catalyst may well be mobile, but their self-diffusion is limited if the 
simultaneous formation of a new phase with the active species is thermodynamically more 
preferred.453 For example, Dang et al.452 demonstrated that calcium cobalt, a layered bi-functional 
material acting as both sorbent and catalyst for the sorbent enhanced reforming of glycerol could 
effectively be stabilized because the components CaCO3 and CoO homogenized into calcium cobalt 
on an atomic level in every calcination stage of the cyclic process instead of remaining segregated 
and sintering. Well-ordered structures, such as layered oxides, spinels or perovskites are particularly 
suitable for such approaches.452, 454
For reaction schemes such as the super-dry reforming of methane, catalyst and oxygen storage 
material are usually separated spatially.455 Work by Hosseini et al. demonstrated that both the 
reforming of methane through the catalyst and the reduction of the oxygen storage material can be 
realized by the same redox catalyst particle provided it is designed carefully in a core-shell 
structure.456

consuming 40.9 quadrillion BTU of energy and emitting 2.5 Gigatons of CO2 (2014 numbers 
provided by IEA).457 The significant energy intensity and CO2 emissions associated with this 
important industrial sector offer excellent opportunities for process intensification, energy 
conservation, emission reduction, as well as profitability enhancement. We believe that CLBC 
represents a promising new frontier in chemical reaction engineering, catalysis, and particle 
technology to address the aforementioned challenges and opportunities. As discussed in Section 2, 
the unique advantages of CLBC largely reside in its ability to significantly improve a chemical (and 
energy) conversion process from a thermodynamic second law standpoint: a strategically designed 
CLBC scheme, when coupled with tailored oxygen carrier or redox catalyst, can significantly reduce 
process exergy loss and/or facilitate chemical transitions that would otherwise be impossible under 
a conventional scheme. From an economic standpoint, reactive separation enabled by oxygen 
carriers in CLBC offers excellent potential to simplify conventional processes and to reduce the 
number of unit operations. With the continued technical progress in CLC, a promising carbon 
capture technology that addresses the carbon intensive, $1.4 trillion power generation sector, we 
argue that chemical looping beyond combustion offers equally and perhaps even more exciting 
opportunities due to their potential for more efficient lattice oxygen utilization, higher product value, 
and relative ease for scale-up compared to full scale utility plants.
Although CLBC has attracted increasing attentions over the past 5 – 10 years, we note this emerging 
research area is far from being adequately explored particularly considering its significant 
complexity and excellent potential. From scientific and engineering standpoints, CLBC represents 
an “ultimate” multidisciplinary and multiscale challenge that requires expertise in various areas 
including, but not limited to, chemical looping, heterogeneous catalysis, material science, particle 
technology, reaction and reactor engineering, and process and system engineering. This is due to 
the uniquely intertwined nature of CLBC. For instance, redox catalyst performance cannot be treated 
in an isolated manner since it is significantly affected by reactor design and gas-solids contacting 
patterns as well as the multi-step redox scheme configuration. Meanwhile, the redox catalyst can 
undergo significant changes in its surface and bulk properties within a CLBC cycle that exceeds 
complexities typically observed in heterogeneous catalysts. Such complexities, while daunting, are 
closely associated with the unique advantages CLBC has to offer. They can and should be addresses 
through continued research via interdisciplinary efforts. From a practical standpoint, redox catalysts 
with high stability and satisfactory long-term performance are critical for CLBC. Moreover, reactor 
designs that facilitate suitable redox catalyst particle circulation, gas-solids contacting patterns, 
residence time distributions, and heat integration between multiple reactors are important to enable 
these promising CLBC technologies.
This article aims to cover all the CLBC schemes to the best of our knowledge. Although a number 
of promising approaches such as oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes and alkene epoxidation 
are under investigation, significantly greater opportunities still exist both within and beyond these 
CLBC topics. From a reaction chemistry standpoint, the chemical looping approach is analogous to 
the MvK mechanism commonly encountered in catalytic oxidation reactions. As illustrated in 
Figure 16, CLBC carries out catalytic oxidation cycles via a step-wise MvK with macroscopic 
spatial or temporal separation of the lattice oxygen removal and replenishment events. This is in 
contrast with conventional MvK, where the catalytic cycle is completed on the surface of an oxide 
catalyst under steady-state operations. The step-wise operations in CLBC offers both significant 
advantages (reactive separation, process intensification, and energy/cost reduction) and potential

challenges (surface and/or phase changes of the redox catalytic under redox cycles). Considering 
their similarities, it would not be unreasonable to anticipate catalytic reactions operated under MvK 
mechanism to be potentially suitable candidates for CLBC. Table 3 summarizes a number of such 
candidate reactions. Compared to the limited CLBC reactions investigated to date, a significantly 
number of potential reactions are yet to be explored. In addition, the regeneration step in CLBC, 
which was demonstrated to be effective for H2 and CO production via CO2/H2O splitting, could be 
investigated for hydrogenation or carbonylation reactions. Carriers other than oxygen, e.g. nitrogen 
carriers, also offer exciting potential for chemical syntheses. Aside from these, significant progress- 
still needs to be made towards in-depth understanding of redox reaction mechanisms, catalyst design 
and optimizations, reactor and process design and operations, as well as process scale up for the 
existing CLBC approaches. To summarize, we believe that CLBC represents a largely uncharted 
and extraordinarily exciting area of research.
