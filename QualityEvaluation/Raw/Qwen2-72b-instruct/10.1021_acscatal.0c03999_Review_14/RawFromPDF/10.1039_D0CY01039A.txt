Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane over Transition Metal 
Sulfides Using Sulfur as an Alternative Oxidant 
Allison M. Arinaga,a Shanfu Liua and Tobin J. Marks a*
The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the 
facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2. Gaseous disulfur (S2) represents a thermodynamically “softer” oxidant that 
has been underexplored and yet offers a potential route to more selective propylene formation. Here we describe a system 
for sulfur-ODHP (SODHP). We demonstrate that various metal sulfide catalysts generate unique reaction product 
distributions, and that propylene selectivities as high as 86% can be achieved at 450 - 550°C. For a group of 6 metal sulfide 
catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding 
catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity. Kinetic data over 
a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst indicate a rate law which is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, suggesting that SODHP 
may occur via a mechanism analogous to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP. The present results should 
motivate further studies of SODHP as a route to the selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene.  
Introduction 
Recent shifts from naphtha to shale gas feeds in cracking units have 
led to a renewed interest in “on-purpose” propylene production.1 
However, 
direct 
propane 
dehydrogenation 
is 
limited 
by 
thermodynamic constraints and catalyst deactivation due to 
extensive coking.2 Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with O2 
(ODHP) is an approach that has the potential to dramatically improve 
the efficiency of propylene production. This reaction is thermo-
dynamically favorable owing to its exothermicity (Figure 1a), and 
coking is significantly suppressed under O2.3, 4 However, after years 
of research, achieving high propylene yields remains elusive due to 
overoxidation of the olefin product to CO and CO2.5 Investigations of 
novel approaches to ODHP are therefore needed to address this 
grand scientific challenge.  
Recently elemental sulfur, in the form of S2 vapor, has been 
implemented as a “soft” oxidant for the oxidative coupling of 
methane (OCM) to enhance ethylene selectivity by moderating the 
thermodynamic driving force towards over-oxidation.6-8 S2 is 
isoelectronic with O2 and is the primary sulfur allotrope present in 
the gas phase above 700 °C (see Experimental Section for details on 
S2 formation in this work).9-11  This approach might also, in principle, 
be applicable to ODHP with S2, as the Gibbs energy of reaction (ΔGr) 
for total oxidation is far less severe with S2 than for O2 (Figure 1a). 
Furthermore, for methane, significant mechanistic differences are 
observed between S2-OCM (SOCM) over metal sulfide catalysts 
versus traditional metal oxide-based OCM.7, 8 These results raise the 
intriguing question of whether an S2 oxidant and metal sulfide 
catalysts might display unique reactivity properties in an ODHP 
process as well.

Earth-abundant metal sulfides have proven to be promising, 
inexpensive catalysts for hydrocarbon transformations such as light 
alkane dehydrogenation.12-18 Additionally, metal sulfides are tolerant 
to sulfur-containing compounds, which are present in most natural 
gas streams and which poison many noble metal and oxide-based 
catalyst alternatives.19, 20 Shan et al. prepared sulfided metal oxide 
catalysts and reported that they exhibit higher activity and selectivity 
for isobutane dehydrogenation than the original oxide catalysts.13-15 
These authors argued that the increased selectivity reflects an 
electronic effect in which olefin desorption is facilitated on the 
sulfided catalyst surfaces. Nevertheless, these sulfided catalysts 
undergo rapid deactivation with time on stream due to loss of sulfur 
but can be regenerated by re-sulfiding the surface.
Peer-reviewed literature and patents have also described 
alkane ODH reactions promoted by sulfur, either in the form of H2S 
added to the reactant stream or by using sulfate- or sulfide-based 
catalysts.21-27 This sulfur addition is reported to enhance both ODH 
conversion and olefin selectivity. Several of these reports argue for 
in-situ formation of some active sulfur species such as S2, produced 
via reaction of H2S and O2. Nevertheless, very little experimental data 
is available to support these models, and the relative roles of S2 and 
O2 oxidation are not easily differentiated.21, 24, 27 Indeed, the limited 
reports in which elemental sulfur is proposed as an oxidant would be 
greatly strengthened by mechanistic data. 
Overall, the prior literature on metal sulfide catalysts and sulfur 
promotion of light alkane activation suggests that a sulfur-ODHP 
(SODHP) process might be a promising route to acceptable propylene 
yields. Additionally, the H2S byproduct formed from an SODHP 
process could be regenerated as elemental sulfur via the  efficient 
industrial Claus process (Figure 1b).28 In this contribution we describe 
a system for SODHP using elemental sulfur (S2) as an oxidant and 
compare the catalytic results over six metal sulfide catalysts. The goal 
here is an exploratory study of the scope, fundamental chemistry, 
and mechanism of S2 as an oxidant for ODHP. We report product 
selectivities, apparent activation energies (Eapp), and reaction orders 
under differential conditions, leading to a plausible proposed 
reaction mechanism. These results demonstrate that sulfur vapor 
(S2) can act as an effective oxidant for ODHP and that this novel 
SODHP process may be a promising new route to propylene 
production. 
Experimental  
Catalyst Preparation
In this study, bulk metal sulfides and sulfided metal oxides were 
employed as catalysts. Sulfided metal oxides will be denoted as S-
MxOy, where MxOy is the metal oxide precursor. ZrO2, TiO2 (rutile), 
Cr2O3, Co3O4, MoS2, and PdS powders were purchased from Sigma 
Aldrich. Prior to sulfidation or reaction, the materials were pressed 
into pellets, then crushed and sieved to achieve a mesh size of 180-
300 μm. The metal sulfides MoS2 and PdS were used as received 
without further pre-treatment.  In order to ensure stable operating 
conditions under the sulfur-rich environment of the SODHP reaction, 
the metal oxides ZrO2, TiO2 (rutile), Cr2O3, and Co3O4 were pre-
sulfided before the SODHP reaction by heating to 600 °C and holding 
for 6 h under a gas stream containing 0.28 wt% S2 and 0.33 wt% H2S. 
The sulfidation conditions were selected based on previous work on 
these and other similar sulfide catalysts for the oxidative coupling of 
methane with sulfur.7 
Safety note: H2S, a pretreatment gas and reaction product of 
this study, is lethal at concentrations of 750-1000 ppm. As such, the 
experimental setup should be contained in a well-ventilated area 
equipped with an H2S monitor. 
Catalyst Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of S-Co3O4 were acquired 
using a Scintag XDS2000 instrument, while all other catalyst XRD 
patterns were collected on a Rigaku Ultima Diffractometer. X-ray 
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a Thermo 
Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi instrument. An electron flood gun was 
applied prior to sample analysis. Peak fitting was performed using 
Thermo Avantage software. Physisorption measurements were 
performed with a Micromeritics 3Flex instrument, and surface areas 
were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. 
Prior to measurements, metal sulfides and sulfided oxides were 
degassed at 120 °C for 6 h, while metal oxide precursors were 
degassed at 300 °C for 6 h. The BET surface areas of S-Co3O4 and PdS 
could not be determined due to loss of sulfur from the bulk under 
vacuum conditions. 
Catalyst Evaluation
Catalytic reactions were carried out at atmospheric pressure 
between 450 and 550 °C in a custom flow reactor that has been 
described in detail previously.6 Briefly, a sulfur evaporator, preheater 
furnace, and reactor furnace are contained within an insulated oven. 
The sulfur flow rate was adjusted by controlling the temperature of 
the sulfur evaporator (typically 180-220 °C). Prior to introduction into 
the reactor furnace, sulfur vapor was passed through the preheater 
furnace at 700 °C. At this temperature, S2 is the predominant gaseous 
species compared to other gas-phase sulfur allotropes.9-11 Gas flow 
rates were controlled using Brooks Model 5850E mass flow 
controllers.
The quartz reactor tube was charged with 100-200 mg of metal 
sulfide catalyst or oxide precursor before each reaction. The reactor 
was flushed with 120 sccm He while heating to reaction or sulfidation 
temperature. During the SODHP reaction, propane and sulfur were 
flowed for a minimum of 3 h. Products were analyzed by gas 
chromatography (Agilent 7890A) using flame ionization (FID) and 
thermal conductivity (TCD) detectors. The reported propane 
conversions (eq. 1) and product selectivities (eq. 2) were determined 
using the average of the last 90 min on stream and calculated on a 
molar basis. Here, C represents the concentration of a carbon-
containing product and  represents the number of carbon atoms in 
𝜈
said product.

Conversion and selectivity were calculated as an average of several 
time points to account for uncertainties in the GC peak areas of 
propane and other gases. Steady state catalyst performance was 
achieved prior to calculation of these values (see Figure S9 for 
stability of SODHP catalysts with time on stream). Additionally, 
weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) during the SODHP reaction was 
calculated by dividing the total mass flow rate of the feed gas 
(including propane, sulfur, and inerts) in grams/min by the total mass 
of catalyst loaded into the reactor in grams.
Results and Discussion  
Catalyst Characterization
The spent sulfided metal oxide catalysts were characterized in order 
to probe the effects of the sulfidation treatment and SODHP reaction 
conditions. The BET surface areas of the precursors and spent 
catalysts are summarized in Table 1 and Table S1. The surface areas 
of the spent catalysts are somewhat lower than those of the

precursors, which is consistent with earlier SOCM studies and is 
expected upon transition from oxide to sulfide.7, 29 The BET surface 
area of the MoS2 catalyst is unchanged after the SODHP reaction. 
PXRD patterns of S-Co3O4 and S-TiO2 reveal complete and partial 
transformation of the bulk into sulfides, respectively (Figure 2). 
Moreover, the S-ZrO2 and S-Cr2O3 diffraction patterns exhibit no 
significant differences from those of the oxide precursors, indicating 
that any sulfide phase is either amorphous and/or present solely as 
a thin layer on the surface.  
The XPS Zr3d spectrum of S-ZrO2 contains a doublet with 
ionizations centered at 181.99 and 184.35 eV. These peaks match 
those of a ZrS2 standard (Figure 3) as well as literature data. 30 The 
Cr2p spectrum of S-Cr2O3 contains a pair of spin-orbit doublets, which 
can be assigned to Cr2O3 and Cr2S3. The peak centered at 574.9 eV 
agrees well with the reported Cr2p3/2 value for Cr2S3, while the peak 
at 576.9 eV falls into the reported range for Cr2O3.31 Similarly, the 
Ti2p scan for S-TiO2 displays four peaks corresponding to the spin-
orbit doublets for TiS2 and TiO2 (Figure S2). These results suggest that 
S-ZrO2 likely consists of a core-shell type structure with surface ZrS2 
and the ZrO2 phase comprising the bulk. In contrast, S-Cr2O3 and S-
TiO2 contain both oxide and sulfide on the surface. While the 
presence of TiS2 in the PXRD pattern of S-TiO2 suggests some bulk 
oxide to sulfide conversion, S-Cr2O3 likely remains as Cr2O3 in the 
bulk.  Similar structural trends were observed in previous studies on 
these catalysts.7 Note that S-Co3O4 is completely sulfided into bulk 
Co3S4 and CoS according to the present PXRD data. The XPS spectrum 
reveals the presence of fully reduced Co0 on the surface in addition 
to the expected CoII and CoIII (Figure S3). Additionally, all the sulfided 
catalysts contain a spin-orbit doublet in the S2p region (see Table 1 
and Figure S4), which further supports the formation of metal 
sulfides.31 
 The diffraction patterns of fresh and spent MoS2 and PdS reveal 
that there are no phase changes following the SODHP reaction 
(Figure S5). However, spent PdS displays significantly sharper peaks 
compared to the fresh catalyst, suggesting increased crystallite 
dimensions/order. Additionally, the XPS spectra in the Mo3d and 
Pd3d regions display no observable change in metal oxidation state 
after the SODHP reaction (Figure S6), indicating that there is no 
significant loss of sulfur from the surface under catalytic reaction 
conditions. 
Catalyst Evaluation
The six catalysts were investigated for SODHP over the 450-550 °C 
temperature range. A “blank reaction” using the same reactor filled 
with quartz sand was also performed to ensure there were no 
significant homogeneous gas phase reaction in this temperature 
range (Figure S10).  All catalysts achieve steady-state conversion 
after 1-2 h on stream (Figure S9). Figure 4 compares the conversions 
and product distributions of the six catalysts. Propane conversion is 
significantly catalyst-dependent and varies from 4.7 to 8.1% at 550 
°C. The major reaction products are propylene and CS2.  Less than 4% 
combined C2 and C1 products are detected at the highest 
temperature of 550°C, suggesting that C-C bond activation is a 
relatively minor pathway. The carbon balance exceeds 98% for all 
catalysts (Figure S11). In addition to carbon-containing products, H2S 
is also detected in the product stream (see Table S3 for H2S yields).  
The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 
to 38% over PdS. The range of propylene selectivities may be due to 
differences in activity for propane/propylene combustion or

desorption energetics of propylene from the surface. Selectivity also 
increases with temperature for all catalysts (see Figure S7). This trend 
is similar to that observed for traditional ODH and indicates that the 
activation energy for propylene overoxidation to CS2 is lower than 
that for propane conversion to propene.32 Thus, as the SODHP 
reaction is further studied in the future and reaction conditions are 
optimized, it may be preferable to operate between 500 – 550 °C, 
where high selectivity can be achieved without the intrusion of 
significant gas phase reactions.
Control experiments were next performed to examine the 
effect of sulfur (S2) in the SODHP reaction. Without sulfur in the 
reactant feed, the propane conversion is significantly diminished 
over the sulfide catalysts. Figure 5 shows the results of experiments 
in which the flow is switched on and switched off while on stream 
over MoS2 and S-ZrO2. That is, the total gas flow rate is maintained 
constant while the flow is terminated using a balance flow of He. In 
a typical experiment, sulfur and propane flow over the catalyst. The 
propane conversion drops during the first 1-2 hours on stream 
before reaching steady state, which may be due to sintering, surface 
reconstruction, or the presence of active sites that are not 
regenerated. When the sulfur flow is terminated, the propane 
conversion falls significantly, but rapidly recovers to steady state 
levels upon reintroducing the sulfur flow. These results argue that 
there is little background non-oxidative dehydrogenation or thermal 
cracking of propane occurring under these conditions for both MoS2 
and S-ZrO2, and that sulfur is an effective oxidant. 
The relationship between propane conversion and product 
selectivity was also investigated by altering the contact time of the 
gas feed. As shown in Figure 6, higher propane conversions lead to 
reduced propylene and increased CS2 selectivity over both S-ZrO2 and 
MoS2. The inverse relationship between conversion and propylene 
selectivity suggests that CS2 is formed as a secondary product from 
propylene over-oxidation.33 However, propylene selectivity does not 
reach 100% when extrapolated to zero conversion, indicating that 
some direct propane  CS2 conversion is also operative.33  
The trade-off between conversion and selectivity in ODHP is 
often severe.34-38 For the present SODHP system, the severity of the 
trade-off is markedly catalyst-dependent. The propylene selectivity 
over MoS2 drops considerably, from 49 to 22% at 2.6 and 10.9% 
conversion, respectively. In contrast, S-ZrO2 displays a relatively 
moderate trade-off at low conversions, with the propylene 
selectivity only falling to 61% at the highest conversion tested (16%). 
Figure 7 shows the conversion-selectivity relationship for SODHP 
over S-ZrO2 to those of ODHP over some well-studied transition 
metal oxide catalysts in the literature. Although the reaction 
conditions are not exactly identical, it can be seen that the propylene 
selectivity over S-ZrO2 is comparable to the selectivities that have 
been reported for optimized traditional ODHP. In particular, the 
extent of the trade-off between conversion and selectivity over S-
ZrO2 rivals that of these literature examples. These results highlight 
that SODHP over metal sulfide catalysts can be an effective route to 
selective oxidative propylene production. Of course, SODHP is in its 
infancy, and further studies will likely yield more active and selective 
catalysts.

Mechanistic Characterization
Since the SODHP catalytic properties are strongly dependent on the 
metal sulfide identity, another question concerning this reaction is 
what intrinsic sulfide properties govern catalyst activity. Since 
neither the active site density nor the sulfide surface area could be 
accurately measured for these catalysts, reaction rates cannot easily 
be used to compare all six catalysts. Instead, the experimental Eapp 
values for propylene formation were determined using the Arrhenius 
formalism and employed as activity descriptors. Note that Eapp has 
frequently been used in the heterogeneous catalysis literature to 
describe catalyst activity and volcano trends.39, 40 Table 1 summarizes 
the measured Eapp value for each catalyst (see Table S2 for R2 values 
from linear fit), and the Arrhenius plots can be found in Figure S12.
Several previous studies suggested that traditional ODHP over 
metal oxide catalysts proceeds via a Mars van Krevelen (MvK) 
mechanism, in which lattice oxygen species on the catalyst surface 
are consumed during alkane activation.32, 38, 41-43 The resulting 
oxygen vacancies are then replenished by the gas phase O2. For an 
MvK mechanism, the catalyst activity is typically determined by the 
reducibility of the catalyst or the metal-oxygen bond strength.44 With 
this relationship in mind, we attempted to correlate the present 
SODHP catalytic activity with either of these parameters. Although 
the heat of formation has frequently been used as a rough estimate 
of the metal-oxygen or metal-sulfur bond strength,45, 46 there is no 
obvious correlation between the bulk sulfide enthalpy of formation 
and the present Eapp values. However, the heat of formation is a bulk 
property and does not necessarily describe surface properties.47 In 
the absence of computed values, the sulfur XPS binding energy was 
selected as a surface specific metric of the metal-sulfur bond 
strength. Since the XPS binding energy represents the energy 
required to remove an inner electron, a larger sulfur binding energy 
suggests decreased electron density on the sulfur atoms/lower-lying 
bonding orbitals, and thus  stronger M-S bonding.48   
Figure 8 examines the correlation between the sulfur 2p3/2 
binding energy and the Eapp for SODHP. Eapp decreases as the binding 
energy decreases (weaker M-S bonding). The exception is S-Co3O4, 
which has the largest barrier despite exhibiting the lowest sulfur 
binding energy. However, as the XPS data reveal (see Figure S3), this 
catalyst contains significant amounts of Co0 on the surface. Note also 
that this Co0 is not a reduction artifact arising from the argon 
sputtering since an ion beam was not applied before acquiring the 
XPS spectrum of this sample. The presence of Co0 could indicate that 
the high Eapp for S-Co3O4 may be due to structural differences versus 
the other metal sulfide catalysts. An alternative explanation is that 
we are observing an inverse “volcano” trend,49 where beyond a 
certain sulfur binding energy the reaction kinetics change and Eapp 
begins to increase. Note that the XPS sulfur binding energy does not 
necessarily scale linearly with actual M-S bond energy, meaning the 
slope visualized in Figure 8 may differ with DFT-calculated values.
Regarding 
the 
remaining 
five 
catalysts, 
a 
plausible 
rationalization for the observed trend is that weaker M-S bonds and 
more electron-rich/basic surface sulfur atoms facilitate hydrogen 
abstraction from propane. Similar trends have been reported 
previously for light alkane oxidation processes, including SOCM.6, 50 
To examine this hypothesis, the reaction orders of sulfur and 
propane were determined. As shown in Figure 9a, the rate of 
propane consumption over S-ZrO2 is essentially invariant with the 
sulfur concentration, indicating a zero-order S2 dependence (see SI 
Table S4 for the conversions and propylene selectivities). Propane: S2 
ratios greater than reaction stoichiometry were used here to ensure 
the observed zero-order dependence was not simply due to an 
overabundance of sulfur in the reactant stream. A similar result has 
been frequently described in the ODHP kinetics literature for O2.33, 41, 
44 The propane order was next measured under excess sulfur. The 
natural logarithms of propane concentration and reaction rate 
display a linear relationship with a slope of 0.91 (see Figure 9b), 
suggesting first-order dependence in propane. 
The sulfur order in the rate law was also measured for S-Co3O4 
to ascertain whether there was a kinetic difference regarding the role 
of sulfur for this catalyst. Unlike S-ZrO2, the reaction rate over S-
Co3O4 increases with increasing sulfur concentration. Figure 9c 
shows that the relationship between the natural logarithms of sulfur 
concentration and rate yields a slope close to 0.5. This apparent half-
order in S2 for S-Co3O4 suggests mechanistically that there is a slow 
S2 dissociation step during SODHP over this catalyst.
Considering the above results, the following mechanism is 
tentatively proposed for SODHP and summarized in Figure 10. The

rate-determining step in SODHP over the present metal sulfide 
catalysts is propane C-H activation by a surface sulfur species, which 
leads to surface reduction. Hydrogen abstraction from the central 
carbon is typically rate-determining in oxide-mediated propane 
oxidations and is consistent with the observed first-order 
dependence on propane.51, 52 A more active sulfur species would be 
expected when the metal-sulfur bonding is weaker and the sulfur 
atom is more electron dense, which in turn would lead to a lower 
Eapp. The relationship illustrated in Figure 8 indeed follows this trend, 
as a lower sulfur binding energy is indicative of weaker metal-sulfur 
bonding. Following C-H activation, the formation of propylene and 
H2S would then leave a sulfur vacancy on the sulfide surface. The 
observed zero-order in S2 for S-ZrO2 signifies that gas phase sulfur is 
involved after the rate-determining step. Thus, akin to the 
mechanism of traditional ODHP, the role of gas phase sulfur (S2) 
would be to replenish the surface sulfur vacancies. 
As the M-S bond becomes increasingly weak, the surface 
reduction by propane could become more facile to the extent that 
re-sulfidation of the surface becomes the slower step. The point at 
which re-sulfidation becomes rate-determining may conceivably 
correspond to the peak of the “volcano” trend in Figure 8. This 
explanation plausibly accounts for the higher Eapp and observed half-
order in sulfur for S-Co3O4. Additionally, the presence of Co0 on the 
surface of S-Co3O4 as discussed above suggests that this catalyst is 
easily reduced and less easily sulfided compared to other SODHP 
catalysts. Note that, although sulfur vapor is preheated to 700 °C 
prior to reaction with propane (see Experimental Section), the actual 
SODHP reaction temperature is 550 °C or lower. Thus, it is possible 
that other sulfur allotropes such as S8 or S7 may be present in the 
reactant stream.9-11 Future experimental and theoretical work will be 
needed to characterize the nature of the sulfur vapor oxidant in more 
detail.  
Conclusions
This investigation aimed to expand the previous S2 “soft oxidant” 
approach as an OCM analogue to an ODHP analogue and to explore 
the activity of metal sulfide catalysts in this reaction. The data 
presented here, including catalyst characterization and reactivity 
studies, are summarized in Table 1. Gaseous elemental sulfur is 
found to be an effective oxidant for ODHP, and the product 
selectivities vary significantly depending on the metal sulfide catalyst 
identity (86% propylene over S-ZrO2 versus 38% over PdS at 550 °C, 
for example). The experimental Eapp values for propylene formation 
are shown to scale/increase with increasing XPS sulfur binding 
energy, a qualitative experimental estimate of M-S bond strength 
and electron density. This result, combined with reaction orders of 
C3H8 and S2, suggest a mechanism in which surface sulfur species 
initiate C-H activation and gas phase S2 replenishes the vacancies 
resulting from product formation. Additionally, respectable 
propylene yields are obtained for a number of the catalysts 
examined. The findings reported in this study demonstrate that 
SODHP is a viable route to selective propylene formation over 
inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts. Further experimental and 
theoretical studies of SODHP catalyst development are ongoing.
