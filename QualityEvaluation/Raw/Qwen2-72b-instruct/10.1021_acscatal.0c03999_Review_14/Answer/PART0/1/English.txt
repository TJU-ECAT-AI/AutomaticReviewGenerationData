Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been extensively studied with a variety of catalysts, including transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements. These catalysts have been explored for reactions with soft oxidants such as CO2, N2O, sulfur-containing compounds, and halogens/halides. Despite the similarities in catalyst systems for CO2- and N2OODHP, inherent differences in reaction properties and the challenge of dealing with corrosiveness have complicated research advancement. Unique challenges and future research directions are identified for each reaction route. Future efforts should focus on designing catalysts that can effectively activate the CH bond in propane while maintaining good regenerability, and on renovating reaction systems to better accommodate industrial processes while addressing the challenges posed by various acid gases. CO2 plays a significant role in ODHP by completing redox cycles, shifting the reaction equilibrium towards product formation, and serving as an agent for coke removal. However, rapid deactivation due to reduction of active sites and coke formation is a major issue in CO2ODHP. Similar challenges exist in N2OODHP, where deactivation and regeneration of catalysts remain problematic. The introduction of exogenous mild oxidizers, such as in catalytic oxyhalogenation, offers a promising route for single-step C3H6 production, achieving yields up to 55%. Gaseous sulfur compounds are also effective mediators for DHP due to their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction. However, the nature of active sites in sulfur-mediated DHP is unclear due to a lack of catalyst characterization and mechanistic studies. To overcome these hurdles, significant efforts should be directed towards developing active and stable catalysts with a deep understanding of structure-activity relationships and reaction kinetics. Theoretical studies have provided insights into mechanistic understanding and catalyst design principles, but more progress is needed in developing better ODHP catalysts. Alternative technologies, such as chemical looping and membrane reactors, are being developed to enhance process efficiency and minimize energy loss.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown that gaseous disulfur (S2) is a promising alternative to O2, as it can suppress overoxidation to COx and potentially lead to more selective propylene formation. Studies on six metal sulfide catalysts have revealed that the apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol, and these energies are closely related to the XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that the strength of the M-S bond is crucial for the activity of SODHP. Kinetic data over a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst suggest a rate law that is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, pointing to a mechanism similar to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP. These findings highlight the potential of SODHP as a selective and efficient route for oxidative propylene production, motivating further research in this area.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or a comparison of various catalyst systems. It focuses on the performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The initial propylene yields were up to 25% at 723 K, but the catalysts deactivated due to coke formation. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, was essential for producing active catalysts. The nature and distribution of these species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity had no significant effect on the initial propene yield but strongly influenced the deactivation behavior. FeZSM-5 showed remarkable resistance against deactivation, while FeBEA deactivated rapidly and completely. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were similar.

Alternative technologies, such as chemical looping and membrane reactors, are being developed to enhance process efficiency and minimize energy loss.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown that gaseous disulfur (S2) is a promising alternative to O2, as it can suppress overoxidation to COx and potentially lead to more selective propylene formation. Studies on six metal sulfide catalysts have revealed that the apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol, and these energies are closely related to the XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that the strength of the M-S bond is crucial for the activity of SODHP. Kinetic data over a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst suggest a rate law that is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, pointing to a mechanism similar to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP. These findings highlight the potential of SODHP as a selective and efficient route for oxidative propylene production, motivating further research in this area.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or a comparison of various catalyst systems. It focuses on the performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The initial propylene yields were up to 25% at 723 K, but the catalysts deactivated due to coke formation. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, was essential for producing active catalysts. The nature and distribution of these species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity had no significant effect on the initial propene yield but strongly influenced the deactivation behavior. FeZSM-5 showed remarkable resistance against deactivation, while FeBEA deactivated rapidly and completely. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were similar.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been extensively studied with a variety of catalysts, including transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements. These catalysts have been explored for reactions with soft oxidants such as CO2, N2O, sulfur-containing compounds, and halogens/halides. Despite the similarities in catalyst systems for CO2- and N2OODHP, inherent differences in reaction properties and the challenge of dealing with corrosiveness have complicated research advancement. Unique challenges and future research directions are identified for each reaction route. Future efforts should focus on designing catalysts that can effectively activate the CH bond in propane while maintaining good regenerability, and on renovating reaction systems to better accommodate industrial processes while addressing the challenges posed by various acid gases. CO2 plays a significant role in ODHP by completing redox cycles, shifting the reaction equilibrium towards product formation, and serving as an agent for coke removal. However, rapid deactivation due to reduction of active sites and coke formation is a major issue in CO2ODHP. Similar challenges exist in N2OODHP, where deactivation and regeneration of catalysts remain problematic. The introduction of exogenous mild oxidizers, such as in catalytic oxyhalogenation, offers a promising route for single-step C3H6 production, achieving yields up to 55%. Gaseous sulfur compounds are also effective mediators for DHP due to their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction. However, the nature of active sites in sulfur-mediated DHP is unclear due to a lack of catalyst characterization and mechanistic studies. To overcome these hurdles, significant efforts should be directed towards developing active and stable catalysts with a deep understanding of structure-activity relationships and reaction kinetics. Theoretical studies have provided insights into mechanistic understanding and catalyst design principles, but more progress is needed in developing better ODHP catalysts. Alternative technologies, such as chemical looping and membrane reactors, are being developed to enhance process efficiency and minimize energy loss.
