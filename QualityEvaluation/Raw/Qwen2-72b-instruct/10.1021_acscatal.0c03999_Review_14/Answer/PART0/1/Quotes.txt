[1] "Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts are reviewed in this work."
          [2] "In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides."
          [3] "For CO2- and N2OODHP, the explored catalyst systems are analogous. However, differences in inherent properties of reactions and difficulties in dealing with corrosiveness have led to complications in advancing the research, resulting in unique challenges and future research directions for each route."
          [4] "In general, future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases."
          [5] "Major positive roles of CO2 include: (i) completing redox cycles, though the oxidation potential is weak, (ii) shifting the reaction equilibrium of ODHP to the product side by consuming the produced H2 via RWGS, and (iii) serving as an agent for coke removal by the reverse Boudouard reaction."
          [6] "For CO2ODHP, rapid deactivation occurs as a consequence of reduction of active sites and coke formation."
          [7] "Similar to CO2ODHP, deactivation and regeneration of catalysts in N2OODHP remains a challenge."
          [8] "The introduction of exogenous mild oxidizers is a potentially selective route for DHP."
          [9] "Catalytic oxyhalogenation is a promising route for single-step C3H6 production and yields of up to 55% have been achieved."
          [10] "The gaseous sulfur compounds, on the other hand, act as effective DHP mediators because of their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule."
          [11] "However, the exact nature of the active sites is still unclear from the studies to date because of the lack of catalyst characterization and mechanistic studies."
          [12] "To deal with the above-mentioned hurdles, significant endeavors should be devoted to developing a sufficiently active and stable catalyst with an in-depth understanding of the structureactivity relationship, as well as reaction kinetics."
          [13] "While there is still significant progress to be made in the development of better ODHP catalysts, theoretical studies in the literature have provided useful insights toward this problem with regards to mechanistic understanding and catalyst design principles."
          [14] "Efforts are also devoted to developing alternative technologies beyond packed catalyst bed, such as chemical looping and membrane reactor."

[1] "The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2. Gaseous disulfur (S2) represents a thermodynamically softer oxidant that has been underexplored and yet offers a potential route to more selective propylene formation."
          [2] "Here we describe a system for sulfur-ODHP (SODHP). We demonstrate that various metal sulfide catalysts generate unique reaction product distributions, and that propylene selectivities as high as 86% can be achieved at 450 - 550C."
          [3] "For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity."
          [4] "Kinetic data over a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst indicate a rate law which is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, suggesting that SODHP may occur via a mechanism analogous to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP."
          [5] "The present results should motivate further studies of SODHP as a route to the selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene."

          [2] "Here we describe a system for sulfur-ODHP (SODHP). We demonstrate that various metal sulfide catalysts generate unique reaction product distributions, and that propylene selectivities as high as 86% can be achieved at 450 - 550C."
          [3] "For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity."
          [4] "Kinetic data over a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst indicate a rate law which is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, suggesting that SODHP may occur via a mechanism analogous to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP."
          [5] "The present results should motivate further studies of SODHP as a route to the selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene."

          [2] "In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides."
          [3] "For CO2- and N2OODHP, the explored catalyst systems are analogous. However, differences in inherent properties of reactions and difficulties in dealing with corrosiveness have led to complications in advancing the research, resulting in unique challenges and future research directions for each route."
          [4] "In general, future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases."
          [5] "Major positive roles of CO2 include: (i) completing redox cycles, though the oxidation potential is weak, (ii) shifting the reaction equilibrium of ODHP to the product side by consuming the produced H2 via RWGS, and (iii) serving as an agent for coke removal by the reverse Boudouard reaction."
          [6] "For CO2ODHP, rapid deactivation occurs as a consequence of reduction of active sites and coke formation."
          [7] "Similar to CO2ODHP, deactivation and regeneration of catalysts in N2OODHP remains a challenge."
          [8] "The introduction of exogenous mild oxidizers is a potentially selective route for DHP."
          [9] "Catalytic oxyhalogenation is a promising route for single-step C3H6 production and yields of up to 55% have been achieved."
          [10] "The gaseous sulfur compounds, on the other hand, act as effective DHP mediators because of their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule."
          [11] "However, the exact nature of the active sites is still unclear from the studies to date because of the lack of catalyst characterization and mechanistic studies."
          [12] "To deal with the above-mentioned hurdles, significant endeavors should be devoted to developing a sufficiently active and stable catalyst with an in-depth understanding of the structureactivity relationship, as well as reaction kinetics."
          [13] "While there is still significant progress to be made in the development of better ODHP catalysts, theoretical studies in the literature have provided useful insights toward this problem with regards to mechanistic understanding and catalyst design principles."
          [14] "Efforts are also devoted to developing alternative technologies beyond packed catalyst bed, such as chemical looping and membrane reactor."

[1] "The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2.
