Persistent challenges in the field of ODHP using soft oxidants include the corrosiveness of the reaction environment and the inherent properties of the reactions that can lead to overoxidation. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems are key areas for future research and development. To improve C-H bond activation, the focus should be on developing catalysts with optimized electronic and geometric properties. Enhancing catalyst regenerability can be achieved through the design of stable and reusable catalysts that can withstand the harsh reaction conditions. Optimizing reaction systems may involve the use of alternative oxidants, such as S2, and the development of more efficient reaction engineering approaches to improve selectivity and conversion.
