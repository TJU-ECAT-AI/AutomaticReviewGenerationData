Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been extensively studied with a variety of catalysts, including transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14\]. These catalysts have been explored for reactions with soft oxidants such as CO2, N2O, sulfur-containing compounds, and halogens/halides. Despite the similarities in catalyst systems for CO2- and N2OODHP, inherent differences in reaction properties and the challenge of dealing with corrosiveness have complicated research advancement \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14\]. Unique challenges and future research directions are identified for each reaction route. Future efforts should focus on designing catalysts that can effectively activate the CH bond in propane while maintaining good regenerability, and on renovating reaction systems to better accommodate industrial processes while addressing the challenges posed by various acid gases \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14\]. CO2 plays a significant role in ODHP by completing redox cycles, shifting the reaction equilibrium towards product formation, and serving as an agent for coke removal \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14\]. However, rapid deactivation due to reduction of active sites and coke formation is a major issue in CO2ODHP \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14\]. Similar challenges exist in N2OODHP, where deactivation and regeneration of catalysts remain problematic \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14\]. The introduction of exogenous mild oxidizers, such as in catalytic oxyhalogenation, offers a promising route for single-step C3H6 production, achieving yields up to 55% \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14\]. Gaseous sulfur compounds are also effective mediators for DHP due to their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14\]. However, the nature of active sites in sulfur-mediated DHP is unclear due to a lack of catalyst characterization and mechanistic studies \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14\]. To overcome these hurdles, significant efforts should be directed towards developing active and stable catalysts with a deep understanding of structure-activity relationships and reaction kinetics \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14\]. Theoretical studies have provided insights into mechanistic understanding and catalyst design principles, but more progress is needed in developing better ODHP catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14\]. Alternative technologies, such as chemical looping and membrane reactors, are being developed to enhance process efficiency and minimize energy loss \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can effectively activate the C-H bond in propane under mild conditions, while maintaining high selectivity and stability. This could involve the design of catalysts with tailored active sites that promote the selective dehydrogenation of propane over competing reactions. Additionally, the optimization of reaction systems to better accommodate the use of soft oxidants, such as CO2 and N2O, could lead to more sustainable and energy-efficient processes. Strategies for improving catalyst regenerability and mitigating deactivation mechanisms, such as coke formation and active site reduction, are also critical areas for future investigation. The exploration of alternative oxidants, such as sulfur compounds, and the development of a deeper understanding of their role in the dehydrogenation process could open new avenues for selective propylene production. Furthermore, the integration of theoretical studies with experimental data could provide valuable insights into the mechanistic details of ODHP reactions, guiding the rational design of catalysts and reaction conditions. Lastly, the advancement of alternative technologies, such as chemical looping and membrane reactors, could revolutionize the industrial production of propylene by enhancing process efficiency and reducing environmental impact.
