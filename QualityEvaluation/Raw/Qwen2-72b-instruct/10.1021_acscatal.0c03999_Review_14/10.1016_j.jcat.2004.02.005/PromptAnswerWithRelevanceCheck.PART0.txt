Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

1. The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or a comparison of various catalyst systems. It focuses on the performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The initial propylene yields were up to 25% at 723 K, but the catalysts deactivated due to coke formation. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, was essential for producing active catalysts. The nature and distribution of these species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity influenced the deactivation behavior. FeZSM-5 showed remarkable resistance against deactivation, while FeBEA deactivated rapidly. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, despite similar residual activities after 400 min on stream. The literature does not discuss persistent challenges in the field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, or key areas for future research and development.

1. 文献没有提供使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展的全面分析，也没有比较各种催化剂系统的性能。它专注于蒸汽活化Fe-沸石在N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢中的性能。初始丙烯产量在723K时高达25%，但由于焦炭形成，催化剂失活。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的框架外铁物种对于产生活性催化剂至关重要。这些物种的性质和分布、沸石宿主和催化剂酸性影响了失活行为。FeZSM-5显示出对失活的显著抵抗力，而FeBEA迅速失活。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产量高于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA，尽管在400分钟后，它们的残余活性相似。文献没有讨论该领域持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性和固有反应性质，或未来研究和发展的关键领域。

1. The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, nor does it compare the performance of various catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion. The document focuses on the use of steam-activated iron zeolites as catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It reports initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but notes that the catalysts deactivate as a result of coke formation. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts. The nature and distribution of these species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior. FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
