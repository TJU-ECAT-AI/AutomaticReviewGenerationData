1. The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, nor does it compare the performance of various catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion. The document focuses on the use of steam-activated iron zeolites as catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It reports initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but notes that the catalysts deactivate as a result of coke formation. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts. The nature and distribution of these species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior. FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.

1. 文献没有全面分析最近在使用软氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)方面的进展，也没有比较各种催化剂系统在选择性和转化率方面的性能。该文件专注于使用蒸汽活化铁沸石作为N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢的催化剂。它报告了在723 K时初始丙烯产量高达25%，但指出催化剂由于焦炭形成而失活。在蒸汽处理过程中产生的框架外铁物种的存在对于产生活性催化剂至关重要。这些物种的性质和分布，沸石宿主，以及催化剂的酸性对初始丙烯产量没有显著影响，但强烈影响失活行为。FeZSM-5显示出对失活的显著抵抗力，而FeBEA则发生了非常快速和完全的失活。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产量高于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA，尽管在400分钟后流上的残余活性非常相似。
