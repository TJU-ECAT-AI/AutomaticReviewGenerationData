Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

1.The document does not provide recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, nor does it compare the performance of various catalyst systems. It does not discuss persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, or elaborate on key areas for future research and development. The document focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide melts, evaluating the reactions of propane with iodine in the temperature range 700-900 K. It discusses the thermodynamic and kinetic considerations of the process, indicating that low temperatures give higher propene selectivities. The experimental results confirm this, and the document suggests that the ratio of normal/isopropyl radicals is a major factor governing propene selectivity. At relatively high radical concentrations encountered in the system, coupling reactions to benzene are observed as the ultimate product. Optimizing the iodine/hydrogen iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen for propene or benzene production is feasible.

1.该文件没有提供使用软氧化剂在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)方面的最新进展，也没有比较各种催化剂系统的性能。它没有讨论该领域持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性和固有的反应性质，也没有详细阐述未来研究和发展的关键领域。该文件专注于在氢氧化锂/碘化锂熔体中丙烷的氧化脱氢，评估了在700-900 K温度范围内丙烷与碘的反应。它讨论了该过程的热力学和动力学考虑，表明较低的温度可获得更高的丙烯选择性。实验结果证实了这一点，文件建议，正常/异丙基自由基的比例是控制丙烯选择性的主要因素。在系统中遇到的相对较高的自由基浓度下，观察到耦合反应生成苯作为最终产物。优化碘/氢碘化物催化的氧化脱氢丙烷与氧气的反应，以生产丙烯或苯是可行的。
