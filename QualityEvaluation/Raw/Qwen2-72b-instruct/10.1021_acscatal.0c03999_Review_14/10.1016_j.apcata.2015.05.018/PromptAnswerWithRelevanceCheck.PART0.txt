Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, nor does it compare the performance of various catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion. The document focuses on the study of rutheniumtitania catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by molecular chlorine. The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400 C. The propane consumption turnover frequency was 45 103 s1. Diffuse reflectance UVvis spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study showed that ruthenium oxychloride was the active component of the catalyst. The literature does not discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, or elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

1.文献没有全面分析最近使用软氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)方面的进展，也没有比较各种催化剂系统在选择性和转化率方面的性能。该文件专注于研究钌钛催化剂在分子氯作用下的丙烷氧化脱氢。丙烯的选择性在丙烷转化率为50%和氯完全转化的条件下达到95%，温度为400°C。丙烷消耗的周转频率为45×103 s1。通过紫外可见漫反射光谱和X射线光电子能谱研究发现，钌氧氯化物是催化剂的活性成分。文献没有讨论该领域持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性和固有反应性质，也没有详细阐述未来研究和发展的关键领域，包括改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程的策略。
