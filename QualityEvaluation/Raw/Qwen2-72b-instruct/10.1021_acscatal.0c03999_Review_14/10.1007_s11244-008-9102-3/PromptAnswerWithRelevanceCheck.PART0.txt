Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

1.The literature does not provide information on recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, nor does it compare the performance of various catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion. The document focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes on supported molten alkali metal chloride catalysts, specifically ethane and propane. It discusses the high activity and selectivity of these catalysts compared to conventional catalysts, and attributes the high selectivity to the high mobility of cations and anions, which facilitates desorption of alkene and the generation of spatially isolated hypochloride anions acting as the active sites for the primary CH bond activation. The persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, are not discussed in detail. Key areas for future research and development include strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes, but these are not elaborated on in the literature.

1.文献没有提供关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展的信息，也没有比较各种催化剂系统在选择性和转化率方面的性能。该文件专注于在支持的熔融碱金属氯化物催化剂上对轻烷烃(特别是乙烷和丙烷)进行氧化脱氢。它讨论了这些催化剂与传统催化剂相比具有高活性和选择性，并将高选择性归因于阳离子和阴离子的高流动性，这促进了烯烃的解吸和空间隔离的次氯酸盐阴离子的生成，后者作为初级CH键活化的活性位点。该领域持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性和固有反应性质，在文献中没有详细讨论。未来研究和发展的关键领域包括改进C-H键活化的策略、增强催化剂的可再生性以及改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程，但这些在文献中没有详细阐述。

1. The literature does not provide recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or a comparison of various catalyst systems. It focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes on supported molten alkali metal chloride catalysts. The challenges discussed are related to the balance between acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst surface, the need for high site specificity, and the generation of uniform, mobile, and self-healing surfaces for complex reactions. Future research areas include exploring the influence of self-organization, dynamic restructuring of the catalyst surface under reaction conditions, and the role of the physical state and chemical composition with respect to activity and selectivity for ODH of ethane and propane.

1. The literature does not provide recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or a comparison of various catalyst systems. It focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes on supported molten alkali metal chloride catalysts. The catalysts have high activity and selectivity to olefins compared to conventional catalysts. Optimum performance is obtained with catalysts on which the alkali metal chloride phase is molten under reaction conditions. The high selectivity to ethene or propene is attributed to the high mobility of cations and anions, which facilitates desorption of alkene (limiting further oxidation) and the generation of spatially isolated hypochloride anions acting as the active sites for the primary CH bond activation. The persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, are not discussed. Key areas for future research and development include strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes, but these are not elaborated on in the literature.
