Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

1.The literature does not provide information on recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, nor does it compare the performance of various catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion. The document focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 catalysts. It does not discuss the challenges in the field of ODHP, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, or key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.
