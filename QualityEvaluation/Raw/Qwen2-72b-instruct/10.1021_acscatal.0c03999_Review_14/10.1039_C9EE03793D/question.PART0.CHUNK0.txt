* Correspondence authors: fli5@ncsu.edu muelchri@ethz.ch QI and FD contributed equally to the manuscript Abstract As a promising approach for carbon dioxide capture, chemical looping combustion has been extensively investigated for more than two decades. However, the chemical looping strategy can be and has been extended well beyond carbon capture. In fact, significant impacts on emission reduction, energy conservation, and value-creation can be anticipated from chemical looping beyond combustion (CLBC). This article aims to demonstrate the versatility and transformational benefits of CLBC. Specifically, we focus on the use of oxygen carriers or redox catalysts for chemical production  a $4 trillion industry that consumes 40.9 quadrillion BTU of energy.
Compared to state-of-the-art chemical production technologies, we illustrate that chemical looping offers significant opportunities for process intensification and exergy loss minimization. In many cases, an order of magnitude reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emission can be realized without the needs for carbon dioxide capture. In addition to providing various CLBC examples, this article elaborates on generalized design principles for CLBC, potential benefits and pitfalls, as well as redox catalyst selection, design, optimization, and redox reaction mechanism.
Broader context: The chemical industry consumes more than 40 quadrillion BTU of energy while emitting 2.5 Gigatons of carbon dioxide each year. Meanwhile, many established chemical processes are extensively optimized, providing limited space for further energy savings and emission reductions.
Chemical looping offers exciting new opportunities to the aforementioned challenges through process intensification. Facilitated by a redox catalyst, a rationally designed chemical looping scheme can reduce the number of unit operations and significantly decrease the exergy loss for chemical production. In some cases, the chemical looping strategy can facilitate a chemical conversion that would be otherwise infeasible in a conventional reaction scheme. While a number of chemical looping based chemical production approaches have shown promising results, this Page 1 of 61 Energy & Environmental Science Energy & Environmental Science Accepted Manuscript Published on 13 January 2020.

concept can be further expanded to a significantly wider sets of products using a variety of feedstock and energy sources. Given the exciting opportunities offered by chemical looping beyond combustion (CLBC) and the emissions and energy demand in the current chemical production practice, the CLBC design principles and redox catalyst selection/optimization strategies covered in this article can provide useful information for researchers in the general areas of chemical looping,catalysis, particle technology, and process intensification.

<questions>


Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
