Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been extensively studied, focusing on transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements. These catalysts have been explored for ODHP reactions with soft oxidants such as CO2, N2O, sulfur-containing compounds, and halogen/halides. The research has faced unique challenges due to differences in the inherent properties of reactions and difficulties in dealing with corrosiveness. Future research directions include designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in propane with good regenerability and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Among the catalysts studied, CrOx stands out as a redox-type catalyst with higher propene selectivity at elevated propane conversion. VOx, another redox-type catalyst, has achieved high propene selectivity but not high propane conversion. Ga2O3, a non-redox-type catalyst, shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion. The presence of CO2 has an overall promoting effect on propene formation. However, there are still elusive points that need to be addressed in future studies, including the identification of redox cycles on redox-type catalysts and the clarification of key intermediates and dominating reaction paths by taking the entire reaction network of CO2ODHP into consideration. There is a competitive adsorption between CO2, propane, and propene, which impacts the propane adsorption and propene yield. Rapid deactivation occurs in CO2ODHP due to the reduction of active sites and coke formation. VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported to be the most superior catalysts for N2OODHP, but deactivation and regeneration of catalysts in N2OODHP remain a challenge. The introduction of exogenous mild oxidizers is a potentially selective route for DHP, with catalytic oxyhalogenation showing promising results for single-step propene production. Gaseous sulfur compounds act as effective DHP mediators due to their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule. However, the exact nature of the active sites is still unclear due to the lack of catalyst characterization and mechanistic studies. To overcome these hurdles, significant efforts should be devoted to developing a sufficiently active and stable catalyst with an in-depth understanding of the structure-activity relationship and reaction kinetics.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)方面的进展已经得到了广泛的研究，主要集中在过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物上。这些催化剂已被用于研究与CO2、N2O、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物等软氧化剂的ODHP反应。研究面临独特的挑战，包括反应的固有性质差异和腐蚀性处理的困难。未来的研究方向包括设计能够促进丙烷中CH键活化并具有良好再生性的催化剂，以及改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程。在研究的催化剂中，CrOx作为一种还原型催化剂，在高丙烷转化率下显示出更高的丙烯选择性。另一种还原型催化剂VOx在低转化率下实现了高丙烯选择性，但尚未达到高丙烷转化率。Ga2O3，一种非还原型催化剂，在40%以下的转化率下显示出与CrOx相当的选择性。尽管Ga2O3在接触C3H8分子时可以被还原，但其氧化态在反应过程中保持稳定。CO2的存在对丙烯的形成有总体的促进作用。然而，未来的研究中仍需解决一些问题，包括识别还原型催化剂上的还原循环，以及通过实验和计算方法识别每个反应的中间体和可能的反应路径。CO2、丙烷和丙烯之间存在竞争吸附，这影响了丙烷的吸附和丙烯的产率。在CO2ODHP中，由于活性位点的还原和焦炭的形成，快速失活发生。VOx和含铁沸石被报道为N2OODHP中最优秀的催化剂，但N2OODHP中催化剂的失活和再生仍然是一个挑战。引入外源性温和氧化剂是DHP的一种潜在选择性途径，催化氧卤化是一种有希望的单步丙烯生产途径，产量可达55%。另一方面，气态硫化合物由于其对从烃类分子中提取氢的高亲和力，作为有效的DHP介质。然而，由于缺乏到目前为止的催化剂表征和机理研究，活性位点的确切性质仍然不清楚。为了克服上述障碍，应致力于开发具有足够活性和稳定性的催化剂，并深入理解结构-活性关系以及反应动力学。
