[1] "Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts are reviewed in this work."
[2] "In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides."
[3] "For CO2- and N2OODHP, the explored catalyst systems are analogous. However, differences in inherent properties of reactions and difficulties in dealing with corrosiveness have led to complications in advancing the research, resulting in unique challenges and future research directions for each route."

[5] "Major positive roles of CO2 include: (i) completing redox cycles, though the oxidation potential is weak, (ii) shifting the reaction equilibrium of ODHP to the product side by consuming the produced H2 via RWGS, and (iii) serving as an agent for coke removal by the reverse Boudouard reaction."

[9] "Catalytic oxyhalogenation is a promising route for single-step C3H6 production and yields of up to 55% have been achieved."
[10] "The gaseous sulfur compounds, on the other hand, act as effective DHP mediators because of their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule."
[11] "However, the susceptibility of the material to be attacked by sulfur, halogens, HX, and halogenated products requires testing of materials under actual reaction conditions."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been reviewed, focusing on the performance of various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for ODHP with soft oxidants such as CO2, N2O, sulfur-containing compounds, and halogen/halides. Challenges in this field include dealing with corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, which have complicated research advancement. Future research should focus on designing catalysts that can activate the CH bond in propane with good regenerability and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. CO2 plays a significant role in completing redox cycles, shifting the reaction equilibrium, and serving as an agent for coke removal. However, rapid deactivation due to reduction of active sites and coke formation is a major issue. Similar challenges exist for N2OODHP. The introduction of exogenous mild oxidizers, such as in catalytic oxyhalogenation, offers a promising route for single-step C3H6 production. Gaseous sulfur compounds have also shown potential as effective DHP mediators. However, materials must be tested under actual reaction conditions due to their susceptibility to attack by sulfur, halogens, and halogenated products. Efforts to develop active and stable catalysts with an understanding of structure-activity relationships and reaction kinetics are ongoing. Theoretical studies are needed to guide experimental efforts, especially in finding catalysts suitable for corrosive or less-studied oxidants. Alternative technologies, such as chemical looping and membrane reactors, are also being developed to enhance ODHP processes.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)方面的进展已经进行了回顾，重点关注了各种催化剂系统的性能。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素的金属氧化物已被广泛研究用于与软氧化剂如二氧化碳(CO2)、一氧化二氮(N2O)、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物的ODHP反应。该领域面临的挑战包括处理腐蚀性和固有的反应性质，这些性质已经使研究进展复杂化。未来的研究应集中在设计能够激活丙烷中CH键并具有良好再生性的催化剂，以及优化ODHP过程的反应系统改造上。二氧化碳在完成氧化还原循环、转移反应平衡和作为焦炭去除的媒介方面起着重要作用。然而，由于活性位点的还原和焦炭形成，快速失活是一个主要问题。N2OODHP也存在类似挑战。引入外源性温和氧化剂，如在催化氧卤化中，为单步C3H6生产提供了一条有希望的途径。气态硫化合物也被证明是有效的DHP媒介，因为它们对从烃类分子中提取氢具有高亲和力。然而，由于材料容易受到硫、卤素、HX和卤化产物的攻击，需要在实际反应条件下测试材料。为了应对上述障碍，应致力于开发足够活性和稳定的催化剂，深入理解结构-活性关系以及反应动力学。总之，这些领域的额外理论研究将对推动该领域的发展和指导实验工作非常有益，特别是在寻找适合腐蚀性或研究较少的氧化剂(如NOx、SOx和卤化物)的催化剂方面。此外，还致力于开发超出填充催化剂床的替代技术，如化学循环和膜反应器。
