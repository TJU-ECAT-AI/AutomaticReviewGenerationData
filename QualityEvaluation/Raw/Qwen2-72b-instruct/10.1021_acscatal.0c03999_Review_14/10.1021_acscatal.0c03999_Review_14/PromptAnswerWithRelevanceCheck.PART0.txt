Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been reviewed, focusing on the performance of various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for ODHP with soft oxidants such as CO2, N2O, sulfur-containing compounds, and halogen/halides. Challenges in this field include dealing with corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, which have complicated research advancement. Future research should focus on designing catalysts that can activate the CH bond in propane with good regenerability and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. CO2 plays a significant role in completing redox cycles, shifting the reaction equilibrium, and serving as an agent for coke removal. However, rapid deactivation due to reduction of active sites and coke formation is a major issue. Similar challenges exist for N2OODHP. The introduction of exogenous mild oxidizers, such as in catalytic oxyhalogenation, offers a promising route for single-step C3H6 production. Gaseous sulfur compounds have also shown potential as effective DHP mediators. However, materials must be tested under actual reaction conditions due to their susceptibility to attack by sulfur, halogens, and halogenated products. Efforts to develop active and stable catalysts with an understanding of structure-activity relationships and reaction kinetics are ongoing. Theoretical studies are needed to guide experimental efforts, especially in finding catalysts suitable for corrosive or less-studied oxidants. Alternative technologies, such as chemical looping and membrane reactors, are also being developed to enhance ODHP processes.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)方面的进展已经进行了回顾，重点关注了各种催化剂系统的性能。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素的金属氧化物已被广泛研究用于与软氧化剂如二氧化碳(CO2)、一氧化二氮(N2O)、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物的ODHP反应。该领域面临的挑战包括处理腐蚀性和固有的反应性质，这些性质已经使研究进展复杂化。未来的研究应集中在设计能够激活丙烷中CH键并具有良好再生性的催化剂，以及优化ODHP过程的反应系统改造上。二氧化碳在完成氧化还原循环、转移反应平衡和作为焦炭去除的媒介方面起着重要作用。然而，由于活性位点的还原和焦炭形成，快速失活是一个主要问题。N2OODHP也存在类似挑战。引入外源性温和氧化剂，如在催化氧卤化中，为单步C3H6生产提供了一条有希望的途径。气态硫化合物也被证明是有效的DHP媒介，因为它们对从烃类分子中提取氢具有高亲和力。然而，由于材料容易受到硫、卤素、HX和卤化产物的攻击，需要在实际反应条件下测试材料。为了应对上述障碍，应致力于开发足够活性和稳定的催化剂，深入理解结构-活性关系以及反应动力学。总之，这些领域的额外理论研究将对推动该领域的发展和指导实验工作非常有益，特别是在寻找适合腐蚀性或研究较少的氧化剂(如NOx、SOx和卤化物)的催化剂方面。此外，还致力于开发超出填充催化剂床的替代技术，如化学循环和膜反应器。

[5] "CO2ODHP, the major efforts have been devoted toward exploring redox-type and nonredox-type catalysts and developing compositionstructurecatalysis relationship."
[6] "As a representative of redox-type catalysts, CrOx exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion among all catalysts at 550 C, as presented in Figure 32A."
[7] "The catalytic performance of other redox-type catalysts, VOx, has not yet reached high C3H8 conversion at 550 C (i.e., >20%), though high C3H6 selectivity (i.e., 95%98%) is achieved at low conversion (Figure 32A)."
[8] "The non-redox-type catalyst, Ga2O3, shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion."
[9] "Although Ga2O3 can be reduced upon contact with C3H8 molecules, its oxidation state remains stable during reaction."
[10] "Instead, the reaction appears to proceed through the proposed heterolytic dissociation mechanism."
[11] "Combined with these developed redox- and nonredox-type catalysts, the zeolite-supported counterparts are also promising candidates (Figure 32A)."
[12] "Other catalysts that have been explored include Fe, precious metal, Mo2C, and Ni catalysts."
[13] "Screening tests and mechanistic studies on these materials shed light on their roles in the selective activation of the CH bond."
[14] "For example, the Mo oxycarbide, formed through CO2-induced oxidation of Mo2C, favors the activation of methylene CH bond in C3H8 molecules."

[20] "Besides, side reactions are involved in addition to CO2ODHP reaction, such as RWGS and reverse Boudouard reaction."
[21] "Continuous efforts have been put forth to identify the intermediates and plausible reaction paths of each reaction by both experimental and computational approaches."
[22] "However, there is a lack of studies in clarifying the key intermediates and dominating reaction paths by taking the entire reaction network of CO2ODHP into consideration."
[23] "In particular, this requires a sufficient amount of in situ characterization techniques to fill the gap."
[24] "There is a competitive adsorption between these molecules, which impacts the C3H8 adsorption and C3H6 yield."
[25] "Dopants that enable the balance between C3H8 and CO2 adsorption and inhibition of strong C3H6 adsorption are desired."
[26] "For CO2ODHP, rapid deactivation occurs as a consequence of reduction of active sites and coke formation."
[27] "Although catalyst stability and regenerability have been examined, testing of long-term stability is rather scarce, nor have regeneration guidelines been comprehensively covered for different catalyst systems."
[28] "Therefore, endeavors should be made in developing robust, coke-resistant catalysts that meet the requirement of practical implementation in the mid to long-term."
[29] "VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported to be the most superior catalysts for N2OODHP (Figure 32B)."
[30] "Because of the absence of thermodynamic restraints, these Fe-containing zeolite catalysts show activity at a relatively lower temperature of 400 C."
[31] "Notwithstanding, potential catalysts that have been tested for N2OODHP are still scarce, and more catalyst screening is needed in future studies."
[32] "For example, there are only a few works regarding metals other than iron-supported/modified zeolites which have been reported."
[33] "Also, while there are multiple reports regarding MFI and BEA zeolite topology for N2OODHP, the effects of other zeolite topologies remain unknown."
[34] "Similar to CO2ODHP, deactivation and regeneration of catalysts in N2OODHP remains a challenge."
[35] "As discussed in section 3.5.3, CO2 can serve as an agent for coke removal, thereby enhancing the catalyst stability, while N2O cannot."
[36] "Together with the variation in oxidation potential between N2O and CO2, these are likely the reasons why similar catalysts show worse stability in N2OODHP."
[37] "Although a few studies have reported the rapid deactivation of iron-containing zeolite catalysts and vanadia oxide-based catalysts for N2OODHP, deactivation studies regarding molybdenum oxide catalysts have been scarcely touched."
[38] "Thus, further study of these catalysts is needed to address the challenges of stability of catalysts for N2OODHP route."
[39] "For iron-containing zeolite catalysts, there have been studies suggesting that the nature and strength of acid sites have significant impacts on the rate of deactivation, implying that catalyst stability can be further improved based on catalyst design."

Transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for ODHP with soft oxidants like CO2, N2O, sulfur compounds, and halogens/halides. The inherent properties of reactions and difficulties in dealing with corrosiveness have led to unique challenges in advancing research for CO2- and N2OODHP. Future efforts should focus on designing catalysts that can activate the CH bond in propane with good regenerability and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.
2.CrOx, as a redox-type catalyst, exhibits higher propylene selectivity at elevated propane conversion among all catalysts at 550°C. VOx, another redox-type catalyst, has not yet reached high propane conversion at 550°C, but it achieves high propylene selectivity at low conversion. Ga2O3, a non-redox-type catalyst, shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion. Zeolite-supported catalysts are also promising candidates.

4.Future studies should address the identification of redox cycles on redox-type catalysts, the reaction mechanisms, competitive adsorption between CO2, propane, and propylene, and catalyst deactivation and regeneration. Efforts should be made to develop robust, coke-resistant catalysts for practical implementation in the mid to long-term.
5.Vanadia oxide (VOx) and Fe-containing zeolites are reported to be the most superior catalysts for N2OODHP. These Fe-containing zeolite catalysts show activity at a relatively lower temperature of 400°C. However, potential catalysts for N2OODHP are still scarce, and more catalyst screening is needed. Deactivation and regeneration of catalysts in N2OODHP remain a challenge, as N2O cannot serve as an agent for coke removal like CO2 can. Further study of molybdenum oxide catalysts is needed to address the challenges of stability for N2OODHP.
6.For iron-containing zeolite catalysts, studies suggest that the nature and strength of acid sites have significant impacts on the rate of deactivation, implying that catalyst stability can be further improved through catalyst design.

2.CrOx作为一种还原型催化剂，在550°C下，与其他所有催化剂相比，在丙烷转化率提高时显示出更高的丙烯选择性。VOx，另一种还原型催化剂，在550°C下尚未达到高丙烷转化率，但在低转化率下实现了高丙烯选择性。Ga2O3，一种非还原型催化剂，在40%以下的转化率下显示出与CrOx相当的选择性。沸石支持的催化剂也是有希望的候选者。其他探索的催化剂包括Fe、贵金属、Mo2C和Ni催化剂。通过CO2诱导氧化Mo2C形成的Mo氧碳化物有利于丙烷分子中亚甲基CH键的激活。
3.CO2的存在对丙烯的形成有整体的促进作用，包括完成还原循环，通过消耗产生的氢气来将ODHP反应的平衡转移到产物侧，以及通过逆Boudouard反应作为焦炭去除的媒介。
4.未来的研究应解决还原型催化剂上的还原循环的识别、反应机制、CO2、丙烷和丙烯之间的竞争吸附以及催化剂失活和再生的问题。应努力开发坚固、抗焦炭的催化剂，以满足中期到长期的实际应用需求。
5.氧化钒(VOx)和含铁沸石被报道为N2OODHP中最优秀的催化剂。这些含铁沸石催化剂在相对较低的400°C温度下显示出活性。然而，用于N2OODHP的潜在催化剂仍然稀缺，需要更多的催化剂筛选。N2OODHP中催化剂的失活和再生仍然是一个挑战，因为N2O不能像CO2那样作为焦炭去除的媒介。需要进一步研究钼氧化物催化剂，以解决N2OODHP的稳定性挑战。
6.对于含铁沸石催化剂，研究表明酸位点的性质和强度对失活速率有重大影响，这意味着可以通过催化剂设计进一步提高催化剂稳定性。

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been extensively studied with a variety of catalysts, including transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements. These catalysts have been explored for reactions with soft oxidants such as CO2, N2O, sulfur-containing compounds, and halogens/halides. Despite the similarities in catalyst systems for CO2- and N2OODHP, inherent differences in reaction properties and the challenge of dealing with corrosiveness have complicated research advancement. Unique challenges and future research directions are identified for each reaction route. Future efforts should focus on designing catalysts that can effectively activate the CH bond in propane while maintaining good regenerability, and on renovating reaction systems to better accommodate industrial processes while addressing the challenges posed by various acid gases. CO2 plays a significant role in ODHP by completing redox cycles, shifting the reaction equilibrium towards product formation, and serving as an agent for coke removal. However, rapid deactivation due to reduction of active sites and coke formation is a major issue in CO2ODHP. Similar challenges exist in N2OODHP, where deactivation and regeneration of catalysts remain problematic. The introduction of exogenous mild oxidizers, such as in catalytic oxyhalogenation, offers a promising route for single-step C3H6 production, achieving yields up to 55%. Gaseous sulfur compounds are also effective mediators for DHP due to their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction. However, the nature of active sites in sulfur-mediated DHP is unclear due to a lack of catalyst characterization and mechanistic studies. To overcome these hurdles, significant efforts should be directed towards developing active and stable catalysts with a deep understanding of structure-activity relationships and reaction kinetics. Theoretical studies have provided insights into mechanistic understanding and catalyst design principles, but more progress is needed in developing better ODHP catalysts. Alternative technologies, such as chemical looping and membrane reactors, are being developed to enhance process efficiency and minimize energy loss.
