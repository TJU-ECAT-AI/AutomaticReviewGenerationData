Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been reviewed, focusing on the performance of various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from main group elements have been extensively studied for ODHP with soft oxidants like CO2, N2O, sulfur compounds, and halogens/halides. Challenges persist due to differences in reaction properties and difficulties in handling corrosiveness, leading to unique challenges for each reaction route. Future research should focus on designing catalysts that can activate the CH bond in propane with good regenerability and renovating reaction systems to optimize processes. CO2 plays a positive role in completing redox cycles, shifting reaction equilibrium, and serving as an agent for coke removal. However, rapid deactivation due to reduction of active sites and coke formation is a significant issue. Similar challenges exist for N2OODHP. The introduction of mild oxidizers is a promising route for DHP, with catalytic oxyhalogenation achieving yields up to 55%. Sulfur compounds are effective mediators due to their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction. However, materials must be tested under actual reaction conditions due to susceptibility to attack by sulfur, halogens, and halogenated products. Theoretical studies have provided insights into mechanistic understanding and catalyst design principles, and alternative technologies like chemical looping and membrane reactors are being developed.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)方面的进展已经进行了回顾，重点关注了各种催化剂系统的性能。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物已被广泛研究用于与CO2、N2O、硫化合物和卤素/卤化物等软氧化剂进行的ODHP。由于反应性质的差异和处理腐蚀性的困难，持续存在独特的挑战，每个反应路线都有其独特的问题。未来的研究应集中在设计能够激活丙烷中CH键并具有良好再生性的催化剂，以及优化过程的反应系统改造上。CO2在完成氧化还原循环、转移反应平衡和作为焦炭去除的媒介方面起着积极作用。然而，由于活性位点的还原和焦炭形成，快速失活是一个重大问题。N2OODHP也存在类似挑战。引入温和氧化剂是DHP的一个有希望的途径，催化氧卤化反应的产率可达55%。另一方面，气态硫化合物由于对从烃类分子中提取氢具有高亲和力，因此是有效的DHP媒介。然而，由于材料容易受到硫、卤素、HX和卤化产物的攻击，需要在实际反应条件下测试材料。尽管在催化剂开发方面仍有重大进展，文献中的理论研究为这个问题提供了有用的见解，涉及机理理解和催化剂设计原则。此外，正在开发诸如化学循环和膜反应器等替代技术。
