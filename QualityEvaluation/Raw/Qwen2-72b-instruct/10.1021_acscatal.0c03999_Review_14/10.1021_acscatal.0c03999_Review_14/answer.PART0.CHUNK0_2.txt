[1] "Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts are reviewed in this work."
[2] "In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides."
[3] "For CO2- and N2OODHP, the explored catalyst systems are analogous. However, differences in inherent properties of reactions and difficulties in dealing with corrosiveness have led to complications in advancing the research, resulting in unique challenges and future research directions for each route."
[4] "In general, future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases."
[5] "CO2ODHP, the major efforts have been devoted toward exploring redox-type and nonredox-type catalysts and developing compositionstructurecatalysis relationship."
[6] "As a representative of redox-type catalysts, CrOx exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion among all catalysts at 550 C, as presented in Figure 32A."
[7] "The catalytic performance of other redox-type catalysts, VOx, has not yet reached high C3H8 conversion at 550 C (i.e., >20%), though high C3H6 selectivity (i.e., 95%98%) is achieved at low conversion (Figure 32A)."
[8] "The non-redox-type catalyst, Ga2O3, shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion."
[9] "Although Ga2O3 can be reduced upon contact with C3H8 molecules, its oxidation state remains stable during reaction."
[10] "Instead, the reaction appears to proceed through the proposed heterolytic dissociation mechanism."
[11] "Combined with these developed redox- and nonredox-type catalysts, the zeolite-supported counterparts are also promising candidates (Figure 32A)."
[12] "Other catalysts that have been explored include Fe, precious metal, Mo2C, and Ni catalysts."
[13] "Screening tests and mechanistic studies on these materials shed light on their roles in the selective activation of the CH bond."
[14] "For example, the Mo oxycarbide, formed through CO2-induced oxidation of Mo2C, favors the activation of methylene CH bond in C3H8 molecules."
[15] "The presence of CO2 shows an overall promoting effect on C3H6 formation."
[16] "Major positive roles of CO2 include: (i) completing redox cycles, though the oxidation potential is weak, (ii) shifting the reaction equilibrium of ODHP to the product side by consuming the produced H2 via RWGS, and (iii) serving as an agent for coke removal by the reverse Boudouard reaction."
[17] "Despite these achievements, there are still elusive points that need to be addressed in future studies:(i) Identification of redox cycles on redox-type catalysts."
[18] "In the case of redox-type catalysts, there exist two different redox scenarios, including Cr6+  Cr3+/Cr2+ and Cr3+  Cr2+, which seems to depend on the nature of the support and metalsupport interactions."
[19] "Such divergence necessitates the efforts to develop an in-depth understanding of the correlations."
[20] "Besides, side reactions are involved in addition to CO2ODHP reaction, such as RWGS and reverse Boudouard reaction."
[21] "Continuous efforts have been put forth to identify the intermediates and plausible reaction paths of each reaction by both experimental and computational approaches."
[22] "However, there is a lack of studies in clarifying the key intermediates and dominating reaction paths by taking the entire reaction network of CO2ODHP into consideration."
[23] "In particular, this requires a sufficient amount of in situ characterization techniques to fill the gap."
[24] "There is a competitive adsorption between these molecules, which impacts the C3H8 adsorption and C3H6 yield."
[25] "Dopants that enable the balance between C3H8 and CO2 adsorption and inhibition of strong C3H6 adsorption are desired."
[26] "For CO2ODHP, rapid deactivation occurs as a consequence of reduction of active sites and coke formation."
[27] "Although catalyst stability and regenerability have been examined, testing of long-term stability is rather scarce, nor have regeneration guidelines been comprehensively covered for different catalyst systems."
[28] "Therefore, endeavors should be made in developing robust, coke-resistant catalysts that meet the requirement of practical implementation in the mid to long-term."
[29] "VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported to be the most superior catalysts for N2OODHP (Figure 32B)."
[30] "Because of the absence of thermodynamic restraints, these Fe-containing zeolite catalysts show activity at a relatively lower temperature of 400 C."
[31] "Notwithstanding, potential catalysts that have been tested for N2OODHP are still scarce, and more catalyst screening is needed in future studies."
[32] "For example, there are only a few works regarding metals other than iron-supported/modified zeolites which have been reported."
[33] "Also, while there are multiple reports regarding MFI and BEA zeolite topology for N2OODHP, the effects of other zeolite topologies remain unknown."
[34] "Similar to CO2ODHP, deactivation and regeneration of catalysts in N2OODHP remains a challenge."
[35] "As discussed in section 3.5.3, CO2 can serve as an agent for coke removal, thereby enhancing the catalyst stability, while N2O cannot."
[36] "Together with the variation in oxidation potential between N2O and CO2, these are likely the reasons why similar catalysts show worse stability in N2OODHP."
[37] "Although a few studies have reported the rapid deactivation of iron-containing zeolite catalysts and vanadia oxide-based catalysts for N2OODHP, deactivation studies regarding molybdenum oxide catalysts have been scarcely touched."
[38] "Thus, further study of these catalysts is needed to address the challenges of stability of catalysts for N2OODHP route."
[39] "For iron-containing zeolite catalysts, there have been studies suggesting that the nature and strength of acid sites have significant impacts on the rate of deactivation, implying that catalyst stability can be further improved based on catalyst design."

1.Recent progress in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants has been reviewed, focusing on the performance of various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for ODHP with soft oxidants like CO2, N2O, sulfur compounds, and halogens/halides. The inherent properties of reactions and difficulties in dealing with corrosiveness have led to unique challenges in advancing research for CO2- and N2OODHP. Future efforts should focus on designing catalysts that can activate the CH bond in propane with good regenerability and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.
2.CrOx, as a redox-type catalyst, exhibits higher propylene selectivity at elevated propane conversion among all catalysts at 550°C. VOx, another redox-type catalyst, has not yet reached high propane conversion at 550°C, but it achieves high propylene selectivity at low conversion. Ga2O3, a non-redox-type catalyst, shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion. Zeolite-supported catalysts are also promising candidates. Other explored catalysts include Fe, precious metal, Mo2C, and Ni catalysts. The Mo oxycarbide, formed through CO2-induced oxidation of Mo2C, favors the activation of the methylene CH bond in propane molecules.
3.The presence of CO2 has an overall promoting effect on propylene formation, including completing redox cycles, shifting the reaction equilibrium of ODHP to the product side by consuming the produced hydrogen via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, and serving as an agent for coke removal by the reverse Boudouard reaction.
4.Future studies should address the identification of redox cycles on redox-type catalysts, the reaction mechanisms, competitive adsorption between CO2, propane, and propylene, and catalyst deactivation and regeneration.

5.Vanadia oxide (VOx) and Fe-containing zeolites are reported to be the most superior catalysts for N2OODHP. These Fe-containing zeolite catalysts show activity at a relatively lower temperature of 400°C. However, potential catalysts for N2OODHP are still scarce, and more catalyst screening is needed. Deactivation and regeneration of catalysts in N2OODHP remain a challenge, as N2O cannot serve as an agent for coke removal like CO2 can. Further study of molybdenum oxide catalysts is needed to address the challenges of stability for N2OODHP.
6.For iron-containing zeolite catalysts, studies suggest that the nature and strength of acid sites have significant impacts on the rate of deactivation, implying that catalyst stability can be further improved through catalyst design.

1.最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)方面的进展已经进行了回顾，重点关注了各种催化剂系统的性能。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物已被广泛研究用于与软氧化剂如CO2、N2O、硫化合物和卤素/卤化物的ODHP反应。反应的内在性质和处理腐蚀性的困难导致了CO2-和N2OODHP研究进展的独特挑战。未来的工作应集中在设计能够激活丙烷中CH键并具有良好再生性的催化剂，以及改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程。
2.CrOx作为一种还原型催化剂，在550°C下，与其他所有催化剂相比，在丙烷转化率提高时显示出更高的丙烯选择性。VOx，另一种还原型催化剂，在550°C下尚未达到高丙烷转化率，但在低转化率下实现了高丙烯选择性。Ga2O3，一种非还原型催化剂，在40%以下的转化率下显示出与CrOx相当的选择性。沸石支持的催化剂也是有希望的候选者。其他探索的催化剂包括Fe、贵金属、Mo2C和Ni催化剂。通过CO2诱导氧化Mo2C形成的Mo氧碳化物有利于丙烷分子中亚甲基CH键的激活。
3.CO2的存在对丙烯的形成有整体的促进作用，包括完成还原循环，通过消耗产生的氢气来将ODHP反应的平衡转移到产物侧，以及通过逆Boudouard反应作为焦炭去除的媒介。
4.未来的研究应解决还原型催化剂上的还原循环的识别、反应机制、CO2、丙烷和丙烯之间的竞争吸附以及催化剂失活和再生的问题。应努力开发坚固、抗焦炭的催化剂，以满足中期到长期的实际应用需求。
5.氧化钒(VOx)和含铁沸石被报道为N2OODHP中最优秀的催化剂。这些含铁沸石催化剂在相对较低的400°C温度下显示出活性。然而，用于N2OODHP的潜在催化剂仍然稀缺，需要更多的催化剂筛选。N2OODHP中催化剂的失活和再生仍然是一个挑战，因为N2O不能像CO2那样作为焦炭去除的媒介。需要进一步研究钼氧化物催化剂，以解决N2OODHP的稳定性挑战。
6.对于含铁沸石催化剂，研究表明酸位点的性质和强度对失活速率有重大影响，这意味着可以通过催化剂设计进一步提高催化剂稳定性。
