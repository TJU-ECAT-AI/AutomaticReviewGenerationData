          [1] "Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts are reviewed in this work."
          [2] "In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides."
          [3] "For CO2- and N2OODHP, the explored catalyst systems are analogous. However, differences in inherent properties of reactions and difficulties in dealing with corrosiveness have led to complications in advancing the research, resulting in unique challenges and future research directions for each route."
          [4] "In general, future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases."
          [5] "Major positive roles of CO2 include: (i) completing redox cycles, though the oxidation potential is weak, (ii) shifting the reaction equilibrium of ODHP to the product side by consuming the produced H2 via RWGS, and (iii) serving as an agent for coke removal by the reverse Boudouard reaction."
          [6] "For CO2ODHP, rapid deactivation occurs as a consequence of reduction of active sites and coke formation."
          [7] "Similar to CO2ODHP, deactivation and regeneration of catalysts in N2OODHP remains a challenge."
          [8] "The introduction of exogenous mild oxidizers is a potentially selective route for DHP."
          [9] "Catalytic oxyhalogenation is a promising route for single-step C3H6 production and yields of up to 55% have been achieved."
          [10] "The gaseous sulfur compounds, on the other hand, act as effective DHP mediators because of their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule."
          [11] "However, the exact nature of the active sites is still unclear from the studies to date because of the lack of catalyst characterization and mechanistic studies."
          [12] "To deal with the above-mentioned hurdles, significant endeavors should be devoted to developing a sufficiently active and stable catalyst with an in-depth understanding of the structureactivity relationship, as well as reaction kinetics."
          [13] "While there is still significant progress to be made in the development of better ODHP catalysts, theoretical studies in the literature have provided useful insights toward this problem with regards to mechanistic understanding and catalyst design principles."
          [14] "Efforts are also devoted to developing alternative technologies beyond packed catalyst bed, such as chemical looping and membrane reactor."

          Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been extensively studied with a variety of catalysts, including transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements. These catalysts have been explored for reactions with soft oxidants such as CO2, N2O, sulfur-containing compounds, and halogens/halides. Despite the similarities in catalyst systems for CO2- and N2OODHP, inherent differences in reaction properties and the challenge of dealing with corrosiveness have complicated research advancement. Unique challenges and future research directions are identified for each reaction route. Future efforts should focus on designing catalysts that can effectively activate the CH bond in propane while maintaining good regenerability, and on renovating reaction systems to better accommodate industrial processes while addressing the challenges posed by various acid gases. CO2 plays a significant role in ODHP by completing redox cycles, shifting the reaction equilibrium towards product formation, and serving as an agent for coke removal. However, rapid deactivation due to reduction of active sites and coke formation is a major issue in CO2ODHP. Similar challenges exist in N2OODHP, where deactivation and regeneration of catalysts remain problematic. The introduction of exogenous mild oxidizers, such as in catalytic oxyhalogenation, offers a promising route for single-step C3H6 production, achieving yields up to 55%. Gaseous sulfur compounds are also effective mediators for DHP due to their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction. However, the nature of active sites in sulfur-mediated DHP is unclear due to a lack of catalyst characterization and mechanistic studies. To overcome these hurdles, significant efforts should be directed towards developing active and stable catalysts with a deep understanding of structure-activity relationships and reaction kinetics. Theoretical studies have provided insights into mechanistic understanding and catalyst design principles, but more progress is needed in developing better ODHP catalysts. Alternative technologies, such as chemical looping and membrane reactors, are being developed to enhance process efficiency and minimize energy loss.

          最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的进展中，已经广泛研究了包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在内的各种催化剂。这些催化剂已被用于与CO2、N2O、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物等软氧化剂的反应。尽管CO2-和N2OODHP的催化剂系统相似，但反应的固有差异和处理腐蚀性的困难已经使研究进展复杂化。为每种反应路线确定了独特的挑战和未来的研究方向。未来的工作应集中在设计能够有效激活丙烷中的CH键同时保持良好再生性的催化剂，以及改造反应系统，以更好地适应工业过程，同时解决各种酸性气体带来的挑战。CO2在ODHP中起着重要作用，通过完成氧化还原循环、将反应平衡向产物侧转移以及作为焦炭去除的媒介。然而，在CO2ODHP中，由于活性位点的还原和焦炭形成，快速失活是一个主要问题。N2OODHP中也存在类似的催化剂失活和再生问题。通过引入外源性温和氧化剂，如在催化氧卤化中，为单步C3H6生产提供了一条有希望的途径，实现了高达55%的产率。另一方面，气态硫化合物由于对烃类分子的氢原子具有高亲和力，作为有效的DHP媒介。然而，由于缺乏催化剂表征和机理研究，到目前为止，硫介导DHP中活性位点的确切性质仍然不清楚。为了克服这些障碍，应投入大量努力开发具有活性和稳定性的催化剂，同时对结构-活性关系和反应动力学有深入的了解。理论研究为机理理解和催化剂设计原则提供了见解，但在开发更好的ODHP催化剂方面仍需取得更多进展。正在开发化学循环和膜反应器等替代技术，以提高过程效率并最大限度地减少能量损失。
