Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

1.Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

The provided literature does not contain information about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, catalyst systems, selectivity, conversion, challenges, or future research and development strategies. Therefore, I cannot answer this question based on the given literature.

1.分析使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展，比较各种催化剂系统(包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物)在选择性和转化率方面的性能。此外，讨论该领域持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性和固有反应性质，并详细阐述未来研究和发展的关键领域，包括改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程的策略。

提供的文献没有关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)、催化剂系统、选择性、转化率、挑战或未来研究和发展策略的信息。因此，我不能根据所提供的文献回答这个问题。
