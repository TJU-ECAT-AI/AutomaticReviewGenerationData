[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."
[2] "To understand the origins of the novel catalytic properties, bimetallic surfaces have also gained a considerable amount of interest for fundamental surface science research."
[3] "The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime."
[4] "There are two critical factors that contribute to the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of a metal in a bimetallic surface."
[5] "First, the formation of heteroatom bonds changes the electronic environment of the metal surface, giving rise to modifications of its electronic structure through the ligand effect."
[6] "Second, the geometry of the bimetallic structure is typically different from that of the parent metals, e.g., the average metalmetal bond lengths change, resulting in the strain effect that is known to modify the electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital overlap."
[7] "In the past decade there have been significant efforts in density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) experiments on bimetallic surfaces."
[8] "One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with the surface to produce intermixed bimetallic surfaces."
[9] "DFT modeling results clearly indicate that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures."
[10] "Surface science results, using several probe molecules, also confirm the different chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces with surface monolayer and subsurface monolayer structures."
[11] "In addition, the combination of DFT modeling and experimental results reveal a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various bimetallic structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties."
[12] "Although studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insight into the novel catalytic properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst the active metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support."
[13] "The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions."
[14] "In particular, we will attempt to bridge the materials gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts and the pressure gap between UHV environment and reaction environment."

1.Bimetallic catalysts gained commercial interest in the 1960s for their unique activities in hydrocarbon reforming. The novel catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces have been the focus of fundamental surface science research. The modification effect is significant when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime. Two critical factors contribute to the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of a metal in a bimetallic surface: the formation of heteroatom bonds changes the electronic environment through the ligand effect, and the geometry of the bimetallic structure is typically different from that of the parent metals, resulting in the strain effect. In the past decade, significant efforts have been made in DFT calculations and UHV experiments on bimetallic surfaces. The monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of three structures: surface monolayer, subsurface monolayer, and intermixed bimetallic surfaces. DFT modeling results show that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures. Surface science results confirm the different chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces with surface monolayer and subsurface monolayer structures. The combination of DFT modeling and experimental results reveals a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various bimetallic structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties. Although studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insight, in industrially relevant supported catalysts, the active metal is present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support. The current review aims to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions, attempting to bridge the materials gap and the pressure gap between UHV environment and reaction environment.

1.双金属催化剂在20世纪60年代因其在烃类重整中独特的活性而获得了商业上的关注。双金属表面的新型催化性质一直是基础表面科学研究的重点。当吸附金属覆盖度在亚单层到单层范围内时，修改效应尤为重要。两个关键因素导致了双金属表面中金属电子和化学性质的改变：异原子键的形成通过配位效应改变了金属表面的电子环境，双金属结构的几何形状通常与母体金属不同，导致应变效应。在过去十年中，对双金属表面的DFT计算和UHV实验投入了大量努力。单层吸附金属可以与主体金属基底以三种结构之一相互作用：表面单层、次表面单层和混合双金属表面。DFT建模结果显示，三种类型的双金属结构对表面d带中心的修改有显著差异。表面科学结果证实了具有表面单层和次表面单层结构的双金属表面具有不同的化学性质。DFT建模和实验结果的结合揭示了表面d带中心位置与各种双金属结构的吸附能之间存在一般相关性，这使得预测具有理想化学性质的双金属结构成为可能。尽管对模型双金属表面的研究提供了基本的见解，但在工业相关的支撑催化剂中，活性金属以高表面积支撑上的纳米颗粒形式存在。当前的综述旨在为几种类型的催化反应提供模型表面和支撑催化剂之间的相关性，试图弥合模型表面和支撑催化剂之间的材料差距以及UHV环境和反应环境之间的压力差距。
