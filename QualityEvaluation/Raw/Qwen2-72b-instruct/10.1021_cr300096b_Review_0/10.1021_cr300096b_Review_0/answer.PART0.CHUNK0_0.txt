[1] "Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinct from those of their parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability."
[2] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."
[3] "The findings of these unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have inspired many extensive investigations on their possible applications."
[4] "Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalytic and electrocatalytic applications."
[5] "To understand the origins of the novel catalytic properties, bimetallic surfaces have also gained a considerable amount of interest for fundamental surface science research."
[6] "The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime."
[7] "There are two critical factors that contribute to the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of a metal in a bimetallic surface. First, the formation of heteroatom bonds changes the electronic environment of the metal surface, giving rise to modifications of its electronic structure through the ligand effect. Second, the geometry of the bimetallic structure is typically different from that of the parent metals, e.g., the average metalmetal bond lengths change, resulting in the strain effect that is known to modify the electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital overlap."
[8] "In the past decade there have been significant efforts in density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) experiments on bimetallic surfaces."
[9] "DFT modeling results clearly indicate that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures."
[10] "Surface science results, using several probe molecules, also confirm the different chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces with surface monolayer and subsurface monolayer structures."
[11] "In addition, the combination of DFT modeling and experimental results reveal a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various bimetallic structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties."
[12] "Although studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insight into the novel catalytic properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst the active metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support."
[13] "The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions."
[14] "We will utilize successful examples, such as hydrogenation reactions, to demonstrate the feasibility of bridging the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and real-world catalysis."
[15] "We will also use other reactions to point out the challenges in applying fundamental surface science studies to predict stable bimetallic structures for catalysis."

1.Bimetallic catalysts, with distinct electronic and chemical properties from their parent metals, have evolved since the 1960s, gaining commercial interest for their unique activities in hydrocarbon reforming. These catalysts have inspired extensive research into their applications and are now widely used in catalytic and electrocatalytic processes. The modification of electronic and chemical properties is significant when admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime, influenced by the formation of heteroatom bonds and changes in metal-metal bond lengths. DFT calculations and UHV experiments have revealed that the surface d-band center modification is different for various bimetallic structures, and there is a correlation between the d-band center position and adsorption energy. These findings help in predicting bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties. Bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts is the primary objective of recent research, utilizing successful examples like hydrogenation reactions to demonstrate the feasibility of this transition. Challenges in applying fundamental surface science studies to predict stable bimetallic structures for catalysis are also highlighted through other reactions.

1.双金属催化剂自20世纪60年代以来，由于其在烃类重整中独特的活性，获得了商业上的关注，其电子和化学性质与母体金属不同，这些催化剂激发了对其应用的广泛研究，现在广泛应用于催化和电催化过程。当吸附金属覆盖度在亚单层到单层范围内时，电子和化学性质的修改是显著的，受到异原子键形成和金属-金属键长变化的影响。DFT计算和UHV实验揭示了不同双金属结构的表面d带中心的修改是不同的，d带中心位置和吸附能之间存在相关性。这些发现有助于预测具有理想化学性质的双金属结构。最近的研究的主要目标是弥合模型表面和工业相关的支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”，利用成功的例子，如氢化反应，来证明这种过渡的可行性。通过其他反应也突出了将基础表面科学研究应用于预测催化用稳定双金属结构的挑战。
