[1] "Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinct from those of their parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability."
[2] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."
[3] "The findings of these unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have inspired many extensive investigations on their possible applications."
[4] "Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalytic and electrocatalytic applications."
[5] "To understand the origins of the novel catalytic properties, bimetallic surfaces have also gained a considerable amount of interest for fundamental surface science research."
[6] "There are two critical factors that contribute to the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of a metal in a bimetallic surface. First, the formation of heteroatom bonds changes the electronic environment of the metal surface, giving rise to modifications of its electronic structure through the ligand effect. Second, the geometry of the bimetallic structure is typically different from that of the parent metals, e.g., the average metalmetal bond lengths change, resulting in the strain effect that is known to modify the electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital overlap."
[7] "In the past decade there have been significant efforts in density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) experiments on bimetallic surfaces."
[8] "DFT modeling results clearly indicate that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures."
[9] "Surface science results, using several probe molecules, also confirm the different chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces with surface monolayer and subsurface monolayer structures."
[10] "In addition, the combination of DFT modeling and experimental results reveal a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various bimetallic structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties."
[11] "Although studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insight into the novel catalytic properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst the active metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support."
[12] "The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions."
[13] "We will utilize successful examples, such as hydrogenation reactions, to demonstrate the feasibility of bridging the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and real-world catalysis."
[14] "We will also use other reactions to point out the challenges in applying fundamental surface science studies to predict stable bimetallic structures for catalysis."

Bimetallic catalysts, with their unique electronic and chemical properties, have evolved significantly since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. These catalysts display activities distinct from monometallic catalysts, leading to enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability. The unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have spurred extensive research into their potential applications. Today, they are widely used in catalytic and electrocatalytic processes. Fundamental surface science research has been conducted to understand the origins of these novel catalytic properties, focusing on the modification of electronic and chemical properties through the formation of heteroatom bonds and changes in geometry. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) experiments have revealed that the surface d-band center modification is significantly different for various bimetallic structures, allowing for the prediction of structures with desirable chemical properties. The review aims to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts by correlating model surfaces with supported catalysts for various catalytic reactions, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach through hydrogenation reactions and highlighting the challenges in predicting stable bimetallic structures for catalysis.
