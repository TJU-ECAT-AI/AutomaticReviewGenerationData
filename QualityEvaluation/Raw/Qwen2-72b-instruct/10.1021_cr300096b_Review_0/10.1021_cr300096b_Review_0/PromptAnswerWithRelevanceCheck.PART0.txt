[2] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."

[6] "The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime."
[7] "There are two critical factors that contribute to the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of a metal in a bimetallic surface. First, the formation of heteroatom bonds changes the electronic environment of the metal surface, giving rise to modifications of its electronic structure through the ligand effect. Second, the geometry of the bimetallic structure is typically different from that of the parent metals, e.g., the average metalmetal bond lengths change, resulting in the strain effect that is known to modify the electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital overlap."

1.Bimetallic catalysts, with distinct electronic and chemical properties from their parent metals, have evolved since the 1960s, gaining commercial interest for their unique activities in hydrocarbon reforming. These catalysts have inspired extensive research into their applications and are now widely used in catalytic and electrocatalytic processes. The modification of electronic and chemical properties is significant when admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime, influenced by the formation of heteroatom bonds and changes in metal-metal bond lengths. DFT calculations and UHV experiments have revealed that the surface d-band center modification is different for various bimetallic structures, and there is a correlation between the d-band center position and adsorption energy. These findings help in predicting bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties. Bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts is the primary objective of recent research, utilizing successful examples like hydrogenation reactions to demonstrate the feasibility of this transition. Challenges in applying fundamental surface science studies to predict stable bimetallic structures for catalysis are also highlighted through other reactions.

Bimetallic catalysts, with their unique electronic and chemical properties, have evolved significantly since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. These catalysts display activities distinct from monometallic catalysts, leading to enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability. The unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have spurred extensive research into their potential applications. Today, they are widely used in catalytic and electrocatalytic processes. Fundamental surface science research has been conducted to understand the origins of these novel catalytic properties, focusing on the modification of electronic and chemical properties through the formation of heteroatom bonds and changes in geometry. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) experiments have revealed that the surface d-band center modification is significantly different for various bimetallic structures, allowing for the prediction of structures with desirable chemical properties. The review aims to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts by correlating model surfaces with supported catalysts for various catalytic reactions, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach through hydrogenation reactions and highlighting the challenges in predicting stable bimetallic structures for catalysis.
