[1] "Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinct from those of their parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability."
[2] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."
[3] "The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions."
[4] "In particular, we will attempt to bridge the materials gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts and the pressure gap between UHV environment and reaction environment."
[5] "We will utilize successful examples, such as hydrogenation reactions, to demonstrate the feasibility of bridging the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and real-world catalysis."
[6] "We will also use other reactions to point out the challenges in applying fundamental surface science studies to predict stable bimetallic structures for catalysis."

1.Bimetallic catalysts, with unique electronic and chemical properties, have evolved since the 1960s, initially gaining commercial interest for hydrocarbon reforming due to their distinct activities compared to monometallic catalysts. The review aims to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" by correlating model surfaces with supported catalysts for various catalytic reactions, using hydrogenation reactions as a successful example. However, it also highlights the challenges in applying fundamental surface science to predict stable bimetallic structures for catalysis.

1.双金属催化剂因其独特的电子和化学性质，自20世纪60年代以来不断发展，最初在烃类重整中获得商业关注，因为它们的活性与单金属催化剂不同。该综述旨在通过将模型表面与各种催化反应中的支撑催化剂相关联，来弥合“材料差距”和“压力差距”，并以氢化反应作为成功案例。然而，它也指出了将基础表面科学应用于预测催化作用下稳定双金属结构的挑战。
