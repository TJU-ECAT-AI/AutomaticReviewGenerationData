Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important. Our group reported a rational strategy for fabricating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through the one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes. The one-step synthetic method was achieved by exposing a mixture of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to the reducing agent NH3BH3 simultaneously, where Co2+ cannot be reduced while Au NPs can be formed first by reduction of Au3+ with NH3BH3 and then act as a catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 to afford active H species. The pre-formed Au NPs served as the in situ seeds and the produced active H species reduced Co2+ for the successive growth of outer Co shells (Scheme 2). Therefore, the basic concept of this one-step synthesis of the Au@Co coreshell NPs is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts (ECo2+/Co = 0.28 eV vs.SHE; EAu3+/Au+ = 0.93 eV vs.SHE), where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential. It is worthy to note here that use of a strong reducing agent (for example, NaBH4) will result in the formation of alloy NPs whereas use of a very weak reducing agent (for example, alcohol) cannot yield NPs or give only Au NPs because Co2+ cannot be reduced.104 Following a similar strategy, non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs have also been prepared by using NH3BH3 as reducing agent, demonstrating the generality of this method.105 Wang and Li have also presented a one-pot wet chemical route to the synthesis of Au@Co coreshell nanocrystals and AuNi spindly nanostructures, in which a suitable reducing agent, octadecylamine (ODA), is crucial for their success. In the ODA solvent, M2+ (M = Co, Ni) cannot be reduced whereas Au3+ and M2+ can be co-reduced based on the following reduction mechanism: the Au3+ can obtain electrons from ODA and be reduced to Au (step I). Once the Au forms, it is surrounded by an electron cloud offered by free electrons of other Au atoms. M2+ cannot be directly reduced by either ODA or Au, but it can be adsorbed on the surface of Au and share a small portion of the electron cloud through its empty orbital (step II). This causes the spherical electron cloud distribution surrounding Au to become an elliptical distribution. The shift in the electron cloud leads to a partial positive charge on the Au surface, which is immediately neutralized by electrons offered by ODA. The continual supply of electrons from ODA to Au makes the shift in the electron cloud from Au to M occur continuously until M2+ is reduced completely.106 Most recently, Huang et al. have used bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature. Due to its mild and stepwise reduction ability, BT was able to preferentially reduce Au3+ to Au NPs when placed in contact with an Au3+/Pd2+ mixture, and subsequently, the formed Au NPs served as in situ seeds for the growth of a Pd shell, resulting in the formation of Au@Pd NPs. Importantly, it is feasible to adjust the morphology of the Pd shell by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio, where Au@Pd NPs with a spherical Pd shell are formed when the Pd2+ amount is insufficient, whereas NPs with a cubic Pd shell are formed when Pd2+ is sufficient.107 Han and coworkers have also reported one-step aqueous synthesis of bimetallic Au@Pd coreshell NPs with a well-defined octahedral shape, in which cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as both reductant and stabilizer is very critical and cannot be substituted by ascorbic acid or CTAB.108 Similarly, triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been synthesized by using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent,109 which we will discuss in detail in Section 4.

Carpenter and coworkers have also reported one-pot aqueous synthesis of Fe@Ag or Ag@Fe coreshell NPs, in which they have shown that the injection time of AgNO3 into a reaction vessel containing aqueous ferrous salt, sodium borohydride, and sodium citrate is a vital parameter for the precise control of a desired coreshell structure. Scheme 3 depicts how the introduction of AgNO3 at different times after the addition of NaBH4 creates various core/shell structures. The results can be explained by the differences in the reduction potentials for Fe2+ and Ag+ in an aqueous solution (EFe2+/Fe = 0.41 V vs.SHE; EAg+/Ag = +0.80 V vs.SHE). For the introduction in 1 min after NaBH4 addition, Ag is formed by classical homogeneous nucleation and growth, resulting in 45 nm spherical NPs. These Ag NPs serve as nucleation sites for the Fe NPs to grow, which simulates a heterogeneous nucleation and growth process. For the introduction after 5 min, the Fe NPs have already formed and therefore act as nucleation sites for the Ag NPs to form and grow, creating Fe@Ag coreshell NPs. Lastly, the introduction after 10 min produces 150 nm Fe clusters and these Fe clusters again act as nucleation sites for the formation of Ag shells.110 Scheme 3 Proposed reaction scheme for the reduction of sodium citrate, FeCl2·7H2O and NaBH4; addition of AgNO3 at various times after the addition of NaBH4 produced various coreshell morphologies.

Galvanic replacement is an effective approach to fabricate bimetallic coreshell NPs with hollow interiors based on the differences in the reduction potentials of core and shell metal ions. Xia and coworkers have devoted much in this topic and developed a lot of bimetallic coreshell NPs.111 The shell metal is mostly noble metals whereas core metal could be either noble or non-noble metals.111113 In addition, it is also very effective for fabricating yolkshell/nanorattle structured NPs113115 or coreshell NPs with alloy shells.102,116 It is known that alloy NPs can usually be obtained from bimetallic coreshell NPs by high-temperature annealing or even by a process of hydrogen absorption/desorption as a trigger for Pd@Pt NPs reported recently.117,118 There are also some interesting transformations from alloy to coreshell NPs (Scheme 4). Mayrhofer et al. have found that PtCo@Pt coreshell NPs can be obtained from Pt3Co alloy upon CO annealing at 200 C, where the adsorption enthalpy of CO on Pt is higher than on Co, Pt segregates to the surface of the NPs, and correspondingly displaces Co to the core.119 Subsequently, carbon supported PdCo@Pd coreshell NPs have been prepared viaannealing PdCo/C at 500 C under flowing H2 based on the segregation effect induced by the difference in the gas adsorption energies on the two metals. Under the high temperature annealing conditions, the PdCo/C alloys undergo phase segregation in which Pd migrates to the surface, forming a pure Pd overlayer on the bulk alloy to afford PdCo@Pd NPs, since the adsorption enthalpy of H on Pd is higher than that on Co.120 More interestingly, Tao et al. have studied that the Rh0.5Pd0.5 NPs undergo dramatic and reversible changes in composition and chemical state in response to oxidizing or reducing conditions. The NP with Rh rich in the surface can be detected upon exposure to an oxidizing gas of NO, while Rh atoms can move back to the core if the NP is exposed to a reducing gas of CO. Thus, the use of reactive gases is a rather unique way to engineer the structures of bimetallic coreshell-like NPs.121 Scheme 4 Structural transformation from alloy to bimetallic coreshell NPs via reaction-driven processes.
Toshima and coworkers have proposed three possible routes for preparation of heterometallic coreshell NPs based on their long-term and systematic studies: 1) Pt@Pd coreshell NPs have been obtained by simultaneous gentle reduction with alcohol for H2PtCl6 and PdCl3 in the presence of PVP; 2) Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been prepared by a so-called hydrogen-sacrificial protective strategy, in which hydrogen adsorbed on the surface of core-metal NPs works as reductant of the second metal ions to produce the shell; 3) physical mixture of two kinds of metal NP in dispersions can spontaneously produce coreshell-structured bimetallic NPs. They have even succeeded in construction of a triple coreshell structure by combination of sacrificial hydrogen reduction or simultaneous alcoholreduction with a physical mixing process (self-organization).122 Kim et al. have reported the formation of CNT supported coreshell clusters in the shape of nano-dandelions on the atomic scale in which the core is a single Pt atom and the shells are several agglomerated Ru atoms. Such an interesting structure resulted from the difference of bond strengths with sulfur atoms in thiol groups between Pt and Ru single atoms which formed onto surface thiol groups of CNT by borohydride reduction; the RuS bond is much weaker than the PtS bond. This brings about the faster release of Ru atoms from thiol groups than from Pt atoms during heat treatment; then, the drifting Ru atoms cover the Pt single atoms still linked to surface thiol groups and form a nano-dandelion structure (Scheme 5). The main advantage of this unique synthetic strategy for coreshell clusters compared to the conventional method is that it is possible to synthesize very small coreshell clusters below 1 nm in size.123 In addition, Zhang et al. reported a well-controlled synthetic strategy to achieve meticulous control of metallic shell growth at the single monolayer level with versatile core NPs via introducing an intermediate phase in a phase transfer reaction to finely tune the shell growth process.124 Yang et al. have reported a general protocol for transferring metal ions from water to an organic medium by using ethanol as an intermediate solvent. The protocol enables the synthesis of a variety of metallic nanocrystals, including coreshell NPs, to be carried out in an organic medium using relatively inexpensive water-soluble metal salts as starting materials.125 Scheme 5 PtRu nano-dandelion formation mechanism based on a single atom to cluster approach.

3.2 Coreshell NPs involving two noble metals
Similar to alloy NPs, coreshell structured bimetallic AuAg and AuPd NPs are preferentially studied among coreshell NPs because of their wide uses in different ends, especially their efficient catalytic properties for a variety of reactions. The electrocatalytic activity of coreshell Au100x@Agx (x = 15, 27, 46, 60) bimetallic NPs embedded in a methyl functionalized silicate MTMOS network towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide was investigated by using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometric techniques. The MTMOS silicate solgel embedded Au73@Ag27 coreshell NP modified electrode showed a synergistic effect and better electrocatalytic activity compared to monometal MTMOSAunps and MTMOSAgnps modified electrodes.126 Toshima and coworkers have interests in Ag@Au coreshell catalysts for glucoseoxidation. The addition of AgClO4 into aqueous dispersions of Au NPs was applied to produce bimetallic Ag@Au NPs with a coreshell structure. The catalytic activity for glucoseoxidation was investigated for thus-prepared Ag@Au bimetallic NPs with various compositions. The highest activity (4079 mol-glucose h1 mol-M1) was observed for the Ag@Au NP prepared with an Ag/Au ratio of 0.25/1, much higher than that of monometallic Au or Ag NPs under the same conditions. The high catalytic activity of the Ag@Au NPs may be due to the electronic effect between the Au and Ag elements in a particle (Fig. 7a).127 More recently, they have developed a simple and novel one-pot preparation method for PVP-protected Ag@Au bimetallic NPs of less than 2 nm in diameter using simultaneous reduction of the corresponding ions with rapid injection of NaBH4. The Ag@Au bimetallic NPs showed a high and durable catalytic activity for the aerobic glucoseoxidation, and the catalyst can be stably kept for more than 2 months under ambient conditions. The highest activity was observed for the bimetallic NPs with Ag/Au atomic ratio of 2/8, of which the TOF value (16890 mol-glucose h1 mol-metal1) was several times higher than that of Au NPs with nearly the same particle size and much higher than that of Ag NPs (Fig. 7b).128 Fig. 7 (a) Glucoseoxidation catalytic activity of Ag@Au NPs at various feed composition ratios and Au and Ag monometallic NPs. Inset: schematic presentation of the formation of Ag/Au bimetallic NPs by the addition of AgClO4 aqueous solution into Au NP dispersion.

The obtained AgC composites were used as precursors to dope Au into the CSs' interior by immersing AgC composites in HAuCl4 solution without additional reducing agent, thus yielding bimetallic AuAg/C composites with possible hollow Ag@Au coreshell structure due to the galvanic replacement reaction. Optical properties and catalytic activities of the composite were tunable via simply controlling the Au/Ag atomic ratio as controlled by the HAuCl4 concentration. The catalytic activity of bimetallic composites was highly enhanced than that of the monometallically doped CSs in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol by NaBH4.129 Our group have fabricated Au@Ag or Au@AuAg NPs confined with an ZIF-8 support for catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol. Results showed the highly synergistic improvement for the catalytic activity compared to the monometallic and alloy NPs. The apparent activation energy for the most active catalyst, 2wt%Au@2wt%Ag/ZIF-8, was evaluated to be 14 kJ mol1, which was much lower than those reported for Au- or Ag-based catalysts and further illuminated the synergistic effect of Au and Ag species.102 Crooks and coworkers have prepared dendrimer-encapsulated PdAu bimetallic NPs in 13 nm with alloyed and coreshell PdAu structures, respectively by simultaneously and sequentially loading metal precursors into the dendrimer and following by reduction. The catalytic hydrogenation of allyl alcohol was significantly enhanced in the presence of coreshell structured PdAu NPs as compared to mixtures of single-metal NPs.130 The Pd-on-Au bimetallic NPs with a 4 nm Au core and controlled Pd loading were synthesized, with all compositions more active for the aqueous-phase trichloroethene hydrodechlorination (TCE HDC) reaction. The most active catalysts were considerably more active (>1900 L gPd1 min1) than Pd NPs (55 L gPd1 min1) and conventionally synthesized Pd/Al2O3 (47 L gPd1 min1). The reaction data suggested geometric effects were responsible for enhanced TCE HDC activity. The binding energy shifts of Pd metal with surface coverage suggested the possibility of catalyst promotion by an electronic effect.131 Hutchings and colleagues have found that the addition of Pd to the Au catalyst, yielding Al2O3 supported bimetallic Au@Pd coreshell NPs with a Pd-rich surface, increased the rate of direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis from H2 and O2 as well as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide formed.132 Almost simultaneously, they reported the Au@Pd NPs with Au-rich core and Pd-rich shell supported on TiO2 gave very high TOFs (up to 270000 turnovers per hour) for the oxidation of alcohols, including primary alkyl alcohols. The catalytic results showed that the introduction of Au to Pd improved the selectivity to aldehydes and Au acted as an electronic promoter for Pd to influence the catalytic properties.133 Frank et al. have also demonstrated that Au@Pd NPs can be effectively supported by aqueous titania dispersion in absence of any organic stabilizing ligands with excellent colloidal stability. Without the need for drying and sintering, Au70@Pd30/TiO2 was catalytically active in aqueous oxidation of 1-phenylethanol by hydrogen peroxide with good conversions at 75 C and appreciable activity at 25 C, which was much higher than the activity of pure Pd/TiO2 and Au/TiO2.134 Zhang et al. have fabricated a novel Pt-around-Au nanocomposite (similar to coreshell structured Au@Pt) by electrostatic self-assembly. It exhibited significantly enhanced activity and high stability towards formic acid oxidation, which showed a promising application in direct formic acidfuel cells. The proposed reason for the unexpectedly high activity for HCOOH oxidation on the Pt-around-Au nanocomposite was the efficient spillover of HCOO from Au to the surrounding Pt NPs, where HCOO is further oxidized to CO2.135 Ataee-Esfahani et al. have synthesized Au@Pt nanocolloids with nanostructured dendritic Pt shells by one-step chemically reducing H2PtCl6 and HAuCl4 species with ascorbic acid in the presence of a low-concentration surfactant solution under simple ultrasonic irradiation conditions. The Pt shell thicknesses on Au cores can be readily tuned by controlling the Pt/Au molar ratio in the starting precursor solution. Through the optimization of the Pt shell thickness, the Au@Pt nanocolloids exhibited enhanced activity as an electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation reaction, which was 4 times as high as that of the dendritic Pt nanocolloids while Au nanocolloids were almost inactive.136 Han and coworkers have prepared bimetallic heteronanostructures consisting of a dendritic Pt shell and structured Au cores (nanocubes, nanorods, and nanooctahedra) via a seeded growth method. The Au@Pt nanostructures have exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity and durability for the ORR than those of the monometallic Pt catalyst, indicating that the formation of heterostructures can provide more active catalytic surfaces. Strikingly, the ORR activities were highly dependent on the shape of the cores and the Au nanooctahedron@Pt showed the largest improvement of the ORR activity (Fig. 8).137 Fig. 8 (a) Schematic synthesis of AuPt bimetallic heteronanostructures consisting of Au nanocrystal cores with well-defined morphologies and dendritic shells of Pt.

Copyright 2010, Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.Bimetallic Pt@Ru and Ru@Pt coreshell NPs have been prepared following the dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticle (DEN) route. By this approach, it is possible to place the desired metal preferentially either on the surface or in the core of the particles by adjusting the NP synthesis path. The presence of Ru improved the catalytic performance in the COad electro-oxidation reaction in relation to Pt-only species. The best results were obtained for the sample with a Pt-enriched surface, where it combined the advantages resulting from the presence of Ru with a better stability due to its preferential location in the core of the NP.138 Eichhorn, Mavrikakis and colleagues have systematically studied Pt-based NPs for PROX reaction. They reported a first-principles-guided synthesis of Ru@Pt NPs with an approximately 12-monolayer-thick shell of Pt atoms. The distinct catalytic properties of these well-characterized core-shell NPs were demonstrated for PROX in hydrogen feeds and subsequent hydrogen light-off. For H2 streams containing 1000 ppm CO, H2 light-off was completed by 30 C, significantly better than that over PtRu nanoalloys (85 C), monometallic mixtures of NPs (93 C) and pure Pt particles (170 C). Density functional theory studies suggested that the enhanced catalytic activity for the coreshell NP originated from a combination of an increased availability of CO-free Pt surface sites on the Ru@Pt NPs and a hydrogen-mediated low-temperature CO oxidation process that was clearly distinct from the traditional bifunctional CO oxidation mechanism.139 They have also prepared Rh@Pt coreshell, RhPt (1:1) alloy, and Rh + Pt monometallic NPs and employed Al2O3 as a support for them with 1.0 wt% Pt loading. The supported catalysts with three different architectures were evaluated for the PROX reaction. For hydrogen feeds with 0.2% CO and 0.5% O2, the Rh@Pt NP catalyst had the best activity with complete CO oxidation at 70 C and very high PROX selectivity at 40 C with 50% CO conversion, which was much higher than that over Pt + Rh and PtRh alloy catalysts (Fig. 9).140 Recently, they have combined first-principles calculations and experiments to systematically investigate the PROX reactivity of specifically synthesized and characterized M@Pt NPs, made of various transition metal cores (Ru, Rh, Ir, Pd, Au) covered by a ca. 12 monolayer thick shell of Pt atoms. Among these NPs, the PROX reactivity was the highest for Ru@Pt coreshell NPs, where the CO oxidation was complete by 30 C (1000 ppm CO in H2), followed by Rh@Pt, Ir@Pt, Pd@Pt, pure Pt, and Au@Pt NPs, in order of decreasing activity. Both the PROX activity and selectivity of several of these M@Pt coreshell NPs were significantly improved compared to monometallic and bulk nonsegregated bimetallic nanoalloys.141 Fig. 9 Temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) plots showing (a) H2O formation and (b) CO2 formation for monometallic Pt NPs, monometallic mixtures of Pt NPs, and 2.7 nm Rh particles, 4.9 nm Pt50Rh50 alloy NPs, and 3.2 nm Rh@Pt NPs for H2 streams contaminated with 2000 ppm CO.

The results indicated that both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation of Pt occurred at very early stages of the synthesis and the growth proceeded via particle attachment. The Pd seeds played a crucial role in forming an open, dendritic structure by providing multiple nucleation sites for Pt that were spatially separated from each other, helping to avoid overlap and fusion between the Pt branches during the growth process. In contrast, extensive self-aggregation of small Pt particles led to the formation of Pt nanostructures with a foam-like morphology in the absence of Pd seeds. The Pt branches supported on faceted Pd nanocrystals exhibited relatively large surface areas and particularly active facets toward formic acid oxidation and the ORR, in the latter of which the PdPt nanodendrites were 2.5 times more active on the basis of equivalent Pt mass for the ORR than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst and 5 times more active than the first-generation supportless Pt-black catalyst (Fig. 10).142,143 Fig. 10 (a) TEM image of PdPt nanodendrites synthesized by reducing K2PtCl4 with l-ascorbic acid in the presence of truncated octahedral Pd nanocrystal seeds in an aqueous solution.

3.3 Coreshell NPs combining noble and non-noble metals
The combination of Pt and another non-noble metal has intensive studies among bimetallic coreshell NPs. Zhou et al. have synthesized the reciprocal coreshell structured NPs, Pt@Cu and Cu@Pt, and made the preliminary evaluation of γ-Al2O3 supported NPs for catalyticNO reduction. Results showed that the Cu@Pt NPs had high activity equal to that of pure Pt NPs but with significantly greater selectivity for N2 formation. The origin of the enhanced performance of the Cu@Pt was tentatively explained to be related to near surface alloy (NSA) effects, in which subsurface metal layer effects the binding of adsorbates (e.g.NO and H) to the particle surface.144 The Cu@Pt/C catalyst was synthesized by sequential reduction of cupric chloride and chloro-platinic acid by using ascorbic acid, followed by anchoring on H2O2-functionalized Vulcan XC-72. The cyclic voltammogram results showed that formation of Pt in the form of a shell on Cu species helped to improve the reactive surface area as the skin layer adopting the surface geometric features of the core material. The electrocatalytic activities of the ORR for Cu@Pt/C catalyst had more positive onset potential than that of conventional Pt20, underlining the fact that the coreshell structured catalyst was more efficient for ORR.145 Similarly, sub-10 nm Ni@Pt coreshell NPs with near monolayer Pt shells were fabricated by a modified polyol process. Characterization results indicated that the deposition of the Pt shell could result in a lattice expansion of the Ni core and the electrochemical responses of these particles revealed that they had a Pt surface with a compressively strained PtPt interatomic distance as compared to that in pure Pt NPs. The specific activity for the ORR on the Ni@Pt NPs was significantly higher than that on pure Pt particles, indicating that the Ni@Pt NPs could be promising catalysts for the cathodes of PEMfuel cells with much reduced Pt content but significantly increased catalytic activity.146 A carbon supported coreshell PtNi@Pt NP catalyst was synthesized through a two-step solution-phase reduction method, and it demonstrated a 5.4 times higher specific activity of ORR than a conventional Pt/C catalyst by using a rotating disk electrode in a three-compartment electrochemical cell, which could be attributed to the modified electronic structure of the Pt surface layer by the underlying Ni sublayer.147 Yang et al. reported carbon supported M@Pt (M = Ni, Co) coreshell NPs with uniform dispersion of diameters of 24 nm by a polyol synthesis process with oleic acid as the surfactant. The M@Pt/C catalysts were used for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of ammonia borane and showed favorable performances, delivering a high hydrogen release rate of 5469 mL min1 g1 and 4874 mL min1 g1, respectively for Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C and Co0.32@Pt0.68/C, both of which were higher than that of a monometallic NP catalyst.148,149 Our group has synthesized carbon-supported Fe@Pt NPs using a sequential reduction process. The Fe core was first synthesized by reduction of FeSO4 using NaBH4 in an aqueous solution with well-dispersed carbon in the presence or absence of NH3BH3 in air at room temperature, respectively affording amorphous and crystalline Fe NPs. Then the atoms in the outer layer of the Fe core were sacrificed to reduce Pt2+ to form the Pt shell. Unexpectedly, in contrast to its crystallized counterpart, iron in the amorphous state exerted a distinct and powerful ability as a core for the Fe@Pt NPs, which combined high catalytic activity, low cost, long-term stability and easy recovery. The resultant amorphous Fe core-based Fe@Pt NPs were far more active for NH3BH3oxidation (up to 354%) than the commercial Pt/C catalysts (Fig. 11).150 Fig. 11 Comparison of catalytic activities for NH3BH3oxidation of (a) carbon supported Fe@Pt NPs with amorphous iron cores, (b) commercial Pt, (c) Fe@Pt NPs with crystallized iron cores, and (d) the FePt alloy.

The Au@Co coreshell NPs with 7 nm sizes obtained by one-step reduction method in our group, which we mentioned above, showed significant synergistic effects in heterogeneous catalysis. The catalytic properties of Au@Co NPs with those of pure Au, Co and AuCo alloy NPs were evaluated for dehydrogenation of aqueous NH3BH3. The Au@Co NPs exhibited markedly high catalytic activity to complete the dehydrogenation reaction of NH3BH3. This excellent catalytic activity was much higher than that of the AuCo alloy and Co with similar morphologies and sizes as those of Au@Co NPs. The Au NPs, which were in interlaced branch shapes with diameters less than 10 nm, had the worst activity. The better catalytic activity of Au@Co coreshell than AuCo alloy NPs might result from the modification of the electronic structure in a coreshell NP which is superior to that in an alloy NP for the dehydrogenation of aqueous NH3BH3.104 The Au@Co coreshell NPs synthesized by octadecylamine reduction also showed better catalytic efficiency than pure Au or Co NPs in the CO oxidation.106 Bifunctional catalytic and magnetic Ni@Ru coreshell NPs were synthesized most recently by means of a seeded growth method, where oleylamine was demonstrated to be a key factor for the creation of uniform Ni@Ru NPs with a jagged Ru shell. The ultra-small Ru NPs stabilized on the Ni surface showed higher activity than monometallic Ru NPs and physical mixture of Ru and Ni for catalytic dehydrogenation of aqueous NH3BH3.151 The Ag@Ni coreshell NPs with a typical size of 14.9  1.2 nm and a tunable shell thickness have been fabricated via a simple one-pot synthetic route using oleylamine as both solvent and reducing agent and triphenylphosphine as a surfactant. The as-synthesized Ag@Ni NPs exhibited excellent catalytic properties for the generation of H2 from dehydrogenation of NaBH4 in aqueous solution. The hydrogen generation rate of Ag@Ni NPs was found to be much higher than that of Ag and Ni NPs with similar sizes, indicating the synergistic effects between Ag and Ni.152 Some reported bimetallic coreshell NPs with synergistic catalytic effects in catalytic reactions are summarized in Table 2.

Here we give one recent example. Lu et al. have demonstrated bimetallic AuPt nanorods (NRs) to be in situ grown and embedded into thermosensitive coreshell microgel particles by a novel two-step approach: Au NRs pre-formed and embedded into the shell of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) networks, followed by Pt preferentially deposited onto the tips of Au NRs to form dumbbell-shaped bimetallic NPs. Quantitative analysis of the catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol indicated that bimetallic AuPt NRs showed highly enhanced catalytic activity due to the synergistic effect of bimetallic NPs.153
4. Synergistic catalysis over trimetallic and multimetallic NPs
In contrast to mono- and bi-metallic NPs, tri- and multi-metallic NPs may possess an even greater degree of catalytic activity and selectivity because more variables are available for tuning. There are limited reports but rapidly growing interest in tri- and multi-metallic NPs in the last two years. As reviewed above, Pt- and Pd-based bimetallic NPs have been intensively investigated as fuel cell catalysts. Improving efficiency and reducing overall cost are two key issues to the commercialization of fuel cell powered vehicles. The introduction of a third/fourth metal to the NP catalyst is expected to produce a combination of effects such as reduction of the lattice distance, the addition of surface sites for the formation of metaloxygen bond and adsorption of OH, and the modification of the d-band center. In order to continuously reduce cost (by reducing the amount of Pt in the catalyst) and simultaneously increase efficiency, Pt- and/or Pd-based tri- and multi-metallic NP catalysts have also been further developed recently.
Zhong, He and coworkers have made core-shell synthesis protocol for the preparation of ternary PtMFe (M = V, Ni) NPs with a few nanometres in core sizes. The PtMFe cores were encapsulated with a shell of mixed amine/acid monolayer and microstructure observations demonstrated the composition uniformity in the individual NP. The PtMFe NPs were assembled on carbon supports with controllable dispersion and mass loading. The carbon-supported alloy NPs after calcination treatment were found to display high electrocatalytic activities for the ORR. The electrocatalytic activity data were compared for the PtVFe/C catalyst in terms of relative mass activities at 0.8 V. In comparison with a commercially available standard Pt/C catalyst (TKK), PtFe and PtVFe had relative activities almost two and four times larger than that of the commercially available Pt catalyst, respectively. The PtNiFe/C catalyst displayed a relative activity almost five times larger than that of the commercially available Pt/C catalyst. The activity displays the order of PtNiFe/C > PtVFe/C > PtFe/C > Pt/C (Fig. 12), demonstrating the effectiveness of the alloy composition in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance. The superior activity of trimetallic NPs was attributed to the alloy NPs located on the surface of the supporting carbon, whereas the traditional synthesis method may cause some NPs to occur inside the micropores of the carbon, which were not accessible by the molecular oxygen.154156 Fig. 12 Comparison of the relative electrocatalytic activities for carbon-supported monometallic, binary and ternary catalysts.

Sun and coworkers have employed a two-step method for synthesizing coreshell structured Pd@FePt NPs with a 5 nm Pd core and a FePt shell whose thickness is tunable from 1 to 3 nm. The uniform FePt shell was formed by controlled nucleation of Fe(CO)5 in the presence of a Pt salt and Pd NPs at designated reaction temperatures. The Pd/FePt NPs showed FePt shell-dependent catalytic properties, and those having a 1 nm coating exhibited drastic increases in durability and activity (15 times more active with a 140 mV gain in onset potential in comparison with those having a 3 nm coating).157 Subsequently, they have designed and synthesized Au@FePt3 and even Pd@Au@FePt coreshell NPs via epitaxial growth of FePt shell over Au and Pd@Au seeds, respectively.130,158 The trimetallic Au@FePt3 NPs possess both the high catalytic activity of Pt-bimetallic alloys and the superior durability of the tailored morphology and composition profile, with mass-activity enhancement of more than 1 order of magnitude over Pt catalysts (Fig. 13), revealing the great potential of utilizing multimetallic nanostructures in tuning the catalytic and durability properties of nanocatalysts.

Wang and Yamauchi have reported an autoprogrammed synthesis of Au@Pd@Pt triple-layered coreshell NPs, which consist of an Au core, a Pd inner layer, and a nanoporous Pt outer shell, in aqueous solution with ascorbic acid and Pluronic F127 at room temperature (Fig. 14). The proposed autoprogrammed synthesis was performed by spontaneous step-by-step depositions of metal precursors without the need for any additional and complex treatments, where the pre-formed Au NPs served as in situ seeds for the subsequent depositions of the Pd inner layer and the Pt outer shell, in tandem. After the formation of Au@Pd coreshell NPs, Pt deposited onto the surface of the Au@Pd binary core. With continuous Pt reduction by ascorbic acid, Pt atomic addition continuously occurred, resulting in the continuous growth of the intermediate Pt outer shell, and then more and more Pt nanoarms grew from the Au@Pd binary core surface. It was assumed that the Pluronic F127 served as a structure-directing agent to direct the nanodendritic Pt outer shell growth during the later Pt deposition. The resultant Au@Pd@Pt triple-layered NPs showed higher catalytic performance than that of Au@Pt coreshell NPs in the methanol oxidation reaction.109 Most recently, Tian and coworkers have synthesized Au@Pd@Pt NPs using the atomic radius, cohesive energy, and electronegativity of these three metals to initiate different growth modes. Au NPs coated with two atomic layers of Pd and a half-monolayer equivalent of Pt clusters (θPt  0.5) possessed the highest catalytic activity for electrooxidation of formic acid compared to other nanostructures such as Au@Pd NPs and Au@Pt NPs using massive electrodes. An increase in the loading of Pd beyond 2 atomic layers and Pt beyond θPt  0.5 actually decreased catalytic activity, inferring that a synergistic effect exists between the three different nanostructure components (sphere, shell and islands).159Carbon-supported pseudo-core@shell PdCu@Pt NPs with intimate contact of Pt and PdCu were prepared by a galvanic displacement reaction between PdCu/C alloy NPs and PtCl62 in aqueous solution. The PdCu@Pt/C catalysts demonstrated higher specific activity to methanol oxidation and ORR than Pt/C and PtRu/C as a result of improved Pt utilization.160 For the PdCo@Pd coreshell NPs obtained from H2-induced surface segregation effect (the synthesis was mentioned in Section 3.1), an ultralow loading of Pt was deposited on its surface by spontaneous displacement reaction and the Pt-decorated PdCo@Pd/C catalyst was found to have significantly enhanced stability and ORR activity. Both PdCo@Pd/C and Pt-decorated PdCo@Pd/C catalysts showed much higher MeOH tolerances than Pt/C.120 The PdPtNi nanoalloy catalysts have been synthesized by a polyol reduction method and characterized for the ORR in PEMfuel cells. The performance of the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) fabricated with the PdPtNi catalysts, with a lower cost than that of Pt, was found to increase continuously in the entire current density range with the operation time in the PEM fuel cells until it becomes comparable to that of commercial Pt. The Pt-based mass activity of PdPtNi exceeded that of commercial Pt by a factor of 2, and its long-term durability was comparable to that of commercial Pt within the 200 h of operation. Composition analyses suggested a dealloyed active catalyst phase consisting of a Pd-rich core and a Pt-rich shell formed by dissolution of Pd and Ni under the fuel cell testing conditions. It was assumed that the strain effect caused by lattice mismatch between the Pd-rich core and the Pt-rich shell may down-shift the d-band center, lower the adsorption energy of surface oxygenated intermediates, and thus enhance the surface catalytic activity.161 Fig. 14 (a) TEM image, (b) HAADF-STEM image, and (c) HAADF-STEM-EDS mapping images of the Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs.

In addition to electrochemical catalysis, tri- and multi-metallic NPs have also showed their synergistic effects in other types of catalytic reactions. Hungria et al. have discovered the synergistic value of mesoporous silica supported trimetallic NP catalyst Ru5PtSn, derived from a heterotrinuclear (RuPtSn) complex, as a highly efficient and selective means of effecting the catalytic single-step hydrogenation of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) to cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) under mild conditions. The presence of tin in the NP catalyst was regarded to play a key role in anchoring the particle owing to its oxophilicity for the support, which in turn diminished the tendency for the sintering of NPs.162 The temperature-programmed oxidation of methane revealed that the addition of Pt and Au to Pd/CeO2catalyst resulted in higher conversion values in the whole investigated temperature range compared to the monometallic Pd catalyst. The time-on-stream experiments provided further evidence for the high-stability of tri-metallic catalysts compared to the monometallic one. It was suggested that advantageous catalytic properties of tri-metallic PtAuPd/CeO2catalysts compared to the monometallic one can be attributed to suppression of the formation of ionic forms of Pd(ii), reaching an optimum ratio between Pd0 and PdO species, and stabilization of Pd in high dispersion.163 The colloidal dispersions of PVP-protected Au/Pt/Rh trimetallic NPs, assumed to have a Au-core/Pt-interlayer/Rh-shell triple-layer structure, were prepared by mixing the dispersions of PVP-protected Rh NPs and those of PVP-protected bimetallic Au1@Pt4 coreshell NPs. The trimetallic NPs with the composition of Au/Pt/Rh (1/4/20) and a triple coreshell structure had the highest catalytic activity for hydrogenation of methyl acrylate at 30 C in ethanol among the trimetallic NPs with other compositions and other structures, and the corresponding mono- and bi-metallic NPs (Fig. 15). The high catalytic activity of trimetallic NPs could be due to the sequential electronic effect between elements in a particle and the strong exothermic interaction could be the driving force for the self-organization to form the triple coreshell structure.164 Following the similar physical mixing method, the same group also reported polymer-protected Pd/Ag/Rh triple-layered coreshell trimetallic NPs by mixing dispersions of polymer-protected Rh NPs and Pd@Ag coreshell NPs. The spontaneously formed trimetallic NPs having an atomic composition of Pd/Ag/Rh = 1/2/13.5 and an average diameter of 2.2 nm showed the highest catalytic activity among the metal NP catalysts for hydrogenation of methyl acrylate at 30 C under an atmosphere of hydrogen.165 Fig. 15 Comparison of catalytic activities of various metal NPs for hydrogenation of methyl acrylate.

The Au/Ag/Pd trimetallic NPs and Pd NPs were synthesized by a chemical method with CTAB as the capping agent. The catalytic activities of Pd and the trimetallic NPs were examined for the Sonogashira and Suzuki CC coupling reactions. Results showed that the trimetallic Au/Ag/Pd NPs with 1/1/1 ratio exhibited better catalysis than Pd NPs in both reactions, which may be due to the concerted electronic effects among these metal atoms.166,167 Zhou et al. have prepared onion-like PdBiAu/C catalyst particles with an average diameter of 13 nm by consecutive chemical reduction of Au, Bi and Pt precursors in aqueous solution and immobilization on active carbon. The onion-like morphology was composed of high content of Au inner core, Bi-rich intermediate layer and Pd-rich external layer based on characterization data. The PdBiAu/C trimetallic catalyst demonstrated good catalytic properties for the oxidation of polyethylene glycol dodecyl ether in liquid phase using water as solvent and O2 as oxidant at atmospheric pressure, superior to a traditional bimetallic PdAu/C catalyst. It indicated that Bi, as promoter element, may play an important role in the electronic interaction of Pd and Au NPs.168 Some reported tri- and multi-metallic NPs with synergistic catalytic effects in respective catalytic reactions are summarized in Table 3.

5. Conclusion and outlook
This feature article has provided a survey of development of bi- and tri-metallic, even multimetallic NPs for synergistic catalysis studies in the last 56 years. We have tried to present an up-to-date overview in such a rapidly growing field, while the subject is very active and many papers are contributed each year (even during the writing of this article) from chemists, physical and materials scientists, etc. Therefore, it is hard to take into account all publications to this field in limited pages. We apologize here if some significant contributions were left out.
Bimetallic alloy NPs have been widely developed with improved catalytic activity. For coreshell structured bimetallic NPs, we have introduced some fabrication strategies, including typical successive reduction or seeded/epitaxial growth, one-step reduction, galvanic replacement reaction, surface phase segregation, physical mixing, and so on. The coreshell NPs usually have significantly higher activities than the monometallic counterparts, even alloy NPs. In recent years, the development of tri- and multi-metallic NPs for catalysis, especially electrochemical catalysis, is becoming a very hot topic. The combination of relatively cheap components with less noble metal into one catalyst affords more opportunities to lower cost and improve catalytic efficiency.
It is worthy to note here that it could be untimely to generalize which structure or which combination is definitely better for a catalytic reaction. For example, we may find many bimetallic NPs with coreshell structure having higher catalytic activities than those of alloyed structure,104,139141,150 whereas the AuAg alloy NPs are especially active for CO oxidation reaction,3236 in which Au adsorbs CO molecules and the neighbouring Ag species adsorbs and affords reactive oxygen, thus greatly facilitating the reaction process. Therefore, different reactions have their special requirements for catalyst structure, composition and combination, that is, case by case. With the development of synthetic techniques, desired structures and various composition combinations, which are currently unrealized, could be fabricated to improve the catalytic properties.
The synergistic catalytic effect over heterometallic NPs based on the reports mentioned in this article could be tentatively ascribed to the following main aspects. 1) Improved activity results from microstructure changes of nanocatalyst upon introducing another metal species. 2) In many cases, electronic interaction among the different components along with geometric effects leads to appropriate modification of electronic structure, which benefits the catalytic activity enhancement. 3) Among many bimetallic (metalA and metalB) nanocatalysts, although metalB is less active or inactive for the reaction, the addition of metalB to metalA can effectively improve the entire activity of the bimetallic NPs by its indirect function. For example, the presence of Rh increases the thermal stability of PtRhBHA catalyst;52 the Sn prevents sintering in RuPtSn NPs;162 the presence of Au reduces the poisoning of AuPd NPs;25 the Au is resistant to oxidation of AuAg NPs;37 metalB helps to activate the catalytic substrate molecules;3234,79 metalB leads to the better dispersion of metalA;67,68,80etc. 4) Among the competitive reactions, the predominant reaction is changed from pathway A to desirable pathway B upon alloying, thus improving the catalytic activity.60,83,84 5) Other reasons. It should be pointed out that more than one of the aspects summarized above could exist in one heterometallic catalyst for its enhanced catalytic efficiency.Although great progress has been achieved, some problems still need to be faced. The present heterometallic NP catalysts are mostly based on noble metals. The high cost and scarce availability make the industrialization very difficult. Further efforts should be made to develop much more effective and economical catalysts. As one vivid example, a family of non-noble metal catalysts, derived from polyaniline, Fe, and Co, as an inexpensive alternative was just reported that approached the performance of Pt-based systems at a cost sustainable for high-power fuel cell applications.169 On the other hand, researchers working in the catalysis field are more concerned about catalytic performance and only some groups carefully investigate the catalyst microstructures. Sometimes, there are even no morphology and size characterizations for metal NP catalysts in some reports. It is important to construct the relationship between catalyst structure and performance, so that we can understand how to modify the preparation conditions to obtain desirable catalysts with improved activity. Materials chemists, being good at materials synthesis, full characterizations and understanding of formation mechanisms for the catalysts, develop novel catalysts while they usually prefer some model reactions to test the performance of the catalysts, where some superior catalysts are possibly overlooked for important industrial applications. Therefore, extensive collaborations among synthetic, materials chemists and scientists in the catalysis field could bridge/compensate for such gaps/losses and make the research go one step further. In addition, although theoretical works were not involved in this article, first principles calculations might help to guide the composition choice for the intelligent design of catalysts in experimental works, and also afford microscopic insights into the fundamental factors underlying their activity.
Along with the development of materials science at an extraordinary pace, we may be able to synthesize heterometallic NPs with experimentally controllable size, composition and chemical ordering under suitable reaction conditions, choice of precursor materials, and combining physical, chemical, and even biological generation methods. The advanced characterizations will pave the way for making clear the relationship between the precise microstructure of heterometallic NPs and their catalytic performance. We have reason to believe that the foreseeable future in this field will be very bright.
