Monolayer bimetallic surfaces: Experimental and theoretical studies of trends in electronic and chemical properties Abstract The current review focuses on the general trends in the electronic and chemical properties of monolayer bimetallic surfaces (MBS). The MBS is defined in this review as a monolayer of admetal deposited on a single crystal metal substrate. Depending on the deposition temperature and reaction environment, the admetal in MBS can be in one of the three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce intermixed bimetallic surfaces. The review will summarize recent experimental and theoretical studies of the surface monolayer, subsurface monolayer, and inter-mixed bimetallic structures to demonstrate their unique electronic and chemical properties. In the current review we will use one the most thoroughly studied bimetallic systems, surface and subsurface Ni monolayer on Pt(111), as a model system to introduce the synthesis, characterization, and DFT modeling of MBS structures. We will then utilize the adsorption of atomic hydrogen, atomic oxygen, and CO to demonstrate the correlation between the surface d-band center and the binding energies of both atomic and molecular adsorbates for various bimetallic surfaces. We will also address the issue of stability of the subsurface and surface MBS structures in vacuum, and in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen. We will then use the hydrogenation of alkenes on subsurface MBS structures, and the reforming of oxygenates on surface MBS structures, to illustrate the trend between binding energies of adsorbates and chemical activities.
1. Introduction
1.1. Unique catalytic properties of bimetallic alloys
One of the main goals of the catalysis industry is to develop new materials that have novel catalytic properties. Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinctly different from those of the parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity and stability. Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed reactivities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts [1] ,[2] ,[3] . These studies also revealed that metals that were immiscible in the bulk, such as Ru and Cu, showed evidence of bimetallic interaction on the surface of the catalyst. The findings of these unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have inspired many extensive investigations on the possible applications of different bimetallic catalysts. Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalysis [4] and electrocatalysis [5] ,[6] applications.
For this reason, bimetallic surfaces have also gained a considerable amount of interest for fundamental surface science research, as summarized in several earlier reviews [7] ,[8] ,[9] . It is now well known that bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces. The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime. However, it is difficult to know a priori how the electronic and chemical properties of a particular bimetallic surface will be modified relative to the parent metals. For this reason, the study of bimetallic surfaces in the field of catalysis has gained considerable interest. There are two critical factors that contribute to the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of a metal in a bimetallic surface. First, the formation of the hetero-atom bonds changes the electronic environment of the metal surface, giving rise to modifications of its electronic structure through the ligand effect. Second, the geometry of the bimetallic structure is typically different from that of the parent metals, e.g. the average metal-metal bond lengths change. This gives rise to the strain effect that is known to modify the electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital overlap.
1.2. Unique properties of MBS
Bimetallic surfaces, produced by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on a single crystal substrate, have allowed the utilization of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes. Many studies have attempted to correlate chemical reactivities with the electronic properties of MBS. For example, Goodman and coworkers found a strong dependence of the CO desorption temperature and the core electron energy shift in a wide range of bimetallic surfaces [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] . Hammer and Nrskov have also extensively studied the interactions between adsorbates and metal surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) [14] . They have shown that the center of the surface d-band in transition metals also correlates with the binding energies of CO and that the core-level shift is related to the d-band shift. Specifically, a shift in the d-band center away from the Fermi level results in a weaker binding energy [15] ,[16] . Therefore, the formation of a bimetallic bond in MBS can lead to a shift in the surface d-band, resulting in a decrease or increase in the adsorbate binding energy.
The modification of the structural and electronic properties of MBS can also lead to new reaction pathways of catalytically important reactions, such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and cyclotrimerization. For example, Koel and coworkers have attempted to correlate a change in electronic or physical structures with novel chemistry of bimetallic surfaces, such as Sn/Pt(111) and Pd/Mo(100) [17] ,[18] . These studies revealed that surfaces with metal adlayer coverages in the monolayer range often demonstrated chemical properties unlike the pure metal surfaces. Another example of correlating the structural, electronic and chemical properties is the novel chemistry on faceting surfaces of many bimetallic systems by Madey and coworkers. For example, the faceting surface of Pd, obtained by depositing one monolayer Pd on W(211), showed a substantial enhancement in the activity towards the cyclotrimerization pathway than that on either Pd(110) or W(211) surfaces [19] .
In the past few years there have been significant efforts in experimental and DFT modeling of MBS. One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the top-most surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce inter-mixed bimetallic surfaces. DFT modeling results clearly indicated that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures. Surface science results, using several probe molecules, also confirmed the different chemical properties of MBS with surface monolayer and subsurface monolayer structures. In addition, the combination of DFT modeling and experimental results revealed a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various MBS structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties.
1.3. Scope of the current review
In the current review we will discuss the general trends in the electronic and chemical properties of MBS from both experimental and DFT studies. We will primarily focus on the results published after the review of bimetallic surface chemistry by Rodriguez in 1996 [8] . One of the most thoroughly studied bimetallic systems, surface and subsurface Ni monolayer on Pt(111), will be used as a model MBS to introduce the preparation procedures and common characterization techniques. This will be followed by an introduction of the application of the density functional theory (DFT) method to determine the electronic properties, such as the surface d-band center, of bimetallic surfaces. A semi-empirical equation will also be introduced to allow the estimation of the d-band center of MBS without quantum calculations. The general trends in the chemical properties of MBS will be demonstrated using several classes of probe atoms and molecules. The dissociative adsorption and desorption of hydrogen will be used to reveal the correlation between the hydrogen binding energy and the surface d-band center for various bimetallic surfaces. This will be followed by the demonstration of the general trend in the binding energy of oxygen, as well as the thermodynamic stability and segregation kinetics of the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. The general trend in the adsorption and reaction of hydrocarbon molecules with unsaturated carboncarbon bonds will be discussed, in particular the novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathways on the subsurface bimetallic structures that are resulting from weakly-bonded hydrogen and alkenes. This will be followed by the discussion of the adsorption and reaction of oxygen-containing molecules, in particular the trend in the reforming of oxygenates to produce H2 and CO on the surface bimetallic structures. The review will conclude by pointing out some of the challenges and opportunities in the understanding and potential applications of MBS.
2. Synthesis and characterization of bimetallic surfaces
A fundamental correlation of the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic alloys requires the synthesis of well-characterized bimetallic surfaces under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Bimetallic surfaces can be prepared by cutting single crystal bulk alloys in a particular crystalline orientation. However, the chemical compositions of these surfaces are limited to those bimetallic systems that produce bulk alloys. A more common way to prepare bimetallic surfaces is by depositing one metal onto the well-ordered single crystal surface of another metal. Comparing to bulk alloy crystals, the deposition method offers the flexibility to compare surface properties of the metal substrate without metal overlayer, and with metal overlayers at different coverages. Another advantage is that, depending on the substrate temperature during deposition, the monolayer admetal can either stay on the surface to produce the surface monolayer or diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the subsurface monolayer. In this section we will provide procedures for the synthesis of MBS with surface and subsurface structures, followed by a description of common UHV techniques for the characterization of bimetallic surfaces.
2.1. Preparation of MBS structures
Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies. The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament.
Fig. 1 shows the typical experimental set-up of a metal source for the thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply. The extremely high melting temperature of the W filament allows the ultra-pure metal wire to evaporate without contamination from the tungsten. The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with an opening of about 1 cm at the front face of the cylinder, to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto the UHV systems. The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for certain amount of time to achieve the reproducible deposition of impurity free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition. Once the metal source is conditioned, the bimetallic surface with desired admetal coverage can be achieved by placing the single crystal substrate close to the opening of the metal source. The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface. In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO.

Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region. For example, at a deposition temperature of 300 K monolayer coverage of Ni atoms stay on a Pt(111) substrate to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer. On the other hand, a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained either by deposition at 600 K or by post-annealing the 300 K surface in vacuum to 600 K. This phenomenon is quite common for other 3d metals on Pt(111), although the diffusion temperature of the admetal layer varies for different 3d metals. More about the preparation of surface and subsurface MBS structures will be discussed in Section
2.3
.
2.2. Common techniques for the characterization of bimetallic surfaces
2.2.1. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
AES and XPS are surface sensitive techniques, with the sampling depth depending on the kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons. The kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or XPS photoelectrons is elemental specific, therefore allowing for elemental analysis of the bimetallic surfaces. The AES peak-to-peak intensities and XPS peak areas, after being normalized by the relevant sensitivity factors, are often used to quantify the compositions of bimetallic surfaces.
One of the most important aspects in studying the bimetallic surfaces is to understand the growth mechanism of the metal overlayer. For studying MBS structures, it is important to differentiate whether the metal atoms grow in a layer-by-layer mode, often referred to as the Frank van der Merwe growth mechanism as shown in Fig. 2 (a), or grow to form 3D islands in the VolmerWeber (VW) mechanism as shown in Fig. 2 (b). In the latter mechanism, a uniform monolayer is not formed because the cohesive energy between metal overlayer atoms (MM) is generally higher than that for the adsorption energy between the metal overlayer and the substrate surface (MS). At least two other growth mechanisms have been described for the formation of metal overlayers: the StranskiKrastanov mechanism that describes the growth of 3D islands after the completion of the first monolayer, and the multiple layer growth mechanism where the second and third layers may start to grow before the first monolayer is completed. Because the current review focuses mainly on the monolayer bimetallic structures, only the first two growth mechanisms will be discussed here, with the purpose being to use AES and XPS to differentiate between a uniform monolayer and 3D islands.

The layer-by-layer and the 3D island growth mechanisms can be in most cases differentiated from the AES or XPS intensities as a function of deposition time.
Fig. 3 illustrates the typical intensity curves for the two mechanisms. The -axis in Fig. 3 is the deposition time at a constant deposition current or voltage, and the y-axis is the intensity for the metal overlayer (M) and the substrate (S). The rate of decrease of the substrate peak and the increase of the metal overlayer peak can be used to qualitatively identify different growth modes. In the layer-by-layer mechanism, Fig. 3 (a), the peak intensity of both the metal overlayer and the substrate show distinct breaks, with the first break being an indication of the completion of the first monolayer. In contrast, Fig. 3 (b) illustrates that such breaks are absent for the 3D island growth mechanism. The AES or XPS calibration curves, provide critical information about whether the admetal forms a monolayer on the substrate, should be performed for the characterization of bimetallic surfaces whenever possible. In addition, calibration curves such as those in Fig. 3 (a) also provide information about the deposition time to achieve the monolayer coverage.

Typical AES calibration curves for different growth modes, where S indicates the signal of the substrate metal and M indicates the signal of the metal overlayer: (a) layer-by-layer growth and (b) 3D island growth (from [27] ).
Because the calibration curves in Fig. 3 require the measurements of many data points, the average thickness of the metal overlayer in the bimetallic surfaces is (2.1) sometimes estimated based on the reduction in the AES or XPS intensities of the metal substrate. In Eq.
(2.1) , and are the intensity before and after the deposition of a metal overlayer, is the thickness of the film, and is the mean free path of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons, which is based on its kinetic energy using the Universal curve [20] . Using this method, the monolayer coverage is referred to as a film thickness that equals the diameter of the admetal.
The utilization of both the calibration curves in Fig. 3 and Eq.
(2.1) requires that the AES or XPS measurements of the substrate surface, with and without the metal overlayer, are performed with the sample at the identical location with respect to the AES or XPS spectrometer. This is because a change in the relative distance and angle between the sample surface and the AES or XPS spectrometer can often lead to variation in the intensity. It is often difficult to keep the constant distance and angle because the deposition often requires the rotation of the sample surface, and in most cases the movement of the sample in the , or directions. An alternative method to estimate the coverage of the overlayer is from a single AES or XPS spectrum from the intensity ratios of the overlayer and substrate. As described below, the calculation takes into consideration the following two effects: (1) the screening of the substrate AES or XPS intensity by the metal overlayer and (2) the contribution of the substrate AES or XPS signal from multiple layers in the bulk. For ease of explanation, the following calculations are described for a monolayer Pt on a W(110) substrate using the XPS peak intensities. The following parameters are defined in the calculation:: intensity of Pt(71.2 eV) feature for 1 ML Pt : intensity of W(31.5 eV) feature for 1 ML W : XPS intensity of Pt(71.2 eV) for Pt/W : XPS intensity of W(31.5 eV) for Pt/W.
The XPS intensities of Pt(71.2 eV) for 1 ML Pt and W(31.5 eV) for 1 ML W are related by the XPS sensitivity factors as follows:(2.2) where and are the sensitivity factors, which are 5.572 and 3.523, respectively, at an analyser angle of 54.7 from the standard XPS Handbook. The experimentally measured XPS intensity of the Pt(4f) feature at 71.2 eV, , can be expressed as (2.3) where is the fraction of monolayer of Pt residing on top of the polycrystalline W surface. The experimentally measured XPS intensity of the W(31.5 eV) feature is contributed from many layers of W. The intensity from the first layer of W can be expressed as (2.4) The first term represents the region without surface Pt, and the second term is from the surface region where W atoms are screened by the surface Pt layer with a thickness of . The term is the mean free path of the W(31.5 eV) electrons, which can be estimated to be 18 Å from the Universal curve [20] . Similarly the W XPS signal from the subsequent layers of W can be described by the following general equation:(2.5) (2.6) Finally, the experimentally measured XPS ratio of the Pt(4f)/W(4f) features can be related to the surface Pt coverage, x, using the relationship as given in Box I : The terms of and can be replaced with XPS sensitivity factors by rearranging Eq.
(2.2) :(2.7) In the current example the diameter of a Pt atom (
Å
,[21] ) is used for the thickness of the Pt monolayer. The thickness of each W layer is estimated to be based on the geometric arrangement of the body centerd cubic (BCC) structure, with being the diameter of a W atom of 2.74 Å [21] . The calculation also reveals that contributions to the W XPS signal from W atoms 20 layers or deeper are negligible. For this reason the sum of the XPS W(31.5 eV) signal, , is calculated from the first 20 W layers. Using the above equations, a monolayer Pt on W(110) is characterized by an XPS Pt(71.2 eV) /W(31.5 eV) ratio of 0.17. Similar equations can also be utilized for AES measurements, after utilizing the relevant AES sensitivity factors for the peak-to-peak intensities and the corresponding mean free paths for the Auger electrons.

2.2.2. Low energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy
Comparing to the AES and XPS techniques, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy [22] is much more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer of bimetallic surfaces. In LEIS experiments the surface is bombarded with positive ions of an inert element, such as He, Ne or Ar, of a relatively low energy (1005000 eV). The incident ion is scattered back with an energy that is directly related to the mass of the surface atom with which it collides. The energy of these ions can be correlated to the mass of the atom from which it is scattered by Eq.
(2.8) . In this relationship, is the energy of the incident ion, and are the masses of the incident ion and the surface atom, respectively, is the measured energy of the scattered ion, and is the scattering angle of the ions. By selecting the appropriate experimental parameters, , and , the value of can be determined by measuring the value of E in the LEIS experiment.
(2.8) Fig. 4 shows an example of the LEIS results following Ni deposition on Pt(111) at 300 K, using He+ ions with an energy of 1 keV as the ion source. The spectrum clearly shows that scattering from Ni and Pt atoms on the surface is easily distinguishable. Since the ions have different sensitivities towards atoms of different atomic numbers, the intensity of the scattering peaks needs to be normalized to the intensity of a pure surface of each element. In this case the sensitivity factor for the Pt signal is determined by measuring the intensity of a clean Pt(111) surface and the sensitivity factor of Ni is determined by measuring the Ni signal in a thick Ni film.

There are several other scattering phenomena that occur in the LEIS experiment which make it specific to only the first surface layer. The ions used for scattering in these experiments have a high neutralization probability and are likely to be neutralized if they penetrate the first atomic layer. As a result, these ions cannot be detected in the analyser. In addition to neutralization effects, the process of elastic shadowing occurs, in which the deeper atomic layers lie within a shadow cone that is projected by the scattering of ions by an atom in the top layer. Within this shadow cone, atoms cannot be detected. These scattering phenomena both contribute to the surface sensitivity of LEIS. As will be demonstrated in Section
2.3
, the surface sensitivity of the LEIS technique makes it one of the most sensitive techniques in the differentiation of surface and subsurface MBS structures,
2.2.3. LEED
Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is a useful technique to determine the overlayer structure in bimetallic surfaces. LEED utilizes a beam of low-energy electrons directed at the surface and collects a diffraction pattern of the electrons that scatter from the surface using a phosphor screen [23] ,[24] . LEED is very useful in identifying the periodicity of the metal overlayer with respect to the single crystal substrate. For example, LEED studies have helped to reveal that alloy surfaces, such as Pt80Ni20(001), Pt80Co20(111), and Pt80Fe20(111), all exhibit a pure Pt outermost layer with a Pt-depleted layer underneath [25] . LEED measurements are also important to confirm the epitaxial growth of metal overlayers in bimetallic surfaces.
2.2.4. STM
Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is often used to determine the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer in bimetallic surfaces. In STM experiments a tip is scanned over a sample surface in a regular array, adjusting the height of the tip to keep either the tunnelling current or voltage constant between the STM tip and the surface. STM is very useful in mapping adsorbate on surfaces as well as detecting surface defects. In addition, fluctuations of intensity can sometimes be related to differing atomic elements, which is often useful in determining the growth mechanism of metal overlayer and the morphology of bimetallic surfaces.
2.3. Case Study: Synthesis and characterization of Ni /Pt(111) surfaces
The Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces have been characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques and DFT modeling [26] . When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. Below we will use the NiPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) surfaces as model systems to illustrate the information that can be derived from AES, XPS, LEIS and STM characterization.
For example, Fig. 5 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K. For the LEIS experiments ( Fig. 5 (a)), Ni was deposited at 300 K and the initial coverage of Ni was approximately 1 ML. The LEIS analyser was fixed at an energy corresponding to He+ scattering from either Ni or Pt, while the sample was heated continuously at a linear rate of approximately 9 K /s. The Pt and Ni intensities were measured in separate experiments, and the LEIS ratio of Ni /Pt intensities was the same at the beginning of each experiment. After a small initial increase in the Ni intensity, possibly due to the desorption of contaminant H2, the Ni intensity decreased significantly with increasing temperature until it became nearly undetectable by 800 K. There were corresponding increases in the Pt intensity as the annealing temperature increased. Similar trends were observed in the AES experiments ( Fig. 5 (b)), which were performed at three different initial coverages. In these experiments, the Ni /Pt AES ratio gradually decreased until around 700 K, in good agreement with the LEIS results. The Ni /Pt AES ratio underwent significant decreases at above 700 K, indicating the diffusion of Ni into regions that were beyond the detection limit of the AES measurements [27] .
Download: Download high-res image (215KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 5. (a) LEIS intensity for Ni and Pt vs. annealing temperature of a Ni /Pt(111) surface. The normalization procedure is described in the text. (b) Ni /Pt AES ratio vs. temperature for different initial Ni coverages (from [26] ).
Fig. 6 shows the normal and grazing emission XPS of the NiPt(111) surface prepared at 300 K and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure prepared at 600 K. In the normal emission experiment, the sample surface was normal to the analyzer and the X-ray beam was incident on the surface at an angle approximately 6070 from the surface normal. In the grazing emission experiment, the analyser axis was at an angle of 60 with respect to the surface normal, and the x-ray beam was nearly incident with the surface normal (about 10 off). Therefore, the grazing emission experiments should be more sensitive to the near surface region than the normal emission experiments. At 300 K, the Ni intensity in the grazing emission spectrum was about 1.35 (based on areas indicated in Fig. 6 ) times larger than the Ni intensity in the normal emission spectrum ( Fig. 6 (a)). This indicated that Ni atoms were preferentially located near the surface. At 600 K ( Fig. 6 (b)), the grazing to normal intensity ratio was 0.74, suggesting a more isotropic composition of the near-surface region, consistent with the inward diffusion of surface Ni atoms at 600 K. The ratios between Ni2p and Pt4f XPS intensities showed a similar trend. For the 300 K deposition, the normal emission Ni2p /Pt4f ratio was 0.82, while for grazing emission it was 1.95, indicating again there was more Ni in the near surface region for deposition at 300 K. At 600 K, the normal emission ratio was 0.71, while the grazing emission ratio was 0.77. Thus, for deposition at 600 K, the surface was not as rich in Ni as the surface prepared by deposition at 300 K, or alternatively, the 600 K surface was enriched in Pt compared to the 300 K surface [27] .

Finally, STM was also utilized to further characterize the morphology of the 300 K and 600 K surfaces. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), after deposition at 300 K, Ni atoms formed islands that were a single atomic layer thick and nucleated at the step edges of the Pt(111) surface. Since the islands did not uniformly cover the step edges, the Ni adatoms were most likely mobile on both the surface and at the step edge until another Ni adatom at the step edge was encountered, at which point nucleation or sticking occurred. Upon annealing to 640 K, all of the island features disappeared, as shown in Fig. 7 (b). The surface appeared fairly uniform, with many small, light, worm-like features, which were attributed to the strain caused by the subsurface Ni in Pt(111) [26] . Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following the annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from the DFT modeling and experimental measurements of chemical properties, as described later.

3. DFT modeling of bimetallic surfaces
The use of ab initio calculations to predict chemical behavior of various catalytic systems has gained increasing momentum over the past decade due to the ever increasing speed of computer processors, as well as to the improvement in the methodology and data interpretation. Results from DFT modeling have provided important insights into the structural stability, electronic density of states, and chemical reactivity of many MBS systems. The review of DFT and its applications to catalysis and surface science can be found in many papers [14] ,[26] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ,[32] ,[33] ,[34] ,[35] ,[36] ,[37] ,[38] ,[39] ,[40] ,[41] . The main objective of the current section is to provide a brief overview of the basic concepts and assumptions of the DFT methods, in particular the surface d-band center that appears to be a very useful parameter in correlating and predicting properties of bimetallic surfaces. A semi-empirical equation will also be introduced as an alternative method to estimate the change in the surface d-band center of MBS.
3.1. Brief overview of DFT modeling
The advent of DFT began with the discovery by de Broglie that matter can be associated with wavelike properties [42] . Using this notion that even matter could be described using waves, Schrdinger proposed the now famous time-independent wave equation (3.1) [43] by modifying the classical mechanics wave equation and substituting in de Broglies relationship. This is the equation that all later quantum mechanical calculations are based on.

.
However, for most systems of interest it is computationally very expensive to solve this equation. The term that causes this dilemma is the term accounting for the electronelectron interactions of multiple electron systems. If we were to attempt to solve the exact Schrdinger equation using current computing power, this would limit reasonable calculations to those containing fewer than 100 electrons. Since transition metals contain many electrons, this restricts simulations to calculations on one to three atoms, which would be insufficient to represent metal surfaces. Therefore, instead of solving the exact Schrdinger equation, alternative numerical methods have been derived based on Eq.
(3.1) with various assumptions.
The first assumption is the BornOppenheimer approximation, which states that the electrons depend only on the position of the nucleus rather than on position and momentum of the nucleus [44] . The resulting simplified Hamiltonian to be solved assuming no magnetic moment is presented in the following equation:(3.2)

j = i + 1 n 1 r i j where the first term is the kinetic energy of the electron, the second term is due to the electronnucleus interaction and the third term is due to the electronelectron interaction. It is the third term that gives rise to the computational difficulties. The main difference between the various computational methods (HartreeFock, DFT, etc.) is from different approaches for expanding the electronelectron interaction term. The HartreeFock (HF) method effectively deals with this issue by replacing the third term with a Coulomb operator and an Exchange operator. The DFT approach, on the other hand, removes this difficulty in effect by moving away from the many electron approach.
The DFT method focuses on solving for the electron density rather than solving for the individual electrons. The HohenbergKohn theorem states that given an electron density, there is only one unique external potential which can be mapped to it [45] . Therefore, the many interacting electron systems can be correlated exactly to a system of noninteracting electrons in an effective potential. This idea led to the KohnSham (KS) single electron equations [46] (3.3) (

+ v x c where the first term in Eq.
(3.3) is the standard kinetic term and the second term expresses the KS approach by using an effective external potential,v eff . The effective external potential is expanded in Eq.
(3.4) , where the first term is the potential due to the nucleuselectron interaction, the second term is the electronelectron Coulomb interaction, and the rest of the potential is contained within the exchanged correlation potential,v x c . If the exact exchange correlation potential were known, these equations would provide the exact electron density. In the DFT approach, various functionals are used as approximations for the exchange correlation potential.
There are two main exchange correlation functionals used to implement the use of DFT, the local density approximation (LDA) [47] and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). LDA approximates the exchange correlation by using the assumption that the density behaves locally like a uniform electron cloud. This approximation provides a good starting point for DFT, however, it tends to make semiconductor systems too metallic [48] and it overpredicts bonding in molecular and solid systems [49] . To correct for this discrepancy, GGA builds on LDA by including the first derivative of the density and hence includes the first order approximation of the gradients of electron density. Most programs implement GGA exchange correlation functionals such as PBE [50]
, RPBE
[51]
, PW91
[52] , etc. Currently one of the main difficulties with improving DFT is that no systematic approach has been discovered for developing new exchange correlation functionals that would compare to the systematic approach developed for the HF methods. However, the current GGA functionals have been successfully used in a wide variety of systems and have provided a foundation to solidify DFT as a powerful predictive tool.
Once an exchange correlation is selected, the total energy can be solved for iteratively using the following steps. First, the electron density is given by making an initial guess for the KS orbitals and using the following relationship:(3.5) ρ ( r ) =
i = 1 n
φ i ( r )
2 .
This initial guess for the density is then used in Eq.
(3.4) to obtain the corresponding effective potential, which is used to solve the KS orbitals using Eq.
(3.3) . Finally, the KS orbitals are used to solve for the new electron density using Eq.
(3.5) . These steps are repeated until a certain tolerance is approached and therefore the solutions are self-consistent. The ground state energy is then given by the following equation:(3.6)

x c encompasses all the interactions not accounted for by the first three terms. This would contain the difference between the kinetic energy for the noninteracting system and the exact kinetic energy, the electron exchange repulsions, and correlation effects for both exchange and Coulomb interactions. Using the RayleighRitz variational principle, an upper bound for the ground state can be calculated for a given basis set.
There are a number of software packages available to implement the iterative approach. Two major packages are often used in the references listed in Table 1 , the open software Dacapo package [53] from the Center for Atomic-scale Materials Design (CAMD) at Denmark Technical University, and the Vienna ab-initio software package (VASP) [54] ,[55] ,[56] from the Theoretical Physics Department at the University of Vienna. Both programs are total energy molecular dynamic simulations that use pseudo-potentials to express the core electrons and planewaves for periodic boundary conditions.
The main concepts for understanding the implementation of DFT for slab calculations are the use of pseudopotentials and the method of applying the periodic boundary condition, which can significantly reduce the computation time. The computational capability is scaled as a function of the number of electrons. Therefore, if the number of electrons to be solved is reduced, the size of the system that can be modelled can be increased. One method for decreasing the total number of electrons involved is to remove the core electrons, which often do not participate in bonding interactions and only act as a shield (through orthogonality) to the nucleus charge. This is done through using a pseudopotential, which provides an effective potential in place of the core electrons. Pseudopotentials are not unique functions and they are generated using various methods. The Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials [57] are a common set used by many simulation packages. For the periodic boundary condition, this is implemented using the Blochs theorem, which shows that a wave function for an electron can be written as the product of a planewave and a periodic function (3.7) ψ n k ( r ) = e i k
r u n k ( r ) .
In order to use the planewaves as a basis, the periodic function,u n k , is expanded using planewaves resulting in the following equation:(3.8) u n k ( r ) =
G
c n ,k +
G
e i
G
r where G is the wave vectors of the reciprocal lattice vectors. In order to achieve a perfect expansion when using a planewave basis, an infinite number of planewaves is required. However, since the wave function is of finite energy, the coefficients for the higher energy planewaves must go to zero. Therefore, the planewave basis set is truncated by setting a cutoff energy. The cutoff energy required for a given precision is element dependent and has to be determined for each element of interest.
Finally, it is important to point out that while DFT has proved to be successful in predicting many trends that have been verified experimentally, there are some limitations that may result in misleading predictions [58] . In brief, the current DFT method is inadequate to accurately describe dispersion forces, charge transfer, extended π conjugation and, in some cases, bond cleavage. Thus, DFT calculations would have difficulty in predicting long-range dispersive intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding or physisorption. Charge transfer refers to such problems as Rydberg excitations due to the asymptotic potential error. The current exchange correlations underestimate molecular HOMO-LUMO band gaps, which leads to poor prediction of electron delocalization as found in π -bond conjugation. These deficiencies with the long-range representation of potential energy also often lead to poor prediction for bond dissociation as the bonds lengthen past the ground state value. Therefore, care must be taken when using DFT to predict chemical behavior if any of these conditions exist in the system of interest.
3.2. Density of states and d-band center
Ab initio calculations offer the ability to identify parameters that correlate electronic and chemical properties, which in turn provide opportunities to predict how the properties of a metal surface are modified by alloying with other metals or promoters. For transition metal surfaces, the effect of substituting one metal for another can largely be attributed to the modification in the d-orbitals, which participate largely in the bonding interaction with adsorbates. It has been further shown that the d-orbitals on the surface of the catalyst of interest can be distinguished largely by characterizing the transition metal density of states (DOS) for the d-orbitals [59] ,[60] . Specifically, it is the location of the d-band center of the DOS in relation to the Fermi level that has been correlated for many bonding interactions. There are many reviews that introduce and develop the notion of density of states and the various moments and it is highly recommended to consult these for further details [59] ,[60] .
The density of states is calculated using the solutions found to the set of single electron KS equations shown in Eq.
(3.3) . These solutions are the KS orbitals, which have no known direct physical meaning. However, since DFT solves for the electron density of a system, the sum of the squared KS orbitals is equal to the exact electron density if the exact exchange correlation functional is known. Since these KS orbitials square form the exact electron density, it has been proposed that these orbitals may have a more physical meaning [14] . Based on this assumption, the DOS is calculated by using the following numerical approximation summed over the reduced first Brillouin zone:(3.9) ρ ( ε ) =
k ω k
i β ( ε
ε i k ) where ρ is the density of states as a function of energy,ε is the absolute energy,ω k is the weight given to a given k -point,β is a broadening function that is used to interpolate the energy present between the finite number of k -points, and ε i k is the KS eigenvalue solution for a given k -point and specific orbital. This numerical approximate is used because the energy of the system is comparable at k -points that are located closely together. This fact allows an interpolation method to be used and only a finite number of k -points need to be calculated. Therefore, to put it simply, the above equation serves the same purpose as the trapezoid rule serves in simpler numerical problems. Eq.
(3.9) enables one to calculate the density of states, and subsequently the various moments, as a function of energy.
In this review, we will focus on the relationship between chemical properties and the center of d-band, which is related to the first order moment of DOS. The various moments of the DOS for any specific orbital or total sum are calculated using the following equation:(3.10) μ n =
ε n ρ ( ε
ε o ) d ε
ρ ( ε
ε o ) d ε where n is the order of the moment,ρ is the density of states,ε is the energy, and ε o is the reference energy which is commonly set to the Fermi energy. The zeroth order moment ( n = 0 ) corresponds to the total normalized number of states. The first order moment ( n = 1 ) corresponds to the average energy of the DOS, which is also referred to as the DOS band center short for center of mass. Other common moments are the mean squared width ( n = 2 ), skewness ( n = 3 ), and kurtosis ( n = 4 ) of the DOS.
There are two critical factors that contribute to the modification of the electronic properties, such as the d-band center, of an admetal on the surface of another metal. First, the geometry of the structure, for example, the average metal-metal bond length, is typically different from that of the bulk metal. This gives rise to strain effects that are known to modify the electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital overlap [61] . According to these arguments, when the surface atoms are subjected to a tensile strain, the d-orbital overlap is decreased, resulting in a sharpening of the d-band and a shift in its average energy (the d-band center) closer to the Fermi level. On the other hand, when surface atoms are under a compressive strain, the d-orbital overlaps are increased, resulting in a broadening of the d-band and a lowering of its average energy. The second factor that contributes to the modification of surface properties in bimetallic systems is the electronic interaction between the two metals. This effect, also commonly referred to as the ligand effect [62] ,[63] , arises because the presence of other metals around a metal atom changes its electronic environment, giving rise to modifications of its electronic structure and consequently, its chemical properties. The relative dominance of the strain or the ligand effects is obviously different for different bimetallic surfaces. More discussion about the two effects can be found elsewhere [38] ,[61] ,[64] . There are also other important phenomena that can affect the properties of bimetallic surfaces, such as ensemble effects and bifunctional catalysis, in which the two metals function independently. These two effects are generally not considered in most DFT modeling of electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces.
The structure of the surface d-electron bands has been shown to be a critical factor in the adsorption properties of many simple adsorbates [14] . In correlating adsorption properties with the d-band structure, it is convenient to use a single, characteristic value that is representative of the d-band. One line of reasoning is that the electrons at the Fermi level are the most energetically available electrons for reactions, suggesting the density of states at the Fermi level,ρ
F
,as a possible parameter to represent electronic properties. This, however, is only a single point in the distribution of states, and may reflect little of the d-band structure. Furthermore, there has been only limited success in understanding trends in catalysis using ρ
F
,and in many systems there is a lack of general correlation between ρ
F
and chemical properties of a surface [65] . Another choice of parameter for correlation has been the number of d-holes, or unoccupied d-states. Hammer and Nrskov have shown that the interactions between adsorbates and transition metal surfaces involve the entire d-band [14] . Therefore, a more logical choice of parameters is one that depends in a functional way on the entire d-band including both the occupied and unoccupied states, such as its average energy. The first moment of the d-band with respect to the Fermi level is the average energy of the band, also called the d-band center. An alternative choice would be the mean squared band width, or the second moment, again with respect to the Fermi level. As will be shown later, these two moments are highly correlated in bimetallic systems.
For example, Fig. 8 shows the DFT results of the surface DOS and d-band center for Pt(111) and for several Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface monolayer structures [64] . As shown in Fig. 8 (a), in each Pt-3d-Pt(111) case, the Pt d-band center is lower in energy, i.e. further away from the Fermi level, than the pure Pt slab. The magnitude of the shift in the d-band center relative to pure Pt generally increases as the subsurface metal moves to the left side in the Periodic Table, from Ni to Ti. The results indicate that the value of the surface d-band center, which is related to the surface chemical properties, can be controlled using different bimetallic combinations. Such modification effects will be illustrated throughout the remainder of this review.

(b) Calculated surface d-band DOS for subsurface 3d metal containing Pt slabs. The number of d-electrons/surface atom is shown for each band (from [64] ).
As shown in the values of
N
d in Fig. 8 (b), which is the number of d-electrons per surface Pt atom and is calculated by integrating the projected d-band DOS up to the Fermi level, remain approximately 9.3 d-electrons/Pt atom for all surfaces. Thus, the d-band filling does not appear to change substantially by the formation of the subsurface bimetallic structures. Correspondingly, the number of unoccupied d-states does not change either, thus correlations between the number of d-holes and chemical properties of these systems are not expected. This does not exclude the possibility that charge is polarized away from the surface, as has been suggested for Ni and Pd on Ta(110), for example,[66] ,[67] .
It is important to keep in mind that, when comparing DFT results reported in the literature, it is absolutely critical to pay attention to calculation details that are used in the modeling. For example, the results in Fig. 8 were calculated using the following calculation procedures: The Pt(111) surfaces were modelled using a 2×2 unit cell with four layers of metal atoms periodically repeated, and with 46 equivalent layers of vacuum (>10 Å ) separating the slabs to represent the Pt(111) surface. The four atoms in the second layer of the slab were substituted with one of the 3d transition metals from Ti to Ni. The first and second layers were allowed to relax to their lowest energy configuration, while the third and fourth layers were frozen at the bulk PtPt distance, 2.84 Å, as determined by DFT for the RPBE exchange correlation functional used in the modeling. The electronic structure was calculated with the Dacapo-2.7 code, which uses planewaves as the basis set, and ultra-soft Vanderbilt pseudopotentials to represent the core electrons [53] . A 4×4×1 MonkhorstPack k -point set was used, the planewave cutoff energy was 350 eV, the maximum symmetry constraints were applied, and spin polarization was not included. A dipole correction scheme was used to ensure the slabs were decoupled. The d-band was determined by projection of the planewaves onto spherical harmonic orbitals, with the cutoff radius at infinity. The d-band center was calculated as the first moment of the projected d-band density of states on the surface atoms referenced to the Fermi level. Overall, any change in the above procedures or parameters can lead to variations in the DFT modeling results. Therefore, a comparison between values from different papers or different research groups is only valid when identical calculation procedures are used in different studies.
3.3. Case study: DFT modeling of thermodynamic stability of 3d/Pt(111) surfaces
One of the most critical questions in MBS is the relative stability of the surface and subsurface monolayer structures. As shown earlier in Section
2.2
, the monolayer surface Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region of Pt(111) upon annealing, indicating that the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is thermodynamically more stable than the surface NiPt(111) structure in vacuum, i.e. without adsorbates on either surface. Several other investigations of Pt-3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies were covered by a Pt skin [68] ,[69] ,[70] . It has been reported experimentally that the presence of adsorbed oxygen can induce Ni segregation in Ni /Pt alloys [71] .
Ruban et al.
[29] have demonstrated the ability of using DFT to calculate the segregation energy (
E
seg ) for transition metal alloys, which is the thermodynamic driving force to move the subsurface admetal from the bulk to the surface of the host metal in vacuum. The ability to predict the segregation energy of transition metal alloys stems from two important features revealed previously by Alden et al.
[72] : (1) the surface segregation energy in transition metal alloy is essentially given by the difference in the surface energies of the pure alloy components and (2) the surface segregation energy depends strongly on the crystal structure of the alloy components. Ruban et al.
[29] have performed DFT calculations of the values of
E
seg for admetal atoms on many host substrates, utilizing the linear-muffintin-orbitals coherent potential approximation. The calculations also included spin-polarized solutions where magnetic hosts or impurities were involved. If
E
seg is sufficiently negative, the admetal will segregate to the surface to produce the surface monolayer structure. If
E
seg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer will be the host metal, leading to the formation of the subsurface monolayer structure. Christensen et al.
[73] have also utilized DFT to discuss surface alloy phases and their stability based on surface phase diagrams constructed from the surface energy as a function of the surface composition.
Greeley and Mavrikakis [31] added to the segregation energy calculations by examining the effects of adsorbates on the stability of the surface and subsurface monolayer structures. Specifically, they investigated whether a strongly bound hydrogen atom could pull the admetal out of a subsurface position. It was found that the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of
E
seg , and the difference of the hydrogen binding energy on the surface and subsurface structures. For hydrogen, which bonds relatively weakly to most transition metals, only a few bimetallic surfaces resulted in hydrogen induced segregation. It is predicted, however, that for adsorbates that have a significantly higher thermodynamic driving force, such as oxygen, CO, and sulphur, adsorbate induced segregation will play a vital role in the relative stability of the surface and subsurface monolayer structures.
In this section the DFT results of the 3d/Pt(111) systems will be utilized to demonstrate the thermodynamic stability of the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) and the surface 3d-Pt(111) structures.
Fig. 9 shows the total energy difference
Δ
E
seg , defined as the difference between the formation energy of the subsurface and surface structures in vacuum, as a function of the surface d-band center of Pt in the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) structure. The values of
Δ
E
seg are positive for all systems, predicting that the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the surface 3d-Pt(111) structures in vacuum. There is also a nearly linear trend with respect to the d-band center, with PtTiPt(111) having the largest thermodynamic driving force and PtNiPt(111) having the smallest
Δ
E
seg . This trend was verified experimentally by comparing the onset temperature for the diffusion of surface Ni atoms in PtNiPt(111) and Co atoms in PtCoPt(111) [74] . The PtCoPt(111) system was found to have a lower onset temperature for diffusion than PtNiPt(111). Using BrnstedEvansPolanyi principle, the lower onset temperature supports the larger thermodynamic driving force for Co than Ni, which is consistent with the predicted trend in Fig. 9 .

Based on the definition described in the text, a positive value means that the Pt-3d-Pt subsurface structure is thermodynamically stable (from [75] ).
The effect on the relative stability of the 3d/Pt(111) surfaces was also calculated when a half monolayer of O or H is present on the surfaces, as shown in Fig. 10 . The values of
Δ
E
seg are calculated from the difference in the total energy using the reaction coordinate shown at the top of Fig. 10 . Similar to the concepts described by Greeley and Mavrikakis [31] , the value of
Δ
E
seg is related to two terms, the value of
Δ
E
seg in vacuum and the difference in the hydrogen or oxygen binding energy between the surface and subsurface structures. Based on the definition of
Δ
E
s , a positive value means that the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt structure is more stable, while a negative value indicates that the surface 3d-Pt(111) is more thermodynamically favorable. The DFT results predict that the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structure is favored in the presence of adsorbed H. In contrast, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of half monolayer O, revealing the thermodynamic driving force for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. The segregation of subsurface Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) has been verified experimentally in the presence of adsorbed O [74] , which will be described in more detail in Section 5 .

Based on the definition described in the text, a positive value means that the Pt-3d-Pt subsurface structure is stable, while a negative value indicates the 3d-Pt surface structure is thermodynamically favored (from [75] ).
In addition, the results in Fig. 10 also reveal the general similarities and differences between MBS structures on the Pt(111) and Pt(100) substrates. Although the values of the d-band center and
Δ
E
s are different for 3d metals on Pt(111) and Pt(100), the general trend in the stability of the surface and subsurface MBS structures remain the same [75] .
3.4. Semi-empirical equation for estimating surface d-band center
Kitchin et al. have developed a semi-empirical correlation to predict the shift of surface d-band centers of MBS without performing DFT calculations [40] . The equation considers the two dominant effects that can lead to the shift in the d-band center in monolayer bimetallic systems, the strain and ligand effects. In the strain effect, the average bond lengths between the metal atoms in the MBS are typically different from those in the parent metals, resulting in changes the orbital overlap and correspondingly electronic properties. In the ligand effect, hetero-metallic bonding interactions between the electronic orbitals of surface atoms and the substrate can result in modification of the surface electronic structures. By taking into account both considerations, an empirical equation is derived that correlates the change in the electronic structures with the characteristic length of bond distance (strain effect) and of d-orbitals (ligand effect) in monolayer bimetallic systems [40] :(3.11)
V
=
7.62
( r d ( overalyer ) r d ( substrate ) ) 3 / 2 d 5 where
V
is the interatomic matrix element that is proportional to the change in the electronic structures,r d is the characteristic length for the overlayer or substrate metal that is related to the spatial extent of the d-orbitals that can be obtained from the Solid State Table in Ref.
[67] , and d is the internuclear distance between the overlayer and substrate metals. According to the tight binding theory, the d-band width should be proportional to the matrix element, which is confirmed by a linear relationship between the value of
V
and the root mean squared (rms) d-band width with numerous bimetallic surfaces [67] .
In order to correlate the d-band width with the d-band center, Kitchin et al. examined whether the formation of the bimetallic surfaces alters the filling of the surface d-band, as shown earlier in Fig. 8 . The change in d-band filling is found to be less than 2% in magnitude upon formation of many bimetallic surfaces. Using a rectangular band model, we can argue that if the d-band filling remains constant but the d-band width changes, then the average energy of the d-band (the d-band center) must change to conserve both the d-band filling and the total number of d-states.
Fig. 11 shows the linear correlation between the rms d-band width and the d-band center for both unrelaxed and relaxed slabs of many monometallic and bimetallic systems. The slope of the correlation is nearly 1, as predicted by the rectangular band model. Thus, the d-band becomes wider as it moves down in energy, i.e. the d-band center moves further from the Fermi level. Similarly, the d-band narrows as the d-band center moves closer to the Fermi level. The linear correlation between the d-band width and d-band center is an important observation because some DFT studies discuss changes in the d-band width (second-order moment of DOS) instead of the d-band center (first-order moment of DOS).

The linear correlation indicates that both parameters can be used to describe the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces (from [30] ).
The establishment of the linear relationship in Fig. 11 allows the estimation of the modification of surface d-band center using Eq.
(3.11) .
Fig. 12 shows a comparison of the shift in the d-band center calculated from the semi-empirical equation and from DFT modeling. The comparison shows a remarkable agreement between the two types of calculations for a wide range of monolayer bimetallic systems [40] . The excellent agreement offers the possibility to quickly estimate the shift in the d-band center, which is related to the modification in chemical activities of bimetallic systems, without performing the more expensive first-principle DFT calculations.

4. Correlating binding energy of adsorbates with surface d-band center
The adsorption properties of many atoms and small molecules on transition metals have been shown by Hammer and Nrskov to depend primarily on the electronic structure of the surface [14] , which is determined by its geometrical structure and chemical composition. It has been shown that the interactions between adsorbates and transition metal surfaces can be considered via a two state orbital mixing picture. The adsorbate orbitals are first broadened by interactions with the broad s-electron band, and then split by strong interactions with the sharper d-band. The authors further demonstrate that changes in the electronic structure of the surface, such as the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level, are clearly correlated with changes in the chemical properties of the surface [14] .
In this section we will use several simple atomic and molecular adsorbates, atomic H, atomic O and CO, to demonstrate that the adsorption energy is related to the surface d-band center of the MBS structures. Some of the experimental and theoretical studies are summarized in Table 2 . We will use these examples to show that there is a nearly linear relationship between the adsorption energy and the surface d-band center of bimetallic surfaces, with the adsorption energy becoming stronger when the surface d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. The results will illustrate that the formation of MBS modifies the value of the d-band center from that of the parent metal surfaces, with the direction and magnitude of the shift depending on the structure and chemical composition of the bimetallic surfaces. Such correlation provides the opportunity for the rational design of surfaces with desirable chemical properties by synthesizing MBS of specific structures and compositions.

4.1. Dissociative adsorption of hydrogen and trends in hydrogen binding energy
4.1.1. Surface and subsurface Ni /Pt structures
Through a combination of theory and experiments, the Ni /Pt MBS structures are among the most well-characterized bimetallic systems [26] ,[31] ,[32] ,[40] ,[76] ,[77] ,[78] ,[79] ,[80] . As discussed earlier in Section
2.3
, depending on the temperature of the Pt(111) substrate during or after the deposition of one monolayer Ni, the resulting surfaces can be described as either the NiPt(111) surface monolayer or the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer. A related surface, PtNi(111), can be produced by depositing one monolayer of Pt on a Ni(111) substrate at 600 K [78] . In this section we will use the adsorption energies of atomic hydrogen on these surfaces to demonstrate the unique properties of the surface and subsurface MBS structures.
Fig. 13 shows a comparison of the Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) spectra of H2 from clean Pt(111), surface monolayer NiPtPt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and a thick Ni(111) film epitaxially grown on Pt(111). It is apparent that the desorption temperature of H2 is significantly different upon the formation of bimetallic surfaces. H2 desorbs from the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure at a lower temperature than that from Pt(111) and Ni(111), while the desorption from the NiPt(111) surface structure occurs at a higher temperature than that of either parent metal surfaces.

Since the dissociative adsorption of H2 on Ni(111) and Pt(111) is not an activated process [81] , the desorption temperature of H2 from these surfaces should, in principle, be related to the respective metalH bond strengths. If one assumes that H2 dissociation on the bimetallic surfaces is also not activated, then desorption temperatures in Fig. 13 indicate a weaker metalH bond on subsurface PtNiPt(111) and a stronger metalH bond on surface NiPtPt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111).
Parallel DFT modeling is performed to understand the origin of the different hydrogen binding energy (HBE) from the four surfaces in Fig. 14 , using the Dacapo-2.6 code and with 2×2 super cells of 3-layer slabs at a 0.25 ML coverage of hydrogen atoms [26] .
