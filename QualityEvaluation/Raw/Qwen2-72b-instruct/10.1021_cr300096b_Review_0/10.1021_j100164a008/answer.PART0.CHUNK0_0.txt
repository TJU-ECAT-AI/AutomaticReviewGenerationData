1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, contributing to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to perform effectively in both fundamental research and practical applications. However, the literature does not provide specific details on the evolution or how these properties contribute to bridging the gaps.
