1.The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis and their contribution to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts is not explicitly detailed in the literature. However, the literature does show a progression of studies focusing on the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic systems, indicating an ongoing interest in understanding and utilizing these properties for catalytic applications. The unique properties of bimetallic catalysts, such as altered electronic structures and surface compositions, have been explored in various contexts, including the effect of strain and ligand effects on hydrogen evolution, the stabilization of late transition metal oxide nanoparticles on supports, and the role of charge transfer in bimetallic systems. These studies suggest that bimetallic catalysts have evolved to address specific catalytic challenges and to improve catalytic performance under industrial conditions.
