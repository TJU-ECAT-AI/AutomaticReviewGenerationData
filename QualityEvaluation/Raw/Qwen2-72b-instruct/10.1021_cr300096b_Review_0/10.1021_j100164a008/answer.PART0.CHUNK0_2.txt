1.The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis and their contribution to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts is not explicitly discussed in the literature. However, the literature does mention the use of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, including the hydrogenation of CO2, the oxidation of H2, the reduction of NOx, and the electrocatalysis of hydrogen evolution. The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts, such as the synergistic effect between the two metals, the modification of the electronic structure of the active metal by the second metal, and the creation of new active sites, are believed to contribute to their improved catalytic performance.

1.文献中没有明确讨论双金属催化剂在多相催化中的演变及其对连接模型表面与工业相关支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”的贡献。但是，文献确实提到了双金属催化剂在各种应用中的使用，包括CO2的氢化、H2的氧化、NOx的还原以及氢进化的电催化。双金属催化剂的独特电子和化学性质，如两种金属之间的协同效应、第二种金属对活性金属电子结构的修饰以及新活性位点的创建，被认为有助于其改进的催化性能。
