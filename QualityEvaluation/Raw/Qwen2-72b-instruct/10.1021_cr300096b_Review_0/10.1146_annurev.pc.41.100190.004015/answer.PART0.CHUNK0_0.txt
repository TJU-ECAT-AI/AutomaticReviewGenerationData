1.Since the commercial introduction of bimetallic catalysts, they have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis. Their unique electronic and chemical properties have contributed to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications. However, the specific details of this evolution and how these properties contribute are not provided in the literature.
