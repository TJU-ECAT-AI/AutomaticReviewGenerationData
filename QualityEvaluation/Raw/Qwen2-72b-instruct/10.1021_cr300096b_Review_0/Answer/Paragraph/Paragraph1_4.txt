The challenges in understanding the molecular level reaction mechanisms, predicting activation barriers, and investigating the stability of bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions need to be addressed through systematic studies on polycrystalline substrates and bimetallic nanoparticles. Detailed studies under non-UHV conditions are required to bridge the pressure gap. The use of bimetallic catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications has led to significant advancements in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, enabling the development of more efficient and sustainable chemical processes.
