                The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has significantly contributed to bridging the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts \[10.1021/j100164a008\]. Their unique electronic and chemical properties, such as altered electronic structures and surface compositions, have been explored in various contexts, including the effect of strain and ligand effects on hydrogen evolution, the stabilization of late transition metal oxide nanoparticles on supports, and the role of charge transfer in bimetallic systems \[10.1021/j100164a008\]. These studies suggest that bimetallic catalysts have evolved to address specific catalytic challenges and to improve catalytic performance under industrial conditions \[10.1021/j100164a008\]. The unique properties of bimetallic catalysts, such as the synergistic effects between different metals, altered surface structures, and modified electronic states, have led to improved catalytic performance in various reactions \[10.1021/ar50109a003\]. The development of bimetallic catalysts has allowed for the design of materials with tailored properties that can enhance selectivity, activity, and stability under industrial conditions \[10.1021/ar50109a003\]. This has been achieved through the precise control of the composition, structure, and morphology of the catalysts, which can be optimized for specific reactions \[10.1021/ar50109a003\]. The use of bimetallic catalysts has also facilitated the understanding of fundamental catalytic processes, as they provide a bridge between the simplified model systems and the complex industrial catalysts \[10.1021/ar50109a003\].
