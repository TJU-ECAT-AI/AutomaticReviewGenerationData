This could lead to the rational design of bimetallic catalysts with enhanced catalytic performance for specific reactions. Additionally, the stability of bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions is an important consideration, as it can affect the segregation and diffusion of metal atoms, impacting the overall catalytic activity and selectivity. Systematic studies on polycrystalline substrates and bimetallic nanoparticles are needed to bridge the materials gap, while detailed studies under non-UHV conditions are required to bridge the pressure gap.
