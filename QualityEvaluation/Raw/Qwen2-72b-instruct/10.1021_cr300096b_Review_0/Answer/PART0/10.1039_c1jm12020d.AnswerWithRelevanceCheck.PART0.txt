          Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, offering unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These catalysts have been widely developed with improved catalytic activity, and their precise microstructure and composition can be controlled under suitable reaction conditions, choice of precursor materials, and combining physical, chemical, and even biological generation methods. The advanced characterizations will pave the way for making clear the relationship between the precise microstructure of heterometallic NPs and their catalytic performance. Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals. The preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified, and synergistic catalysis over trimetallic and multimetallic NPs has also received considerable interest in recent years. Bimetallic catalysts, especially heterometallic nanoparticles (NPs), have been emerging as a type of important catalyst due to their synergistic effects between different metals. These effects lead to higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis. The catalytic activity can be well-tuned by combining two or more metals with various nanostructures, such as alloy/intermetallics, coreshell, and heterostructure. First principles studies have indicated that the synergistic effect on the performance of heterometallic nanocatalysts is subject to surface electronic states, which are greatly altered by the change of catalysts for geometric parameters, particularly related to local strain and effective atomic coordination number at the surface.
