These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system. Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts.

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to this by allowing for the rational design of catalysts with tailored reactivities. The formation of bimetallic surfaces modifies the electronic properties of the parent metals, shifting the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level. This shift affects the binding energy of both atomic and molecular adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces, providing the possibility to control the activity of these surfaces for various reactions. By understanding the correlation between the d-band center and reactivity, bimetallic catalysts can be designed to optimize performance for specific reactions, bridging the gap between fundamental research and practical applications. Bimetallic catalysts, due to their unique electronic and chemical properties that are distinctly different from those of the parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability. These properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications by providing novel catalytic properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces. The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime.

By modifying the d-band center through the formation of subsurface and surface monolayer structures, bimetallic catalysts can control the binding energies of adsorbates, leading to enhanced activities for hydrogenation and reforming reactions. However, challenges remain in understanding the molecular-level reaction mechanisms, predicting activation barriers, and translating the properties of single-crystal model surfaces to polycrystalline substrates and bimetallic nanoparticles under realistic reaction conditions. Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to this bridging by allowing for the rational design of catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability under practical reaction conditions. The ability to tune the electronic structure of the surface through the formation of bimetallic surfaces provides a means to control the adsorption energies of reactants and products, which is critical for optimizing catalytic performance. Additionally, the stability of bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions is an important consideration, as it can affect the segregation and diffusion of metal atoms, impacting the overall catalytic activity and selectivity. The use of bimetallic catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications has led to significant advancements in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, enabling the development of more efficient and sustainable chemical processes.

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, contributing to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties, such as the synergistic effects between different metals, altered surface structures, and modified electronic states, have led to improved catalytic performance in various reactions. The development of bimetallic catalysts has allowed for the design of materials with tailored properties that can enhance selectivity, activity, and stability under industrial conditions. This has been achieved through the precise control of the composition, structure, and morphology of the catalysts, which can be optimized for specific reactions. The use of bimetallic catalysts has also facilitated the understanding of fundamental catalytic processes, as they provide a bridge between the simplified model systems and the complex industrial catalysts. This has led to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes in both fundamental research and practical applications. These properties arise from the synergistic effects between the two metals, which can lead to the formation of new active sites and the stabilization of catalytically active phases under reaction conditions. Bimetallic catalysts have been widely studied and applied in various fields, including petrochemicals, fine chemicals, and environmental catalysis, demonstrating their potential to address challenges in both fundamental research and practical applications. The literature does not provide specific details on how they have evolved or how they bridge these gaps, but it is clear that they play a crucial role in catalysis research and industry.

Since the commercial introduction of bimetallic catalysts, they have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis. Their unique electronic and chemical properties have contributed to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications.

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, offering unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These catalysts have been widely developed with improved catalytic activity, and their precise microstructure and composition can be controlled under suitable reaction conditions, choice of precursor materials, and combining physical, chemical, and even biological generation methods. The advanced characterizations will pave the way for making clear the relationship between the precise microstructure of heterometallic NPs and their catalytic performance. Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals. The preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified, and synergistic catalysis over trimetallic and multimetallic NPs has also received considerable interest in recent years. Bimetallic catalysts, especially heterometallic nanoparticles (NPs), have been emerging as a type of important catalyst due to their synergistic effects between different metals. These effects lead to higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis. The catalytic activity can be well-tuned by combining two or more metals with various nanostructures, such as alloy/intermetallics, coreshell, and heterostructure. First principles studies have indicated that the synergistic effect on the performance of heterometallic nanocatalysts is subject to surface electronic states, which are greatly altered by the change of catalysts for geometric parameters, particularly related to local strain and effective atomic coordination number at the surface.

Bimetallic catalysts, with unique electronic and chemical properties, have evolved since the 1960s, initially gaining commercial interest for hydrocarbon reforming due to their distinct activities compared to monometallic catalysts. The review aims to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" by correlating model surfaces with supported catalysts for various catalytic reactions, using hydrogenation reactions as a successful example. However, it also highlights the challenges in applying fundamental surface science to predict stable bimetallic structures for catalysis.
