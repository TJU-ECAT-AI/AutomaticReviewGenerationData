Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to this by allowing for the rational design of catalysts with tailored reactivities. The formation of bimetallic surfaces modifies the electronic properties of the parent metals, shifting the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level. This shift affects the binding energy of both atomic and molecular adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces, providing the possibility to control the activity of these surfaces for various reactions. By understanding the correlation between the d-band center and reactivity, bimetallic catalysts can be designed to optimize performance for specific reactions, bridging the gap between fundamental research and practical applications.

This understanding has been applied to the rational design of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts for hydrogenation, reforming, and other reactions, offering a systematic approach to identify potential bimetallic combinations and surface structures that are potentially better than the parent metals. However, challenges remain in understanding the molecular level reaction mechanisms, predicting activation barriers, and investigating the stability of bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions. Systematic studies on polycrystalline substrates and bimetallic nanoparticles are needed to bridge the materials gap, while detailed studies under non-UHV conditions are required to bridge the pressure gap.
