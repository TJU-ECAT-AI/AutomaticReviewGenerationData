          Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, contributing to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties, such as the synergistic effects between different metals, altered surface structures, and modified electronic states, have led to improved catalytic performance in various reactions. The development of bimetallic catalysts has allowed for the design of materials with tailored properties that can enhance selectivity, activity, and stability under industrial conditions. This has been achieved through the precise control of the composition, structure, and morphology of the catalysts, which can be optimized for specific reactions. The use of bimetallic catalysts has also facilitated the understanding of fundamental catalytic processes, as they provide a bridge between the simplified model systems and the complex industrial catalysts. This has led to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes in both fundamental research and practical applications. These properties arise from the synergistic effects between the two metals, which can lead to the formation of new active sites and the stabilization of catalytically active phases under reaction conditions. Bimetallic catalysts have been widely studied and applied in various fields, including petrochemicals, fine chemicals, and environmental catalysis, demonstrating their potential to address challenges in both fundamental research and practical applications. The literature does not provide specific details on how they have evolved or how they bridge these gaps, but it is clear that they play a crucial role in catalysis research and industry.

          自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在多相催化中经历了显著的演变，有助于弥合模型表面与工业相关支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。它们独特的电子和化学性质，如不同金属之间的协同效应，改变的表面结构和修改的电子状态，导致各种反应中催化性能的提高。双金属催化剂的发展使得能够设计具有定制性质的材料，这些性质可以在工业条件下提高选择性、活性和稳定性。通过精确控制催化剂的组成、结构和形态，可以针对特定反应进行优化。双金属催化剂的使用也促进了对基本催化过程的理解，因为它们为简化模型系统和复杂工业催化剂之间提供了一座桥梁。这导致了在基础研究和实际应用中开发更高效和可持续的催化过程。这些性质源于两种金属之间的协同效应，这可能导致新活性位点的形成和催化活性相在反应条件下的稳定。双金属催化剂已在石油化工、精细化学品和环境催化等多个领域进行了广泛研究和应用，展示了其在基础研究和实际应用中解决挑战的潜力。文献没有提供它们如何演变或如何弥合这些差距的具体细节，但很明显，它们在催化研究和工业中扮演着关键角色。
