1.The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages of one metal on the surface of another, such as Ni/W, Fe/W, Pd/W, Cu/Re, Ni/Mo, etc., has recently been shown to be dramatically different from that seen for either of the metallic components separately. These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system. Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts.

1.最近的研究表明，一种金属在另一种金属表面的单层覆盖，如Ni/W，Fe/W，Pd/W，Cu/Re，Ni/Mo等，其化学行为与单独的金属成分截然不同。这些化学变化，改变了覆盖层的化学吸附和催化性质，在某些情况下，与双金属系统的结构和电子性质的变化相关联。回顾并讨论了代表性研究，以探讨其与某些双金属催化剂的特殊性质的相关性。
