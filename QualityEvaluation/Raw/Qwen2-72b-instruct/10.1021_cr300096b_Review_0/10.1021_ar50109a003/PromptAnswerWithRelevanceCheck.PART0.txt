1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, contributing to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties, such as the synergistic effects between different metals, have led to improved catalytic performance in various reactions. The development of bimetallic catalysts has allowed for the design of materials with tailored properties that can enhance selectivity, activity, and stability under industrial conditions. This has been achieved through the precise control of the composition, structure, and morphology of the catalysts, which can be optimized for specific reactions. The use of bimetallic catalysts has also facilitated the understanding of fundamental catalytic processes, as they provide a bridge between the simplified model systems and the complex industrial catalysts. This has led to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes in both fundamental research and practical applications.

1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, contributing to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties, such as altered surface structures and modified electronic states, enable them to exhibit enhanced catalytic performance and selectivity compared to monometallic counterparts. These properties arise from the synergistic effects between the two metals, which can lead to the formation of new active sites and the stabilization of catalytically active phases under reaction conditions. Bimetallic catalysts have been widely studied and applied in various fields, including petrochemicals, fine chemicals, and environmental catalysis, demonstrating their potential to address challenges in both fundamental research and practical applications.
