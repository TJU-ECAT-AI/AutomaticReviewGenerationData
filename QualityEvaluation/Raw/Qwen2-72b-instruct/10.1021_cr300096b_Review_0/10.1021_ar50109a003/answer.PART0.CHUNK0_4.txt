1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications. The literature does not provide specific details on how they have evolved or how they bridge these gaps, but it is clear that they play a crucial role in catalysis research and industry.
