1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, contributing to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties, such as altered surface structures and electronic states, enable them to exhibit enhanced catalytic activities and selectivities under practical conditions. This has been demonstrated in various applications, including the hydrogenation of alkenes, the oxidation of alcohols, and the reduction of nitro compounds. The development of bimetallic catalysts has also led to the design of more efficient and sustainable catalytic systems, addressing the challenges of using precious metals and improving the performance of catalytic processes.
