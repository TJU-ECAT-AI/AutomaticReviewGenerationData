1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, contributing to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties, such as altered surface structures and modified electronic states, enable them to exhibit enhanced catalytic performance and selectivity compared to monometallic counterparts. These properties arise from the synergistic effects between the two metals, which can lead to the formation of new active sites and the stabilization of catalytically active phases under reaction conditions. Bimetallic catalysts have been widely studied and applied in various fields, including petrochemicals, fine chemicals, and environmental catalysis, demonstrating their potential to address challenges in both fundamental research and practical applications.

1.自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中经历了显著的演变，有助于弥合模型表面与工业相关支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。它们独特的电子和化学性质，如改变的表面结构和修改的电子状态，使它们能够表现出比单金属对应物更高的催化性能和选择性。这些性质源于两种金属之间的协同效应，这可能导致新活性位点的形成和催化活性相在反应条件下的稳定。双金属催化剂已在石油化工、精细化学品和环境催化等多个领域进行了广泛研究和应用，展示了其在基础研究和实际应用中解决挑战的潜力。
