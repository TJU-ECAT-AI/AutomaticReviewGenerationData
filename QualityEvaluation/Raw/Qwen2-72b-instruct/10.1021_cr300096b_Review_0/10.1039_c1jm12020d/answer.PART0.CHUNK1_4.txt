1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. However, it does highlight the unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts, such as the synergistic effects that arise from the interaction between different metal components. These properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" by providing catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability under industrially relevant conditions. The literature also emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between catalyst structure and performance, which can guide the design and synthesis of more effective and economical catalysts for practical applications.
