1.Since the commercial introduction of bimetallic catalysts, they have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis. Their unique electronic and chemical properties have contributed to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications. Bimetallic catalysts, with their synergistic effects, have shown improved catalytic activity compared to monometallic counterparts. The combination of different metals in a single catalyst can lead to changes in the electronic structure, which benefits catalytic activity enhancement. Moreover, the presence of one metal can help to activate the catalytic substrate molecules, prevent sintering, or improve the dispersion of another metal. These properties make bimetallic catalysts promising for various catalytic reactions, including hydrogenation, oxidation, and reduction reactions. The development of synthetic techniques has allowed for the fabrication of desired structures and various composition combinations, which can further improve the catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts.
