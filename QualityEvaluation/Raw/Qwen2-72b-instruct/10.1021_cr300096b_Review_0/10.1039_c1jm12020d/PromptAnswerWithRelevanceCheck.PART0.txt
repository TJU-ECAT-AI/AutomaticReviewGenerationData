1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. However, it does highlight the unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts that contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Bimetallic catalysts often exhibit synergistic effects that enhance their catalytic activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts. The combination of two different metals in a bimetallic catalyst can lead to changes in the electronic structure and surface chemistry, which can improve the adsorption and activation of reactants and the desorption of products. These changes can result in higher catalytic activity and selectivity for specific reactions. Bimetallic catalysts can also exhibit improved stability and resistance to poisoning compared to monometallic catalysts. The unique properties of bimetallic catalysts make them attractive for both fundamental research and practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis.

1.文献没有提供自商业化引入以来双金属催化剂在异相催化中的历史概览。然而，它确实强调了双金属催化剂的独特电子和化学性质，这些性质有助于弥合模型表面和工业相关支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。双金属催化剂通常表现出协同效应，与单金属催化剂相比，可以增强其催化活性和选择性。双金属催化剂中两种不同金属的组合可以导致电子结构和表面化学的变化，这可以改善反应物的吸附和活化以及产物的解吸。这些变化可以导致更高的催化活性和对特定反应的选择性。与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂还可以表现出改进的稳定性和抗中毒性。双金属催化剂的独特性质使其成为异相催化中基础研究和实际应用的有吸引力的选择。

1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. They bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts by possessing unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties allow them to exhibit higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals. Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have been particularly important in this regard. The preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified, unlike the straightforward synthesis of bimetallic alloy NPs. Trimetallic and multimetallic NPs have also received considerable interest in recent years for their synergistic catalytic effects.

1.Since the commercial introduction of bimetallic catalysts, they have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis. Their unique electronic and chemical properties have contributed to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications. Bimetallic catalysts, with their synergistic effects, have shown improved catalytic activity compared to monometallic counterparts. The combination of different metals in a single catalyst can lead to changes in the electronic structure, which benefits catalytic activity enhancement. Moreover, the presence of one metal can help to activate the catalytic substrate molecules, prevent sintering, or improve the dispersion of another metal. These properties make bimetallic catalysts promising for various catalytic reactions, including hydrogenation, oxidation, and reduction reactions. The development of synthetic techniques has allowed for the fabrication of desired structures and various composition combinations, which can further improve the catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts.

1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications. Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) have been emerging as a type of important catalyst. Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals. Heterometallic NPs composed of two or more metal elements with various nanostructures (alloy/intermetallics, coreshell, heterostructure, etc.) via different synthesis approaches have presented improved physical and chemical properties compared to their monometallic NPs in many fields, especially in catalysis. The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be well tuned by varying the size, composition and atomic ordering. Alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metal-metal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit. Coreshell NPs are in the frontier of advanced materials chemistry among the various bimetallic NPs and are of great importance and interest owing to their physical and chemical properties that are strongly dependent on the structure of the core, shell, and interface, and also quite different from those of monometallic counterparts and alloys.

Bimetallic catalysts, especially heterometallic nanoparticles (NPs), have been emerging as a type of important catalyst due to their synergistic effects between different metals. These effects lead to higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis. The preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified, allowing for the precise modification of the catalyst surface by introducing another component or changing the morphology, which facilitates the controlled tuning of catalytic properties. The catalytic activity can be well-tuned by combining two or more metals with various nanostructures, such as alloy/intermetallics, coreshell, and heterostructure. First principles studies have indicated that the synergistic effect on the performance of heterometallic nanocatalysts is subject to surface electronic states, which are greatly altered by the change of catalysts for geometric parameters, particularly related to local strain and effective atomic coordination number at the surface.
