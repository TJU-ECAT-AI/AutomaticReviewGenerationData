1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications by providing a synergistic effect that enhances catalytic performance. Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have higher activities than monometallic counterparts due to the synergistic effects between the two metals. The preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified, and synergistic catalysis over trimetallic and multimetallic NPs has also received considerable interest in recent years.

1.自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中经历了显著的演变。它们独特的电子和化学性质通过提供协同效应，增强了催化性能，从而在基础研究和实际应用中，弥合了模型表面和工业相关支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。双金属纳米颗粒（NPs）具有合金和核心壳结构，由于两种金属之间的协同效应，其活性高于单金属对应物。双金属核心壳NPs的制备策略既灵活又多样化，近年来，三金属和多金属NPs的协同催化也引起了相当大的兴趣。
