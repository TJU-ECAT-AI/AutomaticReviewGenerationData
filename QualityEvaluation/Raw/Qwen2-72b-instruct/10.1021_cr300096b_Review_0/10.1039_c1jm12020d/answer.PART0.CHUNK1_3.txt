1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. However, it does highlight the unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts that contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These properties include the synergistic effects between the two metals, which can lead to improved catalytic activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts. The literature also discusses various strategies for synthesizing bimetallic catalysts with controlled compositions and structures, which can further enhance their catalytic performance.

1.文献没有提供自商业化引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中演变的历史概览。但是，它确实强调了双金属催化剂的独特电子和化学性质，这些性质有助于弥合模型表面和工业相关支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。这些性质包括两种金属之间的协同效应，这可能导致与单金属催化剂相比，催化活性和选择性得到改善。文献还讨论了合成具有受控组成和结构的双金属催化剂的各种策略，这可以进一步提高其催化性能。
