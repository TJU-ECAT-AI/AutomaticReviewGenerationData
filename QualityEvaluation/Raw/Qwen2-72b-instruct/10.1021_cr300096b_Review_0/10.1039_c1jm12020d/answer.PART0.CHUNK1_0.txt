1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. However, it does highlight the unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts that contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Bimetallic catalysts often exhibit synergistic effects that enhance their catalytic activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts. The combination of two different metals in a bimetallic catalyst can lead to changes in the electronic structure and surface chemistry, which can improve the adsorption and activation of reactants and the desorption of products. These changes can result in higher catalytic activity and selectivity for specific reactions. Bimetallic catalysts can also exhibit improved stability and resistance to poisoning compared to monometallic catalysts. The unique properties of bimetallic catalysts make them attractive for both fundamental research and practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis.

1.文献没有提供自商业化引入以来双金属催化剂在异相催化中的历史概览。然而，它确实强调了双金属催化剂的独特电子和化学性质，这些性质有助于弥合模型表面和工业相关支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。双金属催化剂通常表现出协同效应，与单金属催化剂相比，可以增强其催化活性和选择性。双金属催化剂中两种不同金属的组合可以导致电子结构和表面化学的变化，这可以改善反应物的吸附和活化以及产物的解吸。这些变化可以导致更高的催化活性和对特定反应的选择性。与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂还可以表现出改进的稳定性和抗中毒性。双金属催化剂的独特性质使其成为异相催化中基础研究和实际应用的有吸引力的选择。
