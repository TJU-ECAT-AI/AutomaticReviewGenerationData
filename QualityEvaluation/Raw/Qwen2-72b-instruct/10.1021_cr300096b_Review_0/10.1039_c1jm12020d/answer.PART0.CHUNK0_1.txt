1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. They bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts by possessing unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties allow them to exhibit higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals. Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals. The preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified. Synergistic catalysis over trimetallic and multimetallic NPs has also received considerable interest in recent years.

1.自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中经历了显著的演变。它们通过拥有独特的电子和化学性质，弥合了模型表面和工业相关支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。这些性质使它们在催化作用中表现出比单金属对应物更高的活性，这是由于两种金属之间的协同效应。具有合金和核壳结构的双金属纳米颗粒由于两种金属之间的协同效应，其活性高于单金属对应物。双金属核壳纳米颗粒的制备策略灵活多样。近年来，三金属和多金属纳米颗粒的协同催化也引起了相当大的兴趣。
