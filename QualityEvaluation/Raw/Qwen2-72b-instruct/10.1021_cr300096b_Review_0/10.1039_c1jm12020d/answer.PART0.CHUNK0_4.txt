1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications. Bimetallic catalysts, especially heterometallic nanoparticles (NPs), have been emerging as a type of important catalyst due to their synergistic effects between different metals. These effects lead to higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis. The preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified, allowing for the precise modification of the catalyst surface by introducing another component or changing the morphology, which facilitates the controlled tuning of catalytic properties. The catalytic activity can be well-tuned by combining two or more metals with various nanostructures, such as alloy/intermetallics, coreshell, and heterostructure. First principles studies have indicated that the synergistic effect on the performance of heterometallic nanocatalysts is subject to surface electronic states, which are greatly altered by the change of catalysts for geometric parameters, particularly related to local strain and effective atomic coordination number at the surface.

1.自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在多相催化领域经历了显著的演变。它们独特的电子和化学性质有助于弥合模型表面与工业相关支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”，在基础研究和实际应用中均发挥着重要作用。特别是异金属纳米粒子（NPs）作为一类重要的催化剂，由于不同金属之间的协同效应，其催化活性高于单金属同类物。双金属核壳NPs的制备策略灵活多样，通过引入另一种成分或改变形态，可以精确地修饰催化剂表面，从而实现催化性质的可控调节。通过组合两种或更多金属形成各种纳米结构（如合金/金属间化合物、核壳和异质结构），可以很好地调节催化活性。第一性原理研究表明，异金属纳米催化剂的协同效应受表面电子状态的影响，这种状态会因催化剂几何参数的改变而发生显著变化，特别是与表面局部应变和有效原子配位数相关。
