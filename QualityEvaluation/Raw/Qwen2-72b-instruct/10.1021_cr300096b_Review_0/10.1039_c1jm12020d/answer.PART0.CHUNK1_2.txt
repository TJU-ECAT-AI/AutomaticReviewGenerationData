1.Since their commercial introduction, bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis, offering unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These catalysts have been widely developed with improved catalytic activity, and their precise microstructure and composition can be controlled under suitable reaction conditions, choice of precursor materials, and combining physical, chemical, and even biological generation methods. The advanced characterizations will pave the way for making clear the relationship between the precise microstructure of heterometallic NPs and their catalytic performance.
