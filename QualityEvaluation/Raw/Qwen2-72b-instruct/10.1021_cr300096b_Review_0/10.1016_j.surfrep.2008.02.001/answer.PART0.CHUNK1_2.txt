1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, offering unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These catalysts have been extensively studied in both fundamental research and practical applications, providing insights into the correlation between electronic properties and catalytic activities. The formation of bimetallic surfaces modifies the electronic properties of the parent metals, with the surface d-band center being a useful parameter to represent these changes. The shifts in the surface d-band center affect the binding energy of both atomic and molecular adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces, providing the possibility to control the activity of these surfaces for various reactions. This understanding has been applied to the rational design of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts for hydrogenation, reforming, and other reactions, offering a systematic approach to identify potential bimetallic combinations and surface structures that are potentially better than the parent metals. However, challenges remain in understanding the molecular level reaction mechanisms, predicting activation barriers, and investigating the stability of bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions. Systematic studies on polycrystalline substrates and bimetallic nanoparticles are needed to bridge the materials gap, while detailed studies under non-UHV conditions are required to bridge the pressure gap.

1.自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在多相催化中经历了显著的演变，提供了独特的电子和化学性质，弥合了模型表面和工业相关的支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。这些催化剂在基础研究和实际应用中得到了广泛的研究，为电子性质和催化活性之间的相关性提供了见解。双金属表面的形成改变了母体金属的电子性质，表面d带中心是一个有用的参数，可以表示这些变化。表面d带中心的偏移影响了双金属表面上原子和分子吸附物的结合能，为控制这些表面的活性提供了可能性。这种理解已被应用于氢化、重整和其他反应的双金属表面和催化剂的合理设计，提供了一种系统的方法来识别潜在的双金属组合和表面结构，这些组合和结构可能比母体金属更好。然而，理解分子水平反应机制、预测活化能垒和在反应条件下研究双金属表面稳定性等挑战仍然存在。需要在多晶基底和双金属纳米颗粒上进行系统研究，以弥合材料差距，而在非UHV条件下进行详细研究是弥合压力差距所必需的。
