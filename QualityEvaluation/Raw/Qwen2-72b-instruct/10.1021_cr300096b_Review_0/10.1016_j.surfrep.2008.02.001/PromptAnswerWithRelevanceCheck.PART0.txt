1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to this by allowing for the rational design of catalysts with tailored reactivities. The formation of bimetallic surfaces modifies the electronic properties of the parent metals, shifting the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level. This shift affects the binding energy of both atomic and molecular adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces, providing the possibility to control the activity of these surfaces for various reactions. By understanding the correlation between the d-band center and reactivity, bimetallic catalysts can be designed to optimize performance for specific reactions, bridging the gap between fundamental research and practical applications.

1.自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在多相催化中经历了显著的演变，弥合了模型表面与工业相关的支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。它们独特的电子和化学性质通过允许设计具有定制反应性的催化剂来促成这一点。双金属表面的形成改变了母金属的电子性质，相对于费米能级移动了表面d带中心。这种移动影响了双金属表面上原子和分子吸附物的结合能，为控制这些表面的活性提供了可能性。通过理解d带中心与反应性之间的相关性，可以设计双金属催化剂以优化特定反应的性能，从而弥合基础研究与实际应用之间的差距。

1.The document does not provide a historical overview of the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. However, it does highlight that bimetallic catalysts, due to their unique electronic and chemical properties that are distinctly different from those of the parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability. These properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications by providing novel catalytic properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces. The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime.

1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, offering unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These catalysts allow for the rational design of materials with tailored electronic properties, enabling the prediction of catalytic activities and selectivities based on the position of the surface d-band center relative to the Fermi level. By modifying the d-band center through the formation of subsurface and surface monolayer structures, bimetallic catalysts can control the binding energies of adsorbates, leading to enhanced activities for hydrogenation and reforming reactions. However, challenges remain in understanding the molecular-level reaction mechanisms, predicting activation barriers, and translating the properties of single-crystal model surfaces to polycrystalline substrates and bimetallic nanoparticles under realistic reaction conditions.

1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, offering unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These catalysts have been extensively studied in both fundamental research and practical applications, providing insights into the correlation between electronic properties and catalytic activities. The formation of bimetallic surfaces modifies the electronic properties of the parent metals, with the surface d-band center being a useful parameter to represent these changes. The shifts in the surface d-band center affect the binding energy of both atomic and molecular adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces, providing the possibility to control the activity of these surfaces for various reactions. This understanding has been applied to the rational design of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts for hydrogenation, reforming, and other reactions, offering a systematic approach to identify potential bimetallic combinations and surface structures that are potentially better than the parent metals. However, challenges remain in understanding the molecular level reaction mechanisms, predicting activation barriers, and investigating the stability of bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions. Systematic studies on polycrystalline substrates and bimetallic nanoparticles are needed to bridge the materials gap, while detailed studies under non-UHV conditions are required to bridge the pressure gap.

1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to this bridging by allowing for the rational design of catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability under practical reaction conditions. The ability to tune the electronic structure of the surface through the formation of bimetallic surfaces provides a means to control the adsorption energies of reactants and products, which is critical for optimizing catalytic performance. Additionally, the stability of bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions is an important consideration, as it can affect the segregation and diffusion of metal atoms, impacting the overall catalytic activity and selectivity. The use of bimetallic catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications has led to significant advancements in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, enabling the development of more efficient and sustainable chemical processes.
