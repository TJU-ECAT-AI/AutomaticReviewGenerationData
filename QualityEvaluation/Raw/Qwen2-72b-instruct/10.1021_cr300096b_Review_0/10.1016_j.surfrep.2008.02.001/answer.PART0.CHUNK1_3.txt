1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to this bridging by allowing for the rational design of catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability under practical reaction conditions. The ability to tune the electronic structure of the surface through the formation of bimetallic surfaces provides a means to control the adsorption energies of reactants and products, which is critical for optimizing catalytic performance. Additionally, the stability of bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions is an important consideration, as it can affect the segregation and diffusion of metal atoms, impacting the overall catalytic activity and selectivity. The use of bimetallic catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications has led to significant advancements in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, enabling the development of more efficient and sustainable chemical processes.
