1.Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, offering unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These catalysts allow for the rational design of materials with tailored electronic properties, enabling the prediction of catalytic activities and selectivities based on the position of the surface d-band center relative to the Fermi level. By modifying the d-band center through the formation of subsurface and surface monolayer structures, bimetallic catalysts can control the binding energies of adsorbates, leading to enhanced activities for hydrogenation and reforming reactions. However, challenges remain in understanding the molecular-level reaction mechanisms, predicting activation barriers, and translating the properties of single-crystal model surfaces to polycrystalline substrates and bimetallic nanoparticles under realistic reaction conditions.

1.自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在多相催化领域经历了显著的演变，提供了独特的电子和化学性质，弥合了模型表面与工业相关的支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。这些催化剂允许设计具有定制电子性质的材料，使我们能够根据表面d带中心相对于费米能级的位置预测催化活性和选择性。通过形成亚表面和表面单层结构，双金属催化剂可以控制吸附物的结合能，从而增强氢化和重整反应的活性。然而，理解分子水平的反应机制、预测活化能垒以及将单晶模型表面的性质转化为实际反应条件下的多晶基底和双金属纳米颗粒仍然存在挑战。
