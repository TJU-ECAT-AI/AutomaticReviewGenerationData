1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. However, it does highlight that bimetallic catalysts, due to their unique electronic and chemical properties that are distinctly different from those of the parent metals, offer opportunities to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability. These properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications by providing novel catalytic properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces.

1.文献没有提供自双金属催化剂商业化引入以来在多相催化中演变的历史概览。但是，它确实强调了双金属催化剂由于其独特的电子和化学性质与母金属明显不同，提供了获得具有增强的选择性、活性和稳定性的新型催化剂的机会。这些性质通过在基础研究和实际应用中提供在任一母金属表面上均不存在的新型催化性质，有助于弥合模型表面与工业相关支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。
