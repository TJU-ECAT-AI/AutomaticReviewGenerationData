Bimetallic catalysts have emerged as a significant advancement in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, offering unique properties and applications that bridge the gap between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The evolution of these catalysts has been driven by the need to enhance catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in various chemical processes. Bimetallic catalysts, composed of two different metals, exhibit synergistic effects that can significantly alter the electronic and geometric properties of the active sites compared to their monometallic counterparts. This synergy often leads to improved catalytic performance, making bimetallic catalysts highly sought after in industrial applications. Their unique properties have been harnessed in various sectors, including petrochemicals, fine chemicals, and environmental remediation, where they facilitate reactions such as hydrogenation, oxidation, and hydrodesulfurization. By combining the strengths of different metals, bimetallic catalysts offer a versatile tool for catalysis, enabling the design of more efficient and sustainable chemical processes.
