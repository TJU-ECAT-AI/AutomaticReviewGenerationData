INTRODUCTION 
Bimetallic surface chemistry plays a crucial role in a number of tech­
nologically important areas, including catalysis, magneto-optical films, 
microelectronics fabrication, electrochemistry, corrosion passivation, and 
structural materials. With the advent of ultrahigh vacuum surface ana­
lytical techniques and the development of efficient methods for surface 
preparation, it has become possible since approximately 1970 to prepare 
clean single-crystal bimetallic surfaces that are well characterized with 
respect to the geometric locations of the two different metal elements and 
that are very homogeneous in this surface structure (i.e. having an ideal 
surface unit cell with few defects in repeating this unit across the surface). 
These well-defined bimetallic surfaces have offered for the first time an 
ability to correlate surface chemical reactivity with atomic-level surface 
structure. Such structure/function relationships must ultimately form the 
basis for any predictive ability in tailor-making bimetallic surfaces to have 
desirable reactive properties. This recognition has motivated a great deal 
of stud 
y over the past two decades concerning the structure of single-crystal 
bimetallic surfaces and their surface reactivity with respect to adsorption, 
desorption, decomposition reactions, and catalytic processes. Although 
this field is still in its infancy, a great deal has already been learned and 
trends arc beginning to emerge that give some predictive ability with 
respect to the surface structures assumed by bimetallic surfaces and their 
corresponding reactivity toward simple molecules. The aim of this chapter

is to review some of thes(: trends and to give selected examples of each, 
with particular emphasis on systems that have been studied because of 
their inherent interest to bimetallic catalysis. This is not intended to be an 
exhaustive review of bimetallic surface chemistry. For example, the many 
excellent spectroscopic and quantum mechanical studies that address the 
valence-band electronic structure of bimetallic surfaces have not been 
reviewed in any detail. The many investigations of the oxidation and 
corrosion of well-defined bimetallic surfaces have also largely been omitted 
here, in preference for systems of more catalytic interest. 
To aid the reader in the use of the reference list here, we have followed 
most citations in that list with a designation such as ":A/B(ijk)," which 
indicates that the adsorption of metal A on the (ijk) plane of substrate B 
was studied in that paper. 
RULES GOVERNING BIMETALLIC SURFACE 
STRUCTURE 
By using a variety of surface structural methods such as low-energy elec­
tron diffraction (LEED), ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS), X-ray scat­
tering/diffraction techniques, electron diffraction or forward-scattering 
effects in Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS), photoemission of adsorbed xenon (PAX), and surface 
extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (SEXAFS), experimentalists 
have now characterized (in varying degrees of detail) the structures of 
numerous bimetallic surfaclԧs. These surfaces have typically been prepared 
by one of two methods: (a) by cutting and polishing a bulk single-crystal 
alloy or intermetallic compound of the two elements followed by cleaning 
and annealing in URV, or (b) by vapor deposition of one metal onto a 
clean and well-defined single-crystal surface of the second pure metal in 
URV. Far more systems exhibiting surface crystallinity have been 
prepared 
by the second method. In both methods, control over the sample tem­
perature must be exercised, since changes in temperature can cause several 
types of structural or compositional changes to occur in the surface region, 
as is discussed below. 
Surface Structures Starting From Bulk Alloys 
Before discussing surface structures obtained from bulk alloys, it is useful 
to review a few dominant concepts covering bulk structure in bimetallics. 
Consider the bimetallic AB. Roughly speaking, if A-B bonds are stronger 
than the average of A-A and B-B bond strengths, then alloy formation is 
exothermic (assuming pairwise additivity). Exothermic alloys are usually 
ordered below some critical temperature and disordered above. Highly

ordered alloys are also referred to as intermetallic compounds. Endo­
thermic alloys form solid solutions above some (concentration-dependent) 
critical temperature, and segregated phases below that. The critical tem­
perature can be quite low, so that metastable solid solutions can frequently 
be prepared. In dealing with two metals that have the same bulk crystalline 
structure with lattice parameters that are not too different, crystalline solid 
solutions are frequently seen. Nearly random substitutional alloys can 
result when alloy formation is close to thermoneutral. Textbooks con­
cerning the physics and thermochemistry of bulk alloys can be consulted 
for more detail (la,b). Excellent tabulations exist of bulk phase diagrams 
(2a,b, 3), crystal structures (4,5), and thermodynamic properties (6, 7a,b) 
of bulk binary alloys. 
ORDERED ALLOYS OR INTERMETALLIC COMPOUNDS 
In a very few cases, 
crystalline bimetallic surfaces have been prepared starting from single­
crystal intermetallic compounds in which the surface has been shown to 
approximate ideal truncation of the bulk crystal structure (Le. where an 
imaginary cleavage plane can be drawn through the bulk crystal, and the 
atoms near this surface do not move relative to their bulk positions upon 
separating the two halves of the crystal). The CU3Au(lOO) (8), Ni3AI(001) 
(9), Ni3AI(l11) (10), Ni3AI(l lO) (11), NiAl(IlO) (12a), NiAI(111) (l2b), 
and TiPt3(lOO) (13a) surfaces can all be prepared to give sharp pel x 1) 
LEED patterns and surface compositions indicative of nearly ideal bulk 
truncation. [A similar conclusion for TiPt3(III) (13a) has been challenged 
in a later study (l3b).] In these structures, there is no movement of the 
atoms of the topmost atomic plane laterally (along the surface) relative to 
their ideal bulk-like positions. However, for systems that have been 
analyzed by quantitative LEED (8-12b), a slight (1-3%) movement of 
these atoms outward or inward (normal to the surface) from their bulk 
positions is generally observed. These displacements are generally different 
for atoms of the two different elements. For the case of NiAI(l lO) (12a), 
these displacements arc somewhat larger than usual, as shown in Figure 
I. The mechanism of this surface rippling has been theoretically addressed 
with all-electron local density linearized APW calculations of this system 
(l2c), and was discussed in terms of charge-transfer effects. 
SURFACE SEGREGATION 
In a much larger number of alloy systems, evi­
dence is seen for surface segregation resulting in strong enrichment by one 
component. The concentration in the topmost atomic plane seems to be 
most conveniently probed by low-energy, rare-gas ion scattering spec­
troscopy (ISS), which is sensitive to the topmost atomic planc only (14a­
c). Surface segregation can occur when the bulk is an ordered or a dis­
ordered alloy, or when it is a solid solution. A detailed review of surface

segregation is beyond the scope of this paper. However, this subject has 
been beautifully treated in a number of reviews (l5-17a,b). Some simple 
rules for surface segregation have been developed largely from experi­
mentally observed trends coupled with theoretical considerations of pair­
wise-additive interaction energies within various statistical mechanical 
models: 
1. Surface enrichment frequently occurs in the element with the lower 
heat of sublimation (metal·-metal bond strength) (15, 17a,b). If the atoms 
are of substantially different radius (2) 10%), segregation of the larger 
element may instead occur as a result of the contribution of strain energy 
terms to the enthalpy of segregation (15). A more general statement that 
takes this effect largely into consideration is: Surface enrichment usually 
occurs in the element with the lower surface energy per unit area, which 
is roughly proportional to its heat of sublimation (per mole) divided by 
the square of its atomic diameter. 
2. If alloy formation is extremely exothermic, this tendency for surface 
segregation can be overcome (15). The section on Surface Structures 
starting from Bulk Alloys, above, lists a few systems for which this seems 
to be the case. 
3. To quantify the degree of concentration enrichment, it is necessary 
to minimize an expression for the free energy, and thus to consider the 
entropy of mixing. The en 
tropic contributions can usualIy be approxi­
mated acc.urately 
within a regular-solution cell model) (IS). However, lattice vibrational 
entropy has been shown to make an important contribution in at least one 
case (18). 
4. For exothermic alloys, a depletion of the element that is enriched in 
the topmost layer is frequently seen in the second layer. For endothermic

alloys, surface enrichment is largely limited to the topmost atomic layer 
unless the sample is cooled to near the critical demixing temperature, 
where enrichment in the second layer can become large (15). 
Although these types of models based on pairwise-additive interaction 
energies give qualitative (15, 17a,b) and sometimes even quantitative (15, 
16, 19) predictions of experimental segregation behavior, the interaction 
potentials are nevertheless quite crude. Recently, very sophisticated theor­
etical models of surface segregation (16) that give excellent quantitative 
agreement with experimental results have been accomplished for specific 
systems by using theoretical techniques such as the tetrahedron approxi­
mation of the cluster variation method (20) or the so-called embedded­
atom slab method (21) for calculating thc total encrgy of the necessary 
configurations of the two elements. 
Semi-empirical methods have been developed for predicting heats of 
solution, segregation, and adsorption in bimetallic systems, based upon 
data from pure metals such as electron densities and work functions (22, 
23) or surface core-level binding energy shifts of equivalent-core ions (24). 
Useful tabulations of such energies for many metal-metal combinations 
can be found in Refs. (22, 23). 
Even 
when strong surface segregation has occurred, it is possible that 
the 
surface will still show a sharp LEED pattern. For example, Pt segregates to 
the surfaces of PtsoNiso(11l) and Pt78Ni22(1l1) after annealing at 1170K 
in URV, giving '" 95 at. 
% Pt concentration in the topmost atomic layer 
and a very sharp p( 
1 x I) LEED pattern (25). In this case, the second 
layer is nearly pure Ni (ԤSO%), and the third layer is very rich in Pt again 
(",75%). The square (100) surface of Pt79C021 shows nearly pure Pt in 
the topmost atomic layer and a LEED pattern indicative of a hexagonal 
Pt monolayer (26a,b), similar to the (5 x 20) reconstruction of pure Pt(lOO). 
Annealed CUo.16Nio.84(111 
) gives an ordered Cu( 
II 
I 
)-like monolayer on 
the surface (14a). The annealed Pd67Ag33(111) and Pd7sCu2s(l11) surfaces 
both show sharp p(1 x \) LEED patterns with some segregation (of Ag 
or 
Cu) to the topmost layer (12S). These are thought to have a quasirandom 
distribution of the two elements in the topmost plane. 
Bimetallic Surface Structures Obtained by Va
por 
Deposition of One Metal 
The vapor deposition of one metal onto a single-crystal surface of the 
second metal is another method for preparing bimetallic surfaces. This 
method has the advantage that the whole surface composition range is 
easily accessible. A huge number of crystalline bimetallic surface structures 
giving distinct LEED patterns have been 
prepared in 
this way. A tabulation 
of such patterns in 1979 by Biberian & Somorjai already required 152

references (27), and many new structures have been observed since then. 
Most of these types of structures have resulted from using a combination 
of two immiscible metals or, if working with metals that aIloy, maintaining 
the temperature low enough to prevent any penetration of the deposited 
metal below the surface of the substrate metal. These are true overlayer 
systems. 
TRUE METAL OVER 
LAYERS 
Consider the vapor deposition of adsorbate 
metal A upon substrate metal B. There are several general types of growth 
modes that develop with increasing coverage beyond a monolayer, depend­
ing largely upon the relative A-A, B-B, and A-B bond strengths or more 
specifically, upon the relative surface energies of pure A(YA), pure B(YB), 
and interface YS.B' (Remember that YA is proportional to the heat of sub­
limation of pure A.) These modes, which have been thoroughly reviewed 
by Argile & Rhead (262) (along with a compilation of some 440 inves­
tigations) and previously by others (28, 29), include the [oIlowing: 
I .  The ideal layer-by-Iayer or Frank van der Merwe (FM) mode, which 
strictly holds at equilibrium only for zero misfit or if A and B are identical. 
The "surface energy mismatch" parameter, r AB = 21(YA -YB)!(YA 
+YB)I, is 
generally less than", 1/2 for systems in which this mode is observed (even 
if only under non-equilibrium conditions) (28). The geometric require­
ments for crystalline superlattices have also been weIl outlined (28). 
2. The Stranski-Krastanov (SK) mode, whereby three-dimensional 
crystalline islands of pure A begin to aggregate after one or a few smooth 
monolayers of A. This situation obtains for most systems at equilibrium 
and occurs essentiaIly because the heat of adsorption of A onto the A 
monolayer (or bilayer) on B becomes smaIler than the cohesive energy of 
A in pure A. The A-A bonding in the second or third layer can easily be 
weaker than that in pure A because of electronic effects of B on the first 
monolayer A atoms, or because the substrate lattice geometry forces the 
first layer(s) of A to assume strained bond distances. 
3. The Volmer-Weber (VW) mode, whereby 3-d islands of pure A grow 
even from the lowest coverages, without a smooth monolayer ever being 
formed. This can occur when the heat of adsorption of A on B is lower 
than the cohesive energy of pure A. 
Throughout this paper, absolute coverages (8) will refer to the number 
of adatoms per substrate surface atom, and relative coverages (8*) will 
refer to the fraction of the closest-packed monolayer. From a surface 
reactivity point of view, overlayer systems are most interesting in the 
submonolayer coverage regime in which the two metals are intimately 
contacting each other and therefore display geometric, electronic, and 
chemisorptive properties that are significantly distinguishable from the

781 
pure elements. [These unique properties can sometimes be maintained to 
several monolayers of coverage if a strained, pseudomorphic overlayer 
persists (272, 277).] 
There are also numerous distinct classes of growth modes that develop 
within the first monolayer itself depending upon the electronic nature and 
size of the adatom, the substrate element, the substrate surface geometry, 
and the temperature. I consider here only cases in which the first monolayer 
nears completion before the second layer or 3-d clusters appear (i.e. non 
Volmer-Weber modes). The most important characteristics for predicting 
which of these growth modes will be assumed are: (a) the nature of 
the lateral adatom-adatom interactions, and (b) the degree to which the 
potential energy for the adsorbate varies as the adsorbate moves laterally 
along the surface. This latter feature is largely determined by the atomic­
scale roughness or corrugation of the substrate, but it also depends on the 
strength and nature of the A- B bond. 
Lateral adatom-adatom interaction energies 
The effective ada 
tom­
adatom (A-A) interaction energies along the surface can be probed rela­
tively directly whenever the adlayer can be thermally desorbed without 
removing substrate metal. Here, thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) 
will show a submonolayer desorption peak temperature that either 
increases or decreases with increasing coverage of adsorbate (f) 
A), as shown 
in Figure 2 for the systems Ag/Ru(OOOI) (32) and Bi/Pt(l ll) (33). With 
proper kinetic modeling (32, 49), these TDS lineshapes versus coverage 
can be used to determine the variation in both the desorption energy (Ed) 
and desorption pre-exponential (Vd) with increasing coverage. Since the 
adsorption of metals on other metals has never been shown to require any 
activation energy, the heat of adsorption (Ea) is directly given by this 
desorption energy (Ea = Ed). On defect-free, low Miller index surfaces, the 
first ǈ 
20% of a monolayer of adatoms can 
usually 
be expected 
to populate 
the same sites. Thus, the variation in Ea with 0 
A in the range 0 S 0 
A S 0.2 
clearly reflects the effective lateral A-A attractions or repulsions. Adlayer 
systems that show a TDS peak shifting to higher temperature with increas­
ing coverage generally have net A-A attractions, and those showing a shift 
to lower temperatures have A-A repulsions. The system Ag/Ru(OOOl ), for 
example, shows a 10 kcal/mole (ǈ17%) increase in Ea over this coverage 
range (Figure 2); and Ni/W(l l O) shows a 7 kcal/mole increase (34). The 
variation in Ea with coverage shows structure in these "attractive" systems 
that has been attributed to formation of dimers and larger clusters of 
adsorbate atoms. The system Bi/Pt(l ll), on the other hand, shows net 
repulsive lateral interactions that cause Ea to decrease by '" 7 kcal/mole 
(ǈ9%) for 0Bi = 0 ---->
 0.2 (Figure 2). Even stronger repulsive interactions

are seen with alkali adlayers in which Ea decreases by as much as 35% in 
this coverage range (35-37). In the system Na/Ni(lll), for example, a 
decrease of 20 kcal/mole is seen (35). 
By comparing the coverage dependence of Ea for a large number of 
adsorbed metals on densely-packed transition metal, noble metal, and 
aluminum substrates, Bauer and coworkers (30, 31) have concluded that 
the nature of the net adsorbate-adsorbate lateral interaction depends 
largely on the electronic structure of the free adsorbate atom. By examining 
the coverage dependence of TDS spectra for the many systems reviewed 
in the present paper, it appears that their conclusion is also generally true 
even for the very open (i.e. corrugated) substrate surfaces. Thus, d'"sn-type 
transition and noble metal adatoms show attractive lateral interactions on 
almost all substrates. The Sl- and s2-type alkali and alkaline earth metals 
show strongly repulsive net lateral interactions; and, metals with s2pn 
configurations like Sb, Bi, Pb, TI, Te, Hg, etc show weakly repulsive net 
lateral interactions in the adlayer. Aluminum adatoms seem to be an 
exception here, since AI/Ru(OOOI) shows some tendency to cluster (112). 
Lanthanum (38) and the lanthanide elements (39, 40) seem also to have 
repulsive lateral interactions, although there may be some questions here 
concerning Eu and Tb. For these, the E" values obtained from TDS curve 
fitting was found to be nearly independent of coverage below 0A ǥ 0.2, 
yet Vd was observed to markedly increase with coverage in this 
same range 
(40). Thus, in the case of Eu/W(llO), for example, the desorption spectra 
broadened rapidly to lower temperature with increasing coverage, exactly 
as normally expected for repulsive lateral interactions . The large change 
in Vd without change in Ea seems counterintuitive; so these results may 
bear verification or may indicate large error bars at low coverage. 
Another point should be made about such TDS peaks which shift to 
lower temperature with coverage, yet where curve analysis indicates an 
increasing or constant Ed' First, note that the transition state for desorption 
of metal adatoms resembles the gas phase atom much more closely than 
the adsorbate itself. Thus, the value of Ed closely reflects the enthalpy 
change for desorption, whereas its Gibb's free-energy change (AG) is 
more closely related to the actual desorption rate constant (kd) at a given 
temperature. [Within transition-state theory kd = (kTlh) exp ( -AGijRT).] 
Since inspection of the TDS spectra clearly shows that kd is increasing

with coverage in such cases, AG for desorption must be decreasing in mag­
nitude with coverage. Th 
us, the thermodynamic stability of the adsorbate 
decreases with coverage, so that there will still be no driving force for 
adatom agglomeration into 2-d islands in such systems. This seems, never­
theless, to contradict the LEED observations for the case ofPb on WOlO) 
(44) and on Mo(l l O) (278), which have been interpreted in terms of 
Pb­
Pb attractions and 2-d island formation at low coverages. For Pb on other 
substrates such as W(lOO) (44), AI(llt) (46), Ni(lll) (46, 280), Ni(lOO) 
(280), and on FCC(11 
0) surfaces (99), it is generally concluded that Pb­
Pb interactions are repulsive as predicted above for s2pn_type absorbates. 
As pointed out by Bauer & Kolaczkiewicz (31), the net lateral interaction 
between two metal adatoms results mainly from the competition between 
two terms in the A-A interaction energy: (a) an attractive term caused by 
the inherent strength of A-A bonds, which increases approximately as the 
cohesive energy (or sublimation energy) of the pure solid, and (b) a repul­
sive term due to the fact that the isolated metal adatoms always have some 
effective dipole moment that usually points normal to the surface, and 
like-pointing dipoles (nearby adatoms) have a repulsive interaction. [In a 
plane network of equal dipoles, the magnitude of the mutual repulsive 
energy between two dipoles, including their image charges, increases as 
the square of the dipole moment per adatom (41).] 
I 
Dipole moment of the isolated adsorbate 
The sign and magnitude of the 
dipole moment (/10) associated with the isolated adatom can be determined 
by several methods (30), and in some cases is even calculated quite accu­
rately (35, 41, 42, 52); but it is most commonly determined from the initial 
slope of the work function-versus-coverage curve (30, 35) by using the 
Helmholz equation: 
/10 = (2.66 x 1014 Debye' vole 1 • cm- 2) . (d¢!dO)o, 
where negative is toward the surface (down). This dipole moment increases 
with the difference in electronegativity between the adsorbate and 
substrate. For the substrates we are discussing, the Pauling electro-
I The interaction energy between two adsorbates with effective dipole moments P, and P2 
pointing toward the surface can be shown to vary like [P,' P2/(4nBor3)] exp (-rll,), where r 
is their separation. The effective Thomas-Ft:rmi charge screening length, I" decreases with 
the effective conduction electron density between the two dipoles (94), and therefore with their 
proximity to the surface. A similar dependence is seen from calculations of the electrostatic 
potential of dipolar adsorbates on 
jellium (203). The above expression can be derived by first 
calculating the potential at each end of a point-charge dipole of length / due to the presence 
of an equal dipole some distance away that is parallel and centered in the same plane, using 
the sum of two Coulomb potentials that are screened according to Ref. (94) by the conduction 
electrons. We assume in this calculation that the distance r between the dipoles is large 
compared to the separation 1 of the two point charges that make up the dipole, so that 
cos B = ll(2r): see Ref. (95), p. 590.

negativity is in the range 1.5-2.4, which we will consider electro 
neutral 
here. The very electropositive adsorbates (alkali and alkaline earth ele­
ments) therefore tend to show substantial charge transfer to these sub­
strates, a large work function decrease, and a correspondingly large dipole 
moment [in the range 4-10 Debye (30, 3
5, 42, 45)] pointing toward the 
surface. Lanthanum and the lanthanides are slightly less electropositive, 
and still have substantial downward-pointing dipole moments as adatoms 
[ 
g 2-6 Debye (38-40, 267, 273)]. 
2 The s2pn metals and semi 
metals have 
nearly the same electro 
negativity as these substrates, but nevertheless show 
downward-pointing dipole moments in the range 0.2-2 Debye2 (30, 33, 
44, 46). Adsorption, even of the substrate element itself onto a smooth 
transition metal surface, causes an initial work function decrease due to 
the Smoluchowski effect (this explains why atomically rough metal surface 
planes have several tenths of an eV lower work functions than smoother 
surface planes). For example, W/W(1 
10) (30, 47) and Pt/Pt(1ll) (48) show 
low-coverage work function decreases of ",0.6 and 0.3 eV, respectively. A 
large part of the work function decrease seen for adsorption of s2pn_type 
elements is due to this effect, whose magnitude should increase with the 
size and polarizability of the adatom. Thus, s2pn-metals should have a 
small to moderate dipole-dipole repulsion term in their lateral interaction 
energy in the adlayer. The same can even be said about ad 
layers of the 
dmsn_type transition and noble metals, which generally show either a small 
work function decrease (30, 51, 53, 55, 129, 279) or increase (30, 54, 55, 
129), depending upon the substrate. 
Bulk cohesive energies of the adsorbate elements These dipole-dipole 
repulsions compete against nearly the same covalent or metallic A-A 
bonding attractions that 
give 
rise to cohesion in the pure solid. The relative 
cohesion energies of the different classes of adsorbates should therefore 
also be considered. The alkalis are bonded in the bulk very weakly. The 
alkali earths and the s2pn_type metals have bulk cohesive energies about 
twice as large (except for Hg, which is about the same). The transition 
metals, the noble metals (i.e. the Group IB metals), and the lanthanides 
are much more strongly bonded in the bulk (about twice as strong again). 
Net lateral interaction The qualitative characteristics of the various classes 
of metal adsorbates that have been studied in detail are summarized in 
Table 1. As pointed out by Bauer & Kolaczkiewicz (31), the small cohesive 
energies of the alkalis and alkaline earths are overshadowed by strong 
dipole-dipole repulsions in the ad 
layer, to result in net lateral interactions 
that are very-to-moderately repulsive. In a recent review of alkali adsorp-

tion, Aruga & Murata (281) postulate that this repulsive interaction 
changes to an attractive one at high coverages. This seems very unlikely 
given the numerous TDS results (35, 45, 58, 190) and LEED studies (58, 
67, 69) that indicate net repulsions at all coverages below one ML. The 
weak cohesive energies of s2pn elements are even overcome by the small­
to-moderate dipole-dipole: repulsions, leading to net weakly repulsive 
adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. (Aluminum may be an exception here 
since it has larger than usual bulk cohesive energy, and its small size leads 
to a small dipole moment as an adatom.) Lanthanum and the lanthanides 
display marginal behavior" where large bulk cohesive energies are nearly 
equally balanced by moderate dipole-dipole repulsions, so that anything 
from weakly repulsive to weakly attractive lateral interactions can be 
expected in the adlayer. [The inclusion of GdjW(l IO) under "strongly 
repulsive" systems in Ref. (31) is questionable given the weak decrease in 
Ed with OGd (40).] Transition and noble metal adlayers have only small 
dipole-dipole repulsions, which are easily overcome by large inherent 
A-A cohesion, so that net attractive lateral interactions result. 
Since dipole-dipole interactions are much longer-range in nature than 
the cohesive (covalent) interactions that bond metals together in the pure 
solid or in gas-phase dimers, one might expect some clements to display 
an A-A interaction potential that becomes more and more repulsive as the 
A-A distance decreases from large values (due to dipole-dipole repulsions) 
until a critical A-A distance is reached, below which A-A covalent attrac­
tions take control, and a net attractive well is found. However, we know

of no evidence for such a variation in energy with separation unless it is 
found from the minimum in adsorption energy versus coverage seen for 
adsorbed lanthanides (39, 273). 
As pointed out by Bauer (30), indirect (through-substrate) interactions 
also contribute noticeably to the net A-A interaction energy in some cases. 
Evidence for this is, however, relatively infrequent (see exceptions below), 
thus suggesting that the two terms mentioned above often dominate the 
lateral interactions. 
Overlayer structures 
The net lateral interactions outlined in Table 1 
manifest themselves in distinct structural differences in the resulting 
adlayers. Most of these trends have been classified by Bauer et al (30, 31), 
who found it necessary to separate the behavior on atomically "smooth" 
substrate surfaces such as BCC(IIO), FCC(III), HCP(OOOI), and 
FCC(IOO) from that on atomically corrugated or "rough" surfaces, the 
simplest examples of which arc the very open BCC(100) surfaces and 
the one-dimensionally corrugated BCC(211) and FCC(IIO), HCP(lOIO) 
surfaces. The net A-A interactions outlined above are, of course, modu­
lated by the periodic site potential offered to the adatoms by the substrate 
surface, and it is the combination of the two that usually explains the 
observed surface structures. 
Smooth substrates 
On smooth substrates, the interaction potential for the 
adsorbate is relatively flat parallel to the surface. For example, the adatom 
diffusion activation energy is relatively isotropic and typically only'" 10% 
of its binding energy to the surface (30). For such surfaces, the lateral 
interaction terms highlighted in Table I are not strongly modified by the 
substrate site potentials. 
When net repulsive lateral interactions exist, the adsorbed metal tends to 
spread out in a quasihexagonal array, which maximizes all A-A distances 
(minimizes repulsions) subject to small displacement of the adatoms 
toward preferred sites. The smaller the repulsion (either due to smaller 
dipoles or larger A-A separation), the larger can be these displacements 
from hexagonal to match the substrate lattice-size preference. Well-ordered 
hexagonal or quasihexagonal overlayers have been reported for coverages 
as low as 1/9 for p(3 x 3)-K on Fe( l l l) (45) and 8A = 1/8 in the case c 
(2J2 x 4J2) R45°-Cs on Rh(IOO) (65). The quasihexagonal lattice pa­
rameter then decreases with coverage continuously (31, 56-58), nearly 
continuously (31, 40, 59), or in several discrete steps (33, 39, 60) until a 
nearly close-packed structure is achieved at a complete monolayer. An 
example of such behavior is shown in Figure 3 for the system Bi/Pt(ll l) 
(33). The appropriate metal radii to use in predicting the closest-packed 
monolayer coverage for such systems has been discussed previously (61).

This system shows weakly repulsive lateral interactions. 
The preferences for certain rotational (azimuthal) alignments with the 
substrate have also been discussed for such hexagonal overlayers (59, 260). 
The ordered ovcrlayer structures seen for such repulsive systems have 
been observed to undergo a reversible order -> disorder transition with 
increasing temperature that manifests itself as a rapid loss in intensity and 
broadening of the overlayer LEED spots (30, 31, 33, 56). This might be

attributed to a decrease in domain size of the ordered phase at the expense 
of increasing size of disordered regions of 2-d adsorbate fluid. The order­
disorder transition generally occurs at higher temperatures for more 
closely-packed structures (30, 31, 33, 56, 60, 64) because of the greater 
steepness of the A-A repulsion at short distances. For the same reason, 
adsorbate systems with more repulsive net lateral interactions maintain 
ordered structures of the same coverage up to higher temperatures. 
For weakly repulsive adsorbates, very low temperatures ( f lOOK) are 
sometimes needed to observe low-coverage ordered structures (33). It is 
also to be expected that greater vari ations in site potential parallel to the 
surface would lead to systems that maintain order to higher temperature. 
Examples of systems in which strong substrate site preferences probably 
help maintain adlayer order are the quarter-monolayer Te (59) and 
Gd/W(l l O) systems (31), which maintain order to much, much higher 
temperatures than, for example, similar coverages of Sr/W(ll O) (30) or 
Bi/Pt(l ll) (33), although the magnitudes of adatom-adatom repulsions in 
the latter cases are comparable or even larger.} Cases have also been seen 
where the structure in the ordered domains changes to a higher-coverage 
structure with increasing temperatures at fixed average coverage, pre­
sumably due to a compression of the ordered domains by the increasing 
2-d fluid pressure (31). 
Alkali and alkaline earth overlayers at low coverage on FCC(111) and 
(100) frequently show diffuse rings in the LEED pattern near and even 
below room temperature whose radius expands continuously wi th increas­
ing coverage (45, 56-58, 65-69).4 Here, long-range order is partially lost, 
but relatively good short-range order is maintained by the strong repulsive 
lateral interactions, which force a local quasihexagonal structure whose 
nearest-neighbor distance can be determined from the ring's radius. One 
unusual study shows data where the expected increase in radius with e 1/2 
does not hold (281). The liquid-like fluid phase that gives rise to these rings 
has been addressed in detail for KjNi(lll) (62), and shown to have some 
long-range bond-orientational order. probably imposed by the substrate 
sites. The rings coalesce into spots at low enough temperatures, indicating 
a transition to an incommensurate 2-d crystal (62, 281). The tendency for 
such "ring" patterns is not so obvious on BCC( 
110) surfaces, where distinct 
spot patterns have more often been reported (30). Such ring patterns have,. 
however, been seen for Cs/W(IIO) (93). 
3 This can be seen by comparing changes in desorption energy with coverage below quarter 
monolayer in Refs. (59) and (40) with those in Ref. (33), for example. or by noting the trends 
outlined in Table I. 
4 The lack of ring patterns in some cases in Ref. (66) was not reproduced in later studies 
by one of the same authors (68).

When net attractive lateral interactions exist, the low-coverage adlayer 
coalesces into islands (3 0, 3 1 ,  50, 51 , 70). The nature and density of 
nucleation sites for such islands has been probed with PAX for Cu/Ru(OOI )  
(7 1). With admetals that have the same bulk structure as the substrate and 
a similar lattice parameter (within ع7-9%), the 2 -d islands usually grow 
pseudomorphically, whereby the adatoms assume the same position as the 
atoms would in the next layer of the bulk substrate, thus giving a sharp 
p(l x 1) LEED pattern (5 1 , 52, 7 0, 74, 76, 77, 8 0, 8 1 , 87, 9 1 , 1 1 0). Changes 
in LEEO spot width (50, 51) or in the LEEO I-V curves (77) for the 
p( I x I) spots can be used to distinguish the adlayer's contribution to the 
LEED pattern from the substrate's, which both give the same spot posi­
tions in pseudomorphic growth. Pseudomorphic growth also frequently 
occurs when FCC transition or noble metals or Al are adsorbed onto the 
closest-packed BCC(l I O) and HCP(OOOl )  surfaces, where lattice strains 
up to 7.7% in either direction can be overcome by the site preferences 
offered in pseudomorphic growth (30, 7 1-7 3, 75, 78, 79, 82 -8 6, 88, 1 12). 
The reported p( l  x I) pseudomorphic overiayers of Cu on W(l IO) and 
Mo( I IO) show surprisingly large Cu-Cu expansions ( - 24%) in one direc­
tion (83-85). NijW(IIO) appears to be pseudomorphic below 0.7 mono­
layer ( 1 2 1 )  with a similarly large lattice expansion in one direction. In this 
case, however, islanding occurs only as chains along the direction in 
which the W-W site separation is small (122), and a conversion to an 
incommensurate Ni( l l l )  structure occurs above 0.7 ML (121). 
When the lattice mismatch is greater than 
 7-9 %  in either direction, 
pseudomorphic growth usually does not occur, but instead the adsorbate 
islands assume a nearly hexagonal 2-d structure with a lattice parameter 
that is very close to its own preferred nearest-neighbor distance. Examples 
of this type of growth are the systems: Au/Cu(l OO) ( 30), Ag/Cu(10 0) ( 30, 
82), Au and Ag/Mo(l l O) (8 5), and low coverages ofPd/W(llO) (89). Such 
non-pseudomorphic adlayers typically align themselves preferentially in 
certain rotational directions with respect to the substrate, or even show 
one-dimensional pseudomorphism (8 5, 89). The cases of FCC(I 1 1)- or 
HCP(OOOl )-like films growing on BCC(ll O) substrates have been theo­
retically studied in detail in this respect (28, 29), with certain preferred 
rotational alignments (the so-called Nishiyama-Wassermann and Kurd­
jumov-Sachs orientations) predicted, depending on the bulk ratio of 
adatom: substrate nearest-neighbor distance. In practice these predictions 
rarely 
hold in the first monolayer for metals except in a few observed cases, 
and then usually only for coverages approaching one monolayer (28). 
These systems with attractivlG A-A interactions also show a transition 
to disordered phases with increasing temperature, which has been attri­
buted to a two-dimensional phase transition between a condensed phase

791 
and a "2-d gaseous" phase (88). This transition is easily monitored by 
using work function changes, since isolated adatoms have a larger dipole 
moment than adatoms within condensed islands due to the Smoluchowski 
effect (88 ). Again, the (condensate+gas)jgas transition temperature 
increases with increasing coverage in the low-coverage regime. Theoretical 
models in which the adsorbate gas is either treated as a lattice gas (i.e. in 
localized sites) or as a pure two-dimensional gas both fit the critical 
behavior for such systems with reasonable quantitative accuracy at low 
coverages (88). 
When the clean surface is reconstructed, the metal ad 
layer may relax 
this reconstruction (92, 117). 
If the adsorption temperature is very low, diffusion is prevented and a 
pseudo-random filling of lattice sites occurs for many systems. For 
example, both Ag and eu on PtCIIl) coalesce into 2-d islands only after 
warming to above 
 240K (50, 5 I). The behavior of diffraction patterns 
for such random site-filling has been addressed theoretically (90). The 
dynamics of cold adlayer growth is also being addressed both experi­
mentally (9 1) and theoretically (91 ,  255). For local coverages near one 
monolayer, considerably higher temperatures (SOO-800K) may be required 
to obtain the preferred LEED structure because massive and concerted 
rotations of 
large domains may be necessary (33). 
Corrugated substrates 
The BCC(lOO), BCC( l I 2), FCC(110), and 
HCP(IOIO) surfaces are examples of metal surfaces that are highly cor­
rugated on an atomic scale. The latter three so-called "row-trough" sur­
faces show little corrugation in site potential parallel to the rows, but very 
large barriers to ada 
tom diffusion in the direction perpendicular to these 
rows of atoms. The topmost atomic plane on these surfaces is very open, 
and offers sites between the rows of 
substrate atoms in which normal sized 
adsorbate atoms can sit quite deeply. In this case, the potential field due 
to the dipole moment of 
the adatom can be much more effectively screened 
along the surface by the electron density around the substrate surface 
atoms. On FCC(l l O) surfaces, for example, this screening should be quite 
effective perpendicular to the troughs, but along the troughs it should be 
more comparable to the FCC(l J J) surface. Thus, the dipolar adatom­
adatom repUlsions seen on smoother surfaces will be substantially reduced 
perpendicular to these troughs. It can also be expected that the range of 
the interaction will be shorter in this direction. This couples with the fact 
that the dipole moment associated with an adatom is usually much smaller 
on the more open surfaces (35). Another important feature of atomic 
corrugation along the surface is that the preferred sites are much further 
apart. For example, the nearest neighbor distances in bulk W and Pd are

CAMPBELL 
nearly identical, yet two sites in adjacent troughs on W(211) are 1 .75 A 
(63%) further apart than two three-fold hollow sites on Pd( l l l ). These 
distance differences will also reduce the dipole-dipole repulsion energy, 
which should fall roughly as 1/[r3 • exp (r 
/ 
is), where r is the ada 
tom-ada 
tom 
separation and Is is the Thomas-Fermi charge screening length (see foot­
note 1). Along a smooth surface of a metal, Is should have a value of 
 5-
20 A, intermediate between that in vacuum (Is = 00) and that within the 
bulk of a metal [Is Ǥ 0.5-0.9 A (94)]. Note that the magnitude of Is is 
determined by the conduction electron density (94), so Is should decrease 
with the depth of 
the adsorption site into the metal surface. It will therefore 
be shorter for ada 
toms sitting in deep hollow sites on rough surfaces. Much 
more important for adsorbates in which attractive lateral interactions 
dominate on smoother surfaces, these larger site-site separations along 
corrugated surfaces drastically reduce the strength of adsorbate-adsorbate 
covalent bonding interactions, which die away very rapidly with distance, 
more like 1/(r6). These differences manifest themselves in the surface struc­
tures seen for adsorbed metals. 
For admetals with net repulsive lateral interactions, the "deep" sites of 
the substrate limit the lateral mobility of the adatom and reduce the 
magnitude and range of dipolar repulsive interactions. For this reason the 
adatoms tend not to move slightly out of preferred sites to accommodate 
a more uniform ada 
tom-ada 
tom separation in all directions. This decreases 
the chances for establishing well-ordered hcp-like overlayer structures. For 
example, alkali metals on the BCC(lOO) surface usually show only one 
ordered structure [the p(2 x 2)] beforc the hcp-like monolayer structure 
appears (30). [An exception to this are the ring patterns seen for Cs/W(lOO) 
at low coverage (93). This is probably due to the very large size of Cs, 
which acts to smooth out the surface corrugation.] For Sb (96) on W 
( l  
00), 
only the p(2 x 2) (eSb = 0.25) and e(2 x 2) (eSb = 0.5) structures are seen 
before the p(l x 1) monolayer. On the other hand, Te on W(l OO) shows 
six ordered structures before monolayer completion (274). The richness 
of structure seen for smoother substrates that gives nearly continuous 
compression of 
quasihexagonal arrays is, however, not usuaIly seen here. 
Nevertheless, there is a decrease of the average A-A distance with increas­
ing coverage in the ordered structures that are obtained. The p(2 x 2) 
structures mentioned above for eSb = 0.25 on W(lOO) are somewhat sur­
prising since a e(4 x 2) is more "hexagonal-like" and would provide larger 
average A-A separations at this samc coverage. Indeed, Pb/W(lOO) shows 
a c(4 x 2) at epb = 0.25, but a streaked p(2 x 2) at slightly lower coverage 
(44). The energetic differences between these two structures in a pure 
dipolar-repulsion picture are, however, quite small at the large separations 
here, so that small indirect electronic effects via the substrate may be

enough to push the energy balance in the other direction. [The same must 
also be said for the p(2 x 2)-(OA = 0.25) structures seen for Te on the 
smoother Ni(lOO) and Cu(lOO) surfaces (97).] 
The row-trough surfaces such as FCC(l IO) and BCC(1 12) are highly 
corrugated in one dimension, but smooth in a perpendicular direction. On 
such surfaces, the activation energy for admetal diffusion is small parallel 
to the troughs, but much larger perpendicular to them (30). This allows 
nearly continuous compression of the A-A separation along the troughs 
with increasing coverage, so that a large number of 
LEED structures are 
again seen in the first monolayer for repulsive adsorbates (30, 31, 99). The 
adatoms are nevertheless restricted to sitting down more-or-Iess into the 
troughs at low coverages. As pointed out by Clendening & Campbell 
(99), the submonolayer growth modes for adsorbed metals that have 
net repulsive lateral interactions on such one-dimensionally corrugated 
surfaces can be classified into three distinct categories depending upon the 
substrate (BCC vs. FCC) and the ratio (dAlts) of 
the adsorbate's minimum 
interatomic distance in the bulk (dA) and the trough-trough separation of 
the substrate (ts): 
I .  TYPE A: This growth mode occurs for very electropositive elements 
(Group IA and IIA) and Sb on BCC(1 12) surfaces if dAlts < 0.98. Here 
the adlayer starts out at very low coverage as a pen x l) structure consisting 
of 
rows of adatoms perpendicular to the troughs, wherein every trough is 
occupied identically, but the repeat distance down the troughs between the 
rows of 
adatoms can be quite large (up to seven lattice parameters). These 
rows of 
adatoms move closer together with increasing coverage. Examples 
of such structures are shown in Figure 4. The nature of these structures 
suggests that although the net adatom-adatom interactions are repulsive, 
and the interaction along the troughs is clearly repulsive, an attractive 
interaction is felt across the troughs. This very anisotropic interaction may 
occur because the dipole-dipole interaction between two adsorbate atoms 
located in adjacent troughs must act nearly directly through the substrate 
atom situated in the intervening row. This substrate atom can become 
oppositely polarized, and this should increase its attraction to both the 
ada 
toms. At the same time, it screens out A-A repulsions, resulting in an 
effective interaction between the two adsorbate atoms on either side. This 
tendency for forming chains of adatoms perpendicular to the troughs can 
be considered a type of indirect (through-substrate) attraction. 
2. TYPE B: This growth mode occurs for s2pn_type metals on FCC(l lO) 
surfaces when dAfts < 0.98. These show a c(2 x 2) structure at OA = 1/2 
as the first observable LEED pattern. This quasi 
hexagonal structure is 
consistent with relatively isotropic lateral repulsions. Only at high cover­
ages (8 
A > t/2) do these systems revert to pen x l) structures similar to

those seen 
on type A systems even at low coverages. The 
pen x l ) structures 
may not be seen at low coverages on FCC(110) surfaces because adatoms 
in the highest coordination sites sec between two substrate atoms when 
looking perpendicular to the troughs to an adjacent adatom on FCC(1 1 0) 
surfaces, but they must interact more directly through a single substrate 
atom on BCC(l 12) surfaces. This may allow for more favorable indirect 
attraction and more effectively screened repulsions in the later case. At 
coverages above one half monolayer, the adatoms must move out of 
these preferred sites anyway, and the substrate atoms come more directly 
between them in the pen x I) structures on FCC(l IO). In type A and B 
systems, substantial displacement of the adatoms perpendicular to the 
troughs are sometimes seen at the highest coverages where repulsions are 
strongest. For example, the structures for the high-coverage p( 
CD x l) and 
p(S x I )  overlayers of Pb/Cu(l l O) determined by X-ray diffraction (100) 
show a quasi-hcp arrangement of Pb ada 
toms. (Since Pb atoms are so 
large relative to Cu, the attraction for in-trough sites is also reduced.) 
3. TYPE c: This mode occurs whenever dA/ts > 1 .0. Here, the large size 
of the adsorbate sterically prevents any pen x 1) structure, and c(n x 2) 
structures are commonly seen.

Finally, alkali metals on FCC(l IO) surfaces sometimes induce massive 
rearrangement of the substrate surface atoms (101). These cases are not 
considered in the above discussion. The (1 x 2) reconstruction seen at very 
low alkali coverage has been shown to be the same missing-row structure 
as observed for many clean, reconstructed FCC(I IO) surfaces (102). On 
the other hand, the c(2 x 2)-K structure seen at higher coverage on the 
initially reconstructed Au(1 1 0) surface seems to involve the substitution 
of K for Au atoms (103). 
Now let us consider the case of adatoms with net attractive lateral 
interactions on highly corrugated surfaces. The adsorption of Pt on the 
Pd(I IO), a system in which the lattice mismatch is tiny, shows p(l x 1) 
islands in pseudomorphie growth from low coverage to beyond one mono­
layer (104). On W(21l), adsorbed Ag also grows via p(I x 1) pseudo­
morphic islands in the first monolayer, due to a tiny lattice mismatch (55). 
Gold also seems to fill all the sites along certain troughs when adsorbed 
on W(211). Oddly, some troughs appear to be filled and others free of Au 
at low coverages, with the alternation between filled and vacant troughs 
occurring in an ordered way (55). At e 
Au = I, all the troughs are filled to 
give a pel x I) pseudomorphic monolayer. For Ni/W(211), a pseudo­
morphic p(1 x I) monolayer also grows, bUl at higher coverages the Ni­
Ni separation in the troughs decreases by ԥ 14% to match more closely 
the bulk Ni value, giving a p(6 x 1) overlayer (121). The system 
Ag/Cu(l IO) shows what can occur when the lattice mismatch is large in 
the opposite direction (Ag is 13% larger than Cu). Here, islands of a 
p(5 x 1) structure appear from Ԧ60% up to nearly one monolayer cover­
age (105a,b). In the proposed structure for this, four Ag atoms per unit 
cell fill each trough identically with an Ag-Ag repeat distance along the 
trough that is 
"'" 10% larger than its bulk value but 20% larger than the 
Cu site separation. After these islands grow to cover the surface with 
increasing coverage, a transformation to a c(2 x 4) structure occurs, inter­
preted as a single monolayer of distorted Ag(l l l  
)-like hexagonal structure 
(105a,b). The deposition of 2: 70% ofa monolayer of 
Ag onto the Au(1 1 0)­
(1 x 2) surface relaxes the (1 x 2) reconstruction (127). Although clean 
Pd(l lO) is not reconstructed, Pt and Au films in the 1-2 monolayer range 
do reconstruct, as do pure Pt(I IO) and Au(I IO) (266). 
On BCCClOO) surfaces, noble and transition metal adatoms frequently 
show no LEED superstructure in the submonolayer regime up to > 600K 
(30, 1 22). This has been interpreted as due to p(l x 1) pseudomorphic 
growth (30, 122, 125). High temperatures give c(2 x 2) structures at 
(JA = 0.5 in these systems, which involves considerable displacement of the 
substrate atoms (30) and formation of a monolayer alloy (see below).

discussed above have been determined in such a way that the translational 
registry of the adlayer unit cell with the substrate is not really known. 
Certain assumptions about the preferred site have usually been made in 
aligning the overlayer with the substrate so as to maximize population in 
the preferred site that was assumed. For a few systems, the preferred 
site location has been experimentally determined by field microscopy, 
quantitative LEED, other electron or X-ray diffraction-based techniques, 
SEXAFS, or by ion scattering. Many of these are summarized in Table 2, 
which includes only entries for adlayers at sufficiently low coverages that 
A-A repulsions should not prevent the ada 
toms from finding their pre­
ferred sites with respect to the substrate. As can be seen, the expectation 
that the highest coordination (hollow) sites will be preferred almost always 
proves to be the case. For the same reasons, high-coordination defect sites 
such as steps and vacancies are expected to be populated first, as has 
indeed been verified for Pb/Cu(l OO) (123).

THIN FILM AND SURFACE ALLOYS BY INTERDIFFUSION 
Thin film alloys have 
also bcen prepared by annealing the surface during or after the vapor 
deposition of one species to enable interdiffusion of the two metals. Alloy 
formation is usually marked by observable changes in lineshapes in elec­
tron spectra for the adsorbed metal (109-1 1 2, 1 16). In a few such cases, 
ultrathin or even monolayer films of crystalline solid solutions or of inter­
metallic compounds giving sharp LEED patterns have been prepared in 
this way. I refer to systems in which the intermixing is limited to only the 
topmost atomic plane as "surface alloys." Some structures of 
known, well­
ordered thin-film and surface alloys are summarized in Table 3. As might 
be expected, this approach for preparing ordered alloy surfaces has usually 
been successful only when the two metals form bulk alloys and are nearly 
equal in size (within 13%). However, intermixed e(2 x 2) "surface alloys"

are formed in the topmost plane of W(100) after annealing Cu, Ag, and 
Au overlayers, in spite of the immiscibility of these metals in bulk ( 1 24, 
1 25). The energetic reasons for surface alloying here have been discussed 
(1 24). A metastable "surface alloy" of Au dispersed in the Ru(OOOI )  
surface also appears to have been prepared i n  
spite of 
the lack of 
miscibility 
of Au in bulk Ru (86). 
Note that the topmost surface layer of 
the systems in Table 3 that appear 
to give solid solutions, or pO x 1) LEED patterns, are only assumed to 
be randomly populated by the two elements. This has yet to be verified by 
LEED intensity analysis. The PAX technique (1 1 3) could also be used to 
address this issue qualitatively. The same factors that give rise to phase 
segregation and surface segregation in the bulk of alloys should also give 
rise to nonrandomness in the topmost atomic layer of 
such a solid solution. 
The criteria for mixing or segregation of the two elements within the 
topmost layer of an alloy AxB I - x are the same as those to be considered 
in coadsorbed layers (A + B). The latter have been reviewed by White & 
Akhter (1 1 8) and are largely related to the relative A-B, A-A, and B-B 
interaction energies within the topmost layer. However, we know of no 
experimental study of the lateral distribution of the two elements within 
the topmost atomic layer of a bulk or thin-film solid solution, where the 
topmost layer is intermixed and disordered. This lack of data is undoubt­
edly due to the difficulty of determining such lateral distributions. Such 
lateral distributions have been addressed theoretically for CuNi, PdCu, 
and PdAg alloys using Monte Carlo methods and effective pairwise-addi­
tive interaction energies that match bulk data (1 1 9, 1 28). The size dis­
tribution of Cr clusters in the topmost atomic layer of the Fe72Cr28(l lO) 
surface (which is a "clustering substitutional alloy") have also been cal­
culated using the short-range order parameter determined from bulk 
thermodynamic data on the alloy (1 26). Whether these parameters are 
appropriate at the surface is unclear. These factors have also been 
addressed experimentally with respect to 2-d alloy formation in coadsorbed 
layers of Ag plus Au on Ru(OOOJ) (1 1 3) and Pt plus Pd on W(1 l O) (98). 
For metal-on-metal systems, it is relatively straightforward to predict 
what bulk phases should exist or coexist at equilibrium at a given tem­
perature by simply inspecting the portion of the bulk phase diagram near 
zero concentration in the vapor-deposited element. However, predicting 
what species will form under kinetic limitations is more difficult. Imagine 
starting with a system in which several monolayers of A have been 
deposited as a pure overlayer onto pure substrate B at a very low tem­
perature, and then warming this film to allow intermixing. A useful rule 
of thumb is that intermixing will not occur on a lab time scale until a 
temperature above ""' 2/3 of the alloy's melting temperature is reached.

(Simulations of 
inter 
diffusion kinetics on the monolayer length scale have 
been performed for the general case of metal overlayers on metals (120). 
At the surface, one naturally sees solid solutions (1 1 4  
-1 1 6) or intermetallic 
compounds (8, 1 4c, 108-1 1 2) that are richer than expected in the element 
that started as an overlayer (A) if the thermodynamic limit is not yet 
reached. Thus, crystalline surface solid solutions have been prepared with 
continuously variable composition by proper thermal treatment of metal 
overlayers (1 14--1 1 6). For these, the concentration also decreases smoothly 
with depth (1 1 6). Ordered intermetallic compounds of differing compo­
sition, on the other hand, tend to phase-segregate in the bulk. Thus, it is 
possible to produce at the surface a smooth overlayer or monolayer of 
such 
a compound with a fairly abrupt interface with the underlying substrate (or 
A-poor compound) (8, 1 4c, 109-1 1 2). Alternatively, if 
the compound does 
not like to bond to the substrate (or underlying compound), very strongly, 
three-dimensional islands of the alloy will nucleate to cover only a small 
fraction of the surface area (33, 1 12). Just as in the atomic overlayer growth 
systems above, such systems will frequently develop a monolayer of the 
"alloy" that covers the surface uniformly between the islands (i.e. Stranski­
Krastanov growth mode) (1 12). 
ADSORPTION OF SIMPLE MOLECULES ON 
WELL-DEFINED BIMETALLIC SURFACES 
The adsorption of a number of simple molecules has becn studied on 
bimetallic surfaces of various types with the tools of ultrahigh vacuum 
surface science. At least one of the metal elements has usually been a 
transition metal or a noble metal. The most common molecules to have 
been studied are CO, H2, and O2, although many other molecules have 
been studied on selected bimetallic surfaces. In the case of CO, H 2, and 
O2, enough studies have been performed that one can begin to see periodic 
trends with respect to their chemistry on bimetallic surfaces, as outlined 
below. In each case, however, I first briefly review how these simple 
molecules generally adsorb on the pure metal surfaces. 
Tables 4--
6 summarize many studies of CO, H2, and O2, respectively, 
on well-defined bimetallic surfaces. In each case, the first column specifies 
the surface that was studied. Overlayers are specified with a slash (f); the 
substrate surface appears to the right of the slash and the topmost element 
appears to the left of the slash along with any easily specified LEED 
structure it displays before exposure to CO, H2, or O2, I limit discussion 
here to overlayers of thickness ݌ I monolayer unless otherwise noted. If 
gas adsorption was studied only at one coverage of the metal overlayer, 
the fraction of one full monolayer (or 8*) is specified as a subscript on the

overlayer element. For example, p(1 x I )-Pd 1/ 
Au(l l l) refers to experi­
ments in which the adsorption of simple molecules was studied at one 
full monolayer of pseudomorphic Pd on the Au(l l l) surface. If metal 
overlayers have been heated to cause interdiffusion and alloy formation 
before exposure to the gases, they are specified as "thin-film alloys" (TFA) 
here, unless the intermixing of the two metals is thought to be limited to 
the topmost atomic layer only, in which instance it is called a "surface 
alloy" (SA). "Surface enriched alloy" (SEA) and "ordered alloy" refer to 
surfaces prepared starting with bulk alloys. Subscripts on the two elements 
refer to the composition of the alloys, where the subscripts x and y are 
used to signify that a range of 
surface concentrations was studied. If 
x and 
I - x are used instead as subscripts, x is taken to be small compared to 
one. If 
the surface composition of the alloy is different from the 
bulk, then 
a slash (/) is again used, where the composition to the left of the slash re­
fers to surface composition, and that to the right refers to bulk composition. 
For example, "(1 x 3)-Pto 91Cuo.o9/Pto.98Cuo.o2( 1 1 0)-SEA" refers to a 
Pto.98Cuo.oi l l O) single crystal alloy that was heated to give an enriched 
surface concentration of Pt0 9 1CU0 09 and a (1 x 3) LEED pattern. Simi­
larly, "(..)3 x ..)3)-Ruo.33Alo.dRu(OOOI)-SA" refers to a single-layer sur­
face alloy of 67% Al + 33% Ru on the Ru(OOOl )  surface, which was 
prepared by heating a vapor··deposited layer of AI on Ru(OOOI) and which 
gave a (J3 x ..)3)R30° LEED structure. This nomenclature may be useful 
in future studies. LEED structures are only given in Tables 4-6 when they 
existed on the surface as prepared for gas adsorption studies. (Some liberty 
has been used here if the LEED structure was shown in later studies to 
exist for this preparation.) 
The second column in Tables 4-6 qualitatively describes the difference 
between the desorption temperature of the molecule from the bimetallic 
surface and that from the two pure metals (on surfaces of 
similar geometry 
if possible). Since the desorption temperature (Tdes) roughly reflects the 
activation energy for desorption, and to the extent that this value is 
approximately equal to the heat of adsorption unless there is a sizeable 
activation barrier for adsorption, this column qualitatively reflects the 
influence of combining the two metals upon the heat of adsorption of the 
molecule. In the case of H2 and O2, this and the next column refer to 
dissociative adsorption, unless otherwise specified, whereas for CO they 
reflect molecular adsorption unless specified. The entry "mixed" in this 
column refers to desorption peaks seen at temperatures between those for 
the molecule from the two pure metals. "Higher" refers to desorption 
temperatures above those of either pure metal. Entries such as "Pt-like" 
refer to a desorption temperature very similar to that for the pure Pt 
surface, where an arrow point\ظd up or down signifies that this Pt-like TDS

The third column of

CO Ad

ption 
Carbon monoxide usually adsorbs carbon-end down, in a-top, bridge­
bonded, and/or (less frequently) three-fold-bridging configurations on 
pure metal surfaces. Both ends may bond on some highly corrugated 
surfaces or at defects. It may also temporarily lay flat on the early transition 
metals (Groups IVA-VIA), from which configuration the C-O bond is 
readily cleaved to produce carbon and oxygen adatoms (C., + OJ. Recom­
bination of C., + Oa to give COq occurs at temperatures ( ", 700-1200K) 
much higher than desorption of any remaining molecularly adsorbed CO 
(CO,,). The late transition metals (Ni, Pd, and Pt) and the noble metals 
(Cu, Ag, and Au) do not dissociate CO, or if so only with very low 
probability or at defect sitt:s. The molecular desorption temperature for 
CO is lower on Cu ( '"  
200K) and much lower on Ag and Au ( < lOOK) 
than on the other transition metals ( ", 400-550K), due to a low density 
of states (DOS) near the Fermi level (EF). It also desorbs at very low 
temperatures ( < lOOK) from the main group metals (AI, Sn, Bi) and the 
alkali metals. (Bismuth is actually classified as a semimetaI.) 
Inspection of Table 4 and the references cited there reveals several 
periodic trends with respect to CO adsorption on bimetallic surfaces, which 
we now outline. 
The sticking probability f,:)r molecular adsorption of CO remains quite 
high (",0.3-1) on the metals and their combinations, be they as overlayers 
or alloys, provided the temperature is low enough to stabilize the adsorbed 
species. Pure Ag, Au, Bi, and alkali metals, or their combinations with 
other metals, would appear to be an exception to this. However, the 
adsorption energy of 
CO is so weak when bonded primarily to these atoms 
that CO., is not stable in UHV even at lOOK. Thus, the effective sticking 
probability (which measures only the COa that is stable in UHV) drops 
toward zero for complete monolayers of these species even at l OOK. The 
same can be said concerning eu when working at room temperature, since 
CO desorbs from Cu already at , 200K. 
The desorption energy for CO is substantially effected by the mixture 
of two metals, as can be seen in Table 4. To highlight the kinds of effects 
that can occur, Figure 5 summarizes a number of CO TDS spectra from

these exposures were at a 1 50K in some cases and at ͫ25O-300K in others.) The rate axis 
scale is different for the diff
erent experiments. The nomenclature for specifying these surfaces 
is presented in the second paragraph of the section on Adsorption o\" Simple Molecules on 
Well-defined Bimetallic Surfaces. Starting from the top curve, these data come from Refs.

strong increases (K{J or decreases (Ti-addition) in the desorption tem­
perature are seen for CO/Pt(l l l) depending on the second metal and the 
structure.

CAMPBELL 
For noble metal (NM = Cu, Ag, or Au) overlayers on transition metals 
(TM), here designated as '''NMjTM'' systems, the NM adatoms cluster 
into 2-d islands, leaving large regions of 
clean TM surface even at moderate 
coverages. These areas adsorb CO in almost identical fashion to the pure 
TM surface, and the amount of such "TM-like" COil achievable at satu­
ration decreases roughly as ( 1 -(JNM), where (JNM is the fraction of I mono­
layer of the NM overlayer. If Cu = NM and the adsorption temperature 
is well below 200K, Cu-like CO desorption is also seen to grow with Beu 
in the first monolayer. This species of Cu-bound COa is only slightly 
different from COli on pure Cu. Special "mixed" TDS peaks of low mag­
nitude are also seen where CO desorbs at temperatures intermediate 
between that for pure TM and pure NM. These can be seen, for example, 
for Cu/Pt(l l l) in Figure 5. They are attributed to COa at the edges of the 
NM islands, where the NM-TM electronic interaction causes a CO bond 
strength that is intermediate between that for the two pure metals. The 
nature of these various sites has been beautifully probed with vibrational 
spectroscopy ( l89a,b) for the case of Cu/Ru(OOOI ), as shown in Figure 
6. The mixed sites seem to be due to CO bonded to electronically altered 
Cu sites, and no Cu-Ru bridging CO was seen. These data have been used 
to deduce the dispersion of high-area bimetallic catalysts based on their 
IR spectra ( l 89a,b). 
For the reverse situation, i.e. TM/NM, many of 
the same types of 
effects 
are seen, since the TM also clusters into 2-d islands. For p(l x 1 )­
NijCu(l I I ), the Ni atoms in the first monolayer bond CO in a manner 
very similar to Ni( l l l) ( 1 55). For p(l x I )-Pd/Au(l l l ), however, the Pd 
atoms bond CO in a "mixed" way [that is, with a much weaker strength 
than on pure Pd( 1 I I )  ( 148)]. The difference is that in the former bimetallic 
case the DOS near Ef looks much like pure Ni, whereas in the latter case 
the DOS is much lower than for pure Pd, presumably because of 
the nature 
of 
the Pd-Au interaction. Such electronic interactions are generally referred 
to as "ligand" effects. The difference between Au and Cu substrates may 
result from Au having 
such a low DOS even compared to Cu, but especially 
as compared to Pd. In agreement with this model is that "Co-like" COil is 
also seen for p(1 x I )-Co islands on Cu(100) ( 1 53). So one might expect 
other TM/Au or even TM/Ag overlayers to bond CO much more weakly

behavior. 
For alloy surfaces ofTM + NM combinations in which the two elements 
are nearest neighbors in the topmost plane, only "mixed" CO peaks with 
desorption temperatures intermediate between those on the pure metals 
are seen. The wide range of desorption temperatures and their smooth 
variation with alloy surface composition suggest that a sizeable electronic

Infrared reflection-absorption spectra of saturation coverages of CO adsorbed on 
a Ru(OOOI) surface at 85K with various coverages of Cu, from Ref. (I89a,b). The Cu adlayers 
had been pre-annealed in these data to form p(1 x I) islands with approximate diameters of 
100 A. Notice that both "Cu-like" and "Ru-like" adsorption sites for CO are populated at 
submonolayer Cu coverages. In addition, some sites are populated with CO desorption 
temperatures of b 300K, intermediate between that for Cu and Ru. These occur at island 
edges and give rise to the peaks labeled "mixed." 
ligand effect is in operation here. Such ligand effects seem to be more 
common when the two dissimilar metals bond along the topmost atomic 
layer than when they bond between the top and second layers, with the 
exception of Pd/Au mentioned above. Bridge-bonded CO can also appear 
"mixed" in TDS from such alloys because it bridges between a TM and 
an NM atom, as in the case of Cu + Ni alloys ( 1 54). Here, linear-bonded 
CO on Ni atoms is converted to the less stable Ni-Cu bridging species 
with increasing coverage, to accommodate more CO on the surface. The

(1 X 3)-Pto.9ICuo o9/Pto 98Cuo.o2(l IO)-SEA system is an exception, where 
CO desorption peaks are found somewhat above those for pure Pt( l IO) 
(130. 1 3 1). This may be a structural effect related to differences in site 
geometries on this rough surface. 
For TM I/TM 
2 overlayer systems, 2-d islands of the adsorbed transition 
metal (TM I) still form at submonolayer coverages, so that TM 2-like CO 
TDS peaks are seen at low coverages of TM 
, . Howcver, the TM ,-TM 
2 
interaction is apparently strong enough between layers that TM ,-like CO 
is seldom seen. Frequently, the CO that is bonded to the TM 
I ada 
toms or 
near the edges of their islands show lower desorption temperatures than 
from either pure metal. In one case, pel x I )-Ni(Ru(OOOI), a higher 
desorption temperature is seen (75), and in a few cases "mixed" CO 
desorption states are seen. The same types of behavior are seen for alloy 
surfaces of the two transition metals. showing that substantial electronic 
effects can be expected whenever these are intimately mixed on an atomic 
scale at the surface, be that as overlayers or as alloys. Predicting the 
direction of this ligand effect is, however, difficult. "Lower" CO peak 
temperatures are usually seen if one of the two mctals is from the left of 
Mn and the other from the right of Mn in the Periodic Table; Co/W is a 
possible exception, since it mainly shows "mixed" peaks. Since the molec­
ular desorption peak for CO from pure W surfaces is complicated by strong 
competition by CO dissociation, its desorption temperature drastically 
underestimates the actual heat of CO adsorption for that CO which dis­
sociates. Thus the "mixed" peaks for Co(W ( l l O), which desorb without 
any dissociation at full monolayer coverage, may also actually reflect COa 
with an adsorption energy lower than either pure metal. Thesc systems 
which show "lower" adsorption energies also show lower M -CO stretching 
vibrational frequencies with respect to CO(/ on the pure later transition 
metal, as expected, but a decrease in the CǗO stretching frequency ( 1 3b, 
1 7 1 ). This usually indicates more 2n* backbonding and a weaker C-O 
bond. Although the dissociation of CO is usually inhibited with respect to 
the early transition metal alone, it may be slightly promoted relative to 
the later TM. In the case of Pd 
+ Ta combinations, the reduction in CO 
adsorption energy is attributed to a reduced DOS near Er, whereby the 
bimetallic combination looks very "noble-metal-like" ( 1 76-1 78). The 
nature of the electronic interaction leading to "lower" CO desorption 
states has also been probed on PtxNi/1 I I )-SEAs with PAX (261). The Pt 
sites on these surfaces show a 0.6 eV lower "local work function" than 
pure pte 
I l l). "Mixed" and "higher" CO peak temperatures have been 
frequently reported when both metals come from Mn or to its right in the 
Periodic Table.

responding alloys, the limited results indicate that CO bonds to the tran­
sition metal atoms with a somewhat 
weakened bond as in Figure 5. Column 
2 in Table 4 is therefore listed as "mixed," since pure Al and Sn have 
very low CO desorption temperatures. The Al 
+ 
Ru surface alloy is an 
exception , since its CO-TDS spectrum is quite like pure Ru ( 1 1 2). The 
substantially reduced adsorption energy for CO on Pd/Al( l l l) has been 
attributed to a lower 4d electron population on the Pd monolayer relative 
to bulk Pd (167). For Al adatoms (which form islands) on transition metal 
or noble metal substrates, a great increase in the dissociation probability 
for CO occurs relative to either pure metal surface. An adlayer of Ni 
deposited on Al(l l l) may also look similar to Al/Ni, due to a strong 
tendency for Al to surface segregate even at room temperature (1 63). 
Indeed, both surfaces show a great tendency to dissociate CO, and a 
reduced C-O stretching frequency (162, 1 63). This has been attributed to 
a Nix-C-O-Al" species that acts as a precursor to C-O cleavage (163). 
Thus, the tendency for dissociation in these cases may be due to the great 
affinity of 
Al adatoms for the oxygen of 
CO. Indeed, Al203 has exceedingly 
strong AI-O bonds. Why Al as adatoms (even in islands) on transition 
metals shows this tendency, yet Al in pure Al metal or in the topmost 
plane of alloys does not, remains a question. A similar difference is seen 
for Sn reactivity towards O2 when on Pt( l l l) as opposed to in Pt-Sn alloy 
surfaces (160). 
Bismuth adatoms on transition metals act very much like Au mentioned 
above with respect to CO adsorption in that they essentially site-block 
adsorption with only a slight reduction in the heat of adsorption (Figure 
5) (133). In contrast to the islands for Aua, however, Bia disperses across 
the surface much more randomly, so it is expected to be much more 
intimately mixed with COa; at least at low coverages of both. 
Alkali metals also spread across transition metal and noble metal 
surfaces, and are even more uniformly spaced than Bia due to much greater 
adatom-adatom repulsions. Alkali metals greatly increase the heat of 
adsorption of CO on such surfaces (Figure 5), but decrease its sticking 
probability toward zero at full (close-packed monolayer) coverage. The 
dissociation probability for CO increases due to increased electron 
donation from the substrate metal into the 2n* orbital of 
CO. These effects 
are facilitated by electron transfer from the alkali to the metal, and by the 
electrostatic field emanating from the large dipole moment of the alkali 
adatom. Some direct alkali-CO bonding may also be involved. These 
alkali/CO coadsorption systems have been the subject of 
so much excellent 
experimental (190-201 ,  263) and theoretical (190, 202-205) study that a 
thorough review is beyond the scope of this chapter. The reader is referred 
to an excellent book (190) and the papers listed above for more details on

this subject. One important point that should be made is that the strong 
electronic effect of adsorbed alkalis upon adsorbed CO can be quite long 
in range, although it certainly dies off with increasing distance. Since at 
substantial distances (;:0: 4 A) a large part of this electronic effect is now 
thought to be due to an electrostatic, through-space interaction between 
the adsorbed CO and the large dipole moment associated with the alkali 
adatoms, I expect the strength of this effect to fall off with distance in a 
similar way to that estimated in the section on Corrugated Substrates, 
above, or as 1/[r 3 •  
exp (r/U], where Is may be 
 1 0  A along a smooth 
surface. This is therefore a rather long-range interaction, so Madelung­
like sums should be considered to understand fully the effect of an array 
of alkali adatoms on a CO molecule adsorbed within this array. 
Alkali adlayers frequently show a sudden increase in reactivity not only 
toward CO but also toward other gases when the coverage of the alkali 
exceeds one-half 
monolayer (i.e. just beyond the work-function minimum) 
(197 and references therein). This is consistent with a depolarization of 
the 
alkali adatoms from ionic to a more neutral species above approximately 
1/2 ML, whereby s-electron density reappears on the alkali atom and 
therefore becomes available for reactive chemistry. 
H
ydrogen Adsor
ption 
Gaseous H2 (H2•g) only dissociatively adsorbs on the pure metals we will 
study here at temperatures (T) above lOOK. The product is two hydrogen 
adatoms (Ha>. These can go subsurface (Hb) on some metals. The dis­
sociative adsorption ofH2 occurs readily on the transition metals, and the 
hydrogen adatoms recombine and desorb as Hz at Ǟ 300--1000K. There is 
a large (> 
10 kcal/mole) activation barrier for Hz adsorption on Cu, Ag, 
and Au associated with H-H bond cleavage. If this is overcome by first 
dissociating the Hz in the gas phase, hydrogen adatoms (Ha) can also be 
formed on these noble metals. They associatively desorb as H z,g in TDS 
at ǟ 300K on Cu, Ǡ 260K on Ag, and , 200K on Au. The nontransition 
metals to be discussed here (Bi, AI, Sn, and the alkali metals) also do not 
easily adsorb Hz at lOOK. 
The dissociative adsorption of Hz on bimetallic surfaces is summarized 
in Table 5. Sticking probabilities are generally more dramatically affected 
by bimetallic combination for Hz,g -> 2Ho than for COg -> COo because (a) 
the former has a requirement of at least two sites rather than one to 
accommodate the adsorbed products, and (b) the former has associated 
with it a substantial activation energy related to H-H bond cleavage on 
the pure noble metal and nontransition metal surfaces. Therefore addition 
of these metals to transition metals generally causes a rapid decrease in 
the rate of hydrogen adsorption due to site-blocking and in some cases

due also to electronic effects o n  
the activation energy. Of course, the noble 
metals (and possibly AI) tend to cluster into 2-d islands when adsorbed on 
TM surfaces, so that the sticking probability and saturation coverage of 
hydrogen tend to fall only linearly with admetal coverage, these being 
simply proportional to the fraction of 
the TM surface remaining uncovered 
by the admetal islands. In these cases, the adsorbed hydrogen bonds and 
desorbs very similarly as it does for the pure TM surface, only in lower 
amounts. In one case, some evidence has been presented that suggests that 
these hydrogen adatoms bonded to free Ru sites on p(l x 1)­
CUo.5/Ru(000l )  can "spill over" onto the Cu sites (142). This, if true, 
has very important but unfortunate implications for the use of hydrogen 
adsorption to quantify selectively the number of TM sites on the surface 
of NM + TM bimetallic surfaces, a technique that has been applied for 
years in characterizing high-surface-area bimetallic catalysts. 
The reverse overlayer, i.e. TM/NM, has been studied in H 2  adsorption 
only for the case of p(l x 1 )-Ni/Cu(1 l l) (1 56) and Fe/Cu( l OO) (282), to 
our knowledge. As with COa on this same surface, only Ni sites are 
populated by hydrogen on pel x l )-Ni/Cu(l l l) at 300K; and these are 
electronically very similar to the sites on the pure Ni( l l l ) surface judging 
by the hydrogen TDS. Other 
systems, like Pdf 
Au(l l l), where ligand effects 
are obvious for COli' are also expected to show ligand effects for Hl/' 
Indeed, ligand effects appear to operate in the case of Fe/Cu(1 
00) (282). 
Alloy surfaces of transition metals with noble metals also show only 
sites with TM-like behavior, diluted of course by the noble metal. Two or 
more neighboring TM surface atoms are required to adsorb H2 dis­
sociatively, as is obvious from the fact that the e(2 x 2)-Cuo 5 W 
o. 5/W 
(100) 
surface alloy will not do so (1 88). A somcwhat higher tempcrature dcsorp­
tion peak is seen for hydrogen from Cu + Ru (1 40a,b) and Pd + Ag (1 28) 
alloys than from the pure TM. In the latter cases, this was attributed to 
the fact that Ag facilitates H penetration into subsurface sites, which show 
slower desorption kinetics even on pure Pd surfaces. 
For the rare earth plus transition metal surfaces, Nd/Cu(IOO) and 
Nd + Cu alloys, "mixed" desorption peaks for H 
2 are seen ( 1 59). 
As was the case for CO", hydrogen adsorption on the various 
TM 
I + TM2 bimetallic surfaces shows complicated behavior, with desorp­
tion peak temperatures that are lower than, higher than, the same as, 
and/or between those for either pure transition metal. This indicates again 
that there are substantial electronic ligand effects in these systems. These 
electronic elTects also do not manifest themselves in simple ways with 
respect to hydrogen adsorption compared to CO adsorption. That is, the 
desorption peak temperatures for these two species do not generally shift 
in the same direction (nor always in opposite directions).

Bismuth ada 
toms act pretty much like inert site blockers for hydrogen 
adsorption on the transition metals studied so far (Pt, Ni) and, also like 
noble metals, they have little electronic effect on the adsorption energy of 
hydrogen ( 1 33). They spread out more uniformly on the surface, however, 
and poison the saturation hydrogen adsorption about twice as fast as CO 
adsorption ( 1 33, 248, 249). This is probably because Hz coverage requires 
two or more free Pt atoms (249), although analysis of this type of data is 
highly complicated (248). 
Consistent with the picture that several Pt atoms in a group are required 
to dissociatively adsorb Hz is the fact that the p(2 x 2)-SnO.2SPtO 7s/Pt(l l l) 
surface alloy will not dissociatively adsorb H2, yet it bonds hydrogen 
ada 
toms with about the same adsorption strength as pure pte I I I) if these 
are deposited from a gas-phase H-atom source (1 60). (Actually, only the 
desorption temperature was measured.) This surface even has ensembles 
of four Pt atoms adjacent to the central (fifth) Pt atom, which apparently 
is insufficient to adsorb H 2• The adsorption energy for CO was, however, 
somewhat reduced on this surface, so one cannot rule out that some 
electronic effect is operating on the barrier for H-H cleavage in the tran­
sition state, and that this ensemble would otherwise be sufficient. 
Alkali metals on transition metal or noble metal surfaces usually 
decrease the dissociative adsorption probability for Hz, yet increase the 
desorption temperature for hydrogen adatoms (via 2Ha --+ Hz,g)' The for­
mer has been attributed to an ensemble or site-blocking effect, whereas 
the latter is due to some electronic stabilization (206-21 1). Sodium also 
stabilizes H" on AI(1 I I) (2 12). 
Oxygen Adsorption 
Gaseous O2 (02,g) dissociatively adsorbs on the pure early transition 
metals to produce two oxygen adatoms (O,J even at low temperatures. At 
higher temperatures, bulk oxides can form. Some of the late transition 
metals and noble metals can stabilize molecularly adsorbed oxygen (02,J 
in the peroxo (ot;) and maybe superoxo (O;:,,) forms at low temperatures, 
which act as precursors to dissociation. If 
dissociation does not occur upon 
warming, O2,,, desorbs at :::;
 200K. The heat of adsorption of Oa correlates 
to some extent with the heat offormation of 
the bulk oxide of 
the transition 
and noble metals. Associative desorption via 20a --+ O2 gives peaks in TDS 
in the temperature range 580-1200K on some of the middle and late 
transition metals and noble metals such as Ru, In, Pd, Rh, Pt, Ag, and Au. In 
the case of Au, the Oa has to be deposited from some other gas (such as 
N02) or via gas-phase excitation of the 0-0 bond, since O2 does not 
dissociatively adsorb with any measurable probability on clean Au. Tin, 
aluminum, and alkali metals also dissociatively adsorb Oz quite readily to

make oxidic monolayers and thicker oxide films. Bismuth does the same, 
but with much lower sticking probability ( 
1 0 - 6). The distinction between 
Oa and bulk-like oxides are less clear with these nontransition metals. 
Alkali metals also display oxide forms in which the 0-0 bond stays intact 
to quite high temperatures. 
With respect to the dissociative adsorption of O2 on bimetallic surfaces 
composed of a noble metal and a transition metal, or two transition 
metk, Table 6 shows that sticking probabilities and adsorption energies 
(desorption temperatures) are frequently found that are between those 
of the two pure metals. In one exception (Ni + Ru), a lower desorption 
temperature is seen than with either pure metal ( 1 69). When oxides form, 
the dissociation temperature for the more stable oxide is generally reduced 
in the presence of the other metal (1 69). Often it appears that oxygen 
bonds initially to the metal atoms that havc thc higher heat of oxygen 
adsorption or of oxide formation. Bimetallic surfaces of 
all types frequently 
show oxygen-induced segregation of this same species to the surface. 
A list of numerous systems that display surface segregation of one 
species due to oxygen chemisorption or oxidation is presented in Table 7,

along with the tempcrature required. As can be seen, substantial heating 
is frequently necessary to allow enough diffusion to see this effect, and the 
species that is enriched at the surface is that which forms the more stable 
oxide or Oa species, rather than the one expected to segregate in vacuum. 
In one exception (with Culn alloys), the species with the less stable oxide 
. (CU20) is initially segregated to the surface, but it converts to the more 
. stable oxide upon further heating, via: 3Cu20 + 2In --+ 6Cu + 1nz03 ( 1 52). 
Bismuth adatoms rapidly poison the adsorption of 
both molecular (OZ,a) 
and dissociative (20J oxygen adsorption on PtO l l) via steric site-block­
ing, with very little change in the heat of 
oxygen adsorption in either form 
« 
1 kcaljmole) ( 1 33, 248, 249). The activation energy for the process 
O2,,, --+ 20" is reduced by ", 0.6 kcaljmole by the presence of Bi", but this 
is sufficient to cause a substantial change in the dissociation probability 
for OZ,lI during TDS. 
The surface alloys of Pt and Sn show a much lower dissociative sticking 
probability for O2 than either pure metal, whereas Sn adatoms on Pt( l ! !) 
show a sticking probability that is about the same as on Sn alone ( 160). 
As on pure Sn, there is a greatly increased oxygen uptake on SnjPt(l l l) 
relative to pure Pt(1 1 1) ( 1 60), with the formation of Sn oxides ( 1 60, 1 6 1 ). 
As with AljRu(OOOI ), Sn adatoms on Pt(l l l ) are very different with respect 
to chemisorption than Sn atoms in the topmost Pt(l l l) layer. 
Alkali metal ada 
toms on noble metals, on middle to late transition 
metals, and on Bi cause a significant increase in the dissociative sticking 
probability relative to the clean substrate surfaces, bringing it close to 
unity for oxygen : alkali surface atomic ratios below unity (98, 1 90, 2 1 1 ,  
2 1 3-22 1). In the case ofBi(OOOI )  
(22 1) and Au (2 14) this means an increase 
in reaction rate by over five orders of magnitude. Since the alkali mctals 
themselves generally have high reactivities with O2 as well (222), this may 
be due to direct alkali-oxygen complex [ormation, although indirect ligand 
cffects and electrostatic effects are also expected. Just as with CO", alkali 
addition should cause greater backdonation into the 2n* orbitals of 02.a, 
thus weakening the 0-0 bond and enhancing dissociation. Significant 
evidence has been seen in several cases (58, 1 90, 2 1 6, 2 1 7, 2 1 9) for O-alkali 
complex formation when coadsorbed on transition and noble metals, 
although there appears to still be dominate bonding of the oxygen atoms 
to the substrate metal (2 1 1). The nature of the O-alkali interaction is still 
controversial, although it is certain that the alkali metal itself is more 
stable on the surface when oxygen is present at least at high coverages 
(2 1 3-22 1 ). The oxygen in this complex also reacts readily with CO gas to 
produce CO2 in the case of CsjCu(I I O) (224) and KjPd(l l l) (223) with 
kinctics not greatly different than for 0" in the absence of alkali; this 
indicates that the oxygen maintains a chemical character much like chemi-

sorbed oxygen, albeit perturbed by the alkali. The molecular adsorption 
of O2 is stabilized to higher temperatures on the alkali-dosed surfaces, 
where Oz-alkali complexes have also been observed (214, 218, 220). This 
may not be too surprising, since the pure alkali metal surfaces themselves 
also stabilize 02.a in UHV up to ط 450K (214). The desorption temperature 
for the molecularly adsorbed O2 on K-dosed Au is above room tem­
perature even at low K coverages (214). The desorption peak temperature 
for the dissociated oxygen on alkali-dosed transition metals and noble 
metals can appear either somewhat below (21 6, 2 1 7) or somewhat above 
(98, 2 1 3, 214) that for Ou on the alkali-free substrate. 
Alkaline earth metals are expected to have similar effects on oxygen 
adsorption as do adsorbed alkali metals. This appears to be the case in at 
least one example: 02/Ca/Au (225). 
Other Molecules 
A number of other simple molecules have been studied on well-defined 
bimetallic surfaces. I briefly review below some of these systems to give 
the reader a feeling for the scope of 
these studies and the types of 
influences 
the bimetallic surface can have. 
N2 The dissociative adsorption of N 2 on surface-enriched Fe72Cr2s(l lO) 
alloy surfaces was found to be suppressed (relative to pure Cr) by the 
presence of small amounts of Fe at the surface ( 126). In that study, an 
excellent effort was made to predict the lateral distribution of Fe and Cr 
in the topmost atomic layer based on the short-range order parameter 
estimated from bulk thermodynamic data for these alloys. The authors 
conclude that an electronic effect of Fe upon the chromium atoms reduces 
their reactivity, rather than a simple dilution of 
active Cr ensembles (groups 
of atoms necessary for reaction) by the less reactive Fe atoms. 
Alkali adatoms on transition metal surfaces facilitate N 2 dissociative 
adsorption (226, 227) as they do for the isoelectronic CO (see above). As 
with COm this might be attributed to enhanced backbonding into the 2n* 
orbital, which weakens the N-N bond. In contrast to COa> however, the 
metal-adsorbate bond is weakened for the form of N 
2.", which bonds 
perpendicular to the surface (226, 227). This difference has been used as 
evidence to argue that the adsorption energy for CO comes mainly from 
n-backbonding, whereas for this type of N 
2,a it comes from o--donation 
(226). In contrast, the metal-N2 bond is strengthened by potassium 
addition for the n-bonded form of N

ETHYLENE AND SIMPLE HYDROCARBONS 
Ethylene adsorption has been 
studied on Cu and Au overlayers (and perhaps surface alloys) on Ru(OOOl )  
(1 40b), and on 
p(1 x 1 )-Cu/Rh(1 I I )  
(144). The dominant result is that the 
adsorption is relatively similar to that for the two pure metals. For 
example, ethylene has di-a bonding to the transition metal sites, but n­
bonds only to the noble metal atoms (which generally cluster onto 2-d 
islands) (l40b). The latter form of ethylene does not dissociate upon 
heating, whereas the former does. The latter bonding is, however, elec­
tronically affected by the underlying transition metal in a subtle way, 
resulting, for example, in an increased "nO''' parameter (140b). 
A strong electronic effect is manifested in the Pt-rich surfaces of 
Pt50Ni 5o( l l l) alloys, whereby the top-layer Pt atoms will not adsorb 
ethylene at 1 80K (even dissociatively) (228), whereas Pt( l l l) does so very 
rapidly and strongly. Similar effects are seen for benzene ( 1 72) and for CO 
and H2 (see above). 
Well-ordered Pt-Sn surface alloys on Pt(l l l) still adsorb ethylene in 
the di-a form expected for pure Pt-like sites. However, the TDS peak 
temperature decreases from 285K to 1 84K with increasing Sn content, and 
electronic effects consistent with weaker bonding are also seen in the 
ethylene vibrational spectrum. Also, whereas most of the ethylene dis­
sociates during TDS on clean Pt(l l l ), no decomposition is seen even for 
the p(2 x 2)-Sn 02 sPt O. 75/Pt(l l l) surface (229). This has been attributed to 
an ensemble effect (229), but the electronic effects that increase the desorp­
tion rate may be sufficient alone to explain the fact that the dissociation 
probability decreases. [See kinetic formalism of (234).] 
Potassium (230a,b) or Cs (23 1 )  
addition to Pt( l l l) causes the ethylene to 
n-bond instead of 
di-a bond. The probability that ethylene will decompose 
during TDS is also greatly reduced (230a,b, 23 1). 
As with respect to the simpler molecules above, bismuth adatoms on 
Pt( l  I I )  act much like inert site blockers with respect to ethylene adsorp­
tion. Adsorption and decomposition are suppressed largely via a steric, 
site-blocking (ensemble) mechanism with very little electronic effect (232). 
Similar results have also been seen for a series of 
cyclic alkanes, alkenes, 
and aromatics on Bi/Pt( 1 1 1) (234-236). Because these molecules also bond 
to Bi, but much more weakly than to Pt, precursor chemisorption kinetics 
are seen whereby the sticking probabilities are barely influenced by the 
presence of bismuth adatoms, provided there arc still sufficient free Pt sites 
to adsorb a small amount of the molecule. After the Pt-like sites are 
filled, bonding states are populated with adsorption energies intermediate 
between that of pure Pt and that of pure Bi (see Figure 8 below). These 
are attributed to Iess-than-optimum bonding geometries whereby the 
hydrocarbon must reorient on the surface due to steric overlap with Bi

adatoms. There may also be some electronic effects on these high-density 
overlayers. 
H20 AND C0 2 
The adsorption strength and dissociation of H20 (21 1 , 233 
and references therein) and CO2 (197, 256 and references therein) are 
generally enhanced by alkali addition to transition metal and noble metal 
surfaces. Formation of alkali-hydroxyl and alkali-carbonate complexes. 
respectively, are frequently reported. The adsorption of H20 (and 
CH30H) has also been briefly studied on Cu/Ru(OOOI) (1 89a,b). 
CATALYTIC REACTIONS ON WELL-DEFINED

BIMETALLIC SURFACES 
Catalytic activity or selectivity can be greatly enhanced by the addition of 
a second metal to the primary active metal, as is evidenced by even a 
cursory look through the patent literature. Indeed, much of 
the motivation 
for the research outlined above has been to improve our fundamental 
understanding of the various effects that give rise to improved catalytic 
properties on bimetallic systems. As pointed out in a number of excellent 
reviews based on extensive study with high-surface-area bimetallic 
catalysts, both electronic effects ( 1 5, 237-243) and ensemble effects (1 5, 
237-241 .  250) can play a major role in these improvements. However, 
because they are both generally operating simultaneously, separating these 
effects and assessing their relative importance in the reaction mechanism 
has been very difficult (250). 
At the very least, a detailed knowledge of the surface compositions of 
the two elements and their lateral distribution (atomic-level structure) 
within the top 
few 
atomic layers is 
necessary to obtain any real fundamental 
understanding of bimetallic effects in catalysis. Because of the difficulty of 
this task for high-area catalysts. a number of successful attempts have 
been made to study catalytic 
reactions over well-defined bimetallic surfaccs 
prepared from single crystals, which are more amenable to structural 
characterization. For example, the reaction of H2 with surface oxygen to 
produce H20 has been studied in vacuum over p(1 x l )-AuxPdy/Pd(l l l) 
(1 1 5) and FexCuy/Cu(l l l) (244) thin-film alloy surfaces. In addition, a 
number of slower catalytic reactions that proceed with measurable rates 
only at medium pressures ( >  1 torr) have been studied on well-defined 
bimetallic surfaces in systems that combine a high- or medium-pressure 
microcatalytic reactor with an attached UHV chamber for surface charac­
terization. I have recently reviewed these studies (245), although a number 
of 
other excellent studies have since come to my attention (172, 246, 247, 257, 
258). As with high-area catalysts, some very dramatic improvements in

activity or selectivity have resulted from the controlled addition of 
a second 
metal to the surfaces of these model catalysts. An example of 
this is shown 
in Figure 7 for the case of Re addition to the Ft( l l !) surface. As can be 
seen, the reaction rate for ethane hydrogenolysis (C2H6 
+ H2 
-> 2CH4) is 
about five-fold faster for rv I monolayer of Re than for either pure metal 
(257). Sinfelt (283) has recently reviewed both the high-area catalytic 
results and the single-crystal studies of CujRu bimetallic surfaces in detail. 
That system is an excellent prototype that displays much of the rich 
but complex character of bimetallic systems. As with high-area catalysts, 
however, the separation of ensemble effects from electronic effects has

been rather uncertain or impossible even with these well-defined surfaces 
based on single-crystal substrates. 
The difficulty of isolating ensemble effects from electronic effects in 
catalytic reactions should be obvious from inspection ofthe results even for 
adsorption of simple molecules, as was typified in Tables 4-6. Substantial 
electronic effects were obviously occurring in every class of bimetallic 
surface thus far studied, with two possible exceptions: (a) for noble metal 
over 
layers on transition metal substrates, and (b) for bismuth overlayers 
on transition metal substrates. In the former case, the noble mctal adatoms 
tend to coalesce into 2-d islands that display chemisorption activity, or 
lack thereof, very similar to the pure noble metal, and the remainder of 
the surface acts like pure transition metal. Thus, ensemble effects are 
largely absent in this case or are practically impossible to quantify because 
they occur only at the edges of islands or at vacancy defects in thesc islands. 
On the other hand, bismuth overlayers on transition metals show great 
promise for isolating ensemble effects from electronic effects (232, 234--
236, 248, 249). This is because (a) bismuth adatoms show only very small 
lateral electronic effects when coadsorbed with simple molecules (CO(l) 
02,a, 0(1) Ha, C2H4,a, c-CSH , O,Ul c-CbH , 2,,,, c-CSH8,,,, c-CC6H , o,(I) and c­
C6H6,J, at least on Pt( l l l ); (b) bismuth atoms are themselves practically 
inert (234, 259); and (c) bismuth adatoms show only very weakly repulsive 
lateral interactions with each other, and with co 
adsorbates, so that their 
lateral distribution is very close to random at low coverages (234), Based 
on the results of the section on the Site for the Adsorbed Atom, above, it 
is also safe to assume that the Bi adatoms will mostly reside in the highest 
coordination hollow sites on the surface at low coverages [i.e, three-fold 
hollows on Pt(l l l)], From typical diffusion energies given in Ref. (30) and 
from the results of Ref. (33), we can also assume that bismuth adatoms 
are quite mobile even at l 50K on Pt(l l l). Thus, on Pt( l l l) they can be 
thought of as a nearly random-filling lattice gas at low coverage, which 
sterically block the three Pt atoms associated with their lattice site. 
Although no net catalytic reactions have yet been studied on transition 
metal surfaces as a function of Bi coverage, we have studied a number 
of surface reactions involving the dehydrogenation of simple adsorbed 
hydrocarbons on the Pt(l l l) surface. Free Pt surface atoms, "[Pt]," are 
needed in these reactions, because they abstract the hydrogen atoms from 
the hydrocarbon, breaking the C- H bond. Thus, the reactions studied can 
be written in general as: 
CxHy,a +A[Pt] --+ nH,, + CxHy_n,a> 
where A is the number of free Pt atoms needed for hydrogen abstraction, 
which we also call the "true ensemble requirement." Note that both reac-

competing at the reaction temperature against intact molecular desorption: 
erR),,{/ -+ C-,Hy,g. The competition between these two steps was measured 
by monitoring the relative amounts of Ha and CxHy,g produced during 
TDS. This was performed in the limit of low hydrocarbon coverage to 
prevent self-blocking of sites by the hydrocarbon or its products. An 
example of the type of data obtained is shown in Figure 8 for the case of 
cyclohexane. Notice that the amount of 
dehydrogenation (which is given 
by the area under the TDS curves at m/e = 2 for 2Ra -+ H2,g) decreases to

almost zero by the addition of e:i = 0.2. Tn this same coverage range, the 
probability for molecular desorption correspondingly increases to nearly 
unity, with only a tiny shift in the desorption peak temperature. This 
small shift highlights the lack of significant electronic effects on adsorbed 
cyclohexane due to Bi" in this low coverage regime; so the decrease in 
dehydrogenation has been attributed mainly to simple site-blocking effects 
(234). If one monolayer of Bi is predosed, the cyclohexane desorbs at a 
temperature only slightly above that at which it would desorb from a pure 
Bi surface or from cyclohexane multilayers. 
Figure 9 summarizes the results for a series of hydrocarbons on 
BijPt(1 1 1) by plotting the dissociation probability (Pdiss) for each chemi­
sorbed hydrocarbon during its residence time on the surface against the 
bismuth coverage. Here, Pdiss = 1 .0 implies 1 00% dehydrogenation; and 
Pdiss = 0 means 1 00% molecular desorption. As can be seen, there are 
dramatic differences between the different classes of adsorbed hydro­
carbons with respect to how rapidly Bia poisons their dehydrogenation. 
The alkanes 
are poisoned quite rapidly, the mono-olefins show no influence 
of Bi until some critical coverage, above which dehydrogenation is rapidly 
poisoned, and the aromatic falls somewhere in between. We have shown 
that Bia has only a tiny electronic influence on these reactions, and these 
qualitative differences are due entirely to simple site-blocking affects by Bia 
(234-236). For discussing these curves, we introduced the term "eff
ective 
ensemble requirement, " A* (234), which in the present case is defined as 
A* = I/BcR where BCR is the critical number of Bi adatoms (per Pt surface 
atom) necessary to suppress Pdiss to 1 /3 of its value in the absence of Bia. 
This parameter is quite valuable for qualitatively describing how rapidly 
a site-blocker like Bi suppresses the reaction probability, in this case for 
dehydrogenation. This effective ensemble requirement, A *, is 6.2 for the 
alkanes, 3. 1 for benzene, and 1 .3 for the mono-olefins. We have shown 
(234) that the value of this parameter is only a weak function of the true 
ensemble requirement (A), but that it correlates very strongly with the ratio 
(r) of rate constants for dehydrogenation: desorption as measured on the 
Bi-free surface at the same temperature. This ratio, which is very large for 
mono-olefins, near unity for alkanes, and intermediate for benzene, is 
largely determined by the difference in activation energies for desorption 
minus dehydrogenation. The curves of Figure 9 are all well described by 
the expression: 
Pdiss = r( l - 3BBi)A 
I[ 
I + r( l - 38Bi)A], 
which was derived by realizing that the diffusion of Bia was very fast 
compared to the dehydrogenation rate (234). From this, the weak depen­
dence on A and the strong dependence on r should be obvious. Only for

to those needed to tirst chemisorb it. The mechanistic details that explain 
these results are presented in (234). 
Perhaps the most important conclusion of these studies is that the true 
ensemble requirement only controls how rapidly the reaction probability 
falls with site-blocking in the special cases in which r is very small. Thus, 
one cannot in general even qualitatively assess which reactions require a 
larger number of free sites simply by observing which reactions are 
poisoned more rapidly by the addition of a site-blocking agent like Bia. 
One must, therefore, seriously question even the qualitative conclusions 
about relative ensemble requirements that have previously been obtained 
in this manner. In the absence of a very detailed understanding of the 
reaction mechanism and proper kinetic modeling, such measurements will 
only give an "effective ensemble requirement." The latter alone, while 
lacking true mechanistic interpretability, is nevertheless most important 
from a practical point of view. For example, one can greatly improve the 
selectivity for a reaction with a small "effective ensemble requirement" 
over a reaction with a large A * by the addition of site blocking agents. 
(Compare, for example, the influence of OȊi = 0.3 upon the dehydro­
genation of adsorbed oletins to that of alkanes in Figure 9.) 
In the studies outlined above, the assumption was made that weak 
lateral repulsions between the bismuth and the adsorbed hydrocarbons 
did not influence the lateral distribution of the bismuth on the surface. 
Actually, one should also consider the influence of these lateral interactions 
between adsorbates upon their lateral distributions in kinetic models. 
Beautiful numerical simulations that do just that have been described for 
gencral cases of catalyst poisoning (251 ,  252). Those results suggest that 
the assumption of randomness was not too bad in the above examples, at 
least not until OBi exceeded ", 10% of a monolayer (234). In general, this 
assumption becomes worse at higher coverages. 
Another assumption that fails at high coverages of either species is that 
of "nonoverlapping" or "isolated" ensembles (248). This assumption is 
needed to obtain the (1 - tiM)A factor in rate equations, where OM is the 
fraction of the surface masked by the site-blocking agent. More accurate 
functional dependences have been obtained by numerical simulations 
(without this assumption) for a range of surface geometries and ensemble 
sizes (248). 
Clearly, the considerations necessary to separate ensemble effects from 
electronics effects in bimetallic catalysis are rather complex. However, 
there does seem to be some hope for eventually assessing the relative 
importance of these two, at least for some simple systems. It seems that 
only then will we be able to address properly the electronic effects that are 
equally important in giving bimetallic catalysts their special properties.

CAMPBELL 
CONCLUSIONS 
The last decade has seen a tremendous growth in our understanding of 
bimetallic surface chemistry. We are starting to have reasonable predictive 
ability concerning the structures that will result at bimetallic surfaces when 
treated or prepared in a controlled way in UHV. We are also beginning 
to recognize trends in the interactions of simple molecules with bimetallic 
surfaces. Catalytic reactions are beginning to be studied on well-defined 
bimetallic surfaces, and it is clear from these studies that both electronic 
and ensemble effects play very important roles. There is some hope for 
assessing the ensemble effects separately from electronic effects by studies 
on carefully prepared bimetallic surfaces that have well-defined lateral 
distributions of 
the two metals and a minimum of 
electronic effects between 
the metals. 
Our improved understanding of bimetallic surface chemistry is perhaps 
most clearly exemplified by citing examples of how this understanding is 
starting to be used to advantage. The use of 
bismuth overlayers as outlined 
above to assess ensemble effects is one such example. Bismuth ada 
toms 
have also been used to advantage as surface derivatizing agents to prevent 
adsorbate dissociation and thus to promote intact molecular desorption 
for subsequent mass spectral analysis. This has led to a new surface 
analytical technique called "bismuth postdosing thermal desorption mass 
spectroscopy" (253). Postdosed copper has also been used on Ru surfaces 
to aid in the quantitative analysis of subsurface hydrogen (254). One can 
only expect that more impressive premeditated applications of bimetallic 
surfaces will evolve with our increasing understanding of 
these systems in 
the next decades.
