In this paper, we report the ﬁrst temperature dependent kinetic measurements of the reaction of
C Z 5 1-alkenes with OH radicals and also report the ﬁrst room temperature measurements for
1-alkenes between C811. The rate coeﬃcients at room temperature and between 75 and 100 Torr
for the reaction of OH with 1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene and 1-undecene are
(2.74  0.38)  1011, (3.62  0.68)  1011, (4.20  0.41)  1011, (7.00  0.96)  1011 and
(12.44  1.62)  1011 cm3 molecule1 s1, respectively, at 298 K. No pressure dependence is
observed, suggesting that these reactions are at their high pressure limit. Inspection of the
variation of rate coeﬃcient with temperature over the temperature range 262–300 K shows a
weak negative temperature dependence, suggesting that adduct formation is taking place,
however, a curved Arrhenius plot is clearly seen for 1-decene and theoretical analysis suggests
that abstraction by OH is a non-negligible channel. An estimation of products formed from OH
oxidation suggests that abstraction will lead to products that have a lower photochemical ozone
creation potential than those formed via addition.
Introduction
The reaction of alkenes with OH radicals is of great impor-
tance to atmospheric chemistry, and under certain low NOx
conditions, represents the dominant tropospheric sink for
HOx.1 This is the result of typically fast rates of reaction
coupled with high alkene concentrations present in the tropo-
sphere.2–4 Higher molecular weight alkenes—such as those
studied in this work—are observed frequently in the urban
troposphere5 and have been detected in motor vehicle emis-
sions,6 furthermore, the lack of resolution inherent in standard
single-column chromatographic apparatus may have resulted
in signiﬁcant underestimations of the concentration of C46
compounds in the urban atmosphere.7 Reaction of alkenes
with OH proceeds via two pathways, the most important of
which is considered to be the addition channel, as shown in
Fig. 1a. A second reaction pathway also exists, which abstracts
a hydrogen atom from an alkyl group substituent to an oleﬁnic
bond, as shown in Fig. 1b.
Overall rate coeﬃcients for these reactions are poorly con-
strained for long chain alkenes, especially with regards to their
temperature and pressure dependence. Previous measurements
of Cr4 alkenes exhibit a strong pressure dependence8 and a
non-Arrhenius temperature dependence,9–11 which results
from the formation of an energy-rich OH-alkene adduct.
The energised adduct could then re-dissociate back to reac-
tants, undergo bond ﬁssion to yield products or undergo
collisional stabilisation.
In the literature, the addition pathway is considered most
important,12,13 however, the importance of the abstraction
pathway is uncertain. Atkinson8 conjectured that abstraction
becomes of increasing importance for alkenes with long side
chains. Indeed, Photo Ionisation Mass Spectrometer studies by
Biermann et al.,14 have shown qualitatively that the abstrac-
tion pathway occurs for the reaction of OH with 1-butene and
1-pentene. More recently, the application of graph theoretical
concepts to the kinetics of alkenes15 has led these authors to
suggest that hydrogen abstraction reactions become of in-
creasing importance with increasing size of alkyl substituents.

However, there is also the possibility that hyperconjugation
rather than abstraction is the cause of rate coeﬃcients en-
hancement, as suggested by Canosa-Mas et al.,12 and more
recently reiterated by Pfrang et al.13
To probe further the importance of the abstraction path-
way, experimental and theoretical studies have been under-
taken to investigate the kinetics of the reaction of OH with a
series of 1-alkenes (i.e. 1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-nonene and
1-decene) as a function of pressure and temperature.
Experimental
The basis of the experimental technique requires measurement
of the rate of OH radical decay as a function of a known excess
concentration of the reactant 1-alkene. All reactions were
performed using a 21.5 mm i.d. double-jacketed Pyrex ﬂow
tube, the walls of which were coated with Halocarbon wax
(Halocarbon Products Inc.). Reaction time was varied by
introducing the 1-alkene reactant at known distances along
the ﬂow tube using a 4 mm i.d. Pyrex movable injector. To
ensure rapid mixing of reactants, a ‘‘turbulizer’’ (a propeller-
shaped Teﬂon nozzle) was placed at the end of the injector,
and reaction times were calculated using the linear ﬂow
velocity and the distance between the tip of this injector and
the ion–molecule region (where reactions are considered to be
so rapid as to be practically instantaneous). Fig. 2 is a
schematic diagram of the apparatus.
Experiments were conducted under turbulent ﬂow condi-
tions (i.e. where the Reynolds number, Re exceeds 3000). Re is
given by.

ðIÞ
where d is the internal diameter of the ﬂow tube, 
u is the
average velocity of the carrier gas, r is the density of the carrier
gas and m is the viscosity of the carrier gas.
The temperature of the ﬂow tube was controlled to within 2 K
by ﬂowing a coolant (Texaco Havoline LC + B0F02) at the
desired temperature through the jacket on the exterior of the
ﬂow tube using a circulating cooler (NESLAB RTE 8). The
nitrogen carrier gas was pre-cooled to the same temperature by
passing it through a copper coil immersed in liquid nitrogen.
The carrier gas temperature was maintained with heating tape
regulated by an electronic controller (Carel Universal Infrared
control type W) in conjunction with a type-T thermocouple.
The temperature within the ﬂow tube was monitored using
type-T thermocouples located at the rear of the ﬂow tube and
immediately upstream of the variable aperture. The tempera-
ture proﬁle along the ﬂow tube was checked by placing a type-T
thermocouple at the end of the moveable injector and moving it
along the length of the ﬂow tube.
The ion–molecule region was constructed from 22 mm o.d.
Pyrex tubing and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (ABB
Extrel Merlin). All gas ﬂows were monitored with calibrated
mass ﬂow meters (MKS, 1179). The pressures in the ﬂow tube
were monitored using a 0–1000 Torr capacitance manometer
(MKS, Baratron).
OH radicals were produced upstream of the ﬂow tube via
the reaction.
H þ NO2 ! OH þ NO
ð1Þ
although OH is produced vibrationally excited (up to v = 3),
physical quenching is orders of magnitude faster than that of
mixing.16 Hydrogen atoms were produced by combining a
2.0 STP l min1 ﬂow of He with an 0.5 STP cm3 min1 ﬂow of
0.5% H2 in helium, which was passed through a microwave
discharge produced by a Surfatron (Sairem) microwave cavity
operating at 100 W. H atoms were introduced upstream of the
ﬂow tubevia a sidearm, where they werecombinedwith a 2.0–4.0
STP cm3 min1 ﬂow of 1% NO2 carried in a 2.0 STP l min1 He
ﬂush gas. At the pressures and ﬂow conditions used in this study,
it is calculated that the H atoms have been completely titrated
beforeenteringtheﬂowtube.Themassspectrometersignal(atm/
e 46) was monitored with the microwave turned oﬀand then
turned on. The decrease in the NO2 signal observed when the
microwave was turned on was attributed to the reaction (1).
Using this method it was found that on average 20% of H2
was dissociated into H atoms. Thus under normal operating
conditions the initial concentration of OH radicals formed from
the reaction of hydrogen atoms in the ﬂow tube ranged from
(1–10)  1010 molecules cm3.
1-alkene reactants were introduced into the reaction vessel
through an atmospheric bubbler, with ﬂow rates of 0.1–50 STP
cm3 min1 combined with a 5.0 STP l min1 ﬂow of N2 ﬂush gas,
which was then introduced into the ﬂow tube via a moveable
injector. Accurate concentrations were determined using the

1-alkene reactant vapour pressure and dilution factor within the
ﬂow tube. In all cases, [1-alkene] exceeded [OH] by a factor of 10
or more, ensuring pseudo-ﬁrst-order conditions. Blank runs
(with no RH added) were conducted to conﬁrm that OH signal
(measured at m/e 17, i.e. OH) was unaﬀected by the movement
of the injector.
OH and NO2 were chemically ionized using SF6
 as the
reagent ion. SF6
 was generated by combining a 10 STP
l min1 ﬂow of N2 and a 2.5 STP cm3 min1 ﬂow of SF6
and passing it through a 210Po Nuclecel ionizer (NRD Inc.).
The reagent ion was then carried into the ion–molecule region
through an injector constructed from 6 mm o.d. stainless steel.
A fan shaped turbulizer was attached to the end of the inlet to
enhance mixing of the reagent ion with the sampled ﬂow from
the ﬂow tube. OH was ionized by SF6
 via electron transfer,
enabling the species to be detected by its parent ion.
Ions were detected with a quadrupole mass spectrometer in
a three-stage diﬀerentially pumped vacuum chamber. A sam-
ple of the bulk gas ﬂow containing reactant ions is drawn into
the front chamber through a 0.6 mm aperture which was held
at a potential of 70 V to focus charged reactant molecules.
The front vacuum chamber was pumped by a rotary pump
(Varian DS402) and held at approximately 2 Torr. The ions
were further focused by a 30 mm o.d. and 0.2 mm i.d. stainless
steel plate held at 15 V and passed into a second chamber
containing the quadrupole mass ﬁlter (ABB Extrel, Merlin).
This second chamber was pumped by a turbomolecular pump
(Varian V250) backed by a rotary pump (Edwards E2M8).
The rear chamber, which held the multiplier assembly, was
pumped by a further turbomolecular pump (Varian V250)
backed by a rotary pump (Edwards E2M2). Under typical
operating conditions the rear chamber was held at a pressure
of approximately 9  106 Torr. Ions were detected using a
channeltron (Dtech 402A-H) in negative ion counting mode.
Materials
Helium (BOC, CP Grade) was passed through a gas clean
oxygen ﬁlter (Chrompak) cartridge to remove traces of oxy-
gen, a gas clean moisture ﬁlter cartridge (Chrompak) to
remove H2O, a GateKeeper Inert gas puriﬁer (Aeronex, model
CE500KIAR) to remove H2 and a trap maintained at 77 K
containing a molecular sieve (Alfa Aesar, 4A) to remove
water. 1-pentene (Fluka, 99.5%) 1-octene (Sigma Aldrich,
98%), 1-nonene (Sigma Aldrich, 98%), 1-decene (Fluka, Z
97%), 1-undecene (Sigma Aldrich, 98%) NO2 (Sigma Aldrich,
99.54%) and SF6 (BOC, electronic grade) were puriﬁed by
repeated
freeze-pump-thaw
cycles.
N2
and
H2
(BOC,
99.999%) were used as supplied.
Results
Assessment of detector sensitivity
Dilute mixtures of NO2 were injected via the moveable injector
into the ﬂow tube with no other gases present and the NO2

signal was monitored. From a linear plot of [NO2] vs. NO2

signal it is estimated that the sensitivity for NO2 was 2 
107 molecule cm3 cps1 for a signal-to-noise ratio of one, a
time constant of 1 s and an initial SF6
 of 1  106 cps1.
The NO2 concentrations were corrected to take into account
equilibrium concentrations of N2O4 in the gas mixtures used.
Under the experimental conditions the lifetime of N2O4
formed by the equilibrium
NO2 þ NO2 þ M Ð N2O4 þ M
ð2Þ
is comparable with the time of mixing.17 This assumption was
corroborated by the fact that on the time scale of the experi-
ment no change in [NO2] was observed.
Calibration of the OH sensitivity was performed in a
manner described by Canosa-Mas and Wayne.18 OH radicals
were produced via reaction (1). H atoms were injected into the
ﬂow tube via a side arm inlet located at the rear of the ﬂow
tube and in the absence of oxygen, known amounts of NO2
were added via the moveable injector. The mass spectrometer
OH signal (at m/e 17) was monitored as a function of the
NO2 concentration added at various contact times. It is
estimated that the sensitivity for OH was 4  107 molecule
cm3 cps1 for a signal-to-noise ratio of one, a time constant
of 1 s and an initial SF6
 of 1  106 cps1.
Kinetics
The rate coeﬃcient for reaction of OH with alkenes is mea-
sured by monitoring OH concentration proﬁles at m/e = 17
under pseudo-ﬁrst-order conditions with [OH] = (1–10) 
1010 molecules cm3 and [RH] = (1–50)  1011 molecules
cm3. First-order decay rates (k1st) are obtained by a linear
regression of the plots of ln(OH signal) vs. contact time
(as shown in Fig. 3a) to yield k1st. This process is repeated
for at least 10 diﬀerent values of [RH] at each pressure studied.
As shown in Fig. 3b, the values k1st are then plotted vs. [RH],
which is determined directly from the known concentration
in the mixture ﬂowing through the calibrated ﬂow meter.
These data points are ﬁtted with a linear least-squares routine,
the slope providing the bimolecular rate constant, kOH + alkene.
Table 1 lists the eﬀective bimolecular rate coeﬃcients obtained
in this study. This approach for determining bimolecular
rate constants assumes that deviations from the plug ﬂow
approximation are negligible. Under the conditions in our
turbulent ﬂow tube, Seeley et al.,19 estimated that these
deviations result in apparent rate constants that are B3%
below actual values assuming a reaction probability g for OH
loss at the ﬂow tube walls of 104 (and, at most, 8% below for
g values approaching unity). Hence, the ﬂow corrections
are neglected, as they are smaller than the sum of other likely
errors in the measurements of gas ﬂows, temperature, detector
signal,
pressure,
and

RH
concentrations.
The
temperature of the atmospheric bubbler, was controlled by
the NESLAB RTE 8 and ﬂuctuations in the temperature
results in error in the RH concentration. The temperature
of the ﬂow tube was controlled to within 2 K, which in
the worst case would result in 15% error in the bimolecular
rate coeﬃcient.
The data shown in Fig. 3 are for experiments carried out at
two diﬀerent pressures at 298 K. For all reactions studied,
within error, the eﬀective bimolecular rate coeﬃcient is invar-
iant with pressure, which is in agreement with previous studies
that indicate that, for C Z 4 alkenes, the rate coeﬃcient would
be at the high pressure limit under the conditions used in this

study.20 Previously, there have only been three room tempera-
ture experimental determinations of the rate coeﬃcient of OH
with 1-pentene. A high pressure relative rate determination at
735 Torr by Atkinson and Aschmann,21 a low pressure 2 Torr
ﬂow study by Biermann et al.,14 and a ﬂash photolysis study
carried out at 55 Torr by Nip and Parakesvopolous,22 which
are within experimental error with this study. Furthermore,
the results are in agreement over the pressure range of 2–
735 Torr which indicates that measured rate coeﬃcients are at
the high pressure limit, as shown in Fig. 4a.
The rate coeﬃcient for the reaction of OH was also studied
over the temperature range 262–300 K. From the data in Table 1
it is possible to carry out Arrhenius type analysis of the
temperature dependence yielding an ‘‘Arrhenius’’ expression as
summarised in Table 2. For all compounds studied, the
rate coeﬃcient displayed a negative temperature dependence,
i.e. rate increases as the temperature is lowered, as shown in
Fig. 4a–d.
The negative temperature dependence is indicative of a
complex mode reaction, i.e. that it proceeds through the
formation of an energised OH–alkene adduct. However, hy-
drogen abstraction is also known to occur9,11,14 and one would
expect a positive temperature dependence for such an elemen-
tary reaction. The CIMS technique is blind to the reaction
products and thus it is not possible to directly quantify the
branching ratio of reaction directly. However, an investigation
of the overall kinetics as a function of temperature provides
indirect evidence of the reaction pathways that are operating.
Over a suﬃcient temperature range, a transition from negative
to positive temperature dependence (or vice versa) will be
observed, and therefore deviations from Arrhenius type beha-
viour, resulting in curved Arrhenius plots similar to that of the
reaction of acetic acid with the OH radical.23 Such curvature
would not be observed if hyperconjugation were the sole
reason for increase in reactivity, as there is no change in
reaction mechanism. Over the temperature range studied,
within experimental error, there is no departure from linearity
apart from the reaction of OH and 1-decene, where abstrac-
tion accounts for 14% of the overall rate coeﬃcient at 300 K
based on theoretical calculations (see later). The inference
therefore is that abstraction is an important reaction pathway
for 1-decene, however, the importance of abstraction reactions
of the Co10 1-alkenes is uncertain over the temperature range
studied.
It is interesting to note from this data that rate coeﬃcients
increase rapidly up the homologous series from C511. Tem-
perature dependence is also enhanced over this range—a
phenomenon that can also be observed in the smaller terminal

alkenes10 and for other addition reactions such as the reaction
of OH + RCHO24—and in the case of the terminal alkenes,
appears to exhibit an exponential dependence upon carbon
number. This results in unusually large enhancements in
overall rate coeﬃcients with successive –CH2– groups, which
should not be attributed exclusively to the reactivity of the
secondary group(s), but also to their eﬀect on the temperature
dependence of the reaction. The quoted activation energies
assume Arrhenius type behaviour; however, if the abstraction
pathway also operates, the temperature dependence would be
described by a double exponential ﬁt and thus the single
Arrhenius expression is a poor representation of two compet-
ing channels. The largest reported activation energy is that for
1-decene, which is based on a ﬁt to the three highest tempera-
tures, i.e. only accounting for the addition pathway. The
retrieved activation energy is (3170  118) K, which is
similar to the range of activation energy measurements re-
ported for ethene, which range from 3200 to 4790 K24
where only the addition pathway operates.
Theoretical calculations
In order to assess the impact of the abstraction reaction
pathway theoretical studies were undertaken to investigate
the reactivity of OH towards C–H bonds in long chain
1-alkenes. To assess the reactivity towards C–H bond activation
of these n-alkenes, one must consider the four diﬀerent types of
H-atom: those on the –CH
Q
CH2 alkene group, those in the
allylic CH2 position adjacent to the double bond, those in
the other internal CH2 positions along the chain, and those
on the terminal –CH3 group. As a result of the strongQ
C–H
bond, the alkene C–H bonds are presumably nearly unreactive
towards H atom abstraction. For a –CH3 group bonded to an
alkyl group, the structure-activity relationship25 predicts a
contribution to the rate constant for reaction with OH at
298 K of 0.17  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1. Our previous
computational study26 gave a calculated rate constant for
abstraction from each methyl group of ethane and propane,
respectively, of 0.12 and 0.10  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1, in
reasonable agreement with the SAR. Compared to other chan-
nels available for reaction with the present 1-alkenes, this
contribution is negligible.
For the internal CH2 groups other than the allylic position,
the SAR25 predicts a contribution to the rate constant of ca.
1012 cm3 molecule1 s1. Again, our previous calculations26
reproduce this contribution quite accurately, with the contri-
bution to the overall rate constant for abstraction from the
CH2 position in propane calculated to be 0.96  1012 cm3
molecule1 s1. A similar rate constant can be expected for each
of the internal –CH2– groups in the n-alkenes considered here.
The allylic –CH2– group is expected to be more reactive due
to developing resonance between the forming radical centre
and the double bond in the transition state for C–H bond

abstraction. This eﬀect is not taken into account in the SAR
model.25 We have carried out calculations on the model OH +
1-butene reaction at the same KMLYP/6-311+G** level of
theory27,28 as used in our previous study.26 The transition state
for abstraction of the allylic H atom, shown in Fig. 5, lies
1.84 kJ mol1 below the energy of the reactants, as compared
with a TS lying 3.18 kJ mol1 above the reactants for the
secondary H atom in propane. In our previous work,26 high-
level calculations were used to show that the KMLYP method
tends to underestimate the barrier height for C–H abstraction,
by ca. 7 kJ mol1. Taking this correction into account, and
applying the same simple transition state theory as in the
previous work,26 leads to a predicted rate coeﬃcient for C–H
bond abstraction from the allylic position of 1.70  1012 cm3
molecule1 s1 at 298 K, that is, almost double that for the
internal position in propane. Calculations show a slight posi-
tive temperature dependence of this rate coeﬃcient, corre-
sponding to a positive enthalpy of activation of 1.3 kJ mol1.
Previous experimental work29 has noted that allylic stabiliza-
tion of the product radical can enhance reactivity for C–H
abstraction. Based on the limited available experimental data
and on calculated C–H bond energies, a rough structure–
activity relationship was proposed30 to estimate the rate of
abstraction from allylic positions. For secondary radicals, as
in the present case, this led to an estimate of the rate constant
of between 1.5 and 3.0  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1 at 298 K.
The present calculated value is at the lower end of this range.
Assuming additive rate coeﬃcients with a value of 1012 cm3
molecule1 s1 for each internal –CH2– group leads to
total predicted rate coeﬃcients for C–H bond abstraction for
1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-decene and 1-undecene of, respectively
2.7, 5.7, 7.7 and 8.7  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1 at 298 K.
Although the approximation of additive contributions from
the diﬀerent groups means that the predicted values are some-
what inaccurate, this suggests that abstraction plays a small
but non-negligible role in the overall reaction.
For the reaction of OH with 1-decene the Arrhenius para-
meters for the addition pathway were estimated from a linear
ﬁt of the Arrhenius plot for the experimentally determined rate
coeﬃcients studied at 268, 278 and 286 K, as shown in Fig. 4d.
Then the impact of the abstraction pathway on the overall rate
coeﬃcient can be evaluated using the estimated activation
energy calculated by the KMLYP/6-311+G** calculations.
The solid line is the predicted total rate coeﬃcient i.e.
(kabstraction þ kaddition). In Fig. 4d the inclusion of an abstrac-
tion pathway signiﬁcantly improves the ﬁt to the experimen-
tally determined rate coeﬃcients. A similar analysis has been
carried out for the temperature dependence of the rate coeﬃ-
cients of OH with all other 1-alkenes studied. It has been
calculated that, within the reported experimental error, there
would be little or no impact on the linearity of the Arrhenius
plot, which is in agreement with the experimental results.
Thus, our results would indicate that the abstraction pathway
does operate for the reaction of OH with 1-alkenes.
Comparison with structure activity relationships and further
discussion of these kinetic data
There are no absolute rate coeﬃcients published for the
reaction of OH with 1-alkenes larger than 1-heptene. There-
fore any comparisons that can be made must be with Struc-
ture–Activity Relationships (SARs). The most comprehensive
SAR is that of Kwok and Atkinson25 and will be used as the
bench mark for comparison. Table 3 summarises the rate
coeﬃcients obtained in this work at room temperature (ap-
proximately 298 K) compared with the predictions using the
method of Kwok and Atkinson25 and also compares rate
coeﬃcient data obtained by Atkinson and Aschmann21 for
the reaction of OH with 1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-heptene.
The work of Atkinson and Aschmann21 was a relative rate
study and used the reaction between OH and propene as
the reference compound, taking a rate coeﬃcient of 2.63 
1011 cm3 molecule1 s1 for this reference reaction. There
have been numerous studies of this reference reaction with a
wide range of rate coeﬃcients obtained (approx. 1.5–3.0 
1011 cm3 molecule1 s1). However, a very recent study by
Spangenberg et al.,31 using a pulsed laval nozzle returned a
rate coeﬃcient at 295 K of 2.39  1011 cm3 molecule1 s1
and, in conjunction with the relative rates obtained by Atkin-
son and Aschmann21 (also at 295 K), a revised set of rate
coeﬃcients for 1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-heptene are also
tabulated. First, the general agreement between the studies of
the reaction of OH with 1-pentene is good (noted previously).
The agreement is improved slightly by adopting the most
recent determination for the rate coeﬃcient for the reaction
of OH with propene, but this is a minor point. The rate
coeﬃcient predicted by the SAR for 1-pentene is slightly
higher than the experimental determinations. The rate coeﬃ-
cient obtained in this study for 1-octene is smaller than the
prediction by the SAR by about 8%. The rate coeﬃcients for
the reaction of OH with 1-hexene and 1-heptene measured
using the relative rate method21 are slightly larger than
our rate coeﬃcient for the reaction with 1-octene, which is
clearly out of place. However, the measured rate coeﬃcients
for 1-hexene and 1-heptene are also higher than the SAR
prediction, and upon using the more recent rate coeﬃcient for
propene (the reference reaction in both systems) these rate
coeﬃcients are smaller than the value obtained in this study
for 1-octene and more in line with the SAR prediction. The
rate coeﬃcient for the reaction of 1-nonene with OH is about
4% larger than the SAR prediction. However, there is a clear

departure from agreement between the SAR and this work for
1-decene and 1-undecene, where the rate coeﬃcients returned
are a factor of 1.7 and 2.9 larger than that predicted by the
SAR. We rule out the possibility of a reactive impurity in the
samples of 1-decene (3% maximum) and 1-undecene (3%
maximum) biasing these results: a simple back of the envelope
calculation shows that even if the 3% impurity reacted with a
gas-kinetic rate coeﬃcient of around 1  1010 cm3 molecule1
s1, the rate coeﬃcients would be reduced from 7.0 to 6.9 
1011 cm3 molecule1 s1, so for 1-decene the rate coeﬃcient
would actually increase slightly. Both of these compounds
have low vapour pressures and perhaps there is an error in the
method of measurement, however, the error in the vapour
pressure measurement (underestimation) and therefore our
whole methodology would have to be way beyond reasonable
experimental error limits and clearly these were not encoun-
tered with 1-octene and 1-nonene and there is no reason to
believe this is the case for 1-decene and 1-undecene. It is often
suggested that wall activity is enhanced, leading to increased
loss of OH when larger-than-expected rate coeﬃcients are
returned, however, the OH ‘wall’ loss rate is extremely small
with and without the presence of the reactant and there is
nothing to suggest heightened wall activity. The curved Ar-
rhenius plot for 1-decene is surely an indication that the
abstraction channel is becoming important in these higher
molecular weight systems and may in part be the reason for
the departure between measured and predicted rate coeﬃ-
cients. We are unable to quantify the branching ratios for
these systems with the current experimental set up but we note
the following points. First, the theoretical studies in this work
have highlighted that the allylic–CH2 group has a heightened
reactivity towards abstraction by OH which is not reﬂected in
the SAR.25 Second, a recent SAR32 developed for the addition
of OH to molecules with multiple double bonds assumes that
the rate of addition of OH to a 1-alkene (from propene
onwards) is independent of the substituent CH2R group,
largely in agreement with the methodology of Kwok and
Atkinson, and this assumption may break down for higher
1-alkenes. It would seem that the kinetics of these higher 1-
alkenes are not as straightforward as predicted.
Atmospheric implications
Direct addition to the double bond will lead to the formation
of a peroxy radical of the form CH2(OH)CH(O2)R and on
reaction with NO, NO3 or other peroxy radicals will yield an
alkoxy radical CH2(OH)CH(O)R, which is likely to decompose
to HCHO, HO2 and RCHO on reaction with O2. The products
so formed will enhance ozone formation in the presence of
NOx, since RCHO and HCHO are reactive species that also
have an appreciable photolytic decomposition rate, leading to
further peroxy radical formation. Abstraction of a H-atom
from the alkyl side chain will lead to a peroxy radical of the
form CH2
Q
CHCH(O2)R0 (A) or CH2
Q
CHCH2R00CH(O2)R000
(B). Formation of an alkoxy radical and its subsequent
reaction with O2 will lead to formation of a vinyl ketone
from
(A)
CH2
Q
CHC(O)R0
and
a
ketone
from
(B)
CH2
Q
CHCH2R00C(O)R000. Photolysis rates for these ketones
will be slower than the aldehydes formed from addition of OH.
Also, addition of OH to the double bond of these ketonic
species will be slower than addition to the analogous 1-alkene.
Therefore, abstraction will tend to form products that have a
lower photochemical ozone formation potential, and if there is
a signiﬁcant branching ratio for a particular 1-alkene this will
be an important consideration in mechanism development.
Conclusions and future work
Our data indicates that the reaction of OH with 1-alkenes has
a signiﬁcant negative temperature dependence. The results
represent the ﬁrst evaluation of the kinetics of the reaction
of OH with 1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-nonene and 1-decene. Over
the temperature range studied, the rate coeﬃcient for reaction
was found to be invariant with pressure, suggesting that the
rate coeﬃcient is at the high pressure limit. For the reaction of
OH with 1-decene, the Arrhenius plot was non-linear, indicat-
ing that the abstraction pathway makes an appreciable con-
tribution towards the overall rate of reaction. KMLYP/
6-311+G** theoretical studies were performed to assess the
reactivity of the C–H bond and its impact on overall rate
coeﬃcient. It was found that the abstraction pathway will
operate. However, more studies are needed to directly quantify
the addition and abstraction pathways utilising experimental
techniques that can measure directly the OH–alkene adduct
produced via addition or the alkyl radical produce via abstrac-
tion, such as Ultra-Violet photoelectron spectroscopy.33
Using known tropospheric degradation chemistry, our
model suggests that abstraction will lead to products with a
smaller Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP) and
therefore if the abstraction pathway is of the same order of
magnitude as observed for 1-decene (i.e. 14%) for other
atmospherically
relevant
alkenes,
this
factor

lead to aldehyde formation which not only have high POCP
indices, but will also be precursors to PAN type formation.
