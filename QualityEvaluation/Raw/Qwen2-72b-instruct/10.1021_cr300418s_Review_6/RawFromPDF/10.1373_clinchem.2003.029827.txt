Organic Chemistry Principles and
Industrial Practice. Mark M. Green
and Harold A. Wittcoff. Weinheim:
Wiley-VCH GmbH & Co. KGaA,
2003, 342 pp., $39.00, softcover. ISBN
3-527-30289-1.
This book tells the story behind the
development of some industrial pro-
cesses based on a variety of organic
chemical reactions. For those inter-
ested in such procedures, particu-
larly in those procedures that are
broadly referred to as “polymer pro-
duction”, it is a fascinating presenta-
tion that is easy to read and keeps the
reader alert by providing the histor-
ical details that put the industrial
procedures
into
perspective.
Al-
though its interest for laboratory
medicine is marginal, those with an
interest in practical organic chemis-
try and the synthesis of many prac-
tical products will appreciate this
book.

Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medi-
cine (McGraw-Hill, New York, 2001)
has been a standard textbook in in-
ternal medicine for more than four
decades. The current edition is a
hefty 8.5-pound book with authorita-
tive descriptions on the diagnosis
and management of diseases and is
an excellent reference for anyone in
laboratory medicine. Harrison’s Man-
ual of Medicine, at 1.25 pounds, con-
denses Principles into a more con-
venient form. This book and the
Washington Manual of Medical Thera-
peutics
(Lippincott,
Philadelphia,
2001) are both used by interns to help
them through daily activities. Harri-
son’s focuses on diseases, whereas
the Washington Manual focuses on
patient management.
Carrying both books in a white
coat can be problematic. Fortunately,
both are available in a form loadable
into a personal data assistant (PDA).
My Windows 2000 desktop loaded
Harrison’s Manual to a vintage Palm
IIIx in 10 min without problems.
Pocket PCs are supported, but down-
loading from a Macintosh is not. The
1000-page Manual consumed a com-
pact 1.3 MB, easily within the 4 MB
limit of my Palm. The PDA applica-
tion ran well, and the content index-
ing software accessed topics easily
after a brief learning curve. The texts
in the PDA software and book are
identical, but tables, charts, and illus-
trations are missing from the PDA
version. The PDA user must refer-
ence the print version of the book or
one of two online services, priced at a
hefty $125.00 or $249.00 annually.
Installation also requires Internet ac-
tivation, possibly problematic on net-
works with proxy servers and fire-
walls.
From the content perspective, Har-
rison’s Manual fills a useful niche
even without Harrison’s Principles as
a companion. The ability to look up
treatment and diagnosis protocols
for common medical problems in a
compact book has tremendous utility
in teaching and consultation for lab-
oratory medicine. The book is di-
vided into 17 sections and 201 chap-
ters. Section 1 covers important signs
and
symptoms,
section
2
covers
medical emergencies, section 16 cov-
ers adverse drug reactions, and sec-
tion 17 has 12 pages devoted to lab-
oratory tests. The remaining sections
cover the diagnosis and management
of diseases. Within each chapter,
there are paragraphs covering etiol-
ogy, clinical findings, treatment, and
management. Each chapter also con-
veniently includes one or two defin-
itive references. Both the content and
organization are excellent.
In the end, I prefer Harrison’s Man-
ual in the print format. The omission
of the charts and tables from the
PDA version leads to a loss of clarity.
I also find that reading and navigat-
ing material in a PDA is more diffi-
cult than reading a book. Comparing
books and PDA software provides
interesting insights into the future of
publishing; high-speed networks, in-
creased PDA capabilities, and de-
creasing costs will likely introduce
changes in the publishing industry
paralleling those already seen in the
music-recording industry. Services
