Efﬁcient hybrid density functional calculations in solids: Assessment
of the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof screened Coulomb hybrid functional

~Received 22 March 2004; accepted 19 April 2004!
The present work introduces an efﬁcient screening technique to take advantage of the fast spatial
decay of the short range Hartree–Fock ~HF! exchange used in the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof ~HSE!
screened Coulomb hybrid density functional. The screened HF exchange decay properties and
screening efﬁciency are compared with traditional hybrid functional calculations on solids. The HSE
functional is then assessed using 21 metallic, semiconducting, and insulating solids. The examined
properties include lattice constants, bulk moduli, and band gaps. The results obtained with HSE
exhibit signiﬁcantly smaller errors than pure density functional theory ~DFT! calculations. For
structural properties, the errors produced by HSE are up to 50% smaller than the errors of the local
density approximation, PBE, and TPSS functionals used for comparison. When predicting band
gaps of semiconductors, we found smaller errors with HSE, resulting in a mean absolute error of 0.2
eV ~1.3 eV error for all pure DFT functionals!. In addition, we present timing results which show
the computational time requirements of HSE to be only a factor of 2–4 higher than pure DFT
functionals. These results make HSE an attractive choice for calculations of all types of solids.

I. INTRODUCTION
Kohn–Sham density functional theory ~DFT! has proven
to be a highly competitive method for a wide range of appli-
cations in solid state physics and more recently in chemistry.
While the local density approximation ~LDA!1 has been used
in solid state physics for quite some time, the advent of func-
tionals based on the generalized gradient approximation
~GGA!,2 has also made DFT a valuable tool in chemistry.
Hybrid density functionals,3 which include a certain amount
of Hartree–Fock ~HF! exchange, further improve upon the
GGA results. For molecules, recently developed meta-GGA
functionals4 have been shown to yield accuracy comparable
to hybrid functionals.5 In addition, meta-GGAs yield notice-
able improvements in solids.6 However, a comparison with
hybrid functionals in solids is difﬁcult due to the high com-
putational demands of traditional hybrids.
Methods scaling linearly with system size7 are available
for pure DFT calculations, allowing simulations of large
molecules and solids. However, the HF exchange in hybrid
DFT methods is much less tractable in large systems.
Schemes for linear scaling HF calculations depend on the
decay of the HF exchange interactions over distance. This
decay is highly system dependent and can range from a few
to thousands of angstroms.8,9 Recently, we presented the
Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof screened Coulomb potential hy-
brid functional9 ~HSE! which offers an efﬁcient alternative to
traditional hybrids. Results for various molecular properties
are comparable to traditional hybrid functionals.10 The
present work extends our assessment to three-dimensional
solids.
To render the HF exchange tractable in extended sys-
tems, either the exchange interactions need to be truncated
artiﬁcially or their spatial decay accelerated. Truncation
schemes are very useful for systems with localized charge
distributions where the HF exchange decays rapidly over dis-
tance. In delocalized systems, however, truncation leads to
severe convergence problems in the self-consistent ﬁeld
~SCF! procedure as well as uncertainties in the predicted
energy of the system. The second option, accelerating the
spatial decay, circumvents both these problems but still ne-
glects interactions which might be physically important. The
HSE functional takes this second approach but compensate
for the neglected interactions.
The decay of the HF exchange interaction is accelerated
by substituting the full 1/r Coulomb potential with a
screened potential. Such screened Coulomb potentials are
widely used in solid state physics11 and more recently also in
quantum chemistry.12–16 A screened Coulomb potential is
based on a splitting of the Coulomb operator into short range
~SR! and long range ~LR! components. The HSE functional
uses the error function to accomplish this split since it leads
to computational advantages in evaluating the short range
HF exchange integrals.9 The following partitioning is used:

long range term becomes zero and the short range term is
equivalent to the full Coulomb operator. The opposite is the
case for v→`.

dently by Ernzerhof17 and Adamo.18 However, the exchange
energy term is split into SR and LR components and the HF

The following sections ﬁrst outline the screening tech-
niques used to exploit the fast decay of the SR exchange
interactions. The HSE functional is then assessed on a set of
21 metallic, semiconducting and insulating solids. We
present results for lattice constants, bulk moduli and band
gaps, comparing them to the established LDA, PBE,19 and
TPSS4 functionals. Finally, we show comparative timings for
single point calculations of these systems.
II. SCREENING THE SHORT RANGE HF EXCHANGE
INTEGRALS
In order to take advantage of the rapid decay of short
range exchange integrals, prescreening of integral batches is
necessary. Both screening methods described later are based
on existing bounds and estimates for the contribution of a
given batch of integrals to the Fock matrix. The effect of
small density matrix elements is also included by multiply-
ing the estimated integral with the largest density matrix el-
ement which is contracted with the integral to form an ele-
ment of the Fock matrix. The present work utilizes two
different screening techniques. Compared to traditional hy-
brid functionals, the combination of SR HF exchange and
efﬁcient screening can reduce both computational time and
memory requirement drastically.
A. Schwarz screening
Schwarz screening is an integral part of almost any di-
rect SCF calculation20 and can easily be modiﬁed to account
for the SR exchange integrals. Substituting the SR integrals
in place of the 1/r integrals yields an upper bound of the
form
u~mnuls!SRu<A~mnumn!SR•A~lsuls!SR.
~3!
The (ijuij) integrals are then evaluated for each batch of
integrals and only batches with non-negligible contributions
are used in calculating the HF exchange. The SR screening
integrals are evaluated by the same procedure as the SR ex-
change integrals.9
B. Distance-based multipole screening
Modern quantum chemistry codes employ fast multipole
methods ~FMMs!21–24 to efﬁciently evaluate Coulomb inter-
actions in large molecules and solids. While FMMs cannot
be used to evaluate the exchange interaction in an economi-
cal manner, multipole moments still provide valuable infor-
mation about the magnitude of exchange integrals. Multipole
moments can be exploited for a distance-based screening
scheme of the exchange interactions. The following screen-
ing criterion is implemented in the Gaussian suite of
programs25,26

where Tn is an estimate for the contribution of a shell quartet
and M is a multipole in the multipole expansion of a given
shell pair. M ij

contribute to the integral and Cij

cients in each order of multipoles. Replacing the 1/r poten-
tial with the erfc(vr)/r short range potential yields

This provides a distance-based upper bound for the SR ex-
change contribution of a given shell quartet.
C. Screening efﬁciency
The implementation of periodic boundary conditions
~PBC!, used in this work, relies on evaluating all terms of the
Hamiltonian in real space.27 The HF exchange is evaluated
using replicated density matrices. All interactions within a
certain radius from a central reference cell are calculated and
the rest are neglected.28 This approach works reasonably well
for insulating solids since the corresponding density matrix
elements decay rapidly. In systems with smaller band gaps,
however, the spatial extent of non-negligible contributions to
the exchange energy is large. This large extent results in a
large number of signiﬁcant interactions. To render the com-
putation tractable, the truncation radius must be decreased.
Thus, signiﬁcant interactions are neglected which leads to
errors in the total energy of the system and introduces insta-
bilities into the self-consistent ﬁeld procedure.
Screened Coulomb hybrid functionals do not need to
rely on the decay of the density matrix to allow calculations
in extended systems. The SR HF exchange interactions de-
cay rapidly and without noticeable dependence on the band
gap of the system. The screening techniques described ear-
lier, do not rely on any truncation radius and provide much
better control over the accuracy of a given calculation. In
addition, the thresholds can be set very tightly, without re-
sulting in extremely long calculations.

screening techniques outlined earlier. Figure 1 shows the
CPU time scaling behavior for hybrid DFT calculations us-
ing both PBE0 and HSE for three-dimensional silicon ~dia-
mond structure!. The use of a 6-21G basis set reduced both
the computational cost and the convergence problems of the
PBE0 calculations. The time per SCF cycle is given as a
function of the distance up to which exchange interactions
were included in the calculation. As this radius grows, the

number of replicated cells grows as O(N3). The PBE0 curve
tracks this growth since regular HF exchange has a large
spatial extent. The relatively small band gap of silicon ~1.9
eV in this calculation! is insufﬁcient for density matrix ele-
ments to decay noticeably. HSE, on the other hand, only
shows a modest increase in CPU time as the system becomes
larger. Beyond 10 Å, the CPU time only increases due to the
time spent on screening.
Figure 2 shows the convergence of the total energy in the
same silicon crystal. The HSE calculation converges very
rapidly and only cells up to 10 Å from the reference cell
contribute to the exchange energy. PBE0, by comparison,
converges signiﬁcantly slower. Thus, HSE not only reduces
the CPU time drastically, but also decreases the memory re-
quirements of a given calculation since less replicated den-
sity matrices need to be stored in memory. In practice, HSE
calculations can be performed with the same amount of
memory as pure DFT calculations, whereas traditional hybrid
methods have larger memory demands.
Given the fast decay of the SR HF exchange interactions
and the high screening efﬁciency, we can now efﬁciently
apply HSE to a variety of three-dimensional solids. The next
section outlines these calculations in more detail.
III. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
We have previously implemented the HSE functional
into the GAUSSIAN suite of programs.25 All calculations em-
ployed the PBC code27 available in Gaussian. Three-
dimensional, self-consistent, spin-restricted Kohn–Sham cal-
culations were performed on all systems. The short range HF
exchange interactions were calculated in real space using an
adaptation of the NFX method28 for periodic systems. Gauss-
ian basis sets were used throughout this work. We employed
a standard molecular basis whenever possible. For some sol-
ids, however, other optimized basis sets from the literature
were used. Table I lists the detailed basis sets used for each
system.

All calculations converged the SCF procedure to an ac-
curacy of 1028. Only SR exchange integrals smaller than
10212 were neglected. The reciprocal space integration was
performed using 24 k points in each dimension for a total of
6912 k points. In practice, these thresholds can be relaxed
after a preliminary study of a given system. The goal of the
present work, however, is to establish the accuracy of the
various DFT methods examined. Therefore, we only show
fully converged results.
Lattice constants and bulk moduli were determined us-
ing the Murnaghan equation of state29 ~EOS!. The experi-
mental equilibrium lattice constant was perturbed in steps of
0.05 Å and a total of nine calculations was performed. To
obtain the band gaps, single point calculations were per-
formed at the optimized lattice constants ~for each method!.
Unless otherwise noted, experimental results were taken
from Ref. 6.
All calculations were carried out on dual processor AMD
AthlonXP21001 systems with 2 GB of memory. The silicon
calculations demonstrating screening efﬁciency and conver-
gence used one CPU, all other calculations were run in par-
allel on two CPUs. Wall-clock times are used throughout.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We examined the predicted lattice constants and bulk
moduli of 21 metals, semiconductors, and insulators using
HSE and compared the results to the established LDA, PBE,
and TPSS density functional results. In addition, we per-
formed single point calculations for eight semiconducting
systems ~at the previously found lattice constants! to assess
the prediction of band gaps.
A comparison with traditional hybrid functionals would
be computationally very demanding due to the large basis
sets and tight convergence criteria used in this work. The
metallic systems in our test set also present a fundamental
obstacle for unscreened exact exchange calculations since
metals suffer from a logarithmic divergence in the HF ex-
change term.30
The 21 benchmark systems were chosen to represent a
wide variety of solids. However, we restricted the present
assessment to systems with a single lattice constant. This
restriction simpliﬁes the determination of lattice constants
and bulk moduli considerably. In general, the present assess-
ment closely follows the pure DFT functional work of
Staroverov et al.6
A. Lattice constants
In all the examined solids, the crystal structure is deter-
mined by a single lattice constant. Table II shows the optimal
lattice constants found using the Murnaghan EOS. The accu-
racy of the predicted values correlates directly with the level
of approximation in the functional. HSE gives the most ac-
curate results, followed by the TPSS meta-GGA functional,
the PBE GGA functional and ﬁnally LDA. The mean abso-
lute errors ~MAE! over the whole test set are 0.028, 0.035,
0.049, and 0.067 Å, respectively.
Metallic systems are usually described well by a pure
density functional approach. Semiconductors and insulators,
however, seem to beneﬁt greatly from a portion of exact
exchange which is introduced by hybrid functionals. When
the results for metallic systems are excluded from the statis-
tics, the MAE of HSE for lattice constants drops to 0.017 Å,
whereas the errors for pure density functionals remain virtu-
ally the same.
B. Bulk moduli
The predictions of bulk moduli are somewhat more sen-
sitive to the functional employed. LDA tends to overestimate
bulk moduli due to the overbinding of individual bonds, re-
sulting in a mean error ~ME! of 11.8 GPa. The GGA and
meta-GGA functionals reverse this trend, now underestimat-
ing the bulk moduli ~ME of 29.2 and 24.1 GPa, respec-
tively!. The HSE hybrid functional exhibits a signiﬁcantly
smaller ME of 1.4 GPa ~Table III!. The MAEs also reﬂect
this: 12.6 GPa ~LDA!, 10.1 GPa ~PBE!, 9.9 GPa ~TPSS!, and
4.4 GPa ~HSE!.
When only the semiconducting and insulating systems
are examined, certain parallels to the case of the lattice con-
stants appear. Again, the PBE and TPSS errors remain simi-
lar to the errors of the full set of solids. However, the LDA
error decreases signiﬁcantly to 8.1 GPa. Most likely, this
improvement is due to a cancellation of errors. As with the
lattice constants, the MAE of HSE drops noticeably to 3.6
GPa.

C. Band gaps
The calculation of band gaps in solids has always been
the Achilles heel of pure density functional methods.31 Re-
cently, hybrid density functional studies of band gaps32,33
have demonstrated that including some HF exchange im-
proves results dramatically. Here, we chose a subset of eight
semiconducting systems to assess the performance of the
HSE functional and compare it with pure DFT functionals.
For the gallium compounds, it was necessary to use a
larger basis set for band gap calculations than for the struc-
tural properties. While the 6-31G* basis set proved sufﬁcient
for P, modiﬁed versions of 6-311G* were used for Ga and N
~see Table I!. A similar treatment is necessary for GaAs. In
the present study, however, we excluded GaAs from the band
gap calculations since the computational cost of optimizing
the basis set becomes rather large.
The results shown in Table IV speak volumes. All pure
DFT functionals severely underestimate the band gaps, re-
sulting in MAEs of around 1.3 eV, while HSE produces ex-
cellent agreement with experiment ~0.23 eV MAE!.
D. Timings
In Sec. II C, we already showed the substantial savings
in computational time of HSE over traditional hybrid func-
tionals. Here, we present additional timings for the eight
semiconducting solids. We compare the wall-clock timings
for single point calculations using the LDA, PBE, TPSS, and
HSE functionals.
While the LDA and PBE calculations on average took 8
and 9 h, respectively, the meta-GGA TPSS functional was
twice as expensive ~18 h! per single point. The HSE screened
Coulomb hybrid functional was only twice as computation-
ally expensive as TPSS. Detailed timings can be found in
Table V. In practice, once the necessary convergence criteria
for a given system are established, the tight thresholds, used
here, can be relaxed. Increasing the thresholds can results in
up to a 50% speedup of a given calculation, while still
achieving mHartree accuracy.
In light of the superior results exhibited by HSE in the
previous sections, the additional CPU time is easily justiﬁed.
Traditional hybrid functionals such as PBE0 or B3LYP34 are
difﬁcult to converge for these systems and calculations with
similarly tight convergence criteria cannot be achieved on
commonly available computer hardware.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The in-depth assessment of the screened Coulomb hy-
brid functional HSE for predicting properties of solids, pre-
sented here, is extremely encouraging. HSE signiﬁcantly im-

Hybrid density functional

proves upon GGA and meta-GGA results for structural
parameters such as lattice constants and bulk moduli. For
nonmetallic systems, the error is generally reduced by 50%
or more. In metals, HSE still improves upon pure DFT re-
sults, but the effect is less dramatic. Band gap calculations of
semiconductors, using HSE, produce errors over ﬁve times
smaller than pure DFT results. Due to the nature of the
screened Coulomb interaction approach of HSE, the compu-
tational time needed for these calculations is within a factor
of 2–4 of pure DFT calculations. Traditional hybrid calcula-
tions need signiﬁcantly more memory and CPU time. In ad-
dition, the established hybrids exhibit problems with the con-
vergence of the SCF procedure when higher quality basis
sets are used.
The fact that HSE can be applied to metals is extremely
useful for applications in molecular electronics and related
ﬁelds. HSE enables the treatment of molecules attached to
conducting surfaces on a hybrid DFT level. Due to the prop-
erties of full HF exchange, traditional hybrid functionals can-
not be used for such systems.
Combined with our earlier assessment of HSE for
molecules,10 the present results allow a promising applica-
tion of the HSE screened Coulomb hybrid functional to both
large molecules and solids. The CPU time penalty over pure
DFT functionals is more than offset by the superior results
provided by this hybrid functional.
