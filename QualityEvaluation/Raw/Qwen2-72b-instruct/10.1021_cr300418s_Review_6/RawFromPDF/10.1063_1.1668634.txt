This paper presents a revised and improved version of the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof screened
Coulomb hybrid functional. The performance of this functional is assessed on a variety of molecules
for the prediction of enthalpies of formation, geometries, and vibrational frequencies, yielding
results as good as or better than the successful PBE0 hybrid functional. Results for ionization
potentials and electron afﬁnities are of slightly lower quality but are still acceptable. The
comprehensive test results presented here validate our assumption that the screened, short-range
Hartree–Fock ~HF! exchange exhibits all physically relevant properties of the full HF exchange.
Thus, hybrids can be constructed which neglect the computationally demanding long-range part of
HF exchange while still retaining the superior accuracy of hybrid functionals, compared to pure
density functionals.

I. INTRODUCTION
Kohn–Sham density functional theory ~DFT! has proven
to be a highly competitive method for a wide range of appli-
cations in solid state physics and more recently in chemistry.
While the local density approximation ~LDA!1 has been used
in solid state physics for quite some time, the advent of func-
tionals based on the generalized gradient approximation
~GGA!2 has made DFT a valuable tool in chemistry. Hybrid
density functionals,3 which include a certain amount of
Hartree–Fock ~HF! exchange, further improve upon the
GGA results. For molecules, recently developed meta-GGA
functionals4 have been shown to yield accuracy comparable
to hybrid functionals.5 In addition, meta-GGAs yield signiﬁ-
cant improvements in solids.6 However, a comparison with
hybrid functionals in solids is difﬁcult due to the high com-
putational demands of traditional hybrids.
Methods scaling linearly with system size7 are available
for pure DFT calculation, allowing simulations of large mol-
ecules and solids. However, the HF exchange in hybrid DFT
methods is much less tractable in large systems. Schemes for
linear scaling HF calculations depend on the natural decay of
the HF exchange interactions over distance. This decay is
highly system dependent and can range from a few A
˚ ng-
strom to thousands of A
˚ ngstrom.8,9 A general hybrid DFT
method which can be used over a wide range of system sizes
is highly desirable. We present a possible approach to such a
method in this paper.
To render the HF exchange tractable in extended sys-
tems, either the exchange interactions need to be truncated
artiﬁcially or their spatial decay accelerated. Truncation
schemes are very useful for systems with localized charge
distributions where the HF exchange decays rapidly over dis-
tance. In delocalized systems, however, truncation leads to
severe convergence problems in the self-consistent-ﬁeld
~SCF! procedure as well as uncertainties in the predicted
energy of the system. The second option, accelerating the
spatial decay, circumvents both these problems but still ne-
glects interactions which might be physically important. The
present work takes this second approach but attempts to
compensate for the neglected interactions.
The decay of the HF exchange interaction can be accel-
erated by substituting the full 1/r Coulomb potential with a
screened potential. Such screened Coulomb potentials are
widely used in solid state physics10 and more recently also in
quantum chemistry.11–15 A screened Coulomb potential is
based on a splitting of the Coulomb operator into short-range
~SR! and long-range ~LR! components. The choice of split-
ting function is arbitrary as long as SR and LR components
add up to the original Coulomb operator. The present work
uses the error function to accomplish this split since it leads
to computational advantages in evaluating the short-range
HF exchange integrals.9 The following partitioning is used:
~1!
where
the
complementary

function

2erf(vr) and v is an adjustable parameter. For v50, the
long-range term becomes zero and the short-range term is
equivalent to the full Coulomb operator. The opposite is the
case for v→`.
This work extends our earlier approach9 which used the
above splitting to design a screened Coulomb potential hy-
brid functional. The main improvement over the vPBEh
functional proposed in Ref. 9 is the satisfaction of two addi-
tional theoretical limits that the exact density functional is
known to satisfy. The accuracy of the improved functional is
assessed on a wide variety of molecules. The examined prop-
erties include enthalpies of formation, equilibrium geom-
etries, vibrational frequencies, ionization potentials, electron
afﬁnities, and charge transfers in transition metal complexes.
While the ultimate goal of this project is a widely appli-
cable method for large systems, extensive testing using

smaller systems is necessary to validate the approach taken.
In the following sections, we ﬁrst discuss two modiﬁcations
to our previous hybrid functional and then examine the per-
formance of the proposed method.
II. THE REVISED SCREENED COULOMB POTENTIAL
HYBRID FUNCTIONAL
Our earlier work9 proposed a screened Coulomb hybrid
functional ~vPBEh! based on the PBE GGA functional16 and
the corresponding, parameter-free PBE0 hybrid functional.17
The screened Coulomb hybrid is designed to balance the loss
of HF exchange energy due to the screened potential with a
DFT long-range contribution. For the present, revised
screened Coulomb hybrid functional, we resort to the stan-
dard acronym of Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof ~HSE03!. The
exchange-correlation term of HSE03 takes a form identical
to vPBEh,
Exc

HF,SR~v!1~12a!Ex

PBE,
~2!
where v is an adjustable parameter governing the extent of
short-range interactions and the exchange mixing parameter
a51/4 is determined by perturbation theory.18 The HSE03
hybrid functional is equivalent to PBE0 for v50 and as-
ymptotically reaches PBE for v→`.
Whereas the SR HF exchange is evaluated as before, the
short- and long-range vPBE DFT exchange terms are modi-
ﬁed to satisfy two additional constraints. The following sec-
tions ﬁrst describe the form of the revised vPBE exchange
functional and then discuss the additional constraints which
were enforced.
A. The revised vPBE screened Coulomb potential
exchange functional
The starting point for our screened Coulomb exchange
functional is the exchange hole formulation of the PBE func-
tional by Ernzerhof et al. ~see Ref. 19 for a detailed descrip-
tion!. The PBE exchange energy is deﬁned as an integral
over the exchange energy density
Ex
PBE5E dr r~r!ex
PBE~r~r!,s~r!!.
~3!
The energy density ex
PBE depends on the electron density
r(r) and the reduced gradient s5u¹ru/(2kFr) with kF
5(3p2r)1/3. ex
PBE is deﬁned as a product of the LDA ex-
change energy density and an enhancement factor Fx
PBE
which depends on the gradient of the electron density,
ex
PBE~r~r!,s~r!!5ex
LDA~r~r!!3Fx
PBE~s~r!!.
~4!
Whereas the original, energy-based, PBE functional uses an
explicitly deﬁned enhancement factor, the exchange-hole
based formulation deﬁnes Fx
PBE as an integral over the PBE
exchange hole JPBE(s,y),

A detailed description of the PBE exchange hole and its deri-
vation is given in Ref. 19.
The short-range PBE exchange energy is deﬁned the
same way, except that the exchange hole itself is screened by
employing the short-range Coulomb potential deﬁned in ~1!,

This formulation introduces an electron density dependence
into both the exchange hole and the enhancement factor. The
SR exchange hole has the form

~7!
where A2H are parameters and parametrized functions of
the PBE exchange hole. These parameters are not empirical
but derived from the functional form of the original,
exchange-energy-based PBE functional.
The vPBE long-range exchange contribution is then de-
ﬁned as the difference of the exchange-hole based PBE and
the SR vPBE exchange energy densities,
Ex
vPBE,LR5E dr r~r!@ex
PBE~r~r!,s~r!!
2ex
vPBE,SR~r~r!,s~r!!#.
~8!
Up to this point, the present functional is identical to the
previous vPBE functional. The improvements originate in
the way the SR vPBE exchange hole, which yields
Fx
rev-vPBE, is integrated @Eq. ~5!#. The integral over the short-
range exchange hole cannot be solved analytically due to the
terms in ~7! which contain y in the denominator. Previously,
the problematic terms were approximated by a linear combi-
nation of Gaussian functions. The present functional, how-
ever, uses a different approach to evaluate Eq. ~5!. Instead of
approximating a part of the exchange hole, the error function
is approximated as detailed in Sec. II B. This approach has
distinct advantages. The enhancement factor Fx
rev-vPBE is now
identical to one for v5s50 which recovers the LDA limit
of the uniform electron gas. Furthermore, the new approach
yields derivatives which are numerically more stable, allow-
ing the implementation of analytical ﬁrst and second
~planned! derivatives. In addition, the new functional also
satisﬁes the Lieb–Oxford bound ~Sec. II C! which the origi-
nal PBE satisﬁes, but which is violated in both the exchange-
hole based PBE and the previous vPBE.
These improvements lead to the revised HSE03 hybrid
functional whose behavior is even closer to the PBE0 hybrid
than our previous implementation was. The following two
sections outline the changes made to the vPBE enhancement
factor in more detail.

B. Approximating the error function
The complementary error function is deﬁned as
erfc~x!5
2
ApE
x
`
e2t2 dt.
~9!
This integral does not have a closed-form solution. There-
fore, erfc(x) is usually approximated numerically by a func-
tion of the form
erfc~x!'Pn~t!e2x2,
~10!
where t51/(11px). The coefﬁcients of Pn(t) as well as p
are ﬁtted to the true complementary error function.20 Various
ﬁts use polynomials of orders ranging from four to six. For
highly accurate approximations, several such ﬁts over sub-
intervals are often used. In the present case, the rational form
of t again precludes the analytical evaluation of Eq. ~5!. We
use a slightly simpliﬁed version of ~10! instead:
erfc~x!'P8~x!e2bx2.
~11!
A higher ~eighth! order polynomial gives more accurate re-
sults in this case since the functional form of ~11! is inferior
to ~10!. This approximation is accurate to 1026 in the inter-
val 0<x<14 and the resulting exchange hole can be inte-
grated analytically. The ﬁnal form of the chosen approxima-
tion is
erfc~x!'~11a1x1a2x21a3x31a4x41a5x51a6x6
1a7x71a8x8!e2bx2,
~12!
where the following parameters were ﬁtted via the least-
squares method:
a1521.128 223 947,
a251.452 736 266,
a3521.243 162 299,
a450.971 824 836,
a5520.568 861 080,
a650.246 880 515,
a7520.065 032 364,
a850.008 401 793,
b51.455 915 450.
For x.14, ~5! exhibits numerical instabilities when
evaluated using the approximation ~12!. However, in this
range the Gaussian term becomes dominant and a much sim-
pler approximation can be used:
erfc~x.14!'e22x2.
~13!
Additional numerical approximations are necessary to
ensure numerical stability over all possible values of the
electron density and its gradient. All these approximations
are accurate to better than 10210 and are not discussed in
detail here. They can, however, be found in our reference
implementation of the revised vPBE enhancement factor.21
In general, all numerical approximations employed in
the revised vPBE functional achieve an accuracy much
higher than the underlying exchange-hole based implemen-
tation of PBE. The PBE exchange hole was ﬁtted to the
original PBE functional by Ernzerhof et al.19 and produces
errors in the order of 0.5% in the enhancement factor, com-
pared to PBE.
C. The Lieb–Oxford bound
Lieb and Oxford22 derived a theoretical bound for the
maximum value of the exchange–correlation energy Exc .
The PBE exchange functional enforces the Lieb–Oxford
~LO! bound
Ex>21.679E dr r~r!4/3
~14!
by ensuring that the enhancement factor Fx satisﬁes
Fx~s!<1.804.
~15!
The exchange-hole based formulation of PBE violates this
bound and therefore so does the previous vPBE functional.
The LO bound is not satisﬁed for reduced gradients s
.8.57. This is beyond the range of s in regions of the elec-
tron density relevant to molecules. However, the LO bound
can easily be enforced by smoothly rescaling s beyond a
threshold sthresh.8.3. The rescaling is performed by
snew5smax2
c
s2 ,
~16!
where smax58.572 844 and c518.796 223. These values en-
sure the same maximum enhancement factor Fx(s) as the
original PBE functional.
In practice, enforcing the Lieb–Oxford bound in the rev-
vPBE functional only changes the exchange energies by less
than a mHartree for all examined systems.
III. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
We incorporated the HSE03 functional into the Gaussian
suite of programs.23 Unless noted otherwise, the revised
HSE03 functional was used in all calculations. A reference
implementation of the revised vPBE enhancement factor is
available electronically.21
The 6-31111G(3df,3pd) basis set was used in self-
consistent, spin unrestricted Kohn–Sham calculations of en-
thalpies of formation, geometry optimizations, vibrational
frequencies, and ionization potentials, as well as electron af-
ﬁnities. This basis, when used in hybrid DFT calculations,
provides a model chemistry which gives results close to the
basis set limit. In addition, geometry optimizations and vi-
brational frequency calculations were also carried out using
the 6-31G* basis set which is commonly used for these
types of calculations.
The enthalpies of formation were calculated both using
geometries optimized at the MP2/6-31G* level and then us-
ing geometries optimized with each functional and the
6-31111G(3df,3pd) basis set. Standard enthalpies of for-
mation were obtained by the procedure described in Ref. 24.
For both the zero point energy and the thermal enthalpy cor-
rections, HF/6-31G* frequencies scaled with a factor of f
50.8929 were used.
Geometry optimizations employed analytical gradients
while harmonic vibrational frequencies were calculated via
numerical differentiation of analytic ﬁrst derivatives ~for
HSE03 only, all other functionals used analytic second
derivatives!.

The transition metal hexacarbonyl geometry optimiza-
tions used a Stuttgart 97 small core relativistic effective core
potential ~ECP! on the metal and 6-311G(d) basis sets on
carbon and oxygen. The partial charges were determined by
natural bond orbital ~NBO! analysis25 using the same ECP on
the metal and the 6-311G(2df ) basis set on carbon and
oxygen.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The HSE03 functional was assessed on a wide range of
systems and its performance is compared to the established
B3LYP,3 PBE,16 and PBE017 functionals. The following sec-
tions show the results for enthalpies of formation, geometry
optimizations, vibrational frequencies, ionization potentials,
electron afﬁnities, and charge transfers in a variety of mol-
ecules.
A. Standard enthalpies of formation
The G3/99 set of 223 small molecules24,26 was used to
assess the performance for predicting standard enthalpies of
formation. Results for two subsets of the G3 set, the G2-1
~55 molecules! and G2-11G2-2 ~148 molecules, denoted
G2! sets, are presented as well since a large amount of data
for these test sets exists in the literature.
The HSE03 and PBE0 functionals exhibit similar perfor-
mance with HSE03 producing slightly better results. The
mean absolute errors ~MAE! of HSE03 are 2.89, 4.64, and
6.57 kcal/mol for the G2-1, G2, and G3 sets, respectively.
The errors for PBE0 are 3.01, 5.15, and 7.29 kcal/mol. On all
three test sets, the B3LYP functional yields the best results.
The MAEs are 2.46, 3.04, and 4.31 kcal/mol for the G2-1,
G2, and G3 sets, respectively. The nonhybrid PBE functional
produces errors which are 4–6 times larger than any of the
tested hybrid functionals ~8.19, 17.19, and 22.88 kcal/mol!.
For comparison, the G2-1 and G2 results of our earlier
vPBEh functional are 2.93 and 4.16 kcal/mol, respectively.
This performance is better than the present implementation
but most likely due to spurious error cancellation. The new
implementation is closer to PBE0 in both functional form
and results it produces. Table I shows a full summary of the
results.
While neither HSE03 nor PBE0 yield accuracy compa-
rable to B3LYP, the latter functional contains empirical pa-
rameters which were optimized on the G2-1 set of mol-
ecules. PBE0 does not contain any empirical parameters, and
HSE03 employs only the short-range/long-range splitting pa-
rameter v50.15. The dependence on v has been shown to
be fairly small9 and while v has been chosen to give good
results for the G2-1 set, it does not represent a fully opti-
mized empirical parameter.
To estimate the effect of the molecular geometries, the
148 molecules in the G2-1 and G2-2 test sets were reopti-
mized with the individual functionals ~instead of using the
MP2 optimized geometries!. The enthalpies of formation
predicted in this case ~Table II!, all exhibit errors within 0.25
kcal/mol of the calculations using MP2 geometries. This
agreement is no surprise since geometry optimizations using
any of the above functionals yield excellent accuracy, as
shown in the next section.

B. Geometry optimizations
To further assess the accuracy of geometry optimiza-
tions, the geometries of 96 molecules, radicals and ions of
the T-96R ~Ref. 27! set were optimized and compared to
experimental bond lengths ~see references in Ref. 27!. This
recently compiled test set contains 86 neutral molecules and
10 molecular cations. It is comprised of diatomic molecules
as well as well as several high-symmetry polyatomics whose
geometries are fully deﬁned by a single bond length.
Using the 6-31111G(3df,3pd) basis set, all three hy-
brid functionals yield excellent accuracy with a MAE of
around 0.010 Å. The pure PBE functional exhibits slightly
larger errors ~MAE of 0.016 Å!. The HSE03 functional per-
forms slightly better than any of the established functionals
which were tested.
In other works, geometry optimizations are usually car-
ried out with the more modest 6-31G* basis set. Using this
basis set, the results for the three hybrid functionals are not
as uniform as with the larger basis. The MAE of B3LYP
increases by 100% to 0.020 Å while the errors of both
HSE03 and PBE0 increase by only 50% to 0.014 and 0.015
Å, respectively. Table III shows a summary of all the results.
C. Vibrational frequencies
The recently compiled T-82F set27 of diatomic mol-
ecules, radicals, and cations provides a broad range of test
systems for the prediction of harmonic vibrational frequen-
cies. Vibrational frequencies, just like geometry optimiza-
tions, are usually performed using smaller basis sets. The
geometries of all systems in the T-82F set were therefore
optimized
using
both
the
6-31111G(3df,3pd)
and
6-31G* basis sets and vibrational frequency calculations
were performed using the same basis sets. Table IV shows a
summary of the results.
HSE03 is in close agreement with PBE0. Both yield
MAEs of 44 cm21 using the large basis set and 47 cm21 with
the smaller basis. The PBE functional gives results similar to
its hybrid cousins: 42 and 48 cm21 with the large and small
basis sets, respectively. B3LYP outperforms all other func-
tionals in this test with MAEs of 34 and 39 cm21. However,
as in the geometry optimizations in Sec. IV B, using a
smaller basis set has a signiﬁcantly larger effect on B3LYP
than on the other functionals.
D. Ionization potentials and electron afﬁnities
The performance of the HSE03 functional for ionization
potentials ~IPs! and electron afﬁnities ~EAs! was examined
using the G2/97 ion test set.28 The calculations of the H2S1
and N2
1 cations do not converge with pure DFT methods28
and these two species were dropped from the test set. Our
test set thus comprised 86 ionization potentials and 58 elec-
tron afﬁnities. Geometry optimizations of all ions and neutral
molecules were performed with each tested functional using
the 6-31111G(3df,3pd) basis set. Both IPs and EAs were
calculated as the difference in energy of the charged versus
the neutral species at 0 K.
For ionization potentials, B3LYP produces the smallest
mean absolute error of 0.176 eV, compared to experiment.
The MAEs of PBE, PBE0, and HSE03 are 0.220, 0.197, and
0.227 eV, respectively. Table V shows a more detailed sum-

mary of the results. As noted in previous studies,27,28 the
errors of all functionals are similar and close to 0.2 eV.
Calculations of electron afﬁnities by density functional
methods have sparked discussions whether approximate DFT
is a valid approach to calculate EAs.29,30 Negative ions are
usually unstable when described via not completely self-
interaction-free functionals.31 The success of DFT to predict
EAs seems to rest on error cancellation and basis set effects.
Nonetheless, we calculated electron afﬁnities using HSE03
and the three other functionals. The established functionals
exhibit MAEs ranging from 0.123 eV for PBE to 0.126 and
0.163 eV for B3LYP and PBE0, respectively. The HSE03
functional produces a slightly larger error of 0.210 eV. ~See
Table VI.!
The lower performance of HSE03, compared to PBE0, is
unexpected given the close agreement of these two function-
als for all other examined properties. A closer inspection of
results for individual molecules shows HSE03 to overesti-
mate both IPs and EAs by 0.23–0.25 eV compared to PBE0.
Subtracting 0.24 eV from each IP and EA renders the HSE03
results virtually identical to the PBE0 results. This shift is
independent of the magnitude of the EA or IP and points
toward a deﬁciency in the theoretical model of HSE03. The
source of this behavior remains uncertain and we are cur-
rently investigating its origin.
E. Transition metal complexes
DFT methods have always been quite successful in de-
scribing molecules and complexes containing transition
metals.32 Therefore, the HSE03 functional was also tested on
a series of transition metal hexacarbonyls. Geometry optimi-
zations of the hexacarbonyls of chromium, molybdenum and
tungsten were performed and charge transfer within the com-
plexes was analyzed using natural bond orbital theory.
The optimized geometries of all four functionals are
close to experiment ~see Table VII!. HSE03 gives the best
overall agreement with experimental bond lengths ~MAE of
0.008 Å!. PBE0 and B3LYP are close seconds with MAEs of
0.009 Å, followed by PBE with an error of 0.010 Å. The
metal-ligand distance is best described by HSE03 and PBE
~MAE of 0.010 Å!, while all three hybrid functionals yield
better results for the carbon–oxygen bond lengths than PBE.
No experimental data exists for the partial charges of
atoms inside these hexacarbonyl complexes. Nonetheless,
examining natural bond orbital ~NBO! derived charges is in-
structive since some general information about the methods
can be obtained. The PBE pure DFT functional polarizes
bond less than all three hybrid functionals. HSE03 gives re-
sults similar to PBE0 and B3LYP ~Table VIII!. Thus, ne-
glecting the long-range HF exchange does not adversely af-
fect the wave function of the calculated system.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The HSE03 screened Coulomb hybrid density functional
yields results similar to the established, nonempirical PBE0
hybrid functional on which HSE03 is based. Enthalpies of
formation, optimized geometries, and vibrational frequencies
are predicted with similar or higher accuracy than that
achieved by PBE0. When the common 6-31G* basis set is
used for geometry optimizations, both HSE03 and PBE0
yield signiﬁcantly better results than the B3LYP functional.
For ionization potentials and electron afﬁnities, the three
other tested functionals produced smaller errors than HSE03.
However, the errors produced by HSE03 are acceptable and
might be reduced by enhancing the construction of the func-
tional.
The comprehensive test results, presented here, validate
our original assumptions in designing HSE03. The short-
range HF exchange exhibits all of the physically relevant
properties of the full HF exchange. The same approach used
in constructing HSE03 based on PBE0 can be employed to
construct screened Coulomb hybrid functionals based on
newer, meta-GGA functionals such as TPSS.4

While the present work assesses the HSE03 functional
for a variety of small and medium sized molecules, the func-
tional is designed with solids and large molecules in mind.
Our current research focuses on applying HSE03 to hybrid
DFT calculations in solids, where the use of a screened Cou-
lomb potential drastically reduces the computational de-
mands of hybrid calculations.
