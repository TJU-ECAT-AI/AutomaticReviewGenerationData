The e8'ective
Coulomb
interaction
between
the localized
electrons
is calculated
for Fe and
Ce. It is found that a change in the number
of 3d electrons
in Fe is only screened to about 50%
inside the Fe atom where the change was made, although
perfect (10070) screening
was expected
for a metallic
system
like Fe. In Ce, on the other hand,
the screening
is very efficient.
The
difference
is discussed.
For Ce the calculated
Coulomb
interaction
(6 eV) is in good agreement
with experiment,
while the result
(6 eV) for Fe is surprisingly
large.
I. INTRODUCTION
2(d"s') ~ d"+'s'+ d"-'s'
(2)
For strongly
correlated
systems,
where accurate abini-
tio calculations
are diKcult to perform,
our understand-
ing of the physical
properties
is often based on a model
Harniltonian
approach.
An important
parameter
in such
models
is the effective
Coulomb
interaction
U between
the localized
electrons
in the system,
i.e., the 3d elec-
trons
in a transition-metal
compound
and the 4f elec-
trons
in a rare-earth
compound.
Traditionally,
the pa-
rameters
in such a model
are treated
as adjustable
pa-
rameters
and deduced
from experiment.
Recently, it has
become very popular
to calculate these parameters
using
the ab initio
density-functional
(DF) formalism
in the
local-density
(I,D) approximation.
~
The meaning
of U has
been
carefully
discussed
by
Herring. 2 In, e.g. , a 3d electron
system
with
n 3d elec-
trons per atom,
U is defined
as the energy
cost for the
reaction
2(d") ~ d"+'+ d"-',
i.e., the energy cost for moving a 3d electron between
two
atoms which both initially
had n 3d electrons.
Herring
emphasized
that
U is a renormalized
quantity.
In partic-
ular, U contains efkcts due to screening
from other types
of electrons, e.g. , 4s and 4p electrons for a 3d metal. Thus
the number
of 4s and 4p electrons
on an atom with n+ 1
3d electrons
is reduced
and the number
on an atom with
n —
1 3d electrons
is increased.
This screening
by 48 and
4p electrons
reduces the energy cost for the reaction Eq.
(1). In the Anderson
or Hubbard
models,
for instance,
such a screening
is not included
explicitly
and it is then
important
to introduce
it implicitly
as a renormalization
of U. There are also other renormalization
effects for U,
in particular
due to changes
in the radial extent of the
orbitals
when the number
of 3d electrons
is changed. 2
Herring
argued
that
for metals
the screening
by 4s
and 4p electrons
is very eKcient, and that one therefore
ought to consider
the reaction
i.e., to assume that any change in the number
of 3d elec-
trons is perfectly screened inside the signer-Seitz
sphere
by a change
in the number
of 48 and 4p electrons of the
opposite
sign.
The arguments
of Herring
for this per-
fect screening
were partly
based
on screening
in a free-
electron
gas.
In Fig.
1 we show
the screening
charge
of a positive point charge in a homogeneous
electron gas
with the same density
as the average
density
of 4s and
4p electrons
in Fe (
l.l electrons per atom, r, =2.6 ao).
The curve TF was obtained
using Thomas-Fermi
linear
response
and the curve LDA was obtained
from linear re-
sponse
in the I D approximation.
3 The figure illustrates
that a large fraction of the screening
charge
falls inside
the Wigner-Seitz
sphere
with the radius
Rws = 2.66 ao.

This fraction
is 0.66 and 0.92 in the TF and
LD ap-
proximations,
respectively.
If nonlinear
screening
eAects
are taken into account
the screening
of a positive point
charge
is substantially
more efIicient, 4 while the screen-
ing of a negative
point
charge should
be somewhat
less
eKcient.
The arguments
above are based on screening
in an elec-
tron gas. For Fe metal the screening
is primarily
done by
the 4s and 4p electrons.
The 4s and 4p wave functions
must be orthogonal
to the s and p core states. This forces
the 4s and 4p wave functions to be located primarily
out-
side the core region.
This is illustrated
in Fig. 1, where
we also show the square of the 4s wave function.
The 4s
wave function
has its outermost
node at about r = 1 ao
and is rather effectively
expelled
from the region r & 1.5
ao. This efFectively prevents
the screening
in Fe from be-
ing as eKcient
as in an electron
gas.
In this paper
we
show that because of this, the screening
in Bd metals
is
far from perfect while it is quite efficient for 4f systems.
In Sec. 2 we discuss the calculation
of Coulomb
inter-
action,
and in Sec. 3 we present
results
for Fe and Ce.
The results
are discussed
in Sec. 4.
II. CALCULATION
GF E,ff
In this
section
we focus
on the
calculation
of the
screened
Coulomb
integral F,rr, corresponding
to the un-
screened Slater integral
I"0, where
(3)
IIere $3g(i) is the Bd wave function
and
r & (i'&) is the
smaller
(larger) of r and r'. To describe multiplet
effects
the Slater integrals
I"3 and F~ are needed.
These are
usually
deduced
from atomic data, since the additional
screening
effects in a solid appear to be small, s and are
not discussed
further
here.
To derive
an expression
for F,& we consider
the ex-
pression
for the interaction
energy
in Hartree-Fock
(HF)
for a configuration
with
the Bd states m;,
T, ..., m;
mr, l,...,mr~ l occupied,
where
m refers to the angular
momentum.
We write the interaction
energy
as
&r(m,
T, ..., m;
T;m, , l mr
l) = 2iFo~n(n —I)+E (m;,
T ...m;~ T)
+E (mg, l, .",m,
l)+&&rr(m;, T, ".
, m„T;m, , l, ".
, m;
l),
(4)
(5)
where
the first term
is the spherical
part of the Hartree
energy
related to I"~&, the second and third term the ex-
change energies
for the spin-up
and spin-down
exchange
energies,
respectively,
and
the fourth
term
is the non-
spherical
contributions
to the Hartree
energy.
The total
number
of 3d electrons
is n. The term DEB does not en-
ter in the following
discussion,
since we assume
all charge
densities
to be spherical
inside
a given
atomic
sphere
[the atomic-sphere
approxirnation7
(ASA)]. We can then
write
0
n
Er —
+1
(6)
where
we have only indicated
the number
of spin-up
and
spin-down
electrons, since in the ASA it does not matter
which
m quantum
numbers
are occupied.
We now
use
the relations
(7)
where z; is an eigenvalue
to the LDA equation.
We then
obtain

(8)
where
c3gy is the spin-up
3d eigenvalue,
and
the first
term gives
t,he difI'erence
between
the first two terms
in
Eq. (6).
To calculate
I" & we now
consider
a large
supercell.
The number
of 3d electrons
on one of the atoms
in the
supercell
is varied,
and
I'~& is deduced
from Eq. (8). In
such a calculation
the response of the 4s and 4p electrons
to the change
in the number
of 3d electrons
is included
and the radial extent of the Bd orbital
is allowed to ad-
just self-consistently.
The calculation
therefore
includes
the important
renormalization
efI'ects. In doing this cal-
culation
we have to avoid double counting of the hopping
between
the 3d orbital
and the rest of the system,
since
this hopping
is included
explicitly
in, for instance,
the
Anderson
model.
The hopping
integrals
connecting
all
the Bd orbitals
to other orbitals
are therefore
put equal
to zero. g'
This approach
has the further
advantage
that
it is easy to force each Bd orbital to have the desired oc-
cupation
number.
In the calculation
for Fe below)
all
atoms
but one have the 3d occupation
n = 7 (Bd 43 ),
with 3.5 spin-up
and 3.5 spin-down
electrons.
The cen-
tral atom is given occupation
numbers
according to Eq.
(8) above.
The total number
of electrons
is chosen
so
that the system
is neutral.
These calculations
are sup-
posed to be performed
for an infinite
supercell.
For a
finite supercell
we introduce
a correction
due to the fact
that the Fermi energy
changes
when
the number
of 3d
electrons
changes.
From Eq. (7) we have that the dif-
ference
between
the first two terms
in Eq. (6) is then
given by s3&ff(& + &, z) —
sr;(z + z, z), where
c'r; is the
Fermi energy.
This follows, since the supercell
is always
neutral,
and the change
in the number
of jd electrons
requires
the addition
or subtraction
of the corresponding
number of delocalized
electrons at the Fermi energy.
We

then obtain the expression

which
agrees

III. RESULTS
We
have
performed
calcu1ations,
using
the
lin-
ear
muFin-tin
orbital
method
in
the
atomic-sphere
approximation.
We first consider Fe. In the calculation
for Fe we have used a frozen core approximation.
Since
the 3s and 3p electrons are rather extended
and relatively
weakly bound, they can to some extent relax when the 3d
charge is changed.
From atomic calculations,
we estimate
the eRect on F~& to be a reduction of 0.5 eV. This number
is therefore
subtracted
from all the frozen
core calcula-
tions.
We have first used a supercell
with
four atoms.
Using the formula
(9) we obtained
the result
F~& —
5.9
eV. If the spin polarization
is neglected
a slightly
smaller
value (5.6 eV) is obtained.
This small
difFerence
is not
essential,
and all the following
calculations
are therefore
nonspin-polarized.
We next considered
a supercell
with
16 atoms,
and obtain
Fo& —
—6.2 eV using
formula (9).
This illustrates
that the results are rather
well converged
with
the respect
to the size of the supercell.
We have
performed
some additional
checks of the internal
consis-
tency of the results.
By using the total energy
difference
formula
(6) we obtain the result 6.3 eV for the 16-atom
supercell.
The good agreement
with the result
(6.2 eV)
above illustrates
that the transition
state arguments
be-
hind Eq. (9) are accurate.
We observe,
however,
that
using Eq. (8), which
is not corrected
for the change of
the Fermi energy
in the finite system,
leads to the result
5.7 eV, and a somewhat
less satisfactory
accuracy.
For
a smaller
supercell
this discrepancy
is larger.
As a final
test, we have considered
a supercell
where
one atom has
the occupancy
8, one the occupancy
6, and all the others
the occupancy 7. From this energy E(de + ds + 14d ) we
subtract
the energy E(16d") obtained
by letting
all 16
atoms in the supercell
have the occupancy
7. This gives
F,& directly according to Herring's
definition.
The result
6.8 eV does not differ greatly from the other calculations
(6.2 and 6.3 eV) for the 16 atom
supercell,
suggesting
that the results
are numerically
reliable.
In these calcu-
lations
the hopping
from the 3d levels on all the atoms
in the super
cell was suppressed.
This of course
inAu-
ences the 4s- and 4p-like electron bands and possibly the
ability of these electrons to screen the changes
in the 3d
charge.
To check this, we have performed
a calculation
for a four-atom
supercell,
where
the 3d hopping
is sup-
pressed
only for the central atom.
The 3d electrons
on
the other
atoms
are therefore
allowed
to participate
in
the screening
as well
as in the hybridization
with
the
4s and 4p electrons.
This calculation
leads to the value

F~& —5.6 eV, which
agrees
with
the result
above (5.6
eV) for a four-atom
supercell.
It is now of great interest to check the assumption
in
previous
calculations
about
perfect
screening.
We find
that the changes
in the 3d charge is screened to 24% and
29%%uo by the 4s and 4p electrons,
respectively,
on the same
site.
Totally
the on-site
screening
is therefore
slightly
more than 50%, and it is thus far from perfect.
On the
neighboring
atoms there is in addition
about 40% screen-
ing. In a renormalized
atom calculation,
Cox, Coulthard,
and Ioyd
obtained a much smaller
value F,&
2.8 eV.
This is not surprising,
since they assumed
perfect screen-
ing.
We next consider
Ce (see Fig. 2). We have performed
a calculation
for n-Ce using a supercell
with four atoms.
In this case the outermost
core (5s and
5p) lie ouside
the 4f orbital,
and it is important
to include
core relax-
ation explicitly.
Thus the core orbitals
were recalculated
for each 4f occupation.
This
leads to I",
& —
—6.1 eV.
The change
in the number
of 4f electrons
is screened to
about 4% by the Gs electrons, 4% by the 6p electrons and
97% by the 5d electrons
inside the Wigner-Seitz
sphere.
For Ce there is therefore
a slight overscreening
by about
105%. These results
can be compared
with
calculations
by Herbst, Watson, and Wilkins,
who used a renormal-
ized atom HF approach.
They obtained
U = 5 eV. This
result contains Hund's
rules effects from the higher Slater
integrals F, F, and F . Thus
we subtract
the corre-
sponding
multiplet
effects from our F,&, which
leads to
a value of about 4.6 eV, in good agreement
with Herbst,
Watson,
and Wilkins.
We can also compare
with
cal-
culations
by Dederichs
et al. , 3 who
used
an impurity
calculation
and therefore
did not make
any assumption
about the screening.
Their calculation
is therefore
closer
to ours,
although
it contains
effects of double
counting
of the hopping.
Dederichs
et OL obtained
the results 6.6
and 8.1 eV for Ce in Ag and Pd, respectively,
i.e., slightly

larger than our result.
Min et al. have performed
super-
cell calculations
for Ce and obtained
U = 5.4 eV, i~ which
is slightly
smaller
than our result.
IV. DISCUSSION
As discussed
in the Introduction,
it has been generally
believed that for metals
any change
in the number
of lo-
calized electrons
is perfectly
screened
inside the Wigner-
Seitz sphere
by the delocalized
electrons.
Our calcula-
tions show,
however,
that for the 3d system
Fe, the on-
site screening
is only about
50% while
for Ce there
is
a slight
overscreening
on the central
site.
For Fe the
screening
is done by the 4s and 4p electrons.
As illus-
trated
in Fig. 1, because of the orthogonality
to the core
electrons,
the 4s and 4p electrons
cannot
provide
such a
compact screening
charge as would be expected in a free-
electron gas with a similar
density.
The 4s wave function
is therefore
rather
effectively
excluded
from the volume
r ( 1.5ao. As a result the 3d to 4s bare Coulomb
inte-
gral Fo(3d, 4s) is only moderately
large. Furthermore
the
4s bandwidth
is essentially
determined
by the square of
the wave function
at the Wigner-Seitz
radius.
Since the
4s wave function
has its maximum
close to the Wigner-
Seitz radius, the bandwidth
is very large and the density
of states is small. To illustrate
the effect we assume that
the screening
charge
is simply
the density
of 4s and 4p
states, N(0), close to the Fermi
energy
times the shift
LE, of the 4s level due to the change
in the number
of
jd electrons. If the change in the number
of 3d electrons
is unity,
the shift is
AE, = F (3d, 4s) —
6n, pF (4s, 4s)'—
where bn, p is the change in the number of 4s and 4p elec-
trons and d is the distance between the nearest neighbors.
We have assumed that the 4s and 4p wave functions
have
the same radial extent and that the screening
charge out-
side the central sphere,
1—
bn, z, is located in the nearest-
neighbor
spheres.
The screening
charge is then
given
by
bn,„=N(0) AE, .
For Fe wave
functions
normalized
to the Wigner-Seitz
sphere
we have
I'
(3d, 4s)
1.01 Ry, F (4s, 4s)
0.89
Ry, d = 468a
aOnd N(0)
2 states/Ry
atom.
This
gives bn, z —
—
0.6, in reasonable
agreement
with the cal-
culated
result
bn, z —
—0.53.
For Ce the corresponding
numbers
are I"o(4f, 5d)
0.95 Ry, I" (5d, 5d) —
0.78 Ry,
d = 6.48ao, and N(0)
14 states jRyatom.
This gives
n5g
1.18 in reasonable
agreement
with the calculation.
We notice that the difference
between
Fe and Ce is the
much larger value of N(0) for Ce. This follows partly be-
cause the 5d function
is somewhat
more contracted
than
the 4s function,
but
in particular
because
the Wigner-
Seitz radius
is larger for Ce than for Fe, so that the Ce
5d wave function
has decayed
much more at the Wigner-
Seitz radius.
The integrals
for Fe are slightly
larger for
Fe than for Ce, because of the effect of renormalizing
the
wave functions
to the Wigner-Seitz
radius.
Although
we
find that the 4s and 4p electrons
screen a perturbation
in iron rather ineFiciently,
the situation
is completely
dif-
ferent if the 3d electrons
are included.
Thus it was found
that a core hole in an Mn impurity
in CdTe is slightly
overscreened
if the 3d electrons
on the same site are al-
lowed to participate
in the screening.
In a similar
way
we expect, e.g., 3d impurities
in 3d hosts are screened
eKciently.
The calculated
value of F & appears
to be in rather
good agreement
with
experiment
for Ce.
Thus
values
in the range 6—
7 eV have been deduced
from comparison
with spectroscopic experiments
and model calculations.
For Fe the situation
seems to be different.
Typically F,ff
is expected
to be in the range
1—
2 eV for the metallic
transition
metals, with the exception of Ni.
These es-
timates
often
do not include
many-body
effects in the
analysis
on the same level as was done for the Ce com-
pounds.
Nevertheless
it seems that
many-body
effects
cannot
fully
explain
the
difference
between
the
calcu-
lated and experimentally
deduced values of F,f for Mn,
where a similar result for F,f is obtained.
This seems to
be in contrast to the nonmetallic
3d compounds,
at least
the Ni and Cu compounds,
where
the present
approach
appears to give sensible
values for F,ff.
2
We note
that in the cases where the screening
is far from perfect,
the present
calculation
is expected to overestimate
F,&.
In these cases an appreciable
amount
of screening
charge
is located
in the spheres
which
are nearest
neighbors
to
the central
sphere,
where
the number
of localized
elec-
trons
was changed.
This charge
may be expected to be
concentrated
in the parts of the spheres
which
are clos-
est to the central sphere,
while the charge
is assumed
to
be spherically
symmetric
in the ASA applied
here. The
screening
charge then has a smaller
effect on the 3d level
in the central
atom,
and F
is less effectively
screened
[cf. Eq. (9)]. This effect can be estimated
by assuming
that
all the screening
charge outside
the central
sphere
is located exactly outside the central sphere,
while
in the
ASA the charge is effectively
located at the center of the
neighboring
spheres.
The correction to F,ff is then
(12)
where
0.5 is the
screening
charge
outside
the
central
sphere, 4.68 is the distance to the nearest
neighbor,
and
2.66 is the Wigner-Seitz
radius.
This should
be an upper
limit to the error due to the ASA. This could reduce the
I DA value for F ff to about 4 eV, which still appears too
large compared
with experiment.
V. SUMMARY
The effective Coulomb
interaction
has been calculated
for Fe and Ce as examples of transition
metals
and rare-
earth
metals,
respectively.
It is found
that
the on-site
7574
V. I. ANISIMOV AND O. GUNNARSSON
43
screening
is rather inefficient
for Fe (
50%%uo), but very ef-
ficient for Ce (
100%%uo). Because of the requirement
that
the screening
orbitals
are orthogonal
to the core orbital,
the screening
orbital
is more extended
than
the screen-
ing charge
in a free-electron
gas. As a consequence,
the
width of the band corresponding
to the screening
orbital
is very large for Fe, making
the screening
ineKcient.
For
Ce, on the other hand, the |tVigner-Seitz
radius
is rather
large
compared
with
the 5d orbital,
the corresponding
band is not so broad, and the screening
charge inside the
signer-Seitz
sphere
is large. The results for metallic
3d
systems
appear
to disagree
with
experiment,
while
the
results
for nonmetallic
3d systems
and 4f systems
seem
to be in satisfactory
agreement
with experiment.
