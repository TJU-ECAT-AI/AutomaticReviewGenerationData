We assess the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof HSE screened Coulomb hybrid density functional for the calcu-
lation of spin-orbit SO splittings and energy band gaps. We have employed a set of 23 semiconductors with
available experimental data, including group IV elements, and group III-V, II-VI, and IB-VII compounds. The
spin-orbit interaction is included in the calculations using relativistic effective core potentials within a second-
variation approximation. HSE errrors are similar to those obtained previously without including SO in the
calculation and using a weighted average of the SO split bands for the reference value J. Chem. Phys. 123,
174101 2005. Here we explicitly show that the same good agreement remains after explicitly including SO
interaction in the calculations and comparing directly to experimental energy band gaps.

The performance of density functional theory DFT in its
local spin density LSDA and generalized gradient approxi-
mation GGA has been extensively analyzed in solid state
physics. Improved functionals from the meta-generalized-
gradient
approximation
family
such
as
the
Tao-
Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria1 TPSS functional have been
shown to predict structural properties for instance, lattice
constants and bulk moduli of better quality than LSDA and
GGA,2–4 while energy band gaps obtained as Kohn-Sham
band energy differences with these functionals fail to repro-
duce experimental gaps.5,6 Other approaches, such as the
“scissor
operator,”7
the
LSDA+U,8
and
quasiparticle
Green’s-function-based
methods,9
like
the
GW
approximation,10 are more prominent for this task.
Hybrid functionals which include a portion of Hartree-
Fock exchange have been successfully applied in the calcu-
lation of thermochemical properties of molecules, in addition
to yielding good structural properties.11 The Heyd-Scuseria-
Ernzerhof HSE hybrid functional12,13 originated as an alter-
native approach that can be efﬁciently applied to solids. HSE
employs screened short-range Hartree-Fock exchange in-
stead of the full exact exchange, drastically reducing the
computational requirements and, at the same time, overcom-
ing the known problems of Hartree-Fock exchange.14 The
expression for the HSE exchange-correlation energy is

HSE = aEx

where Ex
HF,SR is the short-range Hartree-Fock exchange,
Ex
PBE,SR and Ex
PBE,LR are the short-range and long-range com-
ponents of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof15 PBE exchange
functional, respectively, and a=1/4 is the Hartree-Fock ex-
change mixing parameter determined via perturbation
theory16,17. In HSE, the short-range and long-range partition
in Eq. 1 is carried out splitting the Coulomb operator as
2
where erf and erfc are the error and complementary error
functions, respectively, and  is the screening parameter. The
functional form of HSE is based on the PBEh hybrid func-
tional also known in the literature as PBE1PBE and
PBE0.18,19 A detailed derivation of the individual terms of
HSE can be found in Refs. 12, 13, and 20. The HSE form
can be viewed as an adiabatic connection functional only for
the short-range portion of exchange, whereas long-range ex-
change and correlation are treated at the PBE GGA level.
We have recently shown that HSE gives improved lattice
constants and energy band gaps compared to traditional func-
tionals which do not include Hartree-Fock exchange using
a set of 40 semiconductors SC/40.4 We are aware of a re-
cent independent study of the performance of HSE for solids
carried
out
with
a
plane-waves-based
computational
program.21 This study reached similar conclusions to ours for
semiconductors, but pointed out some limitations for metals.
Here, we extend our previous benchmark4 by including the
spin-orbit SO interaction. To this end, we have selected a
subset of the SC/40 with available experimental SO split-
tings and band gaps two group IV elements, seven group
III-V compounds, and seven group II-VI compounds, and
we have evaluated these properties using the HSE functional.
Furthermore, we have also included six group IB-VII com-
pounds
with
available
experimental
values:
-CuCl,
-CuBr, -CuI, AgCl, AgBr, and -AgI. In Ref. 4, we used
the weighted average of the experimental SO splitting
whenever available to obtain the reference band gap to
compare with our scalar relativistic i.e., neglecting SO cou-
pling calculations. In this work we compare our energy band
gaps directly with the experimental gaps.
All calculations were carried out using periodic boundary
conditions PBC, expanding Bloch functions in terms of

atomic Gaussian-type orbitals as implemented in the GAUSS-
IAN suite of programs.22,23 Self-consistent Kohn-Sham calcu-
lations were performed on all systems. The short-range
Hartree-Fock exchange interactions were calculated in real
space using a specially adapted near-ﬁeld exchange method24
for screened interactions in PBC as implemented for the HSE
functional.25,26 Note that the screening parameter for the
Hartree-Fock exchange used here and in all our previous
papers for HSE was =0.15/2 Bohr−1 instead of the pre-
viously quoted 0.15 Bohr−1.12 Band gap dependence on the
screening parameter is not crucial for  values arround
0.15 Bohr−1 as will be reported elsewhere.26 We have em-
ployed semilocal atomic-energy-consistent relativistic effec-
tive core potentials27–29 RECPs for third Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge,
As, Se, Br and fourth row elements Ag, Cd, In, Sb, Te, I,
and shape-consistent RECPs Ref. 30 for second row ele-
ments Mg, Al, Si, P, S, and Cl. For a general review on the
choice of RECPs in DFT calculations the reader is referred to
Ref. 31.
The corresponding matrix elements of the SO operator for
a given RECP were evaluated following Refs. 32 and 33,
adapted for PBC. The SO coupling was included in our cal-
culations using the second variation approach.
For second row elements, we have employed the basis
sets of Pacios and Christiansen30 in fully uncontracted form
and with all basis functions with exponents below 0.12 re-
moved. In this way, we avoid the excessive computational
cost of including diffuse basis functions from basis sets tai-
lored for atomic and molecular calculations which in our
experience have negligible impact on the quality of the re-
sults for solids. For third and fourth row elements we have
adopted the basis set given in Ref. 4, fully uncontracted. For
Cu and Ag, we have utilized the double-zeta basis of Figgen
et al.,29 fully uncontracted with exponents below 0.12 re-
moved also.
All systems considered in this paper are closed-shell. All
calculations were carried out considering a diamond crystal
structure for group IV elements and a zinc-blende crystal
structure for all compounds, except AgCl and AgBr that
were taken in the rocksalt structure. Reciprocal space inte-
gration was performed using a uniform k-space mesh of at
least 24 points in each dimension. Band gaps and SO split-
tings were obtained as Kohn-Sham band energy differences.
In all cases, band structure calculations were performed us-
ing the lattice parameters optimized with the HSE functional.
With the exception of group IB-VII compounds, optimized
lattice parameters were taken from Ref. 4. For group IB-VII
compounds, we have optimized the lattice parameter with the
HSE functional employing the basis set described above op-

For the systems studied in this paper, SO splittings occur
at the  point at the top of the valence band, SO=8v
−7v. Since the top of the valence band is dominated by
the anion p-type orbitals, it is expected that SO is dominated
by the atomiclike p3/2-p1/2 splitting of the anion, with
some additional hybridization effects from the crystal envi-
ronment.
In Table I we present HSE results for SO splittings and
energy band gaps in carbon and silicon group IV elements.
For the sake of comparison, results at experimental lattice
constants are also shown. For Si and Ge, direct band gaps
Eg,dir are slightly underestimated with respect to the experi-
ment, while indirect band gaps Eg,ind are in excellent agree-
ment with experimental values. As it has been previously
shown, standard functionals show a severe underestimation
of band gaps.4,6 Ge shows a stronger dependence of the band
gaps on the lattice parameter than Si. SO splittings are al-
most insensitive to the choice of experimental or optimized
lattice constant. Our HSE SO splittings are in close agree-
ment with previous LDA calculations.35,36 This is not surpris-
ing since SO splittings are mostly atomic in nature, and
therefore largely determined by the SO part of the pseudo-
potential.
In Fig. 1, we compare the band structure for Ge as calcu-
lated with HSE and PBE at the experimental lattice constant.
Even though at ﬁrst sight both plots look similar, there are
two qualitative differences. First, HSE predicts a ﬁnite en-
ergy gap at  of 0.76 eV, while PBE gives a small gap of
0.02 eV. The SO splitting of 0.28 eV at the topmost conduc-
tion band is observed in both cases at . Second, HSE not
only destabilizes conduction band energies compared to
PBE, but also stabilizes the valence bands, and as a result,

HSE band widths are larger 14.1 eV than those calculated
with the PBE functional 12.8 eV.
In Table II, we present HSE SO splittings and energy
band gaps for group III-V, II-VI, and IB-VII compounds. For
some systems, reported experimental SO splittings are rather
old, and for InSb, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdSe, and CdTe we found
more than one different experimental value in the literature
the largest difference is 0.06 eV. Our calculations slightly
underestimate SO splittings by 0.05 eV mean error, with a
mean absolute error of 0.05 eV. The largest discrepancy,
0.14 eV, corresponds to -AgI. This underestimation, how-
ever, cannot be directly attributed to the HSE functional, but
rather to the RECPs employed and to the second-variational
approach. We also note some discrepancies between the
present RECP calculations.
Energy band gaps taking SO splitting into account cal-
culated with HSE are underestimated on average by 0.27 eV
with a mean absolute deviation of 0.35 eV, in contrast to
pure functionals, which yield an underestimation of more
than 1 eV.4 HSE errrors are similar to those obtained previ-
ously in Ref. 4 without including SO in the calculation and
using a weighted average for the reference value. Here we
explicitly show that the picture remains the same after in-
cluding SO interaction and comparing with the actual experi-
mental energy band gaps. This comparison as well as calcu-
lated versus experimental SO splittings is shown in Fig. 2.
In summary, we have shown that the HSE functional
gives a very good estimate of energy band gaps and SO
splittings in a set of 23 semiconductors. Considering these
results and previous assessments of HSE for lattice constants
and energy band gaps in semiconductors,4,20 and structural
and thermochemical properties of molecules,13 the HSE
functional provides a useful tool for practical applications in
both molecular and extended systems.
