In this paper, we report the first temperature dependent kinetic measurements of the reaction of C Z 5 1-alkenes with OH radicals and also report the first room temperature measurements for 1-alkenes between C811. The rate coefficients at room temperature and between 75 and 100 Torr for the reaction of OH with 1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene and 1-undecene are (2.74  0.38)  1011, (3.62  0.68)  1011, (4.20  0.41)  1011, (7.00  0.96)  1011 and (12.44  1.62)  1011 cm3 molecule1 s1, respectively, at 298 K. No pressure dependence is observed, suggesting that these reactions are at their high pressure limit. Inspection of the variation of rate coefficient with temperature over the temperature range 262300 K shows a weak negative temperature dependence, suggesting that adduct formation is taking place,however, a curved Arrhenius plot is clearly seen for 1-decene and theoretical analysis suggests that abstraction by OH is a non-negligible channel. An estimation of products formed from OH oxidation suggests that abstraction will lead to products that have a lower photochemical ozone creation potential than those formed via addition.
Introduction The reaction of alkenes with OH radicals is of great impor- tance to atmospheric chemistry, and under certain low NOx conditions, represents the dominant tropospheric sink for HOx.1 This is the result of typically fast rates of reaction coupled with high alkene concentrations present in the tropo- sphere.24 Higher molecular weight alkenessuch as those studied in this workare observed frequently in the urban troposphere5 and have been detected in motor vehicle emis- sions,6 furthermore, the lack of resolution inherent in standard single-column chromatographic apparatus may have resulted in significant underestimations of the concentration of C46 compounds in the urban atmosphere.7 Reaction of alkenes with OH proceeds via two pathways, the most important of which is considered to be the addition channel, as shown in Fig. 1a. A second reaction pathway also exists, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from an alkyl group substituent to an olefinic bond, as shown in Fig. 1b.
Overall rate coefficients for these reactions are poorly con- strained for long chain alkenes, especially with regards to their temperature and pressure dependence. Previous measurements of Cr4 alkenes exhibit a strong pressure dependence8 and a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence,911 which results from the formation of an energy-rich OH-alkene adduct.
The energised adduct could then re-dissociate back to reac- tants, undergo bond fission to yield products or undergo collisional stabilisation.
In the literature, the addition pathway is considered most important,12,13 however, the importance of the abstraction pathway is uncertain. Atkinson8 conjectured that abstraction becomes of increasing importance for alkenes with long side chains. Indeed, Photo Ionisation Mass Spectrometer studies by Biermann et al.,14 have shown qualitatively that the abstrac- tion pathway occurs for the reaction of OH with 1-butene and 1-pentene. More recently, the application of graph theoretical concepts to the kinetics of alkenes15 has led these authors to suggest that hydrogen abstraction reactions become of in- creasing importance with increasing size of alkyl substituents.

However, there is also the possibility that hyperconjugation rather than abstraction is the cause of rate coefficients en- hancement, as suggested by Canosa-Mas et al.,12 and more recently reiterated by Pfrang et al.13 To probe further the importance of the abstraction path- way, experimental and theoretical studies have been under- taken to investigate the kinetics of the reaction of OH with a series of 1-alkenes (i.e. 1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-nonene and 1-decene) as a function of pressure and temperature.
Experimental The basis of the experimental technique requires measurement of the rate of OH radical decay as a function of a known excess concentration of the reactant 1-alkene. All reactions were performed using a 21.5 mm i.d. double-jacketed Pyrex flow tube, the walls of which were coated with Halocarbon wax (Halocarbon Products Inc.). Reaction time was varied by introducing the 1-alkene reactant at known distances along the flow tube using a 4 mm i.d. Pyrex movable injector. To ensure rapid mixing of reactants, a turbulizer (a propeller- shaped Teflon nozzle) was placed at the end of the injector,and reaction times were calculated using the linear flow velocity and the distance between the tip of this injector and the ionmolecule region (where reactions are considered to be so rapid as to be practically instantaneous). Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of the apparatus.
Experiments were conducted under turbulent flow condi- tions (i.e. where the Reynolds number, Re exceeds 3000). Re is given by.
Re  d ur m
I
where d is the internal diameter of the flow tube,u is the average velocity of the carrier gas, r is the density of the carrier gas and m is the viscosity of the carrier gas.
The temperature of the flow tube was controlled to within 2 K by flowing a coolant (Texaco Havoline LC + B0F02) at the desired temperature through the jacket on the exterior of the flow tube using a circulating cooler (NESLAB RTE 8). The nitrogen carrier gas was pre-cooled to the same temperature by passing it through a copper coil immersed in liquid nitrogen.
The carrier gas temperature was maintained with heating tape regulated by an electronic controller (Carel Universal Infrared control type W) in conjunction with a type-T thermocouple.
The temperature within the flow tube was monitored using type-T thermocouples located at the rear of the flow tube and immediately upstream of the variable aperture. The tempera- ture profile along the flow tube was checked by placing a type-T thermocouple at the end of the moveable injector and moving it along the length of the flow tube.
The ionmolecule region was constructed from 22 mm o.d.Pyrex tubing and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (ABB Extrel Merlin). All gas flows were monitored with calibrated mass flow meters (MKS, 1179). The pressures in the flow tube were monitored using a 01000 Torr capacitance manometer (MKS, Baratron).
OH radicals were produced upstream of the flow tube via the reaction.

1 although OH is produced vibrationally excited (up to v = 3),physical quenching is orders of magnitude faster than that of mixing.16 Hydrogen atoms were produced by combining a
2.0 STP l min1 flow of He with an 0.5 STP cm3 min1 flow of
0.5% H2 in helium, which was passed through a microwave
discharge produced by a Surfatron (Sairem) microwave cavity operating at 100 W. H atoms were introduced upstream of the flow tubevia a sidearm, where they werecombinedwith a 2.04.0 STP cm3 min1 flow of 1% NO2 carried in a 2.0 STP l min1 He flush gas. At the pressures and flow conditions used in this study,it is calculated that the H atoms have been completely titrated beforeenteringtheflowtube.Themassspectrometersignal(atm/ e 46) was monitored with the microwave turned offand then turned on. The decrease in the NO2 signal observed when the microwave was turned on was attributed to the reaction (1).
Using this method it was found that on average 20% of H2 was dissociated into H atoms. Thus under normal operating conditions the initial concentration of OH radicals formed from the reaction of hydrogen atoms in the flow tube ranged from (110)  1010 molecules cm3. 1-alkene reactants were introduced into the reaction vessel through an atmospheric bubbler, with flow rates of 0.150 STP cm3 min1 combined with a 5.0 STP l min1 flow of N2 flush gas,which was then introduced into the flow tube via a moveable injector. Accurate concentrations were determined using the Fig. 2 A schematic diagram of the Turbulent Flow CIMS instru- ment. 4350  Phys. Chem. Chem.

In all cases, [1-alkene] exceeded [OH] by a factor of 10 or more, ensuring pseudo-first-order conditions. Blank runs (with no RH added) were conducted to confirm that OH signal (measured at m/e 17, i.e. OH) was unaffected by the movement of the injector.
OH and NO2 were chemically ionized using SF6 as the reagent ion. SF6 was generated by combining a 10 STP l min1 flow of N2 and a 2.5 STP cm3 min1 flow of SF6 and passing it through a 210Po Nuclecel ionizer (NRD Inc.).
The reagent ion was then carried into the ionmolecule region through an injector constructed from 6 mm o.d. stainless steel.
A fan shaped turbulizer was attached to the end of the inlet to enhance mixing of the reagent ion with the sampled flow from the flow tube. OH was ionized by SF6 via electron transfer,enabling the species to be detected by its parent ion.
Ions were detected with a quadrupole mass spectrometer in a three-stage differentially pumped vacuum chamber. A sam- ple of the bulk gas flow containing reactant ions is drawn into the front chamber through a 0.6 mm aperture which was held at a potential of 70 V to focus charged reactant molecules.
The front vacuum chamber was pumped by a rotary pump (Varian DS402) and held at approximately 2 Torr. The ions were further focused by a 30 mm o.d. and 0.2 mm i.d. stainless steel plate held at 15 V and passed into a second chamber containing the quadrupole mass filter (ABB Extrel, Merlin).
This second chamber was pumped by a turbomolecular pump (Varian V250) backed by a rotary pump (Edwards E2M8).
The rear chamber, which held the multiplier assembly, was pumped by a further turbomolecular pump (Varian V250) backed by a rotary pump (Edwards E2M2). Under typical operating conditions the rear chamber was held at a pressure of approximately 9  106 Torr. Ions were detected using a channeltron (Dtech 402A-H) in negative ion counting mode.
Materials Helium (BOC, CP Grade) was passed through a gas clean oxygen filter (Chrompak) cartridge to remove traces of oxy- gen, a gas clean moisture filter cartridge (Chrompak) to remove H2O, a GateKeeper Inert gas purifier (Aeronex, model CE500KIAR) to remove H2 and a trap maintained at 77 K containing a molecular sieve (Alfa Aesar, 4A) to remove water. 1-pentene (Fluka, 99.5%) 1-octene (Sigma Aldrich,98%), 1-nonene (Sigma Aldrich, 98%), 1-decene (Fluka, Z 97%), 1-undecene (Sigma Aldrich, 98%) NO2 (Sigma Aldrich,
99.54%) and SF6 (BOC, electronic grade) were purified by
repeated freeze-pump-thaw cycles.

Results Assessment of detector sensitivity Dilute mixtures of NO2 were injected via the moveable injector into the flow tube with no other gases present and the NO2
signal was monitored. From a linear plot of [NO2] vs. NO2
signal it is estimated that the sensitivity for NO2 was 2 107 molecule cm3 cps1 for a signal-to-noise ratio of one, a time constant of 1 s and an initial SF6 of 1  106 cps1.
The NO2 concentrations were corrected to take into account equilibrium concentrations of N2O4 in the gas mixtures used.
Under the experimental conditions the lifetime of N2O4 formed by the equilibrium
NO2  NO2  M  N2O4  M
2 is comparable with the time of mixing.17 This assumption was corroborated by the fact that on the time scale of the experi- ment no change in [NO2] was observed.
Calibration of the OH sensitivity was performed in a manner described by Canosa-Mas and Wayne.18 OH radicals were produced via reaction (1). H atoms were injected into the flow tube via a side arm inlet located at the rear of the flow tube and in the absence of oxygen, known amounts of NO2 were added via the moveable injector. The mass spectrometer OH signal (at m/e 17) was monitored as a function of the NO2 concentration added at various contact times. It is estimated that the sensitivity for OH was 4  107 molecule cm3 cps1 for a signal-to-noise ratio of one, a time constant of 1 s and an initial SF6 of 1  106 cps1.
Kinetics The rate coefficient for reaction of OH with alkenes is mea- sured by monitoring OH concentration profiles at m/e = 17 under pseudo-first-order conditions with [OH] = (110) 1010 molecules cm3 and [RH] = (150)  1011 molecules cm3. First-order decay rates (k1st) are obtained by a linear regression of the plots of ln(OH signal) vs. contact time (as shown in Fig. 3a) to yield k1st. This process is repeated for at least 10 different values of [RH] at each pressure studied.
As shown in Fig. 3b, the values k1st are then plotted vs. [RH],which is determined directly from the known concentration in the mixture flowing through the calibrated flow meter.
These data points are fitted with a linear least-squares routine,the slope providing the bimolecular rate constant, kOH + alkene.
Table 1 lists the effective bimolecular rate coefficients obtained in this study. This approach for determining bimolecular rate constants assumes that deviations from the plug flow approximation are negligible. Under the conditions in our turbulent flow tube, Seeley et al.,19 estimated that these deviations result in apparent rate constants that are B3% below actual values assuming a reaction probability g for OH loss at the flow tube walls of 104 (and, at most, 8% below for g values approaching unity). Hence, the flow corrections are neglected, as they are smaller than the sum of other likely errors in the measurements of gas flows, temperature, detector signal,pressure,and absolute
RH
concentrations.
The temperature of the atmospheric bubbler, was controlled by the NESLAB RTE 8 and fluctuations in the temperature results in error in the RH concentration. The temperature of the flow tube was controlled to within 2 K, which in the worst case would result in 15% error in the bimolecular rate coefficient.
The data shown in Fig. 3 are for experiments carried out at two different pressures at 298 K. For all reactions studied,within error, the effective bimolecular rate coefficient is invar- iant with pressure, which is in agreement with previous studies that indicate that, for C Z 4 alkenes, the rate coefficient would be at the high pressure limit under the conditions used in this This journal is c the Owner Societies 2007 Phys.

A high pressure relative rate determination at 735 Torr by Atkinson and Aschmann,21 a low pressure 2 Torr flow study by Biermann et al.,14 and a flash photolysis study carried out at 55 Torr by Nip and Parakesvopolous,22 which are within experimental error with this study. Furthermore,the results are in agreement over the pressure range of 2 735 Torr which indicates that measured rate coefficients are at the high pressure limit, as shown in Fig. 4a.
The rate coefficient for the reaction of OH was also studied over the temperature range 262300 K. From the data in Table 1 it is possible to carry out Arrhenius type analysis of the temperature dependence yielding an Arrhenius expression as summarised in Table 2. For all compounds studied, the rate coefficient displayed a negative temperature dependence,i.e. rate increases as the temperature is lowered, as shown in Fig. 4ad.
The negative temperature dependence is indicative of a complex mode reaction, i.e. that it proceeds through the formation of an energised OHalkene adduct. However, hy- drogen abstraction is also known to occur9,11,14 and one would expect a positive temperature dependence for such an elemen- tary reaction. The CIMS technique is blind to the reaction products and thus it is not possible to directly quantify the branching ratio of reaction directly. However, an investigation of the overall kinetics as a function of temperature provides indirect evidence of the reaction pathways that are operating.
Over a sufficient temperature range, a transition from negative to positive temperature dependence (or vice versa) will be observed, and therefore deviations from Arrhenius type beha- viour, resulting in curved Arrhenius plots similar to that of the reaction of acetic acid with the OH radical.23 Such curvature would not be observed if hyperconjugation were the sole reason for increase in reactivity, as there is no change in reaction mechanism. Over the temperature range studied,within experimental error, there is no departure from linearity apart from the reaction of OH and 1-decene, where abstrac- tion accounts for 14% of the overall rate coefficient at 300 K based on theoretical calculations (see later). The inference therefore is that abstraction is an important reaction pathway for 1-decene, however, the importance of abstraction reactions of the Co10 1-alkenes is uncertain over the temperature range studied.
It is interesting to note from this data that rate coefficients increase rapidly up the homologous series from C511. Tem- perature dependence is also enhanced over this rangea phenomenon that can also be observed in the smaller terminal Table 1 Experimentally determined effective bimolecular rate coeffi- cients for the reaction of OH with alkenes.

This results in unusually large enhancements in overall rate coefficients with successive CH2 groups, which should not be attributed exclusively to the reactivity of the secondary group(s), but also to their effect on the temperature dependence of the reaction. The quoted activation energies assume Arrhenius type behaviour; however, if the abstraction pathway also operates, the temperature dependence would be described by a double exponential fit and thus the single Arrhenius expression is a poor representation of two compet- ing channels. The largest reported activation energy is that for 1-decene, which is based on a fit to the three highest tempera- tures, i.e. only accounting for the addition pathway. The retrieved activation energy is (3170  118) K, which is similar to the range of activation energy measurements re- ported for ethene, which range from 3200 to 4790 K24 where only the addition pathway operates.
Theoretical calculations In order to assess the impact of the abstraction reaction pathway theoretical studies were undertaken to investigate the reactivity of OH towards CH bonds in long chain 1-alkenes. To assess the reactivity towards CH bond activation of these n-alkenes, one must consider the four different types of H-atom: those on the CH
Q
CH2 alkene group, those in the allylic CH2 position adjacent to the double bond, those in the other internal CH2 positions along the chain, and those on the terminal CH3 group. As a result of the strongQ
CH
bond, the alkene CH bonds are presumably nearly unreactive towards H atom abstraction. For a CH3 group bonded to an alkyl group, the structure-activity relationship25 predicts a contribution to the rate constant for reaction with OH at 298 K of 0.17  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1. Our previous computational study26 gave a calculated rate constant for abstraction from each methyl group of ethane and propane,respectively, of 0.12 and 0.10  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1, in reasonable agreement with the SAR. Compared to other chan- nels available for reaction with the present 1-alkenes, this contribution is negligible.
For the internal CH2 groups other than the allylic position,the SAR25 predicts a contribution to the rate constant of ca. 1012 cm3 molecule1 s1. Again, our previous calculations26 reproduce this contribution quite accurately, with the contri- bution to the overall rate constant for abstraction from the CH2 position in propane calculated to be 0.96  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1. A similar rate constant can be expected for each of the internal CH2 groups in the n-alkenes considered here.
The allylic CH2 group is expected to be more reactive due to developing resonance between the forming radical centre and the double bond in the transition state for CH bond Table 2 A summary of the experimentally determined Arrhenius parameters this study.

This effect is not taken into account in the SAR model.25 We have carried out calculations on the model OH + 1-butene reaction at the same KMLYP/6-311+G** level of theory27,28 as used in our previous study.26 The transition state for abstraction of the allylic H atom, shown in Fig. 5, lies
1.84 kJ mol1 below the energy of the reactants, as compared
with a TS lying 3.18 kJ mol1 above the reactants for the secondary H atom in propane. In our previous work,26 high- level calculations were used to show that the KMLYP method tends to underestimate the barrier height for CH abstraction,by ca. 7 kJ mol1. Taking this correction into account, and applying the same simple transition state theory as in the previous work,26 leads to a predicted rate coefficient for CH bond abstraction from the allylic position of 1.70  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1 at 298 K, that is, almost double that for the internal position in propane. Calculations show a slight posi- tive temperature dependence of this rate coefficient, corre- sponding to a positive enthalpy of activation of 1.3 kJ mol1.
Previous experimental work29 has noted that allylic stabiliza- tion of the product radical can enhance reactivity for CH abstraction. Based on the limited available experimental data and on calculated CH bond energies, a rough structure activity relationship was proposed30 to estimate the rate of abstraction from allylic positions. For secondary radicals, as in the present case, this led to an estimate of the rate constant of between 1.5 and 3.0  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1 at 298 K.
The present calculated value is at the lower end of this range.
Assuming additive rate coefficients with a value of 1012 cm3 molecule1 s1 for each internal CH2 group leads to total predicted rate coefficients for CH bond abstraction for 1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-decene and 1-undecene of, respectively
2.7, 5.7, 7.7 and 8.7  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1 at 298 K.
Although the approximation of additive contributions from the different groups means that the predicted values are some- what inaccurate, this suggests that abstraction plays a small but non-negligible role in the overall reaction.
For the reaction of OH with 1-decene the Arrhenius para- meters for the addition pathway were estimated from a linear fit of the Arrhenius plot for the experimentally determined rate coefficients studied at 268, 278 and 286 K, as shown in Fig. 4d.
Then the impact of the abstraction pathway on the overall rate coefficient can be evaluated using the estimated activation energy calculated by the KMLYP/6-311+G** calculations.
The solid line is the predicted total rate coefficient i.e.
(kabstraction  kaddition). In Fig. 4d the inclusion of an abstrac- tion pathway significantly improves the fit to the experimen- tally determined rate coefficients. A similar analysis has been carried out for the temperature dependence of the rate coeffi- cients of OH with all other 1-alkenes studied. It has been calculated that, within the reported experimental error, there would be little or no impact on the linearity of the Arrhenius plot, which is in agreement with the experimental results.
Thus, our results would indicate that the abstraction pathway does operate for the reaction of OH with 1-alkenes.
Comparison with structure activity relationships and further discussion of these kinetic data There are no absolute rate coefficients published for the reaction of OH with 1-alkenes larger than 1-heptene. There- fore any comparisons that can be made must be with Struc- tureActivity Relationships (SARs). The most comprehensive SAR is that of Kwok and Atkinson25 and will be used as the bench mark for comparison. Table 3 summarises the rate coefficients obtained in this work at room temperature (ap- proximately 298 K) compared with the predictions using the method of Kwok and Atkinson25 and also compares rate coefficient data obtained by Atkinson and Aschmann21 for the reaction of OH with 1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-heptene.
The work of Atkinson and Aschmann21 was a relative rate study and used the reaction between OH and propene as the reference compound, taking a rate coefficient of 2.63 1011 cm3 molecule1 s1 for this reference reaction. There have been numerous studies of this reference reaction with a wide range of rate coefficients obtained (approx. 1.53.0 1011 cm3 molecule1 s1). However, a very recent study by Spangenberg et al.,31 using a pulsed laval nozzle returned a rate coefficient at 295 K of 2.39  1011 cm3 molecule1 s1 and, in conjunction with the relative rates obtained by Atkin- son and Aschmann21 (also at 295 K), a revised set of rate coefficients for 1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-heptene are also tabulated. First, the general agreement between the studies of the reaction of OH with 1-pentene is good (noted previously).
The agreement is improved slightly by adopting the most recent determination for the rate coefficient for the reaction of OH with propene, but this is a minor point. The rate coefficient predicted by the SAR for 1-pentene is slightly higher than the experimental determinations. The rate coeffi- cient obtained in this study for 1-octene is smaller than the prediction by the SAR by about 8%. The rate coefficients for the reaction of OH with 1-hexene and 1-heptene measured using the relative rate method21 are slightly larger than our rate coefficient for the reaction with 1-octene, which is clearly out of place. However, the measured rate coefficients for 1-hexene and 1-heptene are also higher than the SAR prediction, and upon using the more recent rate coefficient for propene (the reference reaction in both systems) these rate coefficients are smaller than the value obtained in this study for 1-octene and more in line with the SAR prediction. The rate coefficient for the reaction of 1-nonene with OH is about 4% larger than the SAR prediction. However, there is a clear Fig. 5 Structure of the TS for H atom abstraction from 1-butene,optimized at the KMLYP/6-311+G** level of theory. 4354  Phys. Chem. Chem.

SAR. We rule out the possibility of a reactive impurity in the
samples of 1-decene (3% maximum) and 1-undecene (3% maximum) biasing these results: a simple back of the envelope calculation shows that even if the 3% impurity reacted with a gas-kinetic rate coefficient of around 1  1010 cm3 molecule1 s1, the rate coefficients would be reduced from 7.0 to 6.9 1011 cm3 molecule1 s1, so for 1-decene the rate coefficient would actually increase slightly. Both of these compounds have low vapour pressures and perhaps there is an error in the method of measurement, however, the error in the vapour pressure measurement (underestimation) and therefore our whole methodology would have to be way beyond reasonable experimental error limits and clearly these were not encoun- tered with 1-octene and 1-nonene and there is no reason to believe this is the case for 1-decene and 1-undecene. It is often suggested that wall activity is enhanced, leading to increased loss of OH when larger-than-expected rate coefficients are returned, however, the OH wall loss rate is extremely small with and without the presence of the reactant and there is nothing to suggest heightened wall activity. The curved Ar- rhenius plot for 1-decene is surely an indication that the abstraction channel is becoming important in these higher molecular weight systems and may in part be the reason for the departure between measured and predicted rate coeffi- cients. We are unable to quantify the branching ratios for these systems with the current experimental set up but we note the following points. First, the theoretical studies in this work have highlighted that the allylicCH2 group has a heightened reactivity towards abstraction by OH which is not reflected in the SAR.25 Second, a recent SAR32 developed for the addition of OH to molecules with multiple double bonds assumes that the rate of addition of OH to a 1-alkene (from propene onwards) is independent of the substituent CH2R group,largely in agreement with the methodology of Kwok and Atkinson, and this assumption may break down for higher 1-alkenes. It would seem that the kinetics of these higher 1- alkenes are not as straightforward as predicted.
Atmospheric implications Direct addition to the double bond will lead to the formation of a peroxy radical of the form CH2(OH)CH(O2)R and on reaction with NO, NO3 or other peroxy radicals will yield an alkoxy radical CH2(OH)CH(O)R, which is likely to decompose to HCHO, HO2 and RCHO on reaction with O2. The products so formed will enhance ozone formation in the presence of NOx, since RCHO and HCHO are reactive species that also have an appreciable photolytic decomposition rate, leading to further peroxy radical formation.

and a ketone from

CHCH2R00C(O)R000. Photolysis rates for these ketones will be slower than the aldehydes formed from addition of OH.
Also, addition of OH to the double bond of these ketonic species will be slower than addition to the analogous 1-alkene.
Therefore, abstraction will tend to form products that have a lower photochemical ozone formation potential, and if there is a significant branching ratio for a particular 1-alkene this will be an important consideration in mechanism development.
Conclusions and future work Our data indicates that the reaction of OH with 1-alkenes has a significant negative temperature dependence. The results represent the first evaluation of the kinetics of the reaction of OH with 1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-nonene and 1-decene. Over the temperature range studied, the rate coefficient for reaction was found to be invariant with pressure, suggesting that the rate coefficient is at the high pressure limit. For the reaction of OH with 1-decene, the Arrhenius plot was non-linear, indicat- ing that the abstraction pathway makes an appreciable con- tribution towards the overall rate of reaction. KMLYP/ 6-311+G** theoretical studies were performed to assess the reactivity of the CH bond and its impact on overall rate coefficient. It was found that the abstraction pathway will operate. However, more studies are needed to directly quantify the addition and abstraction pathways utilising experimental techniques that can measure directly the OHalkene adduct produced via addition or the alkyl radical produce via abstrac- tion, such as Ultra-Violet photoelectron spectroscopy.33 Using known tropospheric degradation chemistry, our model suggests that abstraction will lead to products with a smaller Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP) and therefore if the abstraction pathway is of the same order of magnitude as observed for 1-decene (i.e. 14%) for other atmospherically relevant alkenes,this factor should be Table 3 Rate coefficients at approximately 298 K obtained in this work compared with measurements made by Atkinson and Aschmann,21 Biermann et al.,14 revised relative rate coefficients using recent data of Sprangenberg et al.,31 for OH + propene,the SAR from Kwok and Atkinson25 and a recent SAR from Peeters et al.32 k/1011 cm3 molceule1s1 Compound This work Atkinson and Aschmann18 Revised Atkinson and Aschmann18 Biermann et al.,11 Kwok and Atkinson22 Peeters et al.,32 1-pentene

Addition of OH to these 1-alkenes will lead to aldehyde formation which not only have high POCP indices, but will also be precursors to PAN type formation.
