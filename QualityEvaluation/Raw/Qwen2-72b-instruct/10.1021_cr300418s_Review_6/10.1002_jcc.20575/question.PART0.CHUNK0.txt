Improved grid-based algorithm for Bader charge allocation Abstract An improvement to the grid-based algorithm of Henkelman et al. for the calculation of Bader volumes is suggested, which more accurately calculates atomic properties as predicted by the theory of Atoms in Molecules. The CPU time required by the improved algorithm to perform the Bader analysis scales linearly with the number of interatomic surfaces in the system. The new algorithm corrects systematic deviations from the true Bader surface, calculated by the original method and also does not require explicit representation of the interatomic surfaces, resulting in a more robust method of partitioning charge density among atoms in the system. Applications of the method to some small systems are given and it is further demonstrated how the method can be used to define an energy per atom in ab initio calculations.  2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem, 2007 Introduction According to Richard Bader's theory of Atoms in Molecules (AIM),1 a molecule can be partitioned into atomic volumes, such that the flux of the gradient of the electron density through the interatomic surfaces vanishes at every point on the surfaces. Within such volumes, it can be shown that the atomic subsystems obey a local virial relation. Also, certain properties, such as an atomic charge, atomic dipole moment, and atomic kinetic and potential energies, are shown by the AIM theory to take on quantities that are well-defined by quantum mechanics, if they are integrated over these atomic subvolumes.2 This leads to the useful ability to partition charge, energy, and other properties unambiguously over the atoms composing a chemical system. Unlike other charge partitioning schemes, such as the Mulliken population analysis, the AIM results are not highly sensitive to the basis set used in the calculation.3, 4 In particular, the AIM method does not require the assignment of each basis function to a specific atom. This makes AIM particularly advantageous in situations where this assignment would be difficult or impossible, such as with plane-wave basis sets. Additionally, the AIM analysis can be performed, using either theoretical or experimentally determined charge densities.The principle obstacle to the integration of AIM properties has been the fast and accurate calculation of the atomic volumes, or equivalently their bounding interatomic surfaces. The first reported calculations involved a coordinate transformation to an atom-centered, distorted coordinate system, in which the integration becomes unbounded.5 Despite the relative simplicity of this scheme, in practice it tends to be very computationally expensive. More common have been attempts to represent the interatomic surface by a function r(θ, ϕ), where θ and ϕ are polar coordinates centered on each atomic nucleus and r represents the radial coordinate from the nucleus to the interatomic surface in question. An early method to approximate this function, used by the program PROAIM,6 determines the interatomic surface with a set of points, which are obtained by following the electron density gradient downhill from bond critical points. Interpolations are performed between the point mesh. The point density within the mesh tends to be quite uneven, leading to interpolations of r that are also uneven in quality, with respect to θ and ϕ. In practice this can lead to density leakage, which becomes more severe in molecules containing sharply curving interatomic surfaces. A later approach involves approximating the interatomic surfaces, by representing them as analytical functions of the angular coordinates of a spherical or curvilinear coordinate system in real space. In particular, an early algorithm used a FourierChebyshev fit to a numerically obtained interatomic surface to obtain an analytical approximation to the surface.7 Another algorithm uses a variational procedure to calculate an analytical solution, by varying a vector of parameters to eliminate the electronic density flux residual over a quadrature of points.8 These and other algorithms have been critically examined by Popelier.9 Although much work has been published with respect to these methods of Bader volume calculation, they remain complicated to implement. In practice, they also tend to lack robustness across a wide range of electron density topologies. Attempts to represent the interatomic surfaces as functions of nucleus-centered angular coordinates are complicated by multiple ray-surface intersections. This essentially makes the interatomic surface a multivalued function. Complex algorithms have been developed to deal with this commonly encountered situation.10 More recently, the octal tree search algorithm of computer graphics was used to analyze the topologically complicated Laplacian of the electron density.11 Recently, an entirely different approach was suggested by Henkelman et al.12 Instead of explicitly representing the interatomic surfaces, each volume element of the system was assigned to an atomic volume by tracing an approximate electron density gradient vector trajectory from the center of the volume element back to an atomic nucleus, and assigning the volume element to that atom. During the gradient vector trace, the position vector was constrained to an integral multiple of the grid spacing in all three-dimensions. Large speed increases could be achieved by this method, because volume elements could be assigned to atomic volumes early in the gradient tracing process, if the position vector corresponded to a volume element that had already been assigned. The original algorithm reported by Henkelman et al.,12 demonstrated some conceptual and practical advantages over previously reported algorithms. Although the original algorithm was described in terms of a regular cubic mesh, it is generally applicable to any type of nonorthogonal regular mesh. The conceptual simplicity of the algorithm and its ease of implementation lead to very robust behavior, independent of the actual topology of the electronic charge density field. The algorithm can easily handle Bader volumes, which do not contain a nucleus. Additionally, multiple ray-surface intersections are not an issue. The original algorithm is summarized below.The input data for the algorithm is a three-dimensional regular Cartesian mesh of values of the electron density ρ defined over a rectangular volume of space V. This volume should be large enough so that the value of ρ is negligible outside this region. The volume V is subdivided into M smaller volumes δVi, i = 1 M centered around each mesh point. Each point at the center of δVi is given by r i = l Δ x + m Δ y + n Δ zk, where l, m, and n, are integers that indicate the discrete numbering of the mesh points and Δx, Δy, Δz are the mesh spacings along each Cartesian direction. The idea is to assign each volume element δVi to a Bader volume associated with a particular atomic nucleus or in rare cases to a Bader volume associated with a local maximum in ρ, which is not a nucleus. The following algorithm is performed to assign the mesh points to a Bader volume:1 Start to scan through the set of volume elements δVi. 2 Initialize a list of volume elements A to be empty. Let ri be the mesh point at the center of the next volume element to be assigned. If there are no more volume elements to be assigned, end program. 3 If the value of ρ at ri is a local maximum then terminate the current search and assign the volume element δVi to the Bader volume associated with that maximum. If δVi has already been assigned to a Bader volume associated with a local maximum, then assign all the volume elements stored in the list A to that Bader volume and go to step 2 at the next mesh point to be chosen. This can be done by increasing l, m, and n sequentially ignoring points that have already been assigned.There are 26 grid points immediately adjacent to each grid point. This is because there are 26 nonzero values of Δ r = l Δ x + m Δ y + n Δ zk such that l, m, n  {1,0,1}. For all 26 adjacent grid points ri + Δr, define an approximation to the component of the electron density gradient in the direction of Δr by (1) 4 The location of the current mesh point is stored in memory in the list A. Let ri = ri + Δr for the Δr with the highest computed value of ρΔr. Go to step 3.The earlier algorithm, however, does not always converge to the correct Bader volumes in the limit of an infinitely fine mesh. In particular, it does not approximate the true Bader surface in areas where the electron density gradient is constant or slowly changing. In these areas, which tend to lie farther from the nuclei, the algorithm tends to snap the electron density gradient trajectories to one of the 26 directions of Δr, irrespective of the mesh density. The cause of this snapping is illustrated in Figure 1a. The results of a Bader volume calculation using this grid-based algorithm, performed on a two-dimensional scalar field is shown in Figure 1a. The scalar field was composed of the sum of four different two-dimensional Gaussians centered at the four vertices of a square.Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a) A schematic illustrating deviation in the original grid-based algorithm near an interatomic surface. The mesh points are illustrated as circles, with fill colors representing the Bader volume assignment. The solid lines represent the gradient vector trajectories, and the dotted line illustrates the true Bader interatomic surface. The arrows represent the Δr vectors. Bader volume assignments are shown in (b) and (c), for the original grid-based algorithm, and the algorithm reported in this article, respectively. These calculations were performed in two-dimensions, using a density field composed of the sum of four Gaussian functions arranged in a square.This dependence of the calculated Bader volume on the orientation of the mesh axes can be demonstrated by calculating the Bader charge of an atom in a molecule at various orientations of the mesh axes and at various mesh densities. The results of these calculations for the water molecule are shown in Figure 2a. In these calculations, the water molecule is rotated by between 0 and 90 with respect to the grid axes, and the Bader charge of the oxygen atom in the water molecule is calculated at mesh spacings of 0.16, 0.18, and 0.20a0. From this graph, it can be seen that the original grid-based algorithm gives results, which vary by up to 0.12e, depending upon the orientation of the water molecule with respect to the axes.Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Bader charge on the oxygen atom in a water molecule, calculated by integration over the Bader volume (a) using the original grid-based algorithm, and (b) the new algorithm with various methods of gradient calculation. All calculations use an electron density obtained from calculations, using the LDA functional with PLATO.13 The calculated oxygen Bader charges are plotted with respect to the rotation of the water molecule around the z-axis of the coordinate system. The series in (a) correspond to regular meshes with spacings of 0.20, 0.18, and 0.16 Bohr radii. The series in (b) correspond to direct gradient evaluation, and cubic and linear interpolation of the gradient, as well as the nearest gradient scheme. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at www.interscience.wiley.com.] Improved Algorithm The intention of the improved algorithm is to correct the dependence of the original method upon the orientation of the system with respect to the mesh axes, and to converge to the correct Bader volumes in the limit of an infinitely fine mesh. To eliminate dependence of the computed charges on the orientation of the system, the gradient trajectory is followed freely in space, with a step size equal to the mesh interval, without restricting its direction to one of the 26 discrete values of Δr. This allows a perfect trace of the gradient trajectory in the limit of an infinitely fine mesh, and therefore an accurate assignment of every mesh point to the proper Bader volume. The new (and the original) algorithm can be applied to non-Cartesian grid with different spacing along three nonplanar directions but for the sake of simplicity we restrict the description again to Cartesian meshes with a regular spacing.As the vector r moves through space, tracing the gradient vector trajectory, it enters and leaves cubes of volume that correspond to the closest mesh point. When the gradient vector trajectory is followed to a point where it is located in a mesh cube that is completely surrounded by mesh cubes that have already been assigned to a particular Bader volume, it is assumed that the currently followed gradient trajectory eventually leads to the same maximum in the charge density. At this point, each mesh cube that has been passed through on the current gradient trajectory is also assumed to be a part of the same Bader volume, and assigned accordingly.A second improvement to the original algorithm is made, in which the calculation is performed on a coarse mesh initially, with the mesh becoming finer at each subsequent step of the calculation. This allows larger volumes of space to be assigned to a particular Bader volume in early steps, with finer details being worked out at later steps in the calculation.The third improvement is performed during the final integration, where a random sampling technique is used within all volume elements that are still not completely surrounded by elements assigned to the same Bader volume. The dividing surface between atoms passes through these cubes. To obtain a more accurate charge assignment, points in the volume element are sampled randomly. Each randomly selected point is then gradient-traced until the point is unambiguously assigned to an atomic volume as described earlier. The contribution of the volume element to the atomic properties is then divided up proportionally among the atoms to which the random samples have been assigned.In the following pseudocode, the same variables are used as in the previous section. However, for simplicity we define (2) as a scalar equal to the mesh spacing in the Cartesian directions (x,y,z). A small constant δg is chosen as the gradient trajectory step size for the duration of the procedure, typically one half of the mesh spacing of the original data. A second constant δQ is defined as a precision parameter used during the random sampling integration procedure. It corresponds to the amount of subcharge in a volume element that we want to be assigned by the charge allocation method. Assuming a typical desired Bader charge precision of around +/ 0.001 electrons, the optimal value of δQ determined heuristically for this precision turns out to be about 1% of this value. However, as δQ is used in a random sampling process, it would be expected that the error would decrease with the inverse of the square root of the number of sampled points. Since the number of sampled points is inversely proportional to δQ, the error should increase as the square root of δQ. In addition to these precision parameters a set B is defined, which has the same number of elements as there are distinct maxima in ρ. When all volume elements are allocated, each element of B is the set of volume elements associated with each distinct maxima of ρ and is thus the Bader volume associated with that maximum point. The full improved algorithm is given below:1 From the supplied data points on the grid, set up a coarse mesh using a large value of δw. Initialize B to be empty. Define a mesh length value δw0, which defines the allowable accuracy of the spatial variation in the Bader volumes. This should be greater than or equal to the mesh spacing given in the input data set. 2 Initialize a set of volume elements A to be empty. Let ri be the mesh point at the centre of the next element δVi to be assigned. This is chosen as in the case of the original algorithm. If there are no volume elements to be assigned, go to step 3. 3 If all 26 cubes surrounding δVi are already assigned to the same Bader volume (i.e., element of B), then assign δVi to that Bader volume. If ri is located within a distance δw of an atomic nucleus, then assign δVi to the Bader volume associated with that atomic nucleus. If ρ has local maximum at ri but ri is not located within a distance δw of any atomic nucleus, assign the δVi to a Bader volume associated with a non-nuclear attractor. Assign all the volume elements stored in the list A to the same Bader volume as δVi and go to step 2. Otherwise, add δVi to the list A. 4 Let (3) Let r = ri + Δr. Determine the new volume element δVi, which contains r. Go to step 3. 5 If δw  δw0, go to 5. 6 Let δw = δw/2. From each old volume element, eight new cubes are produced initially allocated to one of the maxima in ρ. Those new cubes which are completely surrounded by cubes allocated to the same maximum are kept in the appropriate element of B. Those that are not so surrounded are erased from association with a maximum (i.e., removed from that element of B) and considered as unallocated for further investigation. Go to 2. 7 Integrate the electron density over all mesh volumes in the mesh. Let δqi be the total charge contained within the ith volume element. For each volume element that is completely surrounded by volume elements with the same Bader volume assignment, assign δqi to that Bader volume. Otherwise, define an integer N by (4) Choose N random points in δVi and trace the gradient trajectory for each point as in step 3, until reaching a volume element that is completely surrounded by volume elements with the same Bader volume assignment. Once this occurs, assign δqi/N to that Bader volume. End the program.It is important to carry out the charge allocation given in step 5 for elements with trajectories that can be traced back to different Bader volumes. If this is not done, significant systematic errors can occur in the Bader charge integration in certain circumstances. For example, if the true Bader surface is planar or nearly planar, and runs parallel to the xy-plane of the mesh coordinate system, significant errors would result unless ρ was defined on a very fine grid. This is because all of the mesh cubes bisected by this plane would be assigned to either one or the other of the adjacent Bader volumes, depending upon which Bader volume contained the mesh points in this plane.To obtain the gradient vectors, several methods can be used. The Direct method, calculates the gradient vector, using the electronic orbital coefficients. The second method involves interpolation between points in a regular mesh, to obtain each of the three gradient vector components. In this article, interpolations between a mesh of gradient vector components were performed, using a three-dimensional cubic polynomial interpolation algorithm.13 This cubic interpolation algorithm is referred to as Cubic interpolation. For comparison, calculations are also reported by using two simpler algorithms to calculate the gradient vector components. In the first method, the gradient vector is simply taken as the gradient vector of the closest grid point. This algorithm is referred to as Nearest gradient. In the final method, a simple trilinear algorithm was used to calculate the gradient vector components. This algorithm is referred to as Linear interpolation.In rare cases where Bader charge has been allocated to a maximum ρ value, which is not an atom, there are two different courses of action. The choice of this method to use is dependent upon the specific application. In the first method, each of the volume elements making up the corresponding element of B are assigned individually to another element of B, which corresponds to the nearest atom to that volume element.Results The results of a Bader volume calculation performed, using the algorithm reported in this article is shown graphically in Figure 1b, using the same scalar field as shown in Figure 1a. A comparison of Figures 1b and 1c demonstrates that the new algorithm succeeds in assigning all points to their respective Bader volumes, even those which lie close to an interatomic surface.A series of Bader charge calculations was performed on the oxygen atom in a water molecule at a mesh spacing of 0.2 Bohr. As shown in Figure 2b, the calculated oxygen Bader charges vary by approximately 0.001e with respect to rotation of the integral mesh axes, when the new algorithm is used with the Direct method of gradient vector calculation. The algorithm varies by less than 0.005e, when the cubic interpolation scheme is used. The Nearest Gradient and Linear Interpolation schemes varied by approximately 0.08e with respect to rotation of the grid axes. The mean Bader analysis times for calculations performed on a water molecule with a mesh spacing of 0.2 Bohr radii, using all four gradient interpolation schemes are summarized in Table1. The cubic interpolation scheme requires approximately 20% of the CPU time that the direct gradient scheme requires.Table 1.

In each case, the molecule was fully geometry-optimized, using the density-functional theory Package for Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (PLATO),14 before the Bader analysis was performed. For a subset of smaller molecules, the calculations were performed, using the cubic interpolation scheme, as well as with a slower direct evaluation of the gradient vector, for comparison. The results of these calculations are summarized in Table2. Further atomic charge calculations involving only the cubic interpolation scheme are reported in Table3.Table 2.

Gradient vectors were calculated by a cubic interpolation scheme. The atomic energies are also reported (in Rydbergs).
The electron densities were calculated, using the full LCAO treatment and the LDA density functional. The core electrons were represented by the relativistic electronic core potentials of Hartwigsen et al.15 for the elements H, C, O, and Si. For the remaining elements, the nonrelativistic pseudopotentials of Goedecker et al16 were used. For all of the elements except hydrogen, a triple-numeric basis set was used with added polarization functions. For hydrogen, a double numeric polarized basis set was taken. Because the SCF included only valence electrons, the core electrons were assumed to remain completely localized for the purposes of the Bader charge calculations. A fixed, spherically symmetric core electron density function was used at each nucleus for the purposes of the gradient vector calculations. This core electron density was calculated as the difference between an all-electron density atomic calculation, and the corresponding atomic calculation, using the appropriate pseudopotential.
When the cubic interpolation scheme was used, the cubic interpolation was performed on a grid containing valence electron gradient components only. In these cases, the core electron density gradients were added on after the cubic interpolation was completed.
Bader charge analysis is important for a number of reasons. One application is that it allows the total energy of an atomic system to be apportioned uniquely to each atom in the system, defining a so-called energy per atom. This is a concept that is quite useful when fitting empirical potentials to quantum mechanical calculations. This apportioning can be accomplished as follows.
Within the local density approximation, the total energy of a system is given by the equation (5) where fn is the occupancy of the n-th KohnSham orbital, and en is its eigenvalue. EIonIon is a sum of the ionion interactions and the final term is the double-counting energy, defined as (6) The first term in eq. (5) is the band energy, and can be expressed in terms of the density and Hamiltonian matrix,(7) The terms on the right side can then be partitioned among the atoms in the system, by assigning on-site and bonding contributions to each atom,(8) The ionion interactions can be partitioned among the atoms of the system by assigning half of each ionion term to each of the two ions involved. The double counting energy can then be partitioned among the atoms in the system by integrating the right side of eq. (6) over each atomic basin.
The energies reported in Tables 2 and 3 were calculated, using this energy partitioning scheme.
Scaling The total amount of CPU time required by the new algorithm to perform the Bader analysis is plotted against the total number of interatomic surfaces present in all of the molecules studied (Fig. 3). The calculations were performed on a 2.5 GHz PowerPC G5 processor, using a mesh resolution of 0.2 Bohr radii. The CPU time required to calculate the density and gradient arrays were not included in this data. These timing values were fit to a power curve, using a least-squares fitting procedure. The best-fit equation is (9) Hence, the algorithm scales linearly with respect to the total number of interatomic surfaces in the system, and requires approximately 38 s of CPU time per interatomic surface on the computer system used. Due to the fact that the algorithm scales linearly with respect to the number of interatomic surfaces, for larger systems it can also be expected to scale linearly with respect to the total number of atoms in the system. This does not include the time required to perform DFT simulations.

The CPU time reported represents the time required by the Bader volume calculation and integration algorithms and does not include the CPU time required to produce the density and gradient arrays. Also shown is the best-fit power curve corresponding to the timing data, (black line). [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at www.interscience.wiley.com.] Summary An improved version of the grid-based algorithm for Bader atomic property integration has been written. This algorithm is relatively simple to implement, and robust, as well as insensitive to the topology of the electronic charge density. This algorithm can also be applied to a mesh of precalculated gradient vectors, using a suitable interpolation scheme. A series of molecular calculations was presented, comparing the performance of the algorithm, using both direct gradient vector evaluation, and a cubic interpolation scheme. These calculations indicated excellent agreement between the interpolated and directly-evaluated gradient vector methods, validating the interpolation scheme. Compared with the original grid-based algorithm, the reported algorithm was also shown to be relatively insensitive to the rotation of the coordinate system of the mesh.
It was shown that a cubic gradient interpolation scheme yields nearly the same results as a direct gradient evaluation scheme, but requires only approximately 20% of the CPU time. It was also demonstrated that the algorithm scales linearly with respect to the total number of interatomic surfaces in the system. This implies that, for larger systems, the algorithm scales linearly with respect to the total number of atoms.
