< 600 C) produces less polymerized cationic EFAL which may be responsible for the enhancement of the Bronsted acidity of some bridged hydroxyl groups. Harder steaming (2 > 600
C)
forms pentacoordinated,266 tetrahedrally coordi- nated,267 and, in general, condensed alumina EFAL type species.
Steaming followed by acid treatment can extract a part of EFAL and to restore some of the high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) hydroxyl groups by removing cationic EFAL species which were in ion exchange positions.268 Dealuminated samples free of EFAL can be pro- duced by using Al complexing agents such as ED-
TA269
and (NH4)2F6Si.270p271 In the first case, the Al vacancies are partially left behind, while with the second reagent, the Al vacancies are healed by Si incorporation.
Finally, Sic14 has also been used to dealuminate zeolites.272 This reagent removes some of the ex- tracted Al as AlC13, but some part still remains in the zeolite.
By using one of the above dealumination proce- dures, or a combination of them, it should be possible to prepare zeolites, which can only be synthesized in a short range of SYAl compositions,with an expanded 576 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 range of Si/Al ratios. Furthermore, one can control the presence or not of Lewis acid sites, as well as their nature and amount.
4. Influence of Structural Effects
It was said above that besides electronegativity,zeolite geometry also plays a role in determining the acidity of zeolites. In this way, it is claimed that the distances and bond angles in the Al-OH-Si group can affect the acidity of the hydroxyl and strongly acidic zeolites have a range of T-O-T angles (ZSM-5, 137-177; mordenite, 143-180) larger than other less acidic (HY, 138-147).
The effect of the bond angle and bond distances in Al-OH-Si on the acidity of the hydroxyl group has been studied by means of molecular orbital calcu- l a t i o n  .    - Carson et al.278 have calculated the energy required to deform the protonated and depro- tonated Si-0-AI bridge, and found that the depro- tonation energy decreases with the increase of the
T-O-T
bond angle, and consequently, the corre- sponding acidity increases. Other authors279 arrive at similar conclusions since they found that in a cluster of the type (HO)3 Si(0H) N(OH)3, the most stable T-O-T angles for the protonated and depro- tonated forms are 134.2 and 179.3, respectively.
Experimental results seem to confirm this, and it can be illustrated with SAPO-37,which is isostructural with faujasite, and can be synthesized using tetra- propyl and tetramethylammonium as templates. In this structure the tetrapropylammonium cation is located in the supercavity, while tetramethylammo- nium cation is in the sodalite units.280 When both templates are removed by calcination, acid sites are formed which correspond to hydroxyls pointing to the supercavity (3639 cm-l) and to sodalite units (3573 cm-l) and which are mildly acidic. However, if SAPO-37 is calcined at 400 C in vacuum then the tetrapropylammonium (TPA) is removed while tet- ramethylammonium (TMA) is still present in the sodalite cages. In this case it has been that the high-frequency band at 3639 cm-l was shifted at 3630 cm-l indicating an increase in the acidity of the corresponding hydroxy group, as was confirmed by pyridine adsorption-desorption. This was ex- plained by assuming that the presence of TMA in the sodalite cage can produce a deformation of the structure, opening the T-O-T angles and increasing the acidity of the associated protons.225 The zeolite structure may also cause preferential location of acid sites, i.e. preferential location on some particular oxygens. It was found by XRD that in faujasite the preferred oxygens for forming the bridged hydroxyls are 0 1 and 0 3 ,  and then 0 2 ,  versus O4 which are those with the lower T-O-T angles.281,282 This has been confirmed by theoretical calculation.
Neutron diffraction (ND) studies were also used to explain the distribution of protons dependent on the large range of effects, i.e. electrostatic forces between protons, framework oxygens, and  a t i o n s .    ,
ND
has also confirmed that 0 2  are preferred than 0 4 positions for proton localization. This observation has been explained by assuming that although the bond angles for TO2T and T04T are nearly the same, Cot the proton localized on 0 2  points to the 6-member ring window which communicates the supercavity with the sodalite unit, and is stabilized by four closely located oxygens. On the other hand, protons bonded to 0 4 point to the supercage and are not stabilized by neighbor oxygens.
In conclusion, nowadays it is clear that zeolite geometry has an influence on acidity due to long- range effects as well as on the local structure of the acid sites. While long-range interactions have a clear effect on the strength of the OH bond and on its electronic properties, as has been demonstrated by IR and NMR, respectively, their effects on proton distribution have to be systematically investigated.
Besides its influence on acidity, the zeolite geom- etry plays an important role in the catalytic behavior of zeolites through the so-called shape selectivity effects. Zeolite shape selectivity has been thor- oughly discussed in the literature188201,284-295 and here will only be outlined.
The first type of shape selectivity is related to mass transport discrimination, and involves reactants and products selectivity. It occurs when the zeolite or zeotype acts as a true molecular sieve for potential reactants and products which, due to their different sizes, present significant differences in diffusivities through a given pore channel system. This type of selectivity is especially important for medium-pore zeolites and allows discrimination between linear and branched paraffins and olefins, as well as between different alkyl aromatic isomers.
When reactants can diffuse inside the zeolite pores and the reaction occurs within the crystalline struc- ture, the size and shape of channels and cavities can also be used, in some cases, to select the desired reaction path by making use of the so-called transi- tion state shape selectivity. This occurs when the spacial configuration around a transition state lo- cated in the crystalline volume, is such that only certain configurations are possible.
There are other geometry-related effects on the product selectivity: molecular traffic control 200,295 in multidimensional pore zeolites and channel tor- t  o s i t y  .
The former originates from the preferred diffusion in the crystalline volume of zeolites of molecules with different shape or size within one of two independent systems of pores. In the latter, the reactants will be subjected to more secondary reac- tions.
The more zeolite effects are discussed, the more and more similarities can be found between zeolites and enzymes. Although the zeolites are not as specific a catalysts as enzymes, they present some common features derived from their hydrophobicity- hydrophilicity, the response of their structure to the interactions of the reactant and the active site, and the shape selectivity effects. However, it is even more than that, and in the next chapter we will show that electronic confinement effects characteristic for molecular sieves, which are generally absent for amorphous mesopore catalysts, may introduce new effects which have an important impact on chemical reactivity.

5. Confinement Effecfs
Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 577 Theoretical calculations made with the molecule of ethylene confined into a microscopic cavity that there is an increase in the energy of the HOMO orbital, and therefore, the electron shift to form a covalent bond will be more favored. Furthermore, it is deduced that the basicity of a confined guest molecule should increase with respect to that in the gas phase, and this may assist in explaining the stronger than expected acidity of zeolites. It should be noticed that the electronic confinement exists independently of the presence of electric field gradi- ents, and as these, will contribute to the preactivation of molecules inside the pores of zeolites.
When a reactant molecule diffuses through the micropores of a zeolite and starts to interact with its walls and acid sites, the sorption energy of the molecule will include, as was said above, the follow- ing energy terms:

where ED and ER are the attractive and repulsive contributions from the van der Waals interaction,respectively; Ep,

and EQ are the polar, field- dipole, and field gradient-quadrupole terms, respec- tively; E 1 is the sorbate-sorbate intermolecular interaction energy; and finally, EAB is the energy of the intrinsic reactant-acid site (acid-base) chemical interaction. If one assumes that under reaction conditions the sorbate-sorbate intermolecular inter- action energy (Ed is smaller than the other energy contributions, the interactions in the confined space of the pores are characterized by ED,
ER,
Ep,
EN,
and
EQ
terms. The first two energy terms will be mostly determined by the geometry of the environment of the acid sites, while the other three will be more sensitive to the chemical composition of the environ- ment. D e r  u a n e has proposed that owing to the confinement effect sorbate molecules in zeolites and zeotypes tend to optimize their van der Waals inter- action with the surroundings and that the surface curvature of the pore walls interacting with the reactant amplifies the importance of van der Waals interactions. This effect makes zeolites even more similar to enzymes, since the confinement effect may lead to site recognition or molecular preorganization of specific sites of sorbates, reactants, and reaction intermediates or p r o d  c t s .    - Furthermore, be- cause of the close size of reactants and zeolite pores,it can be considered that the molecules are solvated by the framework and therefore the electric fields generated by the zeolite must strongly affect the properties of the solute molecule.
Besides the confinement effect proposed by Der- ouane, when the size of a guest molecule approaches the size of the pores and cavities of the host, one must also consider an electronic confinement, which can strongly influence the energy levels of the reactant- guest molecule, making it more reactive. The elec- tronic confinement299 or boxing effect implies that owing to the partial covalent character of the alumi- nosilicate crystals,300 electrons are not localized on the framework atoms, but they are partially delocal- ized through the bulk. Taking this into account, and when the size of the channels approaches the size of the molecule, the density of the orbitals (i.e. the probability for finding the electrons) of the guest molecule has to drop suddenly to nearly zero when reaching the walls of the zeolite. This is the conse- quence of the short-range repulsion with the delo- calized electron clouds of the lattice. This implies that a contraction of the orbitals of the guest molecule will occur with the consequent changes in its energy levels. More specifically an increase in the energy,especially in the frontier orbitals, should be expected,something which may imply a preactivation of the molecule when residing in the pore of the mi- croporous material. 6 .
Soft-Hard Acidities in Zeolites In 1963, Pearson301 introduced the concept of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) in order to explain affinities between acid and bases that do not depend on electronegativities or other related macroscopic properties. A simple rule was established saying that soft acids prefer to react with soft bases and hard acids prefer to react with hard bases. Hard acids are defined301-303 as small-sized,highly positively charged,and not easily polarizable electron acceptor, while soft ones are defined as those possessing the reverse properties. The fact that the bridged hydroxyl groups as well as the zeolite crystal have a strong covalent character, as was described above, makes it necessary to discuss the acidity of zeolites not only from the point of view of their acid strength but also from the point of view of their HSAB properties. The zeolite acidity considered from the softness point of view allows one to understand better the reactivity and,therefore, to explain the zeolite selectivity in reac- tions in which orbital control may exist and product distribution is not affected by diffusion limitations.
While the influence of zeolite composition and structure on acid strength has been thoroughly studied by theoretical calculations, as has been discussed above, only a few papers on the hardness of the acid sites have been published. Langemaeker et al.304 have studied the variation of the Fukui function with changing electronegativity in the neigh- borhood of the zeolite acid site. The Fukuis function is related, by density functional theory,305 to Fukuis frontier density306 and can be interpreted as a local softness.307 In a more recent work308 the softness of zeolite structures was determined by semiempirical density functional methodology using the infinite solid model. Working with cluster structures, we have correlated the softness of the acid site and the softness of an adsorbed reagent on the basis of the LUMO energy obtained from both ab initio and semiempirical calculations.309-312 In our work it was found that by increasing the SUAl ratio in the framework the acid softness in- creased. The effect on the energy of the LUMO orbital, and therefore on the softness, caused by replacement of Si by Al is due to long-range effects.
The calculations show that the destabilization of the LUMO orbital is related to the spatial distribution of the negative charge in the Al-containing frame- work and the localization of the M+ countercations. 578 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 It is known that the acid strength is affected when the nature of the framework atoms in the vicinity of the acid site is changed. With respect to the HSAB concept we found that the softness increases in the order of Al > Ga > B. From these results one may be tempted to correlate softness and acid strength,since in these cases the same tendency between the two parameters is observed. However, this should not be done since both parameters are not equivalent.
Indeed, the acid strength is related to the inductive effect of the framework cations, while the softness is determined by the charge distribution in the frame- work. An example which shows that in some cases acid strength and acid softness can follow opposite tendencies, comes from the isomorphic substitution of Si by Ge, in the site supporting the bridged hydroxyl Furthermore, it has been found with the Si-Ge system that the effect of the isomor- phic substitution can be different and dependent on whether the substitution occurs at the same site supporting the OH acid group (increases softness) or in the second coordination sphere (decreases soft- ness).
The catalytic implications of changes in acid soft- ness-hardness have been observed for orbital- controlled reactions such as alkylation of toluene and m-xylene by methano1.310-312,314,315 First, softness- hardness of the alkylating agent, i.e. the methoxy- zeolite complex was evaluated theoretically for vari- ous zeolite compositions, and it was found that the softness of the acid sites and the softness of the methoxyzeolite complex increase with the framework dealumination. It was also observed that the soft- ness of the alkylating agent is even larger due to the fact that during the activation of the electrophile- zeolite complex the energy of the LUMO orbital decreases and its density at the reaction site in- creases at the same time.312 All this was reflected in the alkylation of toluene and m-xylene by metha- nol, by an increase in the pardortho and 124/123 ratios with the increase of the softness, i.e. the increase of the SUA1 ratio of the zeolite, and when going from B-, to Ga- and to Al-substituted large-pore zeolites.311 The probability that orbital control exists in reac- tions occurring on zeolites is increased because when a molecule is introduced into a zeolite pore or cavity,the energy of the HOMO increases due to the pres- ence of the electric field gradients and electronic confinement.299 Then, and taking the electrophilic alkylation of aromatics as an example, if the energy of the HOMO orbital of the aromatic molecule is increased in the zeolite cavity compared to its value in the gas phase, it is obvious that the energy gap between the LUMO orbital of the electrophile and the HOMO of the aromatic substrate should be smaller in the confined space of zeolite than in an unconfined space. Consequently, a larger effect of the orbital control could be expected when reactions are carried out in Zeolites. However, one should consider that the shape selectivity effects can be very important in zeolites, and they may lead to different results that the selectivity effects due to orbital control.311 Corma
7. Interaction between Hydrocarbons and Acid Sites:
Carbocations as Intermediates in Acid-Catalyzed Reactions on Zeolites At the beginning, the catalytic behavior of acid zeolites was compared to that of superacids in solu- tion. It was supposed that as in the case of super- acids in homogeneous phase,316,317 carbocations would be formed on the surface of acid zeolites by protona- tion of olefins, aromatics, and even alkanes, by protonation and dehydration of alcohols, or by ab- straction of hydride ions from saturated molecules.
It was supposed that such carbocations would be the intermediate species in acid-catalyzed reactions of hydrocarbons. Since "free" carbocations were de- tected in a homogeneous solution of SbF5-HF, one may expect to be able to detect them on the surface of an acidic zeolite. However, most of the attempts have failed318 and the only carbocation positively identified on the amorphous silica-alumina and the HY zeolite is the very stable triphenylcarbenium ion.
In this case the observed chemical shift is practically the same as that reported for the "free" carbocation with superacids in liquid media. Xu and Haw319 have reported the NMR observation of indanyl carbenium ion intermediates in the reactions of hydrocarbons on acidic zeolites.
In the case of smaller potential carbocations pos- sibly derived from alcohols and olefins,there is some indirect evidence of their presence at the zeolite Unfortunately, the high reactivity of such intermediate species with olefins to form oligo- mers, makes uncertain the interpretations based on the NMR assignments. Then, due to the lack of experimental evidence one may conclude that it is difficult to accept a direct analogy between the acid catalysis in zeolites and that of superacids in liquid media. The principal difference between the two types of systems would be the much larger stabiliza- tion of the intermediate carbocations by solvatation in the superacid media. This is so, despite of the fact that the zeolitic media are also able to solvate charged species, especially in zeolites with a high framework Al content, where the strong field gradi- ents in the channels favor the polarization and ionization of guest molecules in a similar way as in highly polar Recently, it has been proposed230*325,326 that the intermediate stable species in hydrocarbon reactions on acid zeolites must be alkoxy complexes. However,the species whose electronic structure and geometry could be assimilated to adsorbed carbenium ions would not be stable, but would correspond to acti- vated species:alkoxide (I) activated species ( 1 1 )
Quantum chemical calculations that the intermediate 11, which may represent the adsorbed carbenium ion is much less stable, even for small C-0 distances, than the complex I. In the latter a Inorganic Solid Acids covalent bond between carbon and oxygen is formed,so the structure I could be identified with the real,stable, adsorbed intermediate, while the ionic system I1 requires an additional energy in order to exist. The energy needed to form I1 comes from thermal activa- tion and/or from the stabilization achieved by its interaction with a basic oxygen (species 111): Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 579 This type of intermediate I11 implies the existence and the important role of the acid-base pairs in zeolites. We have recently shown by detailed ab initio molecular orbital calculations327 that in the case of C 3 and C4 olefins this process is a concerted mechanism involving the proton transfer from the zeolite toward a carbon of the olefin double bond, and the simultaneous C-0 bond formation at the adja- cent oxygen on the zeolite structure. The reaction mechanism and the properties of the transition states are practically the same, irrespective of the frame- work TI1 atom and the increase in branching when going from propylene to isobutene. This suggests that the geometric conformation of the transition state and the flexibility of the zeolite structure are determinant for the formation of an intermediate complex of type 1 1 1 .
The same type of stabilization effects have been observed when the stability of NH4+ formed by protonation of NH3 by the acid sites of zeolites was compared with that of chemisorbed NH3 on OH acid sites.328 It was concluded that if N&+ is coordinated to only one basic oxygen of the zeolite in its anionic form, the ionic pair type complex is less stable than that corresponding to the adsorption of NH3 in where the H atom is still covalently bonded to the oxygen of the acid center:ionic pair complex adsorption complex However, when the coordination of NH4+ is biden- tate or tridentate to other basic oxygens, the ionic pair complex is more stable than the adsorbed complex. It was also found that the geometry around the tetrahedra changes when the proton is trans- ferred. This would not be possible if the lattice was rigid. Consequently, proton transfer requires a flex- ible lattice that allows for local deformations.231 In conclusion,it appears that no free carbocations are formed as intermediates on hydrocarbon reac- tions catalyzed by zeolites,but in this case carbenium ions represent unstable ion pairs or transition states.
In the case of zeolites those intermediate species are formed on acid-base pairs, and the flexibility of the zeolite is vital to allow proton transfer. There is no doubt that the electric fields present in zeolites,which are specially intense in AI-rich zeolites, can help to stabilize ionic pair complexes. However, it should be noticed that exactly the same type of reactions and at the same, or even lower, reaction temperatures occurs also on high SUM ratio zeolites,in where the stabilizations due to the solvent effect of the zeolite should be much lower.
8. Zeolites as Acid Catalysts for Hydrocarbon Reactions
Owing to the special characteristics of zeolites and zeotypes as acid catalysts, they have interesting catalytic properties for carrying out reactions with organic c o m p o  n d s .    - Here, we are going to review a series of hydrocarbon reactions catalyzed by zeolites, wich are of fundamental and practical inter- est in the oil and chemical industry.
Isomerizations. Alkenes. When olefins are in contact with acid catalysts they can easily isomerize the double bond and interconvert the cis and trans isomers. These reactions proceed by breaking and formation of carbon-hydrogen bonds, on or next to the double bond, and are catalyzed by the acid sites.
In the case of catalysts with very strong acidity,proton addition to the double bond with the formation of a carbenium ion, followed by proton elimination has been observed in strong liquid acids:

580 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 By following the mechanism proposed by Kazan- sky, it is clear that the activation energy of the double-bond isomerization should be the same as the energy required for the decomposition of an alkoxide group. Indeed, the calculated values for the alkoxide decomposition, and the value of the activation energy for the double-bond isomerization on zeolite catalysts are very similar and in the order of 15-20 kcal mol-.

+1.5 can carry out the isomerization of double bond in long chain olefins with high activity and selectiv- it.' Stronger acid zeolites are less adequate, since besides the double-bond isomerization they can also carry out undesired reactions such as oligomerization and even cracking.However in the case of olefins the most interesting type of isomerization, from the industrial point of view, is the production of branched olefins from n-olefins, especially in the C4 and C 5 fraction. This is so because of the increasing interest in isobutene and isopentenes as starting materials for the produc- tion of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE),and methyl tert-amyl ether (TAME) which are used as oxygen- ated octane booster additives in the new reformulated gasolines.The skeletal isomerization of olefins requires stron- ger acid sites than double-bond isomerization, and the activation energies involved are similar to those for olefin cracking, indicating that both reactions should share common steps.By following a carbenium ion formalism, branching can occur through a protonated cyclopropane ring,which can give after ring opening and back proton transfer to the catalyst, a branched olefin: Corma In this mechanism, and for hydrocarbons with less than five carbon atoms, a primary carbenium-like species is formed, and this would explain the need for stronger acidity for carrying out this reaction.From the practical point of view the skeletal isomerization of short-chain olefins should be carried out at temperatures as low as possible, since at low temperatures the equilibrium is shifted toward branched products (Figure However, at lower temperatures the selectivity is decreased due to olefin oligomerization reactions.343 If the reaction temper- ature is increased in order to avoid olefin oligomer- ization, then other reactions such as cracking, hy- drogen transfer, and coke formation can compete,with the corresponding negative effect on selectivity and catalyst life. Thus, reaction temperature is an important variable which has to be adjusted together wich olefin partial pressure and catalyst acidity in order to optimize the process.Large- and medium-pore zeolite and zeotype cata- lysts have been studied. In the case of large-pore zeolites such as Y, beta, and ZSM-12344 higher selectivity for isoolefins and longer catalyst life were

Since hydrogen transfer and coke formation are competing undesired reactions, the density of acid sites in the zeolite can have an important effect on selectivity. This effect was by means of two beta zeolites with Si/ Al ratios of 51 and 28. As expected, a slower catalyst decay was obtained on the sample with the largest Si/Al ratio.
Since in alkene branching isomerization an ad- equate choice of the acid strength of the catalyst is important to control selectivity and catalyst deactiva- tion, and thus, zeotypes of the AlPO, SAPO, and MeAPO type, whose acidity can be modified by introducing different elements at different concentra- tions into the framework, have been used as olefin isomerization catalysts. They are active and selective for n-butene isomerization if used at temperatures higher than 300 0C.345-347 The other factor which also plays a determinant role on the isomerization selectivity and the catalyst life, is the zeolite and zeotype pore size. In general,it can be said that medium-pore materials favor the skeletal isomerization with respect to double-bond isomerization and oligomerization. Moreover, geo- metrical restriction within the pores decreases the formation of coke precursors, and therefore increases the life of the catalyst. In this sense the adequate combination of acidity and pore size have made medium-pore Fe and Mn SAPO-11 and SAPO-31 suitable catalysts for commercial isomerization of n-butene. Results from Table 9345 show that while SAPO-31 is already active and selective catalyst if used at high reaction temperatures, the selectivity to isobutene is strongly increased when Mn is intro- duced into the framework.
Another way to control acid strength is the syn- thesis of zeolites with TI1 other than Al. When B instead of Al was introduced into ZSM-5 it was found that activity decreased but selectivity to isobutene increased. Thus, an improvement was claimed when ZSM-5 containing B and Al were synthesized.348 Inorganic Solid A c i d s

Samoles taken aRer 6 h time on stream Yield (mol%) out on acid zeolites, and this process requires very strong acid sites. However, the use of monofunc- tional acid zeolites gives low selectivity to branched isomers because of extensive recracking of branched alkanes, which are easier to be cracked than the n-paraffins.
Conversion and selectivity is strongly increased when Pt or Pd are incorporated into the acidic zeolite,and the reaction is carried out in the presence of Hz.
In this case, the proposed mechanism involves the formation of an intermediate olefin, which is pro- duced by dehydrogenation of the alkane on the metallic site.354 In the second step, the olefin diffises to an acid site, where it is protonated to form a carbenium ion-like transition state, which can isomer- ize or even crack, depending on the hydrocarbon chain length, reaction temperature, and the average lifetime the branched carbenium ion-like species on the catalyst surface, ms in turn depends on both the acid stren@h and on the good hydrogen transfer- Si/AI= 15 Si/AI=47 Figure

However, it should be taken into account that B can easily come out from the framework positions during the zeolite activation. If this happens, the B Al- ZSM-5 zeolites are equivalent to Al-ZSM-5 zeolites but with a higher SVAl ratio. Indeed, the results presented in Figure 16 show that by increasing the framework SVAl of MCM-22, which has 12 and 10 MR channels, the selectivity to isobutene increases,while the selectivity to oligomerization and cracking decreaes.3 Similarly, other medium-pore size zeo- lites with high SVAl ratio such as ZSM-22 and ZSM- 23, if used at high temperature and WHSV, give high activity and electivities.3 The best results reported on skeletal isomerization of n-butene on zeolites correspond to ferrierite. This has a structure formed by unidirectional 10 MR channels with loobs. When the zeolite is optimized from the point of view of the framework SUM ratio and the crystallite size, selectivity to isobutene close to 70% at -60% conversion is 0btained.3 It has been claimed353 that the special channel structure of ferrierite is responsible for the high isomerization selectivity, which is achieved because cracking of the branched dimeric CS olefin intermediates which produce isobutene and n-butenes rather than C 3 and hydrogenation activity of the catalyst. An scheme of such a mechanism is as follows:

n-paraffin ==== n-olefin sec-C+ metal In the bifunctional mechanism described above and if the adequate balance between the metal and the acid function is achieved (Pt atadacid site 2
0.15),355
the rearrangement of the carbenium like-ion becomes the controlling step.
When shorter chain p a r a " c 4 - C are to be isomerized very strong acid sites are needed since the reaction will go through primary carbenium ions.
Thus, zeolites with stronger acidity, such as morden- ite and ZSM-5, would appear as the most convenient.
However, because of the small diameter of ZSM-5,the diffusion of branched isomers will be restricted in this zeolite, and therefore mordenite should be the preferred catalyst. When this is selected as the acid component, sites with maximum strength are pro- duced bv modifvine the framework SVAl ratio in post- C5 fragments.
Alkanes. Skeletal isomerization of paraffins with carbon numbers between 5 and 10 is important to improve the octane number of the gasolines, while isomerization of larger n-paraffins (>Cia) is also useful to decrease the freezing point of the diesel fuel.
The skeletal isomerization of paraffins can be carried synthesis treatments in order to obtain isorated tetrahedral Al Thus, maximum activity is found for framework SiAl ratios of ca. 10. How- ever, it was pointed out, when discussing the influ- ence of zeolite composition on acid strength, that an increase in the acid strength of bridged hydroxyl groups can be obtained by interaction with ex- 582 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 Corma traframework species. This effect also occurs in mordenite, in which owing to the OH-EFAI,interac- tion an increase in the activity of a Pmordenite for isomerization of n-pentane and n-hexane was ob- served.263 Other large-pore zeolites in which strong acidity can also be produced are omega and beta. Indeed,bifunctional catalysts based on these two zeolites show good activity and selectivity for n-pentane and n-hexane i s o m e r i z a t i  n .    ' In the case of n-butane, zeolite catalysts can hardly work at temperatures below 270 "C and in this case most of the isobutane is formed by an alkylation- cracking mechanism, instead of by direct isomeriza- tion of n-butane.
When long-chain n-paraffins have to be isomerized,milder acidities and larger pores are desired in order to minimize recracking of the branched products formed. Thus, bifunctional catalysts based on zeo- lites such as faujasite, ZSM-3, CSZ-1, and L, or even zeolite mixtures as well as SAPOS and MEMOS,show good selectivities for branching isomerization of long-chain p a r a f f i n  .   O - In the case of open structures in where no shape selectivity effects exist,the product distribution can be predicted by taking into account the protonated cycloprane (PCP) mech- a n i  m .   ' It can be concluded that when using zeolites as catalysts for isomerization of n-paraffins, one has to take into account the size of the reactant and products, as well as the acid demands to form the corresponding intermediates. Then, a zeolite or zeotype with the adequate pore size and acid strength could be selected. However, even with the best optimized zeolite catalysts, it is not possible to carry out the isomerization of n-butane to isobutane with good yields and selectivity. This reaction requires stronger acid sites than those obtainable in zeolites,and the possibilities of solid catalyst with stronger acid sites to carry out this reaction will be described later when discussing the acidic properties of het- eropoly acids and sulfated metal oxides.Alkyl Aromatics. Aromatic ring positional isomer- izations are reactions of commercial interest where zeolites have demonstrated its superiority as cata- lysts. In Friedel-Crafts type of acid catalysts the isomerization of alkyl aromatics is always accompa- nied by the competitive transalkylation reaction.Zeolites have demonstrated that it is possible, by an adequate selection of the pore size and chemical composition, to optimize selectivity toward the pro- duction of the desired isomer. Taking the isomer- ization of xylenes as an example, the composition of the thermodynamic equilibrium at room temperature is approximately: 24, 60, and 16% for p-, m-, and o-xylene,respectively. Since the commercially most desired product is the para isomer, which is a raw material for production of terephthalic acid, there is a clear incentive for the selective isomerization of m- to p-xylene.On solid amorphous catalysts, as well as on large- pore zeolites and zeotypes, the isomerization of m-xylene is accompanied by transalkylation to pro- duce toluene and trimethylbenzenes: Furthermore, at high conversions, xylenes are produced with the thermodynamic equilibrium com- position.It is generally believed that isomerization of alkyl aromatics occurs by a 1,2 alkyl shift,368 and the relative rate reflects the relative stability of the alkyl cation. However, when using large-pore zeolites, it has been found that even at low levels of conversion,isomers can also be formed through a bimolecular transalkylation mechanism from intermediate,-l as it occurs for the transalkylation of xylenes to give toluene and trimethylbenzenes. Since the bimolecu- lar transalkylation reactions should involve a bulkier transition state than that of the unimolecular 1,2 methyl shift it could be expected that by reducing the space available inside the channels, a situation may be reached where transalkylation could be sup- pressed by transition-state shape selectivity. This is what is observed when the reaction is carried out on zeolites with different pore sizes.3712372 Results pre- sented in Figure 17,373 clearly show that transalky- lation is strongly decreased in 10 MR zeolites.Besides geometrical effects, the chemical composition of the zeolite also has an effect on the ratio of uni- to bimolecular reactions. In this way, it was found by means of kinetic and isotopic studies371 that by increasing the framework SUAl ratio of a large pore HY zeolite, the ratio of uni to bimolecular reactions occurring during m-xylene isomerization increased.If the suppression of xylene transalkylation achieved by using medium-pore zeolites is already a big improvement in the xylene isomerization process,zeolites can go further than this, and they can also improve the selectivity to the para isomer by product diffusion shape selectivity. As was presented before,in ZSM-5 zeolite the diffusion coefficient for p-xylene is more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than for o-xylene. This difference allows p-xylene to escape more rapidly outside the zeolite crystallite than the ortho isomer. Then the characteristic diffusion time for o-xylene is much greater than its characteristic isomerization time, so the diffusion of ortho will be selectivelly retarded within the pores, allowing time for isomerization toward p -  y l e n e .Results from Figure 18373 show the effect of pore dimensions on the para to ortho ratio obtained during isomerization of m-xylene on zeolites with different pore sizes, and it shows the increased para selectivity obtained on medium-pore zeolites.What has been said for xylene isomerization also applies to other alkyl aromatics such as ethyl-,methylbenene? diispropylbenzene? and l-meth- l n a p h t a l e n e .   " The relative ratio of the size of the molecule and the pore size seems to be the most important factor controlling the result of the isomer- ization.

The isomerization-transalkylation of alkyl aro- matics is perhaps the best example to show the important role played by shape selectivity owing to the micropores of zeolites on hydrocarbon reactivity.
This type of reaction is so determined by space restriction that they are widely used to test the pore topology of any new zeolite structure syntheized.
Carbon-Carbon Rupture and Formation.
Catalytic Cracking. Catalytic cracking of hydro- carbons is a field in which zeolites have been respon- sible for the largest revolution in oil refining in the last 30 years. Indeed, gasoil cracking is the basis for the production of more than 30% of the gasoline,while it also produces diesel, and olefins and isopar- affins for petrochemical uses. The substitution of amorphous silica-alumina catalysts by faujasite zeolites, toward end of the 1960s, allowed a strong increase in the production of gasoline.
From the point of view of cracking mechanism, the acid sites of the zeolite are believed to be the catalytic active sites. If cracking of hydrocarbons on liquid superacids proceeds through the formation of free carbenium and carbonium ions,380,381 in the case of hydrocarbon cracking on zeolites, the formation of free carbocations has not been observed. However,and after considering the product distribution ob- tained during cracking of alkanes, alkenes, cycloal- kanes, and alkyl aromatics, it appears obvious that r

In this way it is believed that when carbenium ion-like species are formed on the surface of the zeolite, one way to stabilize the short-lived ion pair is by a /?-scission process which produces an olefin in the gas phase and a new alkoxy group which remains adsorbed:230

This reaction should involve a concerted mecha- nism that allows the compensation of the dissociating bonds by the new ones being formed. This, in turn,should produce a decrease in the activation energy with respect to a process involving the formation of free carbenium ions followed by cracking.
Recently,it has been suggested that similar to the mechanism of cracking proposed by Olah in super- protolytic cracking could also occur on the surface of zeolites.3822383 This mechanism started by protonation of a C-C bond by the acid site of the zeolite. Ab initio quantum chemical calculations 584 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 Corma have been carried out to visualize the transition state of the protolytic cracking.230 Even though the hy- drocarbon molecule was small (CzHs) and the zeolitic active site was simulated by a very simple cluster,some interesting qualitative conclusions could be reached: the transition state appears as a two-point interaction of ethane with the OH and a neighboring oxygen. The reaction coordinate of protolytic crack- ing represents the concerted stretching of the 0-H bond in the bridging hydroxyl group, combined with the heterolytic splitting of the carbon-carbon bond in the protonated ethane molecule. The final step is the formation of free methane and the formation of a methoxy group in the neighboring basic oxygen of the former acid site.
While there is no doubt that the initiation step in the protolytic cracking of paraffins and cracking of olefins is the formation of a carbocation or a carbe- nium ion-like intermediate on a Bronsted acid site of the zeolite, it is still under discussion if paraffin cracking initiation via carbenium ions also occur and,if so, on what zeolite sites are the carbenium ions formed.
Some authors have claimed that a carbenium ion can be formed on alkanes or cycloalkanes by abstrac- tion of a hydride ion from the hydrocarbon by either a Bronsted acid site, which gives H 2 as a p r o d  d ,   - or by a Lewis acid site from the c a t a l y  t .    , Another hypothesis to explain the paraffin-cracking initiation, supposes that the cracking chain is initi- ated by Bronsted-site protonation of olefins that are either present in the feed or formed by thermal cracking.391 A comprehensive discussion of the dif- ferent initiation schemes can be found elsewhere.392 The current situation in the cracking of alkanes on zeolites appears to be the following: when crack- ing n-alkanes, the reaction is initiated by formation of a carbocation-like intermediate which cracks and gives a shorter alkane in the gas phase and an adsorbed carbenium ion-like species on the zeolite.
This carbenium can either desorb giving one olefin in the gas phase and restoring the zeolite Bronsted site, or it may follow a chain mechanism by abstract- ing a hydride ion from another reactant molecule,and desorbing from the catalyst as a paraffin, while leaving a carbenium ion of the reactant molecule on the zeolite surface: The adsorbed (C,H2,+1)+ can now crack following the p rule.
In summary, in the case of n-alkanes, it could be said that the first molecules of reactant are cracked by protolytic cracking. Then, when the shorter carbenium species remain on the surface, cracking can continue by two routes: (1) protolytic cracking,if the carbenium ion desorbs and regenerates the original Bronsted site, and (2) p-scission, if hydride transfer from a reactant molecule to the adsorbed carbenium ion occurs.
The relative extension of protolytic to /3-scission mechanism or, in other words, the length of the cracking chain and hydrogen transfer, has an impor- tant impact on the quality of the products formed during the commercial cracking of gasoil in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units. Indeed, protolytic cracking is believed to favor the formation of unde- sired dry gas with respect to p-scission. On the other hand, hydrogen transfer is believed to be responsible for saturation of olefins, with the corresponding increase on gasoline stability and selectivity, but producing a decrease in the research octane number
(RON).
Cycloalkanes, which are also present in FCC feedstocks,393 play a determinant role in cracking chemistry for hydrogen transfer, and as precursors for aromatics and coke. They can also react on acid zeolites to give ring opening and cracking by pro- tolytic and p-scission, as well as isomerization, and hydrogen transfer  reaction.- Alkyl aromatics, which are also constituent of FCC feeds,397 also crack on zeolites by the complete cleav- age of the side chain from the aromatic ring if that has less than five carbon atoms. Cracking can also take place along the side chain if this has more than five carbon  atom.,- Both, chemical composition and geometrical struc- ture of zeolites play an important role on determining the product distribution obtained during catalytic cracking. In this way it has been shown that the ratio of protolytic cracking to p-scission increases when increasing the SVAI ratio of the zeolite,401 meanwhile hydrogen transfer and coke formation decrease. Thus, during gasoil cracking an increase in the framework SUAI ratio of the zeolite produces a decrease in the selectivity to gasoline owing to a larger recracking, which yields C1-C4 gases, while also produces a decrease in the hydrogen transfer and coke formation, with the corresponding increase in RON and throughput, respectively.
The zeolite geometrical factors can be taken ad- vantage of to selectively crack n-paraffins and n- olefins with respect to their branched isomers when using medium-pore-size zeolites. This effect is based on zeolite shape selectivity by mass transport dis- crimination, which arises because there are signifi- cant differences in difisivities between branched and linear hydrocarbons within the pores of 10 MR zeolites, as for instance ZSM-5.402-408 However,spatial constraints of reaction intermediates can also play an important role in determining the different cracking rates of monobranched and linear paraffins on ZSM-5 zeolite. Evidence of this was given by Frilette et al.402 when showing that the relative rate of cracking n-hexane to that of 3-methylpentane was independent of the size of the individual catalyst crystal (Figure 19h402 The rate control by spatial constraints of reaction intermediates is due to the fact that a branched paraffin, by being a bulkier molecule than the un- branched isomer, requires more space to form the reaction intermediate, with possible limitations by the pore size of ZSM-5 zeolite. By carrying out this selective cracking of molecules in the gasoline range,the addition of ZSM-5 to FCC catalysts produces an increase in gasoline RON and also an increase in the production of propylene.Inorganic Solid Acids Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 585 were candidates for this,414-416 and zeolite Y, either in the protonic form or exchanged with di- or trivalent cations, has been studied for alkylation of isobutane and butene. On the basis of the products formed, it appears that the general reaction mechanism operat- ing on zeolites is the same as that on liquid acids.413 This involves a chain mechanism in which the initiation step is the protonation of the olefin, fol- lowed by a hydride transfer from a molecule of isobutane to the sec-butyl carbocation:

Changes in the pore size of the zeolite additive,for instance by using beta or MCM-22 zeolites, allows one to keep a good gasoline selectivity while increas- ing the RON of the gasoline and shifting the C4 and Cg products to desirable isobutylene and isoamylene p r o d  c t s .    - It can be concluded that by taking advantage of the high cracking activity of zeolites combined with the fact that different pore size zeolites may perform different type of cracking on the different products,leaves open the possibility to optimize cracking products by using multizeolitic cracking catalysts.
The effects shown by zeolites on catalytic cracking,also apply to hydrocracking of paraffins and gasoil.
Thus, hydrocracking is slow for n-alkanes, but the rate strongly increases for branched isomers. It can be said that hydrocracking starts when the n-parafin has undergone,at least, two isomerization steps.
This can be seen when hydrocracking n-decane on a large- pore Pt/USY zeolite (Figure 20).412 As in the case of catalytic cracking, the channel structure of ZSM-5 has a strong effect on the relative rate of cracking and isomerization,as well as on the isomer distribution of n-decane, suppressing the formation of bulky di- and tribranched decanes and ethyl octane. The shape selectivity effect of me- dium- and small-pore zeolites for hydrocracking paraffins, has shown its practical utility in the selectoforming and catalytic dewaxing processes.
Carbon-Carbon Bond Formation by Alkane- Alkene Alkylation. Environmental concerns are driving forces to find solid acids which can be used instead of the unfriendly HF and HzS04 catalysts for production of alkylation gasoline.413 Acid zeolites In a following step, the tert-butyl cation-like inter- mediate can attack an olefin to give the correspond- ing c 8 carbocation.

The chain is transferred by hydride transfer be- tween the adsorbed c 8 carbocation-like intermediate and the isobutane reactant. In this way a c 8 branched alkane is desorbed while an adsorbed tert-butylcar- benium ion is formed.
The chain is finished by desorption of a carbocation giving the corresponding olefin and restoring the Bronsted acid site.
This simplified mechanism only applies in a first approximation. When the product distribution is analyzed in detail, it can be deduced that other isomerization and olefin oligomerization reactions also occur.413 The most important pathway compet- ing with the desired alkylation is the dimerization of the olefin which in the case of 2-butene would give dimethylhexanes (DMH). This is a much less desired reaction owing to the much lower octane number of dimethyl derivatives with respect to trimethylpen- tanes (TMP).
In the case of zeolites, high activity and selectivity to TMP are obtained in the first moments of the 586 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 reaction. However, after a few minutes on stream the activity of the zeolite for hydrogen transfer, which is the reaction responsible for chain propagation, is lost, and then the reaction enters a critical stage in which product distribution is better explained in terms of olefin oligomerization instead of isobutane- butene alkylatin.',l* Since zeolite composition and structure have an influence on acidity as well as on hydrogen transfer activity, different REHY and USY preparations have been s t  d i e d .    , It has been found that while maximum activities were obtained for framework Si/ Al ratios of -6, the ratio of TMPDMH, which can measure the ratio of alkylation to oligomerization,continuously increases when decreasing the frame- work Si/Al ratio.421 This is not surprising since it is known that the concentration of reactants in the pores, the extent of hydrogen transfer, and the distribution of acid sites, strongly depend on the zeolite framework composition. The results obtained with steam dealuminated USY were compared to those on another large-pore high SUA1 ratio zeolite,such as beta, with different crystal sizes.421 It has been seen that, at least in beta zeolite, limitations in the diffusion of branched products may exist at the relatively low reaction temperatures used, as can be deduced from the increase in conversion,observed when decreasing the crystal size of the zeolite.Moreover, the beta zeolite is less selective to TMP due to its lower hydrogen transfer activity.The pore size of the zeolite is critical for diffusion of the branched products as well as for allowing the bulky transition state involved in the hydrogen transfer reaction between TMP and isobutane. When zeolites with different structures were compared at the same level of total conversion, it was f
n d
that alkylate yield increases from ZSM-5, which is formed by 10-member ring channels, to MCM-22 with 12- member ring cavities connected between them by 10- member ring windows, and an independent 10- member ring channel system,423 and from this to large-pore zeolites such as mordenite, beta, and Y.
In conclusion, it can be said that even though the zeolites are active and selective catalysts to carry out the alkylation of isobutane with olefins, their practi- cal use is limited, during to the fast catalyst deacti- vation if conventional reaction systems are used. In the next sections we will discuss the possibilities that offer stronger solid acid catalysts, such as heteropoly acids and sulfated metal oxides for this important reaction.
Carbon-Carbon Bond Formation by Olefin Oligomerization. Olefins can easily oligomerize in the presence of acid catalysts, and they also do so on acidic zeolites. 13C "in situ" NMR studies indicate that the reaction may proceed via a carbenium-like type mechanism, and alkoxides were identified as intermediate.- Together with oligomerization,other consecutive reactions such as transmutation and hydrogen transfer also occur and the oligomers may be converted to secondary olefinic and paraffinic products.429 Secondary reactions are so fast that a rapid equilibration of olefins to a composition deter- mined by the temperature and pressure of the system occurred.
Coma It is clear that in a system involving several bimolecular and unimolecular reactions, as well as products with different sizes, the final product dis- tribution could be affected by the pore size of the zeolite. In general, and as it could be expected, the amount of branched products increases when in- creasing the pore size of the zeolite or zeotype The practical importance of olefin oligomerization is illustrated by the fact that this reaction, together with transmutation-disproportionation and aroma- tization of C p to Clo olefins, are the basis of Mobil's olefin to gasoline, distillate process (MOGD).432-435 The process is quite flexible and allows, on the one hand the production of isoolefins, when the reaction is carried out at high pressures and low tempera- tures, and the hydrogenation of the 165 "C+ olefins produces a premium quality low-pour-point jet fuel and distillate fuel. On the other hand, when the process is operated at higher reaction temperatures aromatics are produced.432 Zeolite ZSM-5, either in its acid form, with supported Ni, or with supported Ga, and in combination with aluminum phosphate/ alumina are good catalysts for the oligomerization of Cp-C10 olefinic p r o d  c t s .    - Compositional (Si/ Al ratio), textural (crystal size), and catalyst confor- mational parameters (extrudation and pelletization) of the ZSM-5 zeolite play an important role on the final catalytic performance.442 Diffusional problems are important in this reaction, and therefore, a decrease in crystallite size produces an increase in activity and catalyst life. In the same way, if inter- crystalline diffusion resistance is increased by high- pressure pelletization, a decrease in conversion and catalyst life is observed.
New zeolitic structures containing 12- and 10- member ring channels (MCM-22) have been claimed as adequate olefin oligomerization catalysts,u,u and multifunctional catalysts involving MCM-41 plus MCM-22 have been claimed to carry out oligomer- ization plus cracking.445 Reactions involving olefins or even paraffins which can be cracked andlor dehydrogenated to form olefins which then can react, is an open field where the structure of the zeolite pore plays a determinant role,and consequently the product composition can be controlled by using the adequate zeolite or zeotype structure.
Alkylation of Aromatics. Electrophilic alkyla- tion of aromatics can be carried out by a variety of reactants such as olefins, alcohols, and halogenated hydrocarbons.330 Commercial catalytic processes lead- ing to the formation of ethylbenzene, p-xylene, pro- pylbenzenes,ethyltoluene, and 4,4'-isopropylbiphenyl are based on alkylation of benzene, toluene, and biphenyl.Early studies on the alkylation of benzene and related aromatics with olefins on large-pore acid zeolites found that a Langmuir-Rideal-type mecha- nistic kinetic equation can adequately represent the chemical process. In such a scheme, it was supposed that an anionic lattice-associated carbenium ion was formed by attack of a proton on an olefin, and this is then attacked by a free or weakly adsorbed aro- ma ti.,- However it has to be taken into (SApO).426-428,430-432 Inorganic Solid Acids Table 10. Alkylation of Benzene with Dodecene at 200 "C and 14.6 atm on ZSM-12 Zeolite phenyldodecane isomer distribution (%) conversion(wt%) 2-Ph 3-Ph 4-Ph 5-Ph 6-Ph dodecene Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 587 reaction. Nevertheless, very little amounts of poly- alkylated products are observed unless total pressure is increased.453 Long-chain alkyl aromatics are useful molecules for production of surfactants, and they are produced by alkylation of benzene with long-chain n-olefins on HF acid. The 12-member ring unidirectional ZSM-12 zeolite gave unique product distribution in the alky- lation of benzene with long chain olefins, forming preferentially 2-phenylalkanes (Table owing to spatial restriction in the pores of this zeolite.Larger polyaromatic molecules have been alkylated on amorphous solid acids as well as on large-pore zeolite.? An interesting example in which shape selectivity has been found in large-pore zeolites is the 4,4' alkylation of biphenyl by propylene. Table 11457 shows the isopropylation of biphenyl on large- and medium-pore zeolites, such as mcjrdenite (HM), HY, HL, and HZSM-5, as well as on amorphous silica- alumina (SA). Results show that mordenite gives the largest selectivity to 4-isopropylbiphenyl
(IPBP),
and to 4,4'-diisopropylbiphenyl (DIPBP). This last prod- uct has commercial interest for liquid crystals and high-performance polymers. When the mordenite was further dealuminated to SUA1 ratios of 2600, it gave biphenyl conversion of 98% with a selectivity to the 4,4' isomer of 73.5% at 523 K, propylene pressure of 8.43 kg cm-2, and 20 of reaction. Dealu- mination decreased polymerization and coke forma- tion, as well as reactions occurring on the external surface of the zeolite. The higher selectivity observed on H-mordenite with respect to other large-pore zeolites is believed to be due to the geometry of the channels in mordenite, which consist of 12-member ring crossed by 8-member ring channels. Then, the packed biphenyl molecules adsorbed in the 12- member ring channels would be alkylated by the propylene which would diffuse through the 8 MR channels.458 Acid mordenite catalysts also show shape selectiv- ity for the alkylation of naphthalene, anthracene,dibenzofuran, and p-terphenyl with p r  p y l e n e ,    - due to steric restriction at the transition state in the pores and differences in diffusion rates of reactants and products.Alkylation of aromatics is a good example of reac- tions where the diffusion and transition shape selec- tivity play a predominant role in controlling the selectivity of zeolite catalysts. Furthermore, it shows that depending on the size of the reactant and product molecules, shape selectivity applies to either medium- or large-pore size zeolites, and selective
54 92 8 0 0 0 account that it is difficult in the case of zeolite catalysts to assume a Langmuir-Rideal-type mech- anism in the strict sense, i.e. adsorbed olefin and aromatic in the "gas phase", since any molecule within zeolite pores is going to be subjected to the electric field gradients and even to electronic confine- ment effects. Thus, one has to consider that at least some degree of weak chemical adsorption of the aromatic must occur.
Zeolites in which no diffusional or transition state shape selectivity exist behave like liquid acids or mesoporous amorphous solid acids, i.e. there is a predominance of ortho-para orientation in electro- philic substitution reactions on aromatic rings con- taining ortho-para-directing substituents. Moreover the stronger the increased electron density at the ortho and para position generated by the ring sub- stituent, the easier will be the a l k y l a t i  n .    * How- ever, in the case of aromatics alkylation the concept of shape selectivity has been very useful in designing new improved alkylation catalysts based on zeolites.
In this way, the Mobil-Badger ethylbenzene process is based on the use of a ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst to produce ethylbenzene, for the production of styrene,by alkylation of benzene with ethylene.450 By an adequate choice of the benzene to ethylene ratio it is possible to limit the formation of diethylbenzene, and an overall yield of 99% of ethylbenzene is obtained.
Due to pore constraints medium-pore zeolites strongly limit the formation of coke, allowing cycles of up to 60 days between regenerations.
Product diffusion shape selectivity is responsible for the selective formation of p-ethyltoluene (97% of the three isomers formed) during the alkylation of toluene with ethene on modified ZSM-5 zeolites.451 Production of p-xylene by alkylation of toluene by methanol (TAM Process)452 is also based on the faster diffusion of the para isomer, with respect to 0- and m-xylenes, which enriches the product in the most desired p-xylene.
Longer chain olefins have also been used for selective formation of monoalkyl products.

However, zeolites are useless either to catalyze reactions at low temperatures or for processes requiring acidities stronger than Ha = -10.In those cases, other more acidic inorganic solid catalysts are needed, and the possibilities of het- eropoly acids and sulfated transition metal oxides will be discussed in the following sections.
C. Heteropoly Acids
1. Composition, Structure Preparation, and Textural
Properties Heteropoly compounds involve a large class of coordination-type salts and free acids which are formed by the condensation of more than two differ- ent types of oxoanions as for instance:
12W04'- +
HPOt- + 23H' -
PW,,04,3- + 12H'O
In this section the terms heteropoly compounds and heteropoly anions will be used for heteropoly acids (acid forms) and their salts.463-465 The anion contains a central atom, typically Si or P (Table 121, tetrahedrally coordinated to oxygens Coma

and surrounded by oxygen-linked hexavalent 2 - 18 peripheral metal atoms. These are usually Mo or W but can also be others such as V, Nb, Ta, single, or in combination. It is possible to prepare heteropoly anions with different structures.
The structure of the fundamental units is called the primary structure. Secondary structures are formed when the primary units are joined to form a solid. For instance, for the heteropoly anion with a Keggin structure466 the primary structure (Figure 21a) is formed by a central Po4 tetrahedron sur- rounded by 12 WO6 octahedra which are arranged in four groups of three edge-shared octahedra W3013.
These W3013 units linked by shared corners to each other and to the central PO4. In this case, the secondary structure is formed by packing the poly- anions into a bcc structure in which the protonated water dimer (HzO)zH+ is connected to four anions by hydrogen bonding at the terminal oxygen atoms of Figure 2 1 .

the anions (Figure 21b). Then, depending on the amount of hydration water and on the countercation,several crystallographic arrangements exist. For instance, the Keggin heteropoly acid H3PW12040 adopts different forms (Table 13), when hydration water content is changed from 5 to 29 molecules. In the case of heteropoly acids, the hydration water can be replaced by polar molecules, and as will be shown later this becomes crucial for the catalytic activity shown by solid heteropoly acids.
It can be said463 that the structures of the het- eropoly anions are governed by two general prin- ciples. Firstly each metal atom occupies a MO,coordination polyhedron in which the metal atoms are displaced, owing to the M-0 bonding, toward the polyhedral vertices that form the surface of the structure. The second principle establishes that structures with MO6 octahedra that contain three or more free vertices are in general not observed.467 Different techniques have been used to characterize the primary and secondary structure of heteropoly anions, in solution, as solids or supported on different carriers. In this way, IR s p e c t r o s  o p p   - can distinguish different types of oxygen atoms present in typical heteropoly acids, i.e., oxygen connecting species that binds central to peripheral atoms (Oc),bridging oxygens which bind adjacent peripheral atoms (Ob), and terminal species attached to a single peripheral atom (OJ. The IR spectrum of a Keggin anion (Figure 22)471 shows bands at 1064 and 1079,963 and 983, and 900-700 cm-l, which correspond to P-0, Mo=O and W-0 stretching bond vibrations,and to M-0-M bridging bond vibration, respec- tively. Laser Raman spectroscopy has also been used to study the structure of heteropoly compounds in s o l  t i o n    ,as well as in the form of solids, and s  p p o r t e d .    ,    , An example of a Raman spectrum of a solid heteropoly compound is given in Figure 23.Very similar spectra are obtained in solution, indi- 700 300 Wavenumber ( c m - ' )

Surface Raman scattering, useful for the characterization of heteropoly anions, is also a pow- erful technique to determine reactive species in "in situ" performed catalytic reactions, using the second- ary structures, and individual anions in dilute sup- ported systems.477>478 Most of the elements found in heteropoly acids have nuclides P3W,

Therefore, it is not surprising that NMR has been extensively used for the characterization of heteropoly compounds by matching their NMR spectra to those of standards whose structures have been previously determined by other methods such as X-ray or neutron diffrac- tion. NMR is also used to characterize their acidity,the state of adsorbed molecules, reaction intermedi- ates, and even the m i c r o p o r  s i t y .    - Other spec- troscopic methods such as visible and UV absorption and ESR are also used for the structure characteriza- tion, since they give indirect information about the bonding in heteropoly  o m p o  n d s .Heteropoly acids are synthesized under acidic conditions by apparently simple inorganic reactions of the type:

For instance, failure to recognize the hydrolytic instabil- ity of 12 molybdophosphoric acid and the formation of heteropoly species containing atomic ratios lower than 12 to 1 has led to the development of incorrect preparative procedures and misleading physicochem- ical results. Good results were obtained by either extraction of acidified solutions of sodium molybdate and sodium phosphate,512 or by a non-ether route, by boiling molybdenum trioxide and phosphoric a  i d .    , Details of the preparation procedures of heteropoly 590 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 Cor" Table 14.

P t 4 + acids and their salts in aqueous and non aqueous solutions, are given in a number of reviews and papers.515-526 In order to introduce an element into the frame- work during the synthesis of the heteropoly acid, it has to have ability to rapidly exchange coordination in solution between tetrahedral and octahedral;527 it should have a smaller size than that required for octahedral coordinated oxygen anions, and finally,elements supporting a high positive charge are required. The first characteristic indicates the ne- cessity of having soluble precursors for the synthesis of the heteropoly anions. The high positive charge is required to avoid an excess of negative charge on the anion, while the small size of the framework atoms allows the structure to achieve a stable form.
Strong ion-induced dipole forces between terminal oxygens and metal ions cause the exterior oxygens to be highly polarized toward the center of the complex, and consequently the protons are loosely attached, giving strong acidities. Moreover,it causes the good solubility in various solvents, and prevents condensation of the oxyanion monomers into infinite oxide lattices, giving instead discrete polyanions with definitive structures. Then, those requirements could be made more specific by noting that the framework atoms must have an ionic radius between 53 and 70 pm and a charge >4+.
In Table 14 the elements which meet those criteria are given.
With respect to the stability of heteropoly com- pounds, it can be said that the nature of the central atom is critical for the stabilization of the primary structure. The larger the central atom, the more stable the heteropoly anion structure is.52s In the case of the secondary structures, water molecules connect the individual heteropoly anions through weak hydrogen bonds. In the case of [PW12O40l3-, its radius is only 5-6 8, while the spacing between ions is -23 A,leaving therefore a considerable space between ions. From this arrangement it is not surprising that porous structures of considerable surface area can be formed by the loss of some crystallization water. In this way, it has been shown529 that the surface area of 1-12 molybdophos- phate H3[PMo120401 increases from 0.1 to 10 m2 g-l when subjected to a moderate heat treatment in a dry He stream.The amount of water and therefore the porosity and thermal stability can be controlled by formation of salts with different cations. In this way, Niiyama et al.530 have classified the salts into two groups on Table 15. Physical Properties o f

the basis of their solubility (group I and 11). The so called group I1 is hydrophobic and involves large monovalent cations (Table E),which interact strongly with the anions, and maintain a rigid structure,which resists solvation in water at high tempera- tures. Water associated with the cation is held strongly until the decomposition temperature is reached. Under these conditions zeolitic water is the only water lost from the structure, this giving surface area over 100 m2 g-l. In the case of salts of group I,hydration water is relatively easy to remove and then heteropoly ions are maintained close resulting in the absence of open pores and this gives surface area under 10 m2 g-l.
The effect of the ion-exchange procedure on the pore structure and morphology of the heteropoly salts has been studied by McGarvey and M  f f a t ,by means of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and X-ray powder diffraction. They have demonstrated that the ion-exchanged salts have microporous struc- tures, and the structure is retained after ion ex- change, and quantitative aspects of the structure are,for a given anion, largely controlled by the size and nature of the cation. It has to be remarked that the microporosity found in heteropoly oxometalates can play an important role in shape-selective catalysis.
However, considering the textural r e s  l t s    ,one should not expect to control pore size to the same extent as in zeolites since heteropoly oxometalates suffer from the disadvantage of having relatively broad pore size distributions, and consequently, the fraction of the surface area with potential shape selective effects will be considerably smaller than expected in a solid with pores of similar and uniform cross section.532 However, Bonardet et a1.533 have recently investigated the microporosity of 12 poly- oxometalate salts by the 129Xe NMR method proposed by Ito and F r a i  s a r d ,and they confirmed for NH4+,
K+,
and Cs+ salts the presence of microporosity, and found that it is homogeneous and organized. This is generated by the introduction of certain cations which leads to the translation or the rotation of the Inorganic Solid Acids Keggin anions in such a way that the interstitial volumes become interconnected, creating homoge- neous microporosity in which nonpolar molecules such as Xe can be adsorbed.533 It appears then, that the heteropoly acids salts of group I1 may offer interesting properties as catalysts considering their favorable textural properties. The group I heteropoly acid salts having the low surface area can be of interest in those reactions in which consecutive steps are to be avoided. In any case if required in large surface area form, they can be prepared by supporting the heteropoly acids on large surface area carriers.505,535-539 However solid sup- ports with surface basicity should not be used in order to avoid decomposition of polyanions.
2. Nature of Acid Sites
The pH values of aqueous solution of heteropoly acids indicate that they are strong acids, and their strong acidity is related to the large size of the polyanion having a low and delocalized surface charge density, causing a weak interaction between polyanion and proton. They present strong acidic properties also in the solid state and are very sensitive to countercations as well as the constituent elements of p o l y a n i o n  .    - The origin of the acidity in heteropoly oxyanions is multiple (Table 16).
In the case of heteropoly acids, protons are directly compensating for the negative charge of the anions.
The states of proton and crystallization water in the acid form were studied by high-resolution solid-state

NMR and IR,543 and by lH NMR.544 In the free polyanions in solution, bond length-bond strength correlations and 1 7 0

indicate that the preferred protonation sites are the bridging oxygen atoms which have a larger electron density than the terminal atoms. In solid state, as was mentioned above, the protons are involved in the formation of the crystal structure of the heteropoly acid, and in the protonation of the more accessible terminal oxygens leading to the H502+ species which links four neighboring heteropoly anions by forming hydrogen bonds with terminal W=O  oxygen:' Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 591 In the case of metal salts, different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of their acidity. In this way, and based on the correlation between catalytic activity of metal salts of dodecamo- lybdophosphoric acid in an acid catalyzed reaction (2- propanol dehydration) and the electronegativities of the metal cations (except for alkaline-metal salts), Niiyama et a1.548,549 have proposed that water coor- dinated to metal cations (Mn+) can become hydrolyzed generating H+: Mn+ + mH,O -

However, this mechanism, probably valid for cat- ions with a large charge to size ratio, i.e., relatively acidic cations, fails to explain the nature of acid sites generated when cations with low electronegativity,such as Ag+, are introduced. Nevertheless, it has been observed that in salts with reducible cations such as Ag+ and Cu2+,the presence of HZ enhances the carboniogenic activity. This was attributed to the formation of protons after the following cation reduc- tion:550,551 In the case of bulk dehydrated heteropoly anions it has been recently observed by 170 NMR of solid molybdophosphate, that the terminal oxygen atoms are the predominant protonation sites in the dehy- drated solid.536 Table 16.

This was later proved by pyridine adsorption on Ag3PW12040 and Cu3(PW12040)2 before and after treatment with H2.552 Before the H 2 treatment only the IR band at ca. 1445 cm-l associated to Lewis acid sites was observed, indicating the interaction of adsorbed pyridine with Ag+ and Cu2+ cations. The salts were then exposed for 1 h at 5.7 and 7.1 kPa,and at 300 "C to Hz and after that evacuated. The IR spectrum of adsorbed pyridine gave a band at ca. 1535 cm-l from pyridinium ions, thus indicating the presence of Bronsted acid sites formed in the reduc- tion reaction (see above).
The acid characteristics of heteropoly acids and their salts have been studied by many of the methods described above. Note that the acid strength of heteropoly acids cannot be determined by the indica- tor method, except for heteropoly tungstates which have only a weak color. In the case of 1-12 tung- stophosphoric acid HO > 8.2 was determined.553 At present, many efforts are devoted to the character- ization of the acidic properties of heteropoly acids by means of adsorption and thermal desorption of basic molecule- as well as by NMR.505 Stepwise thermal desorption of pyridine showed that a significant amount of protons from the bulk was still retained on H3PW1204 at 573 K. On the other hand, no pyridinium ions were detected on amorphous silica-alumina at this temperature.557 In general, the amount of acid sites in heteropoly anions has been titrated by  y r i d i n e   * -   O and ammonia.561 Figure 24562 shows the acidic properties of a series of heteropoly compounds measured by thermal de- sorption of pyridine absorbed at 25 "C. In those cases only pyridinium ions were detected, and the amount of pyridine hold by the solid after evacuation at 130 "C agrees with the number of protons present in the free acids. Moreover, the change in the amount of pyridine retained by the solid at different desorption 592 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 Corma Evacuation Temp. (C) Figure 24.
