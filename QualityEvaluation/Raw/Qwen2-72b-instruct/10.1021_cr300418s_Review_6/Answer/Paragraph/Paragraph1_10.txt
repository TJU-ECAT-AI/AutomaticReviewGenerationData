Computational methods, particularly Density Functional Theory (DFT) and cluster models, have become indispensable tools in the field of catalysis, offering deep insights into the complex mechanisms of catalytic systems. DFT, a quantum mechanical modeling method, is widely used to predict and understand the electronic structure of materials, including doped oxide catalysts. This approach enables researchers to simulate the interactions between catalysts and reactants, such as alkanes, at the atomic level, providing detailed information on reaction pathways, activation energies, and intermediates. Cluster models, on the other hand, simplify the computational task by representing a small portion of the catalyst surface, allowing for the study of surface reactions with reduced computational resources. Together, these computational approaches have significantly advanced our understanding of catalytic processes, particularly in the context of alkane activation, by doped oxide catalysts, facilitating the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for various industrial applications.
