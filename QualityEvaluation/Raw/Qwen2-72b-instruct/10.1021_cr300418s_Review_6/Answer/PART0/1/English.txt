Density functional theory (DFT) is essential for computational methods in catalysis due to its efficiency in handling large systems with numerous electrons, enabling the calculation of adsorption sites and reaction paths. However, standard GGA-DFT has limitations in accurately representing the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth metal oxides. The DFT+U method offers a temporary solution by adding a Hubbard-like correction to prevent orbital delocalization. Hybrid functionals like B3LYP and HSE are alternatives that improve accuracy by incorporating Hartree-Fock exchange energy. The inclusion of van der Waals interactions in DFT versions is beneficial but not commonly applied to oxides. The lack of precise binding energy data on clean oxide surfaces makes the accuracy of GGA-DFT in calculating total energy differences uncertain. Computational methods allow for the exploration of new catalytic materials that can then be synthesized experimentally. Computing accurately the catalytic properties of doped oxides requires detailed knowledge of the surface morphology and composition under reaction conditions. Small oxide cluster models can be used for more accurate quantum chemistry methods, although the catalytic activity of these clusters is size-dependent. Challenges include the uncertainty in GGA-DFT calculations for total energy differences, which are crucial for catalysis, and the need for corrections like DFT+U to prevent the delocalization of d- or f-orbitals. Hybrid functionals like B3LYP or HSE offer alternatives to GGA+U, but require more computational resources. Van der Waals interactions are often overlooked in GGA-DFT, affecting the accuracy of calculations for certain systems. Quantum calculations on heterogeneous catalysts often neglect spin-dependent terms, which can lead to issues in spin-forbidden transitions. Electron charge assignment in molecules is a debated topic in quantum chemistry. Despite these challenges, computational methods allow for the exploration of new catalytic materials that can be synthesized experimentally if they show promise.
