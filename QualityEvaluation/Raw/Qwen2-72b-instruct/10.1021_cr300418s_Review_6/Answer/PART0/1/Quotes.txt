          [3] "A temporary palliation is provided by the DFT+U method (165-167) in which a Hubbard-like correction is added to the DFT theory to prevent the delocalization of the d- or f-orbitals of the cations."
          [4] "An alternative to GGA+U is to use a hybrid functional such as B3LYP (177) or HSE. (178-186) Both methods add some HartreeFock exchange energy to the GGA functional."
          [5] "It is therefore preferable to use versions of DFT that include the van der Waals interaction, but this has been done infrequently for oxides."

          [10] "Experiments on gas-phase clusters (146) and on mass-selected clusters supported on solid surfaces (147-158) show that the catalytic activity of very small clusters depends strongly on their size."
