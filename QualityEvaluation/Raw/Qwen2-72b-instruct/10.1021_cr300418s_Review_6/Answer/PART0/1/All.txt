However, standard GGA-DFT has limitations in accurately representing the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth metal oxides. The DFT+U method offers a temporary solution by adding a Hubbard-like correction to prevent orbital delocalization. Hybrid functionals like B3LYP and HSE are alternatives that improve accuracy by incorporating Hartree-Fock exchange energy. The inclusion of van der Waals interactions in DFT versions is beneficial but not commonly applied to oxides. The lack of precise binding energy data on clean oxide surfaces makes the accuracy of GGA-DFT in calculating total energy differences uncertain. Computational methods allow for the exploration of new catalytic materials that can then be synthesized experimentally. Computing accurately the catalytic properties of doped oxides requires detailed knowledge of the surface morphology and composition under reaction conditions. Small oxide cluster models can be used for more accurate quantum chemistry methods, although the catalytic activity of these clusters is size-dependent. Challenges include the uncertainty in GGA-DFT calculations for total energy differences, which are crucial for catalysis, and the need for corrections like DFT+U to prevent the delocalization of d- or f-orbitals. Hybrid functionals like B3LYP or HSE offer alternatives to GGA+U, but require more computational resources. Van der Waals interactions are often overlooked in GGA-DFT, affecting the accuracy of calculations for certain systems. Quantum calculations on heterogeneous catalysts often neglect spin-dependent terms, which can lead to issues in spin-forbidden transitions. Electron charge assignment in molecules is a debated topic in quantum chemistry. Despite these challenges, computational methods allow for the exploration of new catalytic materials that can be synthesized experimentally if they show promise.", "Chinese": "密度泛函理论（DFT）在催化计算方法中至关重要，因为它在处理包含大量电子的大型系统时效率高，能够计算吸附位点和反应路径。然而，标准GGA-DFT在准确表示过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物的电子结构方面存在局限性。DFT+U方法通过添加类似Hubbard的校正来防止轨道离域，提供了一种临时解决方案。B3LYP和HSE等混合泛函是通过加入Hartree-Fock交换能量来提高准确性的替代方案。虽然包含范德华相互作用的DFT版本是有益的，但它们在氧化物中并不常见。由于在清洁氧化物表面上缺乏精确的结合能数据，GGA-DFT在计算总能量差时的准确性尚不清楚。计算方法允许探索新的催化材料，然后这些材料可以被实验合成。准确计算掺杂氧化物的催化性质需要对反应条件下的表面形态和组成有详细的了解。小型氧化物簇模型可以用于更精确的量子化学方法，尽管这些簇的催化活性取决于其大小。挑战包括GGA-DFT计算中对总能量差的不确定性，这对催化作用至关重要，以及需要像DFT+U这样的修正来防止d-或f-轨道的离域。B3LYP或HSE等混合泛函提供了GGA+U的替代方案，但需要更多的计算资源。GGA-DFT中往往忽略了范德华相互作用，这会影响某些系统的计算准确性。在异质催化剂上的量子计算通常忽略了自旋依赖项，这可能导致自旋禁止跃迁的问题。分子中原子电荷的分配是量子化学中一个有争议的话题。尽管存在这些挑战，计算方法允许探索新的催化材料，如果显示出前景，实验人员可能会尝试合成它们。", "Doi": "10.1021/cr300418s_6"},
