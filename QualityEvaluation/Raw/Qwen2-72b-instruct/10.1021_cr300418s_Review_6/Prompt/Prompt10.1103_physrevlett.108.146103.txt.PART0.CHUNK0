Density-Functional Theory with Screened van der Waals Interactions for the Modeling of Hybrid Inorganic-Organic Systems Victor G. Ruiz,1 Wei Liu,1 Egbert Zojer,2 Matthias Scheffler,1 and Alexandre Tkatchenko1 1Fritz-Haber-Institut der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Faradayweg 4-6, 14195, Berlin, Germany 2Institute of Solid State Physics, Graz University of Technology, Petersgasse 16, A-8010 Graz, Austria (Received 15 November 2011; published 6 April 2012) The electronic properties and the function of hybrid inorganic-organic systems (HIOS) are intimately linked to their interface geometry. Here we show that the inclusion of the many-body collective response of the substrate electrons inside the inorganic bulk enables us to reliably predict the HIOS geometries and energies. This is achieved by the combination of dispersion-corrected density-functional theory (the DFT van der Waals approach) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 073005 (2009)], with the Lifshitz-Zaremba-Kohn theory for the nonlocal Coulomb screening within the bulk. Our method yields geometries in remarkable agreement ( 0:1 A) with normal incidence x-ray standing wave measurements for the 3, 4, 9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (C24O6H8, PTCDA) molecule on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111) surfaces. Similarly accurate results are obtained for xenon and benzene adsorbed on metal surfaces.

PACS numbers: 68.35.p, 68.43.h, 73.20.Mf Hybrid inorganic-organic systems (HIOS) are essential ingredients of a wide range of emerging devices.
Applications in which such interfaces play a crucial role include (opto)-electronics (e.g., transistors, light-emitting diodes), organic photovoltaics, and sensors [1]. The inter- face geometry of HIOS plays a crucial role in the determi- nation of their electronic properties, and the accurate prediction of interface structure and stability is essential for controlling the function and quality of these highly sought-after technologies.
Within the possible variety of HIOS, 3,4,9,10-perylene- tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (C24O6H8, PTCDA) on coinage metals is one of the best experimentally and theoretically characterized systems.
The adsorption geometry of PTCDA on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111),has been accurately determined by means of the normal incidence x-ray standing wave (NIXSW) technique [24],making these systems a suitable choice for testing the predictive power of theoretical methods.
The reliable prediction of the equilibrium structure and dynamic properties of HIOS from first principles represent a great challenge to the state-of-the-art theoretical methods due to the interplay of covalent interactions, electron trans- fer processes, van der Waals (vdW) interactions, and Pauli repulsion. In particular, vdW interactions are fundamental in determining the structure and stability of organic mole- cules on solid surfaces [511]. Romaner et al. studied the adsorption of PTCDA on coinage metals [12], and concluded that a more accurate approach to include vdW interactions is needed.
To illustrate the problem, we start by comparing the performance of existing theoretical methods for the inter- action of PTCDA with Ag(111) in Fig. 1. The average adsorption distance (2.86 A ) is reliably known from a number of NIXSW studies for the ordered monolayer at room temperature (see Ref. [4] and references therein).
There is also an estimate of the adsorption energy of
2.4 eV by extrapolation from the 1,4,5,8-naphtalene-
tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (C14O6H4, NTCDA)

These error bars correspond to typical experimental error estimates.

0031-9007=12=108(14)=146103(5) 146103-1 Published by the American Physical Society molecule, which is closely related to PTCDA and experi- mentally accessible to temperature-programmed desorp- tion [10,13]. Using standard density-functional theory (DFT) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [14] functional results in no visible minimum in the binding curve [10]. The local-density approximation (LDA) under- estimates the binding distance ( 2:65 A), although it (fortuitously) yields a better adsorption energy [15]. The inclusion of vdW interactions using the vdW-DF nonlocal functional [16] leads to far off results both for the binding distance and the binding energy [10,12]. Interatomic pair- wise PBE-D correction by Grimme [17] appears to be closer to the experimental binding distance; the calculated binding energy is, however, by 1 eV larger than the above mentioned estimate. The interatomic pairwise PBE  vdW correction scheme [18], where the vdW coefficients and radii are determined nonempirically from the electron density, leads to a better prediction for the energy but it still overestimates the equilibrium distance by about
0.25 A
. Even the computationally most expensive calcu- lations using exact exchange with electron correlation treated in the random-phase approximation (with some additional approximations to make these calculations fea- sible) yield a 0.2 A overestimation in the equilibrium distance of PTCDA on Ag(111) [19].
In this Letter, we propose a method that extends standard pairwise vdW corrections [17,18] to the modeling of adsorbates on surfaces. Here, this is achieved by combin- ing the DFT  vdW scheme [18] with the Lifshitz- Zaremba-Kohn (LZK) theory for the vdW interaction between an atom and a solid surface [20,21]. In our approach (DFT  vdWsurf), the vdW energy correction to the DFT total energy is given by a sum of Cab
6 R6
ab terms,where Rab are the distances between atoms a and b, in analogy to the DFT-D and DFT  vdW methods. By employing the LZK theory, however, we include the many-body collective response (screening) of the substrate electrons in the determination of the C6 coefficients and vdW radii, going effectively beyond the pairwise descrip- tion. Interface polarization effects are accounted for via the inclusion of semilocal hybridization due to the dependence of the Cab 6 interatomic coefficients on the electron density in the DFT  vdW method. We show that nonlocal screen- ing reduces the vdW C6 coefficients by up to a factor of 4 for coinage metals. As indicated by the solid blue (light gray) line in Fig. 1 for the PTCDA/Ag(111) interface, DFT  vdWsurf indeed provides the most accurate results for the binding distance and energy when compared to all other theoretical methods. Similarly accurate results are found for PTCDA adsorbed on other coinage metals as well as for Xe and benzene on a range of metallic surfaces.
Beyond the region of orbital overlap, the vdW interac- tion of an atom a with a solid B is given by EvdW CaB 3 =Z  Z03, where Z is the distance from the vdW image plane Z0, and the CaB 3 is the corresponding vdW interaction coefficient [2022]. Zaremba and Kohn derived this formula starting from quantum mechanics, obtaining the following expression for the CaB 3 coefficient [20,21] CaB 3 @ 4
Z 1
0 d!i! "Bi!  1 "Bi!  1 ;(1) where i! is the polarizability of the atom a, and "Bi! is the dielectric function of the solid B. Equation (1) incorporates screening effects inside the bulk as it is evi- dent from its dependence on the dielectric function "Bi!.
A convenient approach to recover the LZK formula [22,23], is to determine the vdW interaction of an atom a with a solid B by a summation of Cab
6 =R6
ab pair potentials between the atom a and the atoms b in the infinite half- space of the solid B. In this case, the image-plane position is given as Z0  d=2, where d is the interlayer distance,and the CaB 3 coefficient is obtained as CaB 3 ns
6
Cab
6;LZK;
(2) where ns is the number of atoms per unit volume in the bulk.
Combining Eqs. (1) and (2), the screened Cab 6;LZK coeffi- cient is derived. It effectively inherits the many-body screening effects contained in CaB 3 from Eq. (1). The next step is to disentangle the heteronuclear Cab 6;LZK interaction coefficient into homonuclear Caa 6 and Cbb 6;LZK coefficients.
For this purpose, we adopt a Pade -approximant model for the atomic polarizability as in the DFT  vdW method [18]. The Pade -approximant model allows us to perform analytic frequency integration, leading to a simple combi- nation rule for Cab

:(3) The a 0 and b LZK correspond to the adsorbate atom and the effective atom-in-a-solid static polarizabilities, respec- tively. In the context of LZK theory, the frequency- dependent polarizability of the adsorbed atom is equivalent to the one of the free atom in the gas phase. Since accurate a 0 and Caa 6 values are known for the free atoms [24], the two parameters to be determined in Eq. (3) are b LZK and Cbb 6;LZK. We obtained them by solving a system of two equations [Eq. (3)] using any two atoms from the list: H, C, Ne, Ar, and Kr for a given solid B. The dielectric function "Bi! was calculated in terms of the absorptive part of the dielectric function "2 at real frequencies by the Kramers-Kronig relation. The data were taken from the reflection energy-loss spectroscopy (REELS) experiments by Werner et al. [25]. The LZK dispersion coefficients along with b LZK for an atom b inside the bulk correspond- ing to Cu, Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt metals, obtained with the above procedure, are shown in Table I. For comparison, the

146103-2 free atomic parameters are also displayed. The screened dispersion coefficients for atoms in the bulk are reduced by a factor of 1.5, 2, and 4 for Pd, Au, and Cu, respectively,and 3 for Ag and Pt compared to their free atom counter- parts. This clearly illustrates the sensitive dependence of the dielectric screening on the inorganic substrate. We note that both LZK parameters are essentially invariant to the nature of the adsorbed atom. Thus, they can be considered as intrinsic properties of the bulk.
The LZK theory is exact for atom-surface distances beyond orbital overlap. However, it does not include effects due to rapid spatial variations (interface polariza- tion) in the dielectric function close to the surface. We effectively include these contributions through the linkage of the LZK theory with the DFT  vdW method. Once the b LZK, Cbb 6;LZK, and Rb LZK are computed, the reference DFT  vdWsurf polarizability, C6, and vdW radius for the bulk atoms are set to those values. Nevertheless, these parameters change with the definition of a dimensionless effective volume vi eff for species i, in terms of the Hirshfeld partitioning of the electron density [26,27],vi eff R r3wirnrd3r R r3nref i rd3r
;(4) where wir is the Hirshfeld atomic partitioning weight of the species i, r3 is the cube of the distance from the nucleus of an atom i, nr is the total electron density, and nref i r is the reference electron density. For the solid, the reference corresponds to the spherical electron density of an atom in the bulk, and for a molecule, it corresponds to the free atom electron density. The effective Cii 6;eff coefficient is deter- mined as Cii 6;eff  vi eff2Cii 6;ref, the effective polarizability as i eff  vi effi ref, and the effective vdW radius, which determines the onset of the damping function, is calculated as Ri eff  i eff=i ref1=3Ri ref [18]. Significant interface po- larization is observed in the DFT  vdWsurf method when organic molecules are adsorbed on metals. For example,for the PTCDA molecule located at the experimental equi- librium position on Ag(111), the molecular C6;eff coeffi- cient is increased by 9% compared to the gas-phase PTCDA, while for the surface atoms it is decreased by 4% compared to the atoms inside the bulk (C6;ref).
To further benchmark the DFT  vdWsurf approach, we next calculated the binding energy curves for a rigid PTCDA molecule on Cu(111) and Au(111) surfaces.
These are shown together with the experimentally deter- mined average adsorption distances in Fig. 2 (Calculation details are included in the Supplemental Material [28].) The data for PTCDA on Ag(111) from Fig. 1 is also included for the sake of comparison. The first interesting observation comes from comparing the PBE  vdW and PBE  vdWsurf binding curves for PTCDA/Ag(111) in Fig. 1. The LZK correction leads to a reduced C6 coeffi- cient (see Table I), and yields significantly smaller long- range vdW energy. However, the vdW radii of Ag(111) atoms are also reduced, amounting to a larger vdW con- tribution at shorter range. These two effects modify the binding curve for PTCDA/Ag(111), leading to a reduced adsorption energy and a reduced adsorption distance com- pared to PBE  vdW. The same conclusions hold for the other coinage metals. As shown in Fig. 2, the equilibrium distances agree very well with the NIXSW results and also the adsorption energies reproduce the trend in the binding strength inferred from experiment: EadsCu > EadsAg > EadsAu [4].
It is well known that the PTCDA molecule is signifi- cantly distorted upon adsorption on Ag(111) and Cu(111).
Seeking to understand whether PBE  vdWsurf can also accurately reproduce the vertical distortion, we carried out structural relaxations of the PTCDA/Me(111) systems,where we allowed the atoms in the PTCDA molecules and in the top metal layer to relax. Figure 3 shows the

146103-3 average bonding distances of the carbon atoms and the carboxylic and anhydride oxygens for the relaxed geome- tries and compares them to experimental data where avail- able. The adsorption distance of the C backbone after relaxation agrees remarkably well with the experimental data to better than 0.1 A for Cu(111) and Ag(111), while an underestimation of  0:1 A is observed for Au(111). The slightly larger discrepancy observed for Au can be attrib- uted to the Au(111) surface reconstruction [29,30].
The position of the carboxylic oxygen (Oc) for PTCDA/ Ag(111) agrees with experiment to better than 0.1 A . Our calculations reproduce a distortion in the Oc of 0.13 A with respect to the C backbone due to the attraction to the surface, while the position of the anhydride oxygen (Oa) is underestimated by around 0.15 A . With respect to PTCDA/Cu(111), we observe that the oxygen atoms are placed at an averaged position of 2.62 A ; i.e., they reside below the C backbone, opposite to the findings of Gerlach et al. [2]. In addition, the Oc is located below the C back- bone, while the Oa is located above it. Our calculations for different monolayer structures show that the vertical posi- tion of the oxygen atoms in PTCDA/Cu(111) is sensitive to the lateral placement of the molecules in the unit cell, and we will present further analysis in forthcoming work [31].
Nonetheless, the overall agreement between the geome- tries derived from NIXSW data and DFT  vdWsurf is within 0.1 A .
In order to test the applicability of the DFT  vdWsurf method to systems other than PTCDA/Me(111), we calcu- lated the relaxed geometry for Xe and benzene on a variety of metallic surfaces. Also for these systems, the DFT vdWsurf approach leads to a good agreement in the adsorp- tion distances and interaction energies compared to avail- able data as shown in Table II. In the case of Xe/Me(111),we find that the top and fcc hollow adsorption sites are practically degenerate. For Xe/Pt(111), measurements show that, at low coverage, the diffussion barrier for lateral movement of the Xe atoms on the surface is less than 10 meV [40]. We report the Xe-surface distance for the top site because it is experimentally determined as the most stable one. For Xe/Pt(111), the PBE  vdWsurf method also yields an accurate vibrational energy of 3.4 meV compared to the experimental value of 3.7 meV [41].
Detailed analysis of this problem will be presented in a forthcoming publication [42].
In summary, we have combined the DFT  vdW method with the Lifshitz-Zaremba-Kohn theory, leading to a promising method (DFT  vdWsurf) that can accu- rately describe the structure and energetics of HIOS. For nonmetals, the DFT  vdWsurf theory is equivalent to using screened reference parameters for an atom in a solid as recently presented by some of us [43]. The DFT  vdWsurf method has the same cost as the under- lying DFT calculation, and does not depend on the nature of the surface, being equally applicable to insulators, semi- conductors, and metals.

Comparison between the experimental binding distances [3,4] (with typical error bars shown in paren- theses) and the calculated distances in the present work for PTCDA on Cu(111) (a), Ag(111) (b) and Au(111) (c). The distances are measured as an average over the constituent atoms of the two molecules in the unit cell (carbon, anhydride oxygen,and carboxylic oxygen) with respect to the unrelaxed topmost metallic layer. The structure of PTCDA is also displayed in (d).
PTCDA/Cu(111) shows a distortion in the carboxylic oxygen atom, which is in agreement with a low coherent fraction for the carboxylic oxygen atom as reported for the NIXSW experiment in [2]. Calculation details are included in the Supplemental Material [28].

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
