Laboratory of Physical Chemistry, Materials Science Center, University of Groningen, The therlands (Received 21 May 1976) The
LMM
Auger spectra of Cu, Zn, Cia,and Ge are presented and discussed.
Transition probability calculations are described and with these a clear assignment of the peaks can be made. Ii is further shown that from the L3M,&M4, Auger lines the term splittings and the effective on-site electron-electron interaction can be determined.
The latter is shown to be strongly reduced from the free-atom value, This has important consequences for the description of the band structure using one-electron theories.

I. INTRODU(:TION
High-resolution QMM Augex' meRsul'emBDts of the transition metals axe extremely important for an understanding of electron correlation effects in 4-band metals.In R recent paper' we have discus- sed this in some detail.It wiH. become clear that from the J.,MM,, Auger spectra the effective Coulomb interaction U,between two 3d holes on the same site can be determined.U, is strongly reduced from the iree-atom va, lue because of elec- tronic as well as lattice polarization effects.This reduction can in fact exceed the ordinary Coulomb interaction leading to the formation of "bipolarons. " The relative magnitude of U,a,s compared to the one-electron valence bandwidth I" is of utmost im- portance in a number of problems.
It is well known from Hubbard's papers' that for U, I' the ma- terial will behave like a strongly correlated meta. l for a, less than haU-filled nondegenerate band and for a nondegenerate half-filled band like a Mott- Hubbard insulator.For U, I' the material will behave much like an ordinary metal.The one- electron bandwidth can be studied by x-ray photo- electron spectroscopy (XPS) and U., can be de- termined for 3d transition metals from the I,,M,M5 Auger lines.Also for a description of transition-metal im- purities in metals U, is a. very important quan- tity.It, for example,appears in the Anderson Hamiltonian' describing virtual bound states Rnd tI16 appeRx'ance Rnd size of locRllzed ITlagnetlc mo- ments.The size of the magnetic moments is also dependent on the exchange interactions.These can be determined from the term splittings of the
I.,M45M4, Auger lines.
For the d-band structure and localized moments ln 3d tx'Rnsltlon metal. s Ueff ls Rlso extremely im- portant.For U, I' one can justify a one-elee- tron band-structure description.For U, T' one must resolt to mod6ls whicll 1Delude the on-site correlations as, for example,is done in the mini- mum pola, rity model." In this model the cha, rge on any particular site is not allowed to fluctuate by more than one electron.
Before dealing with the above theories one must have a, detailed understanding of. the various Auger processes and one must be able to make a. clear assignment of. the various peaks and satellite structure in these spectra, . The purpose of. this pRper Rnd R one to follow ls to show that fox' Cu Zn, Qa, and Ge in which the 3d States are full the Auger spectra, ean be understood in detail.Since high-resolution L,MM Auger speeix'R of transition metals have become available several papers have been publi hed tc account for absolute kinetic energies of the Auger electrons and multi. - plet structure.These results indicate that a. Satis- factory assignment can be made by considering the problem in an atomic rather than a, solid-state way, Absolute klDetle energies for the J jg@Af45 Auger electrons in Cu and Zn were calculated by Kowalczyk eI aI', .' Their approach has very recent]y been improved by Hoogewijs et at. ,"who intro- duced a hitherto neglected term in the extra-atomic 1elaxRilon energy.
Recently detailed transltlon- probability calculations have been carried out for the J.MM Auger spectra of Se,"and for the .LM,.M, Auger spectrum of Cu,' and atomic Zn." In this paper we have calculated the transition pl obabillties of Rll flDRl-8tRte terms 1D the

As mill be shown the intensity ratios can be deter- mined from the L, and L, core-level widths in the XPS spectrum.

II. EXPERIMENTAL
The x-ray photoelectron and x-ray excited Auger spectra were collected with an AEI-ES 200 spec- trometer using a Mg Ka source with a linewidth of 0.7 eV.
In one case (Ge) monochromatized Al Kn radiation was used with a linewidth of about
0.4 ep. This was required
for Qe because the Mg En radiation is almost at the energy threshold for the Ge L, photoelectrons thereby decreasing the intensity ratio I /I . The use of the monochro- 2 3' mator is the reason for the relatively bad signal to noise ratio in the Qe Auger lines.The spectra were obtained of foils clamped on a copper sample holderattemperaturesof 20 C for Cu, Zn,and Qe and O'C for Ga. The spectrometer was evacuated to better than 10 ' Torr and the data were collected with a POP 8 computer.Before the spectra were taken the samples were cleaned by cycles of argon ion etching and heating,except for Ga which could not be heated because of its low melting point and therefore was cleaned by etching only.After this treatment the ratio of the heights of the 0 1s and C 1s lines as compared to the L, lines was for all metals less than 3/p and for Cu less than l%%u.There also was no evidence of shoulders on the photoelectron lines indicating the absence of any oxidation.All spectra were corrected for the energy-dependent transmission of the analyzer and for scattered electrons.In the former correction the transmission of the analyzer including the re- tarding lens system is assumed to be inversely proportional to the kinetic energy of the electrons as has been derived by Helmer et a/." In the cor- rection for the scattered electrons the probability (n) that a scattered electron suffers an energy loss is assumed to be independent of the amount of en- ergy loss.
Since the measurement is done at dis- creet points (E,.) in the energy distribution,we can write Here I(E) and I"(E)are the corrected and mea- sured intensities at kinetic energy Eand o. is de- termined iteratively in a computer program de- veloped for this purpose.

The importance of the corrections is displayed in Fig. 1 where the corrected as well as the uncorrected L,3M 3M23 spectrum of Cu is shown as an example.
III. THEORY
The kinetic energy of LMM Auger electrons can be written"
E(L,MM; X) = E(L,)
E(Mq)
E(M,)
F(M M,;X)+R(M M;X) . (l) Here E(L,), E(M,), and E(M,) are the core-level binding energies mhich can be determined by XPS.
F(M,M,;X) describes the Coulomb energy of the holes created in the Mb and M, levels.
It is depen- dent on the final state term X of this two-hole configuration and can be expressed as the sum of Slater's direct and exchange integrals. " When spin-orbit interaction is considerable F has to be calculated in the intermediate coupling scheme rather than in LS coupling.
R(M, M,;X), often called the total relaxation energy,is the additional relaxation energy due to the two-hole final state above and beyond the sum of the two one-hole re- laxation energies.
These latter values are in- cluded in E(M,) and E(M,). We can also lump the last two terms into one which is then a directly measured quantity

U,(M, M,;X) is the total additional energy re- quired to excite two holes M, and M, on the same atom for the final state term X above and beyond the two one-hole excitation energies.
U, is then the effective Coulomb interaction of the two holes on one site reduced from the free-atom value by extra-atomic or band polarization.
It should be noticed that we are at present not concerned with the various contributions to the relaxation energy which have been discussed by Hoogewijs et nf." but primarily with the effective two-hole Coulomb interaction.
Auger processes result from radiationless tran- sitions that arise from the electrostatic interac- tion between two electrons in an atom initially singly ionized.
The pxobability of such a transi- tion is given by perturbation theory "23"23"23 23 23 a5 l

(3) can be separated into radial and angular factors." The calculation of these factors leads to the transition probability a.s a function of the final-state term X (see Appendix).
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIDN
In Fig. 2 the three main parts of the I.
MM Auger spectra of Cu, Zn, Ga, and Qe are shown.
There is a strong resemblance between the speetxa of the different metals although certain differences ean be noticed.
One can see that the relative intensity of the I2MM Rs coIDpRx'ed to the LSMM portloQ in- creases as one goes fx'om Cu to Qa, having a value of about & in the latter metal and staying approxi- mately constant on going to Ge. The increase of the L,/L, , intensity ratio in the Auger spectra on going from Cu to Qa ean be explained very satis- factory by considering a L,,I.,M4, Coster-Kronig process,which has a decreasing probability on golQg from Cu to QR becRuse of the following.The necessary condition for this process to appear is that the L,,-L, energy difference must exceed the binding energy of the M4, electron,in the presence of the L,, hole.This condition is easily satisfied for Cu. For Zn the M4, binding energy is close to threshold for this process.""For Ga and Ge the M4, binding enex'gy is too large for the Coster- Kronig process to occur." Therefore in Cu and Zn R fraction of the prlmarlly ex'eRted L2 holes decays via this Coster-Kronig process,which in turn leads to a reduction in the L, part of the I.
MM
Auger px'oeesses as compared to the I., part.The satellites on the low-kinetic-energy side of the I,M4, M4, region which appear only in Cu and Zn ean also be explained as being a result of the
LI.
,M45 Coster-Kronig process." Aftex this process has taken place the created I., hole can decay via the normal L,,MMAuger process,except that the initial state now already has a hole in the M4, level, created in the Coster-Kronig px'o- cess. This means that the I,M4, M4, Auger pro- cess in this case ends up in a final state with three M45 holes instead of two M45 holes in the nox'mRl case. The difference between this Coster-Kronig preceded L,,MMprocess and the common
I.,MMprocess gives rise to a shift to lower
kinetic energy of the former one because of the Coulomb interaction between the Auger electrons and the extra M4, hole.
A more detailed discus- sion of this subject including the effect of the
I.,I.,M4, Coster-Kronig
process on the I. photo- electx'on spectrum will be published in a second pRper.Aside from these differences all of the spectra exhibit several peaks which are a result of final state tex'm splittings.The final states possible are '8, 'P, 'D, 'I', and '6 in the L,MMspec- trum corresponding to two d holes.For the
I. MM4, process the final-state terms are 'P',
cess we find the terms '8, 'P, Rnd 'D.IQ ordex' to identify the peRks %'101 the various flQRl-stRte terms,transition probabilities ax e required.Vfe calculated these in the j-j and LS coupling scheme 1672

for the initial and final state,respectively.
The details are given in the Appendix.
For the free- electron wave function we first tried plane waves but we were not able to get reasonable agreement with the spectra.
We then resorted to radial in- tegrals given by McGuire, "in which the free- electron wave function is modified close to the atom because of the interaction with the positive charge left behind.
As will be discussed shortly these transition probabilities result in surprisingly good agreement with experiment.
The calculated transition probabilities are given in Table I. The fact that the plane-wave functions are not at all satisfactory is interesting in itself.
It shows that the interaction between the outgoing electron and the hole left behind even at kinetic energies of about 1000 eV is far from negligible.
This is a strong indication that the sudden approximation usually used in XPS and Auger spectroscopy is probably not valid.
It can be seen from the cal- culations given in Table I that there is little quali- tative and certainly no quantitative relation between the transition probability and the multiplicity of the corresponding final-state term.
The calculated transition probabilities of the final-state terms in the L,MM45 Auger process of Cu are in very good agreement with those obtained by Roberts et Ql.
To display the excellent agreement between theory and experiment we show in more detail the L3M45M$5 spectrum of Ga in Fig. 3. For this metal there are no additional complications due to Coster- Kronig processes.
We fitted this spectrum with the constraint that the intensity ratios of the terms were given by the theoretically calculated transi- tion probabilities.
The widths of the term peaks were constrained to be equal.
The line shape of each peak was taken to be the sum of Lorentzian

(4) we see that the term splittings are detexmined by the E' Rnd E4 Coulomb integrals.The fit in Fig. 2 was determined by leaving E' Rnd E as free parameters. %'6 see that the result of this fit is exceptionally good considering that the calculated intensities mere used.It seems that the only significant deviation vrhich occurs is that the theory predicts a slightly higher 'E intensity (the peak on the high-kinetic-energy side of the spec- trum) than is observed.From the fit we obtained vridths of 1.4 6V for the various lines and a line 30- shRpe with 3 Lorentzlan Rnd 3 QRusslan character The values obtained for E' and E4 for Cu, Zn, Qa,and Qe are given in Table II and are seen to be close to the free-atom values obtained from Mann, " except for the E' integrals of Cu and Zn.This is due to the fact that for these thoro metals the exper- imental E' Rnd E' integrals frere obtained from the I.,MMAuger spectrum because of the pro- nounced influence of the I,,I.,M, Coster-Kronig process on the LM M45psetr cumas was mentioned before.In the L,2M4, M4, spectrum of Cu and Zn vre see that the '8 final state has an anomalously high intensity.It is possible that for these metals the peak in the '8 region originates from some other process,thereby causing a large uncertainty in the position of the real 'S final state and there- fore in the '8-'G term splitting.The experimental E integral is mainly determined by this splitting,vrhereas the E' integral is mainly determined by the 'E-'G term splitting [see Kgs.

Ga and Ge (as is well known from their XPS spec- tra the ylasmon satellites for Cu and Zn have negligible intensiti. es) and the Auger peaks involv- ing the M, level.
Because of the presence of all these extra peaks it is not possible to do a de- tailed fit to the I.MMand LMM, Auger spectra in a way as was done for the I3M45M45 spectrum of Ga (Fig. 3). However,just as for the
I.,MMAuger spectra the experimental
yeak positions of the most prominent lines in the 3M,3M, 3 spectra can be used to determine F which is the only Coulomb integral involved in the peak splittings in this process." Values for this integral together with the calculated free-atom values from Mann" are listed in Table II. For the L 23 M23 M45 case only the 'F- D term sp litting can be determined experimentally.Because the theo- retical splitting of these terms is a sum of F', G',and G' integrals' and the spin-orbit coupling con- stant $,"no explicit values for these integrals can be obtained from the spectrum.
However,the theoretica, l splitting calculated using Mann's in- tegrals is shown to be in very good agreement with experiment (Fig. 4}, so we may expect them to be good for this process.In contrast to the F' and F' values obtained from the L3M45M45 Auger spectra (Table II}the E' values for the L, MM spectra (Table II) are much larger than the atomic values.The reason for this is not clear.How- ever, it should be noted that the calculated Cou- lomb integrals are for the neutral atom.It may be that for the final state with two M holes the Coulomb integrals are considerably higher be- TABLE VI.

cause the wave functions are somewhat less ex- tended.
At the moment we are more interested in the I.,M4, MAuger process because the interest- ing physical properties of the transition metals are determined mainly by the 3d electrons.
For that purpose we consider the effective Cou- lomb interaction U,which we introduced in the theoretical section.For the 'G final state in the L3 M45 M45 Auger process it has the form en(M45M&5i G}=+(M45M45i

In Table VI the values for F (calculated using Mann's table" ) and ft (from Table IV) are listed.
From this table we see that 8 strongly reduces the Coulomb interaction between the two Mholes.
The question now arises a.s to how much of this reduction is atomic and how much comes from the fact that the atom is in a solid.

for this part.
Here E, Eand E2,are total energies of the metal in different ionization states and E(L) and E(M) are core-level binding ener- gies.
The total energies mere calculated using a numerical Hartree-Fock method.
For E2, the '" final- state term was taken.
The calculations were done on ions stripped off the 4s and 4p electrons,i.e., for Ge the states (Ar) Sd", Sd', and Sd' were calculated.The results are also listed in Table VI. From this table we see that the atomic part Bofthe total relaxation energy B is small and almost constant for the four materials,indi- cating a large contribution coming from the sur- rounding atoms and valence electrons.The values are in good agreement with the value of 'l.2 eV which Weightman et al'.' found for the atomic part of the total relaxation energy (aside from the outer shell) in Se.As mentioned in the Introduction the size of U,ff (also given in Table VI) as compared to the one- electron bandwidth I' is very important in deter- mining the physical properties of the transition metals and their compounds.If U, is larger than tmice this bandwidth,the two-hole states,where the two holes are on the same atom,will fall out- side of the two-hole states where the holes are on different atoms.The result of this is that the ma- terial mill no longer behave like a one-electron metal and electron correlations mill be important As will be shown in a subsequent paper this is also the condition for obtaining atomiclike Auger line- widths.Band effects in the Auger spectra will ap- pear for U,  2 I".Since U,can be determined from the Auger spectra and also the one-electron bandwidth I'can be obtained from XPS it is in- formative to plot U,and 2 l versus atomic

This is shown in Fig. 5 for the metals Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, and Ge. The experimental data for Fe, Co, and Ni used to obtain U, for these metals were determined by us from the x-ray photoelec- tron and x-ray excited Auger spectra,in the same way as was done for Cu, Zn, Qa, and Ge.
