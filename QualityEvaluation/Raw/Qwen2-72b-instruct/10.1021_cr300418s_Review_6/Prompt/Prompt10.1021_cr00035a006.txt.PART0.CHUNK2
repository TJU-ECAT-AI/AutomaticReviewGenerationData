It appears that partial substitution of H+ by Na+ decreases both the number and strength of the acid sites. In general, the acidity increases with increas- ing cation electronegativity. However, caution must be paid when the acidity of salts is compared since they are sensitive to slight changes in stoichiometry,reduction of the metal ion, hydrolysis during prepa- ration and the degree of hydration.563 It appears then that heteropoly compounds have a relatively large number of strong acid sites (mainly of Bronsted type), which are accessible to bases.
More specifically, it has recently been presented564 that CSH-PWIZOO is a superacid and its perfor- mance can be modified by changing the extent of Cs substitution. Figure 25 provides a comparison of the relative acid strength of some solid superacids.
Therefore, especially the high surface area materials should provide new opportunities for using them as solid acid catalysts in hydrocarbon reactions.

)* type catalysis. The former occurs on those com- pounds which are able to adsorb reactants only on the external surface. In this way hydrocarbons are adsorbed in amounts lower than that corresponding to the monolayer. In the case of bulk type catalysis,the heteropoly compound can take up polar molecules in amounts which correspond to more than 100 surface In case the uptake of polar molecules such as alcohols, ethers, and amines gave integral multiples of the number of protons, and the rate of their adsorption was primarily determined by the polarity and secondarily by the molecular size (Figure 26).565 The amount adsorbed can be con- trolled by changing the cation in the salts.567 Considering the bulk adsorption properties, it turns out that catalytic reactions involving polar molecules occur not only at the surface but also in the bulk solid of certain heteropoly acids. The practical effect of this is that the catalytic system behaves like a highly concentrated solution. This explains why these solids have been named pseudo liquid. Under such circumstances all the acid sites are available to the reactants and therefore high catalytic activity could be expected. A schematic diagram of the two types of catalysis is given in Figure 27. The pseudoliquid phase is characterized by uniformity, mobility, three- dimensional reaction field, and other qualities which are very convenient in the study of the catalytic phenomena by using in situ characterization tech- niques. In this way, Misono and O k  h a r a have detected by NMR and IR spectroscopies several reaction intermediates during the dehydration of ethanol in pseudoliquid. The comparison of the chemical shift of the hydroxyl proton of the dimer species (C2H50H)2Hf detected in H3PW12040 and in HS03F-SbF5, supports the idea that H3PW12040 is a superacid.
After all this it is not surprising that heteropoly compounds have found large and practical applica- tions in olefin and acetylene hydration, as well as in dehydration of alcohols.

- - - their salts. On these materials the diffusivities of different alcohols have been measured in a series of heteropoly acids and the results are compared to those obtained in a ZSM-5 zeolite (Table 17).531 It has been observed there that the diffusivity of n- alcohols decreases with the decrease of their molec- ular weight, and furthermore the hydrogen bonding has a substantial influence on diffusivity. Indeed,while in ZSM-5 the pore size restriction may be dominant it is apparent that in the large-pore het- eropoly compounds the electric field potential plays an important role.
As was said before, owing to the flexible nature of the acid forms and of some salts, alcohols are readily absorbed into the bulk by substituting water mol- ecules and/or by expanding the distance between polyanions. Under such circumstances the system behaves like a concentrated solution ("pseudoliquid phase"), and corresponds to a bulk-type catal- ysis.5609563,569-571 If this is so, the reaction should take place in the three-dimensional bulk solid, and a catalyst effectiveness factor close to unity should be expected. Therefore, the rate of reaction should be proportional to the catalyst weight regardless of its specific surface area. Indeed, a linear correlation between the catalytic activity of a series of heteropoly compounds and their bulk acidity has been found and the results are given in Figure 28.560 A kinetic proof of the bulk type catalysis for dehydration of 2-pro- ;i i

Moreover, the amount of absorbed molecules depends on the partial pressure of ethanol, and the reaction proceeds in the catalyst bulk phase.

On this basis the following reaction mechanism has been proposed:574 Corma This mechanism is not only consistent with the general knowledge and with the intermediate species detected, but can also explain the depen- dence of ethylene and ether selectivities on the partial pressure of C2H50H.577,578 The activity of heteropoly compounds in the alcohol dehydration reaction is much higher than that of s i l i  a - a l u m i n a    * and their activity strongly de- pends on the temperature of the pretreatment,580 on the amount and nature of the cations in the salts,567,568 and, if supported, on the nature of the support Indeed, the type of cation, size, and its electronegativity does not only change the number of acid sites but also can dramatically change the absorption capability of the original heteropoly acid causing, in the limit, the alcohol dehydratior, reaction to occur at the surface of the salt instead of in the bulk phase. Besides being a source of protons, the interaction between the reactant and the heteropoly anion of the catalyst can be important for the overall process, as demonstrated by the catalytic action of the chiral 2- 18 molybdophosphate. Indeed, this catalyst has been shown to promote the acid- catalyzed reaction of nonchiral benzyl alcohol to chiral plybenzyl.
The chirality of the products shows that the interaction between the reactant and the heteropoly anion plays an important role in the formation of the final product. It has been reported that when heteropoly acids are supported on silica,alumina, or activated carbon, they strongly interact with the support surface thus changing their be- havior505,581-584 and acting as a condensed solution at the surface of the support.585 Recently, Hashimoto et al.583 have obtained a supported heteropoly acid PW, highly dispersed by intercalation into a Zn aluminum carbonate hydroxide by an anion-exchang- ing technique. This was a very active catalyst for the dehydration of n-butanol having the turnover numbers for the intercalated PW/Zn-AI catalyst twice of the unsupported PW12 heteropoly acid.
In conclusion, it turns out that heteropoly acids are very adequate alcohol dehydration catalysts, owing to their very special absorption properties for polar molecules. Furthermore, their activity and selectiv- ity can be tailored by introduction of metal cations and by changing the partial pressure of the reactant.
There is no doubt that if a catalyst is highly active for a given reaction (dehydration), it should also be very active for the opposite reaction (hydration of olefins to alcohols),provided that the reaction condi- Table 18.

isobutene liq 56 1984 Cq separation (aq-Cd (ConcHPA) tions are adequate. This basic catalytic principle is clearly illustrated by the case of heteropoly acids, on which industrial hydration processes of C3-C4 olefins have been developed (Table 18).586 Using this type of catalysts, isopropyl alcohol was produced by hy- dration of propylene (Tokuyama Soda) with a conver- sion of 70% and selectivity of 99%.587-590 The use of heteropoly acids in this process avoids the use of sulfuric acid, with the corresponding advantage in waste stream disposal.The hydration of isobutene is carried out selectively in the presence of n-butene in a highly concentrated aqueous solution (0.05-0.8 M) of 12 heteropoly acids at 60-80 "C. The isobutene hydration is so selective that it allows separation of butenes present in the
C
4 streams produced by steam or catalytic cracking.
When the process is carried out in a multistage reactor, isobutene is 100% converted, while less than 1% of the n-butene is hydrated. In this case the heteropoly acid not only acts as a strong acid catalyst but is also capable of increasing the solubility of butenes while stabilizing the reaction intermediates by the coordination to the p  l y a n i o n .
The competi- tive coordination of isobutene, n-butene, and water to polyanions promotes the high selectivity for isobutene hydration.
The kinetic expression for hydration of isobutene when using heteropoly acids as catalysts continu- ously increases from first to second order:rate = K[polyanion][protonl[isobutenel = = K[polyacid12[isobutenel While in the case of mineral acids a first-order dependence is found.Finally, it should be remarked that in this process the decomposition of heteropoly acid was suppressed by partial reduction of Mo or W and by coexistence of organic base with phosphoric acid, rendering the catalyst life longer and decreasing corrosion.Another way of separation of isobutene from mixed C4 hydrocarbon streams, such as Raffinate-1,involves the use of heteropoly acids in the etherification of the
C
4 mixture with diols, such as ethylene glycol or 1,2- propylene glycol, to obtain the corresponding glycol mono-tert-butyl ethers. This is followed by deetheri- fication of monoether at higher temperatures to yield pure isobutene and the regenerated For this process heteropoly acids dispersed on group I

oxides, such as 12 tungstophosphoric acid on titania, are the adequate catalysts.592 Inorganic Solid Acids Esterification and Hydrolysis. Esterification of alcohols with saturated and unsaturated acids is a reaction of industrial importance. Liquid-phase acid catalysts such as sulfuric acid,p-toluenesulfonic acid
(PTSA),
methanesulfonic (MSA), hydrochloric acid,etc. have been used. They however produce waste products as well as undesired byproducts such as ethers and olefins. For certain esterifications, non- acidic tetrabutyltitanates and -zirconates produce lower amounts of byproducts than the liquid acids,but their activity is much lower than that of the Bronsted acids.593 In this sense heteropoly acids performed well for simple esterifications with car- boxylic a  i d s .    - Izumi and Urabe594 have ob- tained 95% of conversion and 100% selectivity for the esterification of acetic acid with ethanol to form ethyl acetate, at 150 "C and 1 atm.
Heteropoly acids may have the following advan- tages compared to other catalysts: the absence of byproducts produced in reactions of the conjugated base of the acid; the high activity which allows one to work at low temperature; the possibility to adjust their acidity by varying the counterion or by varying the heteroatoms or metal atoms; and the possibility to recycle the catalyst by acidifymg the alkaline wash water followed by extraction with the feed alcohol.
The catalytic activity for esterification is similar to that of HzS04 and PTS, suggesting that these catalysts were equally strong in solution due to the leveling effect of the basic reactant (Table 19).598 However, for the hydrolysis of isobutyl propionate the catalytic activities of heteropoly acids were 60- 100 times higher than those of H2SO4 and PTSA.598 The performance of the heteropoly acids for esteri- fication of alcohols can be improved by supporting the heteropoly acids on activated carbon. This not only increases the catalyst life,but also the formation of the corresponding ether is remarkably sup- pressed.594 Heteropoly acids were used as catalyst for the production of phthalic acid diesters in the acid catalyzed diesterification of phthalic anhydride and the corresponding alcohols. The reaction proceeds in two stages. For instance, in the diesterification of phthalic anhydride with 2-ethylhexan01: Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 595 Table 19.

The first step is a fast and complete reaction of the anhydride with one molecule of alcohol, proceeding without the addition of catalyst. The second stage is the esterification of the resulting monocarboxylic acid with a second molecule of alcohol while forming one molecule of water. The equilibrium is shifted by the continuous removal of water.
The kinetics of the esterification reaction on het- eropoly acids is given by the following equation:and the reaction shows a lower activation energy on heteropoly acids than on HzS04 or PTSA. This allows the reaction to be performed at lower temperatures (100-120 "C) using the heteropoly acids catalyst with the corresponding low rate of formation of ethers and olefins. Ether formation depends on the structure of the alcohol, being lower for bulkier alcohols in agreement with a S N mechanism. On the other hand the size of the alcohol has little effect on the rate of esterificatin.
In order to achieve better catalyst recovery, the reaction has been carried out on heteropoly acid supported on carbon, silica, alu- mina, and titania,599fj00 but in all cases leaching of the heteropoly acid was found, together with a decrease in the catalyst activity.
In conclusion, it appears that heteropoly acids are active and selective catalysts for carrying out both,esterification and hydrolysis reactions providing that reaction temperature could be kept low in order to diminish dehydration reactions. When this is achieved then the removal of water in order to shift the equilibrium becomes difficult unless the reaction is carried out at very low pressure, or in the presence of a cosolvent forming an azeotrope with water, which has lower boiling temperature.599 Finally, complete recovery of the catalyst will be required if these reactions are to be used in practice.
Isomerization Reactions. Double-bond isomer- ization in olefins is a well-known acid-catalyzed reaction which involves the Bronsted sites of the catalyst. For instance, in the case the double-bond isomerization of n-butene a protonation of the double bond occurs in an initial step and a see-butyl cation is frmed.Ol-O The heteropoly acid will be in this case a supplier of the acid site, and any acidity modification may affect the catalytic activity. It has been found604 that the nature of the central atom (Si or P) has little influence on the activity of heteropoly 596 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 Coma olefins.5371610-613 In this area the pioneer work was done by Sebulsky et a1.,610 who reported the alkyla- tion of benzene with 1-dodecene on a bench scale using a series of supported silicotungstic acid cata- lysts, with the purpose of producing a precursor of a biodegradable linear alkyl benzene sulfonate. The use of a solid catalyst such as the supported het- eropoly acid should have sound environmental and technical advantages over more conventional cata- lysts such as aluminum chloride or hydrogen fluoride.
Kinetic studies show that the following reactions occurred on the silicotungstic acid supported on A l 2 0 3 ,  SiO2, and SiO2-Al203: Table 20. First Reduction Potentials of Various Heteronolv Acids compound first red. potential (eV) -

molybdates, but it does have (Si < P) in the case of heteropoly tungstates. Interestingly, the value of the first reduction potentials of these compounds cor- relates very well with their catalytic activity (Table 20),which may indicate that for heteropoly acids with the same peripheral atom the reduction potential may be, at least in this case, correlated with acidity.The importance of the acidity of the heteropoly acid in the relation to the rate of olefin isomerization is proven by increasing the electronegativity of the cation. However, for the acidic salts, the correlation is not so direct.604 A more acid-demanding type of isomerization, is the isomerization of n-paraffins, and specially n- butane and n-pentane. The isomerization of n- butane is an important reaction since it produces isobutane which is a desirable reactant for the production of alkylation gasoline, as well as for the production of isobutylene required for methyl tert- butyl ether formation. The skeletal isomerization of n-butane involves the formation of a primary car- bocation as intermediate. In order to do this very strong acid sites, whose conjugated anion can stabi- lize the unstable primary carbocations are needed.Thus, SbF5-HF and oxide supported SbF5605,606 are used to carry out that reaction. Heteropoly acids,especially the strongly acidic CSZ.HO.PWIZOO salt,607 have been proven to be selective catalysts for the formation of isobutane. However, temperatures as high as 300 "C are required to be of practical use.
In analogy with commercial bifunctional Pt catalyst on fluorinated alumina, Pd salts of heteropoly acids or Pd-heteropoly acid systems have been used for isomerizing n-pentane and n-hexane, in the presence of H2.608,609 The total conversion of hexane and the distribution of the products in hexane isomerization over Pd salts of H3PW12040 were much higher on the Pd salt than on the parent acid. In the case of pentane isomerization, 40% of conversion with 97% selectivity was obtained on the Pd salt at 180 "C.
When the reaction temperature was increased to 200 "C, the conversion strongly increased (92%) but the isopentane selectivity appreciably decreased (58%).
The results were improved when the Pd-H3PW12040 catalyst was supported on active carbon.
These results indicate that the isomerization of short-chain alkanes on bifunctional catalysts based on heteropoly acids deserves further attention.
Carbon-Carbon Bond Formation and Break- ing. Alkylation-Dealkylation of Aromatics. As was said above, the conventional acid Friedel-Crafts catalysts involving proton donor-promoted Lewis acids such as aluminum chloride-hydrogen chloride,and proton containing molecular sieves are active catalysts for the alkylation of aromatics with alcohols,olefins, and alkyl halides. Heteropoly acids and their salts have also been used to alkylate aromatics by rl

The kinetic rate constants for the different reactions were obtained610 (Table 21),and the results clearly indicate that a second dodecyl alkyl group adds to the aromatic ring as rapidly as the first. Thus, the steric hindrance for the second alkylation does not seem to operate. Moreover, since the activation energies are also the same for the two reactions, it appears that the only control of selectivity can be done from the benzene to 1-dodecene ratio in the feed. In this way,a conversion of 99% and selectivity of 91% was obtained at 150 "C, at 14 atm of total pressure and a benzene to 1-dodecene ratio of 9.0. This result was indeed very promising, but the presence of heavy alkylates in the products (8%) indicates that some catalyst deactivation has already occurred.

Moreover, with in- creasing of the acid strength of the heteropoly acid by increasing the valency of the central atom, the selectivity to BPX significantly increases, while the conversions of 2-methylpropene are at similar levels.
It was mentioned before that the acidic and ad- sorption properties of heteropoly compounds can be modified by synthesizing different salts. The results of these changes are reflected in the alkylation of 1,3,54rimethylbenzene by cyclohexene. For this reaction a Cs2.5H0.5PW12040 was remarkably more active than H  P W   O  O .    , This activity difference cannot be explained only on the basis of total acidity and acid strength distribution, and the higher hy- drophobicity of Cs salts with respect to the heteropoly acid form, with the corresponding beneficial adsorp- tion of nonpolar molecules such as aromatic and cyclohexene has been claimed as an additional activ- ity factor.617 On top of that, the soft basicity of the heteropoly anion,596 which can be changed by the presence of Cs+,gives the system a special acid-base bifunctionality which enhances the catalytic activity of the heteropoly acid salt. The following scheme shows the acid-base bifunctional mechanism where polyanion stabilizes the cyclohexyl cation and/or the cyclohexyl 1,3,5-trimethyl proton from the latter cation:617 polyanion *-*+- polyanion potyanion Since heteropoly acids can catalyze the alkylation of aromatics, they should also catalyze dealkylation and transalkylation. Indeed, Nowinska et a1.618 have shown that 12 tungstophosphoric acid supported on y-Al203 and Si02 was active for cumene cracking at Table 23.

Isoparaffins and Olefins. The increasing demand for high-octane paraffinic gaso- lines has compelled the refiners to look for the appropriate isoparaffin alkylation process. However,in order to widely expand such process the actual acid mineral catalysts, i.e. HF and H2S04 have to be substituted by solid acid catalysts. Owing to their strong acidities, heteropoly acids have been explored as potential catalysts for alkylation of isobutane with butene but the literature on this subject is scarce.620,621 In these cases, K+, Rb+, Cs+, and NH4+ salts of tungstophosphoric heteropoly acid were preferred as catalysts and they could form tribranched products in good yields at relatively low temperatures (Table 23). Moreover, it appears that they give better results than superacid S042-/Zr02 catalysts. How- ever, little is known about an important feature of alkylation catalysts such as the catalyst deactiva- tion-regeneration. The preliminary results621 indi- cate that a strong deactivation of the catalyst can occur with time on stream.
Isobutane alkylation is a field of sufficient interest to justify further research on the application of heteropoly acids and their salts,as insoluble catalysts or supported on SiOz, y-Al203, carbon, etc. The special hydrophobic-hydrophilic properties of het- eropoly acids as well as the stabilizing character of the polyanions can give, if properly tuned, interesting results.
D. Sulfated Metal Oxides
About 15 years ago, it was shown that by a sulfate treatment of oxides such as ZrO2, TiOz, SnO2, Fe203, HfOz, etc., a remarkable increase in the surface acidity and in the catalytic activity for carbenium ion reaction of the starting metal oxides was a c h i e  e d .    - These catalysts were claimed to present superacid sites with acid strengths, mea- sured by the indicator method, of up to HO < -16.04 which have opened new perspectives in the use of friendly solid catalyst for carrying out, under mild conditions, reactions involving very strong acid sites.In this section the preparation, acid characteristics,and the carboniogenic catalytic activity for hydrocar- bon reactions will be reviewed. 598 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 16 Corma - 80 t - \ 1 2 r - y

1. Preparation of Sulfated Metal Oxides
Different procedures for preparation of sulfated metal oxides have been reported.622-628 The sulfated metal oxides are usually prepared by first precipitat- ing the hydroxides, and after washing and drying,they are treated with a solution of H2S04. The treatments with (NHJ2S04, S02, H2S, and SO3 also promote the catalytic activity.626 In the case of sulfate-treated superacids of Fe, Ti, Zr, Hf, and Sn, superacid sites were not created by the treatment of sulfate ion on the crystallized oxides but on the amorphous hydroxide forms followed by calcination and crystallization. However, in the case of superacid of Al203, better catalysts were obtained when the crystallized oxide rather than the amor- phous one was treated with HzS04.630 Thus, it appears that the nature of the starting metal oxide hydroxide,631 as well as each one of the posterior treatments, can be of importance for the final proper- ties of the acid catalyst632 and they will be discussed here.After the dried hydroxide is impregnated with a solution of H2S04 or (NH4)2S04,the resulting solid is dried and calcined to temperatures of 500-650 "C.
A variable to be considered during the preparation is the normality of the H2S04 solution. Indeed, it has been f o  n d    - that the amount of sulfate adsorbed by the solid increases rapidly with the concentration of sulfuric acid in contact with the solid (Figure 29) and higher sulfur contents are obtained, for any calcination temperature, for higher H2S04 normali- ties, in the case of S042-/Zr02 catalysts (Figure 30).
After H2S04 impregnation, the calcination temper- ature of the resulting material also plays an impor- tant role on the subsequent textural, acidity, and catalytic The sulfated materials show larger surface areas than the pure metal (Table 24).
The XRD spectra of SnO2,ZrO2,and T i 0 2  show the degree of crystallization of the sulfated oxides to be much lower than that of SnO2 without the sulfate treatment. Furthermore, the presence of sulfate638 retards the conversion of the tetragonal to the mono- clinic form in the case of ZrO2, and from anatase to rutile in the case of TiO2. For instance, the XRD pattern of S042-/Zr02 heated at 650 "C was com- pletely a tetragonal form, while the pure ZrOz was 1

At calcination temperatures above 650 "C the sulfated species start to decompose probably follow- ing the reaction:636 2zr4+ + s o :- - 2zr3+ + so, + 0, Indeed, the formation of SO2 by sulfate decomposi- tion has been detected for sulfated ferric oxide.641 It can be concluded that the preparation of cata- lytically active sulfated oxides is not trivial, and the different preparation steps need to be optimized for each oxide: the starting salt and the precipitation procedure, the selection of the sulfating agent and procedure of sulfation, and calcination conditions.
Inorganic Solid Acids
2. Nature of Acid Sites
Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 599 metal oxide surfaces. Sulfate-promoted ZrO2 exhibit a strong IR band at 1370 cm-l which has been assigned to an asymmetric stretching vibration of S=O. The adsorption of pyridine caused a large shift in the S=O band to 1330 cm-l, which was ex- l a i n e d by assuming that the sulfur complex in the highly acidic catalysts has a strong tendency to reduce the bond order of SO from a highly covalent double-bond character to a lesser double-bond char- acter when a basic molecule is adsorbed on its central metal cation. The strong ability of the sulfur complex with structure I1 to accommodate electrons from a basic molecule,i.e. to act as a Lewis site, is a driving force in the generation of highly acidic properties.
However, chelation of the metal would leave it 8-coordinated and not a Lewis acid site.632 Thus,while this scheme provides an illustration on the formation of active sites, it does not permit SO2 or SO3 to be eliminated from structure I1 without introducing problems with the oxidation states of the elements and compounds involved in the reaction:634 Arata and Hino630 have proposed a different struc- ture for the active site, in where sulfate bridges across two zirconium atoms: It was said above that much better catalysts are obtained with sulfated samples obtained from zirco- nium hydroxide rather than from zirconium oxide.
Then, it can be assumed, in a first approximation,that the formation of acid sites involves a two-step chemikal reaction between the superficial hydroxyl groups of zirconium hydroxide and adsorbed H2S04:636 first step: impregnation-drying step Zr,(OH),, + xH,SO, - second step: calcination above 400 "C Several observations support this reaction scheme.636 In this way, the presence of S042- anions in the zirconia framework may explain the sintering resis- tance and the stabilization of the tetragonal phase.
The existence of an optimum for the catalytic and ionizing properties as a function of the sulfur content may be due to the maximum covering of the hydrox- ide surface. However, the nature of the high acidity of the sulfated metal oxides is still controversial.
Thus, several authors627,631,642-645 have proposed that the very strong acidity is due to an increase in the number and strength of Lewis acid sites, and Yamagu- chiu3 has offered the following scheme to describe the formation of an active catalytic site:calcined at 723 K moisture (NH&SO4 + metal oxide .

This author proposed that whatever the starting sulfur materials are, once they are oxidized at the surface of metal oxides, they form structure 1 1 .
Thus the structure I1 is essential for the acid-catalyzed reactions as a common active site on the sulfur- promoted oxidized samples, and it is suggested that structure I1 may develop at the edge or corner of Bronsted acid site

This model implies the formation of Bronsted acid sites, and it has been observed by IR that there is an easy conversion of Lewis to Bronsted acid sites by sorption of water molecules. The presence of those Bronsted acid sites would allow catalytic reactions to occur at much lower temperatures with the same rate as they occur at higher temperatures without the presence of Bronsted sites.
While the above structure is widely used to discuss the catalytic activity of these materials since it illustrates the presence of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites in the active catalyst, Davis et al.634 have shown that it does not appear possible to make it conform with the chemical bonding, due to the valence or structural changes that occur during catalyst prepa- ration and activation by heat treatment. Indeed,when losing sulfur upon heating above 650 "C, the following reaction will occur depending on whether SO3 or SO2 is lost: The loss of SO2 implies the reduction of S6+ to S4+ with a corresponding oxidation of some Zr or 0 species, but the authors634 were unable to offer a scheme to illustrate that.
In order to deal with those difficulties Clearfield et al.632 have proposed the following scheme:600 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 Coma 300 '

The authors proposed that in sulfuric acid media the predominant species is bisulfate. This ion could displace a single bridge. On heating, an adjacent hydroxyl could interact with the bisulfate ion to split out water leading to structure 11. However, the hydroxyl group could also interact with an adjacent OH bridge to split out water and leave the bisulfate ion intact. Thus strong Bronsted and Lewis acid sites would be present on that structure. The presence of both type of sites have, indeed, been seen by IR and pyridine adsorption measurements,644 and it has been proposed that Bronsted acid centers can be present only if sulfates, and possibly polysulfates, are present on the top terminations of the scale-like ZrO2 crystallites, i.e., on regular patches of low index crystal planes.
With respect to their acidity CO adsorption at room temperature led to an IR spectrum with a peak at 2200 cm-l characteristic of CO adsorbed on strong acid sites.642,647,648 Large H-1 chemical shifts suggest that the sulfated zirconia catalyst presents protonic superacidity, this property being related to the structure of surface sulfated species.649 Most of the measurement using indicators show that these ma- terials fall in the superacidity region. However, this has been contested by Hall et al.,650 claiming that they have not observed superacidity on sulfated zirconia catalysts. The limitations of Hammett's indicators for measuring the acid strength of sulfated oxides have been presented by several a  t h o r s    ,who have shown that even the nonsulfated ZrO2 is already in the superacid region using the Hammett indicator technique, while it is inactive for butane isomerization.Recently, Lin and Hsd9 have proposed a new approach for detecting superacidity on these catalysts by means of temperature-programmed desorption of substituted benzenes. Using such a procedure it was shown that sulfated zirconium oxides present super- acid sites. However, the method has been contested by Jatia et a1.,62 who have shown that the TPD peak used by the former authors59 to claim superacidity comes from C02, S02, and 0 2 formed by oxidation of adsorbed benzene on the samples.Very recently Vedrine et al.652 introduced a new model for S042-/Zr02 catalyst which indicates that the acidity does not fall in the superacidity range but corresponds to that of H2S04. The authors indicate that from the IR spectra of S042-/Zr02 activated at 600 "C and 2 wt % sulfur content, one can see the SO3 species associated to 1387 and 1027 cm-' bands corresponding to a Lewis site with a band at 1459- 1464 cm-l for adsorbed pyridine. This so3 species was reversibly transformed upon water adsorption into adsorbed H2S04 species associated to 1320,1200,and 1055 cm-l bands and to pyridinium species at 1542 cm-l. On these bases, the authors have pro- posed the following equilibrium to occur:(SO3Iads

t (SO,, H2OIad,t (H,SO,),d, H3O+ f (HSO,-),d,(HsO,-),d, + HzO H30+ f (sO:-),d, This is supported by theoretical calculations using molecular complex models which show that sulfated zirconia corresponds to HzS04 on ZrO2 with an acid strength about equal to that of HzS04, which is in the lower limit of s  p e r a c i d i t y .    .This model,while very suggestive, needs to take into account the role of the metal which undoubtedly indicates that there is a direct correlation between the acid strength of the S042-/M02 catalyst and the electronegativity of the metal, in such a way that the following order of acid strength has been observed:639,654-656 so42-/ ZrO2 > S042-/Sn02 > S042-/Ti02 > S042-/Fe203 > In order to increase both acidity and stability,complex oxides have been sulfated. In this way it has been shown that the introduction of a small amount of W03 in S0d2-/Zr02 not only enhances the acid strength of the catalyst but also introduces Bronsted acidity. This indicates that Bronsted acid- ity may result in this system from the OH groups bonded to tungsten atoms on the catalyst surface through the following structure:657 so42-/&03. 0 0

In this case, W03 and S042- cooperate to enhance the acidity of ZrO2.
One limitation of sulfated oxide solid acids is their lack of stability, and the improvement of this is of paramount interest for future catalytic applications.
In this sense, a new class of solid superacids, sulfated metal oxides containing Fe, Mn, and Zr have been d e  e l o p e d ,    -   l which shows higher stability than sulfated ZrO2, while are able to isomerize n-butane at near room temperature with a rate 3 orders of magnitude greater than sulfated zirconia. These results have been reproduced by Jatia et a1.62 who also found that the addition of either Fe or Mn Inorganic Solid Acids increases the catalytic activity with the Fe impreg- nated sample showing an order of magnitude greater activity than the Mn impregnated material. The combination of Fe and Mn enhances the catalytic activity over the singly impregnated solids and the sulfate concentration plays an important role in optimizing the activity of the doubly impregnated zirconia.
In conclusion, it can be said that a new type of solid acid catalysts with relatively high surface areas and strong acidities are obtained by treating some transi- tion metal oxides by HzS04 or (NH4)2S04. The acid strength could be controlled by changing the elec- tronegativity of the metal as well as by introducing multimetal systems. Both types of acid sites, Bron- sted and Lewis, are present on these catalysts, and they remain stable at temperatures up to 600 "C.
The acidity and surface area strongly depend on the preparation procedure, i.e. impregnation, and calci- nation. Finally, the exact nature of the acid sites is still controversial, and it even is questioned if super- acid sites, i.e. sites with acidity higher than 100% H2S04, are really formed. Nevertheless, they are very active catalysts for carboniogenic reactions and this aspect will be discussed below.
Superacid Oxides. Another way to overcome the unstability of the sulfated oxide catalysts at high temperature is to try to develop strong acidity on nonsulfated promoted oxides. In this sense it has been h o
n
,
that ZrO2 has weak acid sites which are able to catalyze carbenium ion reactions such as double-bond isomerization, dehydrations, etc., and the acidic characteristic of the oxide depends on preparation and calcination conditions. However, Arata and Hino664-667 have shown that by impregnat- ing Zr(OH)4 with a salt of tungsten or molybdenum followed by calcination in air at high temperatures acid sites of HO

As it oc- curred in the case of sulfated ZrO2, it has to be avoided the crystallization of ZrO2 from Zr(OH)4.
Consequently, the hydroxide should not be heated at temperatures above 300 "C.
The interaction of W or Mo with ZrO2 during calcination retards the evolution of the tetragonal form, as occurred with the introduction of S042-.
However, with W and Mo the crystallographic phase transformation of ZrO2 is completely a tetragonal form when calcining up to 900 "C and a monoclinic form after calcination at 1000 "C. It would appear then that tungsten and molybdenum oxides combine with zirconium oxides to create superacid sites at the (WOs)/ZrOz catalysts have been prepared by different methods including a conventional impregnation tech- nique, a molten salt method, and calcination of zirconium hydroxide impregnated with Mo(W) salt.
Among them the third one gives the strongest acidi- ties, which are lower than those obtained with sulfated zirconia.66s As observed with the sulfate superacids when calcined at high temperatures, the surface areas of time when a tetragonal system is formed.664@6

All these facts are a clear indication that the type of interac- tion, and species formed cannot be too different from those obtained on S042-/Zr02 catalysts.
3. Hydrocarbon Reactions on Superacids Oxides and
Sulfated Oxides Dehydration of Alcohols and Hydration of Olefins. Dehydration of alcohols is a reaction which does not need strong acid sites. In fact the relatively weak acid sites present in untreated ZrO2 are able to carry out this type of in a very selective way. Practical use has been made of the selectivity of ZrO2 and other pure oxides for dehydra- tion of alcohols; and for instance, Koei chemicals obtains allylamine by the selective dehydration of 1-amino-2-propanol using ZrO2 as catalyst:676

As was said above, the Sod2- treatment of oxides produces a decrease in the amount of weak acid sites while new very strong acid sites are formed. Then,since in the case of alcohol dehydration all weak and strong acid sites can be active, it can be expected that the activity should correlate with the total number of acid sites better than only with the number of the very strong. For instance when the catalytic activity for 2-propanol dehydration of a series of TiO2, TiO2- Si02 and S042-pl'i02,and S042-/Ti02-Si02 catalysts was compared it was found that although the acidity of so42-/Tio2 is the highest, its catalytic activity is relatively S042-/Fe203 catalysts have also been used to dehydrate ethanol, 2-propanol, and 2-butanol at 170-250 0C,678-680 showing a higher activity than amorphous silica-alumina, and much higher activity that the Fez03 in the absence of Sod2-.One advantage of S042-/metal oxide catalysts is that it is possible, in some cases, to combine the acidic properties of the sulfated catalyst with the oxidation activity of the metal oxides to carry out, in one pot,dehydration and oxidation reactions. For instance,cyclohexanol is dehydrated and oxidized on so42-/ SnO2 catalysts to give high yields of cyclohexanone (Table 26).678 The results show that the amount of cyclohexanone formed was increased by the sulfate treatment and the addition of water, and selectivities to cyclohexanone higher than 95% could be obtained.If the strong acidities of sulfated oxides do not present any advantage with respect to dehydration 602 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 Table 26.

Indeed, high activities and selectivities to ethanol were obtained during hydra- tion of ethylene on S042-/Zr02 and TiOz-ZnO con- taining small amount of S042- catalysts. The main inconvenience of sulfated oxides as hydration cata- lysts is their gradual deactivation owing to the loss of S042- by dissolution in water occurring during the reaction. The results given in Figure 31681 indicate that higher yields and selectivities of ethanol are obtained at low temperatures, but oxidative dehy- drogenation of the alcohol occurred at higher tem- peratures on S042-/Sn02 catalysts.
Esterification and Acylation Reactions. Es- terification of organic acids and alcohols is a type of reaction which is not highly demanding from the point of view of acid strength and can be catalyzed by relatively weak acid sites present in unsulfated Zr02.682 Sulfation of ZrO2 strongly decreases the activity for the esterification of acetic acid and methanol due to the decrease in total amount of acid sites. On the other hand, the formation of very strong acid sites during the sulfation can also cata- lyze the dehydration of the alcohol giving the corre- sponding olefin.683,684 The extent of the side reaction will be decreased by diminishing the electronegativity of the metal to be sulfated. In Table 27685 it is shown that the initial activity of S042-/Ti02 is the highest of any catalyst studied, but it decays rapidly with time. Indeed, after 2 h of use the activity of so42-/ Ti02 is already lower than that of niobic acid, which on the other hand remain unchanged after 60 h of use. The deactivation of S042-/Ti02 has also been observed during the esterification of phthalic acid with n-octyl alcohol, and the decay was associated to the elimination of sulfate ion on the surface.

Other esterification reactions studied using S042-/Ti02 and S042-/Zr02 as catalysts are ethanol and acrylic acid,and methanol and salicylic a  i d .    , In conclusion, it appears that sulfated oxides are not the most adequated catalysts for esterification reactions since the most stable S042-/Zr02 catalysts are less active and selective than others such as niobic acid and supported heteropoly acids, while other more active and selective such as S042-/Ti02 are rapidly deactivated due to the loss of so42-.
In the case of Friedel-Crafts acylations the reac- tion can be performed with an acid chloride, an anhydride, or an organic acid as acylating reagents and with AlC13 as catalyst but used in stoichiometric amounts. Thus, the disadvantages of this catalyst due to wastes and corrosion problems have been tried to be overcome by the use of S042-/Zr02,which has very strong acid sites needed for this reaction. A direct correlation between acylation activity and concentration of the very strong acid sites has been found on S042-/Zr02 catalysts. Indeed, the results from Figure 32686 show that different calcination temperatures of 823 and 873 K for samples prepared Inorganic Solid Acids Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 603 Yield

On the basis of the strong acidity of S042-/Zr02,it has been used as catalyst for acylation of o-chlo- robenzoyl chloride with chlorobenzene and its activity is superior to that of any other known inorganic solid oxide base catalyst, and H Z S O  : Indeed, results from Figure 33 clearly show that S042-/Zr02 is more active that either HzS04 acid or zeolites.
The use carboxylic acids as acylating agents is of great interest, but it should be considered that in that case acid sites stronger than HO = -15 are needed for the formation of the acylium cation (RCO+). If one takes into account that acid sites of HO = -16 have been found on S042-/Zr0 it is not surprising that it has been found to be able to carry out acylations of toluene using anhydrides and carboxylic acids, with the order of r e a  t i v i t y   '     @ (PhC0)ZO > PhCOzH > PhCOaEt > PhCOzMe.Contrary to what has been observed on FeS04, in the case of S042-/Zr0 the acylation reaction com- pletely stopped when the solid catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture. Thus, it appears that S042-/Zr02 acts as a true heterogeneous acid cata- lyst.686 When the electronegativity of the metal changes, the activity of the sulfated catalyst for the acylation reaction also changes. In this sense while the sulfated A 1 2 0 3  is active for benzoylation of benzene with both benzoyl chloride and benzoic acid,its activity is smaller than that of S042-/Zr0.68s The authors suggest that the benzoyl cation (PhCO+) from a benzoyl chloride molecule is generated on a Bron- sted site created by adsorption of water on Lewis sites of the catalyst.In conclusion, sulfated zirconia appears as a very promising solid catalyst for carrying out acylation reactions. However, questions related to catalyst lifetimes remain unanswered.Isomerization Reactions. Cis-trans and double- bond isomerization of butenes are catalyzed by Bron- sted acid sites of relatively low acid strength, being the reaction intermediate a sec-butyl cation formed by the addition of the proton. The same intermediate is often involved in the case of Lewis solid acids, but in this case protonic acid is induced by the reaction of the olefin on the Lewis acid site. Due to the low acid demand of this reaction, it appears that sulfated oxides would not be the most adequate catalysts, and the studies of isomerization of olefins on them are scarce. In the case of S042-/Fe03 the IR of adsorbed 1-butene has provided information on the nature of interaction between the olefin and the sulfated catalyst.689 Thus, upon adsorption at room temper- ature, the presence of C=C stretching and CH3 bending vibration in the 1400-1700 cm-l region indicate that 1-butene adsorbs molecularly, probably forming a n complex.690 When increasing the tem- perature to 420-520 K, the original peak disappears and new broad peaks appear in 1550-1700 cm-' region which may indicate the formation of n-allyl intermediates. If this is so, it is then possible that 1-butene adsorbs on Fe site (Lewis acid site) forming an allyl species between 420 and 520 K. When the sample is heated further in He flow some of the adsorbed 1-butene does not simply desorb but reacts with the sulfate ion to promote its decompositin.Hence an IR band at 1350 cm-l appears to be due to the following intermediate of the sulfate decomposi- tion: It appears then that if the olefin isomerization reaction is carried out at temperatures above 520 K there is the possibility that catalyst deactivates by chemical decomposition of sulfate groups.The cis-trans isomerization of 2-butene has been used as a test reaction to evaluate the acidity of NiO- Ti02 treated by different mineral based on the idea that the activity increases either with increasing acid strength and/or acid amount. In that case the high catalytic activities of modified catalysts were correlated with the increase of acid strength by the different inductive effects of the anions of the treating acids, which follow the order of acid strength and catalytic activity: s 0 4 ' - > P043- > B0s3- > Se042-.If olefin isomerization is an uninteresting reaction to be catalyzed by sulfated superacid catalysts, the branching isomerization of short chain n-alkanes is of practical interest. Indeed, the reaction of isomer- ization of n-butane to isobutane, is carried out commercially on chlorinated aluminas. Due to ther- modynamic reasons, it is of interest to carry out the reaction at temperatures as low as possible, and this would be achieved by using superacids as catalysts.When n-butane is reacted in a liquid superacid,molecular H2, methane, and ethane are observed as reaction products. Their formation is explained by the attack of a H+ either to a C-H or a C-C bond to form a carbonium ion, in which the incorporated H+ forms a two-electron three-center intermediate, and this intermediate liberates one hydrogen or an alkane molecule and leaves a carbenium ion. This carbe- nium ion may undergo skeletal rearrangement and yield alkane isomers:692 604 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 Corma

In the case of solid superacids of the sulfated oxide type, n-butane is selectively isomerized to isobutane at reaction temperatures up to 150 "C. On the basis of the idea that intermediate carbenium, but no carbonium ions, can lead to branching isomerization,it has been proposed that it is an abstraction of hydride ion by a Lewis acid site which initiates the reaction to form a butyl carbenium ion, followed by the methyl migration to yield a 2-methylpropyl carbenium ion, and finally isobutane is formed by the addition of hydride ion to a carbenium ion.693 These conclusions were confirmed by deuterium tracer investigation. However, as was seen for zeolites,isobutane can also be formed through an oligomer- ization-cracking mechanism which can also be carried out on Bronsted acid sites.
In the case of sulfated oxides, which can isomerize n-butane even at room temperature, both types of acid sites, i.e. Bronsted and Lewis acid sites, have been detected by pyridine adsorption. Even though there is still discussion on the type of active site involved in the isomerization of n-butane on these catalysts, it appears that the presence of both types of sites are necessary for the reaction to occur. In fact, it has been suggested that the superacidity may arise from the presence of Bronsted sites whose acidity is enhanced by the presence of strong neigh- boring Lewis acid sites.633,636 These conclusions are supported by the correlation between acidity and catalytic activity, and the maximum rate for n-butane transformation is found to correspond to a Bronstedl Lewis ratio, measured from the intensity of pyridine IR bands, close to 1,hence to the monolayer of sulfur species. Moreover, it has been that in the presence of excess of water (e.g. 0.6 x lo3 Pa partial pressure) the activity of a S042-/Zr02 catalyst for n-butane isomerization dropped to zero. Further- more, if no water was present in the reaction media,by drying the n-butane by passing through a molec- ular sieve column, the activity was also shown to decrease by 20% to 30%. If the normal feed, contain- ing traces of water, was used again, the catalytic activity was recovered. On the other hand Pinna et al.'jg4 have claimed on the basis of selective and reversible CO adsorption results that strong Lewis acid sites from S042-/Zr02 intervene in the isomer- ization of n-butane since CO selectively poisons Lewis acid sites and in parallel the activity drops to zero.Activity is recovered upon desorption of CO.After all these results, one is tempted to compare the behavior of S042-/Zr02 with that of HF-SbF5 and
A
c 1 3 .
In the case of the HF-SbF5 superacid system,this also involves both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites with their ratio equal to one. In the case of MC13 which is very active for n-paraffin isomerization, it requires the presence of low amounts of moisture to proceed as catalyst. When small amounts of H20 are present in the reaction media, some of the AC13 molecules become hydrolyzed and the final catalytic system consists of HC1-AlCl3, which again contains Bronsted-Lewis acid sites.
Finally, it is worth pointing out that at high hydrogen pressures an inhibition of the rate of isomerization occurs. This property is consistent with a mechanism involving Bronsted sites.695 Thus, it can be concluded that the variables in catalyst preparation which were shown above to control acidity of these systems are also going to control the catalytic activity for n-butane isomeriza- One of the important variables which controls acidity in sulfated oxides catalyst preparation is the nature of the oxide. In this sense, S042-/Zr02 is more active than S042-/Ti02 catalyst.623 An increase in catalyst stability, surface acidity, and, therefore,catalytic activity for n-butane isomerization has been obtained by Hsu et al.658-660 by using a sulfated oxide containing iron, manganese and zirconium. The sulfated zirconia promoted with iron and manganese is capable of isomerizing n-butane to isobutane at near room temperature with rates approximately 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than sulfated zir- conia.62j660 Unfortunately, the isomerization activity of sul- fated oxide catalysts decreased along the time on stream due to catalyst decay. It has been pre- sented696,697 that catalyst deactivation occurs not only by coke deposition but by reduction of the oxidation state of sulfur in the surface complex. High H 2
pressures can inhibit coke deposition and prolong the life of the catalyst.698 This was much prolonged by preparing a bifunctional catalyst by supporting Pt on S042-/Zr02,and introducing H 2 in the reaction media.
Bifunctional Sulfated Oxide Catalysts. The isomerization of n-butane, as well as n-pentane and n-hexane which form the light straight run (LSR) gasoline, are important reactions in the refinery.
Those isomerizations are commercially carried out on bifunctional catalysts containing chlorinated alumina as the acid component and Pt as the dehydrogenat- ing-hydrogenating function. In the case of LSR Pt/ zeolites,they are also used commercially owing to the higher stability presented by zeolitic catalysts to the presence,of some water and sulfur in the feed.
However, the lower acid strength of zeolites with respect to chlorinated alumina requires the use of -100 "C higher reaction temperatures in the former with the corresponding decrease in branched prod- ucts and therefore on the octane of the resulting product. Taking all this into account it could be expected that S042-/Zr02 catalyst containing P t
could act as an adequate isomerization catalyst for n- butane and LSR, since it can work at low tempera- tures and it is not poisoned by traces of water in the feed. Indeed, high conversions for isomerization of ti0n.633636 Inorganic Solid Acids Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 605 * 8 ob

CdCs have been reported using Pt-S042-/Zr02 cata- l y s t  .
The addition of Pt produces a strong in- crease in catalyst duration at 140 "C,20 kg cm-2 total pressure and a molar ratio of H 2 to n-Cs equal to 1-5.
On these catalysts, Pt exists in the metallic state in reasonable large crystals and no detectable change in the valence state of Pt occurs during catalyst use.7oo H2 also plays a role on keeping the activity since even in absence of Pt the catalyst deactivation is significantly reduced if the H 2 pressure is high enough.698 However the role of H 2 may not be limited to avoid deactivation by hydrogenating hydrogen- deficient poison precursor,699 and Ebitani et al.701 have presented the possibility of H2 intervening in protonic acid sites generation. These authors claim that protonic acid sites can also be originated from molecular hydrogen. To explain this they suggest that molecular hydrogen dissociates on the Pt to hydrogen atoms which undergo spillover on the S0d2-/Zr02 and convert to an H+ and e- or H-, the H+ acting as catalytic site for acid catalyzed reac- tions. In this case the Lewis acid sites would act as acceptors of an H- or e-, and as a result of that the Lewis acid site is weakened. This suggestion was made on the basis of the observation that when n-pentane isomerization was carried out in a N2 stream no conversion was obtained, while a conver- sion was obtained when the gas switched to hydrogen (Figure 34).701 An important fact observed by Ebitani et al. is that the bifunctional catalysis, if any, is very small on Pt-S042-/Zr02 catalysts, and therefore the role of Pt will not be to carry out the dehydrogena- tion-hydrogenation of paraffins as it occurs in a conventional bifunctional catalyst. If this is so, we can oversee another mechanism to explain the role of H 2 on these catalysts during alkane isomerization.
Indeed, we have presented very recently702 that on monofunctional acid catalysts, on the basis of zeolites,at lower reaction temperatures the controlling step can be the desorption of the carbocations. Then,under these circumstances, H 2 can act as a hydrogen transfer agent which facilitates the desorption of organic cation while regenerating the acid site. The

The final result was also an increase on the ratio of isomerizatiodcracking ratio.
When Pt was introduced on the catalyst, a much larger activation of the H 2 occurs on it, thus facilitat- ing the above reaction. The kinetic results obtained - s 3 d Calcination Temp.

Changes in activity (0) and acid strength (0) of S042-/Zr02 as a function of calcination temperature, at 150 "C isobutanehutene ratio of 1.8. by changing H2 partial pressure, hydrocarbon partial pressure, and reaction temperature could be ex- plained by such a mechanism.702 If this was so on zeolites which have weaker acid sites (shorter aver- age lifetime of carbocations) and good hydrogen transfer activity, one should expect it to occur even more so on the S042-/Zr02 type catalyst.
Our model would also be supported by the result obtained by Iglesia et a1.703,704 who have showed that the addition of small amounts of adamantane (which increases hydride transfer and carbenium ion termi- nation rates) to n-heptane increases isomerization rates by a factor of 3 and inhibits undesirable cracking reactions. In their case, dihydrogen also acts as a hydride source in alkane isomerization catalysis but it requires the additional presence of metals which can catalyze H2 dissociation.
In conclusion, it could be postulated that when Pt is introduced in S042-/Zr02 superacid catalysts and
H
2 is used in the reaction, not only the life of catalyst is longer but also better activities and selectivities are achieved, by decreasing the average lifetime of the carbocations on the surface, due to the presence of activated H 2 which acts as a hydride transfer agent. For practical applications, the catalyst should retain activity for at least a one year period and should be regenerated afterward.
Reactions Involving Formation and Cracking of C-C Bonds. Owing to the strong acid sites present on sulfated oxides, they have been tested as possible alternatives of HF and H2S04 for alkylation of paraffins and olefins. In this way they have been used to react methane and ethylene to produce CB to C7 products705 or, more importantly from a practical short-term point of view, to alkylate isobutane and butene to produce alkylation gaoline.O-O Calcina- tion temperature plays an important role on acid properties and therefore on alkylation activity. It was found (Figure 35)706 that a maximum in alkyla- tion occurs at calcination temperatures of 650 "C for S042-/Zr02 and 550 "C for S 0 4 2 - / T i 0 2 .
However, it has been f o  n d    t that on s0k2-/ Zr02, together with alkylation of isobutane and butene, oligomerization of butene and cracking of alkylate products also occur on these catalysts. The recracking of alkylates can be decreased by decreas- ing the reaction temperature (Figure 36), and high activity and selectivity to the desired trimethylpen- tanes is obtained on sulfated zirconia catalyst, with 606 Chemical Reviews, 1995, VoI. 95, NO. 3 60 i 2

In conclusion, superacid sulfated oxides are active and selective catalysts for performing alkylation of isobutanehutene at low temperatures. The behavior of S042-/Zr0z is not very different from that of Hz- SO4, with the indication that for this reaction the catalyst may be acting as "supported sulfuric acid".
If sulfated oxides are able to carry out C-C bond formation, they should also catalyze the reverse reaction, i.e. C-C bond rupture. In this sense and as has been found for any of the reactions described up to now, a correlation exits between calcination temperature (acidity) and cumene cracking. Again,two different maxima were found for S04Z-/ZrO and S04z-/Ti0,being lower by -100 "C the calcination - - ;

However, SOa2-/Zr02 has a major drawback as an alkylation catalyst, and this is rapid deactiva- tion.?07 We have tried to change the product distri- bution and catalyst life by modifying reaction condi- tions, as well as the acid strength of the catalyst. The latter was done by changing the nature of the sulfated oxide. Results from Figure 37,109 where the activity of sulfated zirconia, titania, SnOz, Fez03, and Ab03 was compared for alkylation of isobutand butene, indicate that the order of activity is the same than the order of acidity: ZrOz > SnOz = Ti02 > temperature required for achieving the maximum on so.ri0.7*0 In the case of paraffin cracking, hexadecane has been used as a representative test molecule of the long-chain alkanes present in gasoil feeds. Practi- cally all the reported s t u d i e  '   J ' conclude that sulfated zirconia was much less active than a similar material containing P t ,
and cracking increased with both reaction temperature and reaction time.
Two aspects on the behavior of Pt-S042-/ZrO catalysts for hydrocracking of long chain n-alkanes are worth pointing out. The first one is that despite the presence of very strong acid sites it is possible to obtain up to 70% of the hydroisomerized products with two or more alkyl substituents,provided that a low enough reaction temperature is used. When the reaction temperature is increased above 100 "C,hydrocracked products strongly increase with a very high selectivity for isoparaffin products. It appears,therefore, that on the catalysts n-hexadecane is first isomerized into multibranched products which are then cracked more easily:n-paraffin= n-paraffin+= branched paraffin's cracked products tl desorbed branched paraffins The second aspect to be noticed is that the cracked products are shifted on F't-S042-/ZrO toward long- chain products. The amount of long-chain cracked products (2'28) obtained on S042-/Zr0 is much greater than on either amorphous silica-alumina or with the ratio of CJc16-n (n > 8) much larger on the former. This supports the idea that together with cracking, addition and, specially, oli- gomerization reactions also occur:634 C,Hg+ + C5H1o - cgH19+ 2C4Hg+ -

In conclusion, it appears that it is worth investi- gating the possibilities of these catalysts for hydroi- somerization and hydrocracking of long-chain par- affins and waxy products, in the sense that they allowed the reaction to be performed at lower tem- peratures with the benefits in formation of branched products. In the case of catalytic cracking we do not oversee practical possibilities due to their relatively Inorganic Solid Acids low thermal and hydrothermal stability which do not allow regeneration by coke burning in the presence of steam.
Other Reactions Requiring Superacids Sites Carried Out on Sulfated Oxides: Electrophilic Chlorination of Methane. Activation of methane is a subject of actual interest in many laboratories.
Besides the extensive work carried out on the oxida- tive coupling of methane,713-715 electrophilic conver- sions offer interesting posibilities.
Thus, under superacidic conditions, methane reacts with SbFdC12 in SOzClF at -78 "C to give methyl chloride in high selectivity,but with low levels of conversion.717 TaFd Nafion-H, SbFdgraphite, and even zeolites have been used as catalyst for the chlorination of methane.718,719 When the reaction was carried out on S042-/Zr02 catalysts, it was found720 that the conversion in- creases with reaction temperature from 200 to 235 "C, while, in contrast to what occurs on zeolites,selectivity decreases. More specifically, at temper- atures below 225 "C S042-/Zr02 gives selectivities 280% in methyl chloride. Above 225 "C chloroform is formed, but no C 1 4

is observed. Addition of Fe and Mn to sulfated zirconia improves methyl chloride selectivity but decreases conversion. However, it should be considered that in order to discuss selectiv- ity effects the results should be compared at the same level of conversion. It has been proposed720 that the mechanism of the reaction on S042-/Zr02 might be the same as that the proposed over oxyhalide or supported Lewis superacid catalysts: Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 607 t

It was presented above that zirconia- tungsten and zirconia-molybdena oxides, calcined at temperatures between 600 and 1000 "C, show strong acid sites. When used as catalysts, they are able to carry out the benzoylation of toluene with benzoic anhydride, isomerization of n-heptane, and oligomer- ization of l - d e  e n e .
In these cases the maximum in activity was obtained for very high temperatures,close to 800 "C, but in all cases and as occurred before, their catalytic activity follows the trend of acidity. This type of oxide will offer new opportuni- ties in catalysis, especially for reactions which require highly thermally stable catalysts.
IV. General Conclusions
It appears today that a large variety of solid acids within a large scale of acidities +3.5 I

-16 and with high surface areas can be prepared. This offers the possibility for selecting a catalyst with the adequate acid strength for almost any particular acid-catalyzed reaction. This situation has been made possible by the large amount of work performed by researchers from different areas. In this way NMR, IR, EPR, Raman, and XPS spectroscopists have characterized the nature and different types of acid sites, which have been modeled by a specialist in quantum chemistry. On the basis of those as well as on adsorption studies, researchers in Material Sciences have made possible the preparation of solid acids, based on inorganic oxides, within different range of acid strengths. On top of that and in collaboration with catalytic specialists, acidity has been coupled with adequate surface and pore size properties in order to optimize catalytic activity and selectivity in a large variety of reactions with organic compounds. In this sense, zeolites and zeotypes have represented a revolution in the field of acid catalysis,not only because of the rationalization on the nature of the acid sites achieved, but also because of the practical catalytic results achieved with these mate- rials. Their use has completely changed the scheme in refining and petrochemistry and, now, is opening new possibilities in the field of fine chemicals.
However, their practical use is still limited to reac- tions requiring acidities lower than HO = -10 (unless high reaction temperatures can be used). Owing to this, there is strong incentive to develop new solid acid catalysts based on inorganic solids, with very strong acid sites. In this sense, heteropoly acids and their acid salts offer new possibilities for carrying out more demanding reactions at lower temperatures.
Their possibilities will be expanded in the near future if structures with controlled, stable micropores with sizes in the range of reactant molecules could be prepared. In this case there is no doubt that a combination of acidity, molecular sieve properties,and chirality can open new and exciting possibilities to these materials.
Finally, when stable stronger acidities are re- quired, activated oxides and sulfated oxides can offer clear advantages. These materials, make available superacid sites on the surface of solid catalysts.
However, their performance has to be improved in order to avoid undesired parallel reactions and catalyst deactivation. Efforts should be made to decrease the acid strength heterogeneity of these materials, which involve the presence of acid sites of weak, medium, strong, and very strong acid sites.
Their possibilities as a real counterpart of unfriendly HF and H2 SO4 acid catalysts would strongly be increased if they could be prepared with only very strong acid sites on the surface. 608 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 Coma
