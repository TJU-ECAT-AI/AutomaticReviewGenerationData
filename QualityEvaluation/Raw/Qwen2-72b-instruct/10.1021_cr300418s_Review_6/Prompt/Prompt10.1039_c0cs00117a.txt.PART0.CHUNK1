nCO. See Fig. 25b for the analogous spectra of NO dosed on alkali metal exchanged-ferrierite. Part (b): when M posses empty orbitals of suitable energy an electron transfer from the CO MO to the s M AO occurs, resulting in a positive D nCO. Part (c): When M possesses d-electrons a back-donation from atomic d orbital to the molecular anti-bonding p-CO orbitals occurs, weakening the CO bond and inducing a negative D nCO. In some cases the three effects may occur concomitantly. Part (a) adapted with permission from ref. 169 (copyright American Institute of Physics 1995); part (b) unpublished.

Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 4965 halides182 could not be directly used to establish a simple cationmolecule interaction, because on the large [001] faces adsorbing cationic sites are not isolated, resulting in a relevant Madelung effect and important static and dynamic shifts are observed,10 vide infra section 3.31. The existence of a simple electrostatic interaction was observed already in the late seventies by Hauge et al.,183 who monitored the n(CO) of carbon monoxide in interaction with different alkalimetal fluoride molecules isolated in cryogenic argon matrices. They found that the positive D n(CO) was roughly increasing upon decreasing the cationic radius (RM), a clear evidence that the M+  CO interaction is of pure electrostatic origin.
Also alkalimetal cations hosted as extraframework charge balancing inside zeolitic channels or cavities act as isolated sites able to coordinate CO molecules at low temperature.146,166168,184,185 In such cases a direct D nCO p 1/d2 MCO relationship was observed. The model reported in eqn (2) was derived by Lamberti et al.,169 who used the experimental D n(CO) values measured by FTIR on Na+-, K+-, Rb+- and Cs+-exchanged ZSM-5 and MOR zeolites to determine, the local positive electric field strength at the cation site E (26 V nm1), the effective charge on the cationic site (0.650.75 e) and the negative contribution from the negatively charged zeolitic framework Ez (4.2 and 4.7 V nm1 ZSM-5 and MOR, respectively). The data reported in Fig. 14 also contains the data collected on Li-ZSM-5 and Li-MOR,where the local electric field is as high as 8.2 V nm1. Please note the remarkable values of the local electric field probed by CO, as 1 V nm1 = 109 V m1. The simple electrostatic model here summarized169 has successively been significantly improved by the more sophisticated ab initio approach, on naked cations170 and on fragments mimicking the zeolite sites,171 by Ferrari et al. These two successive studies confirmed the electrostatic nature of the interaction. In this regard, also the theoretical works of Larin et al.184,185 are worth mentioning.
A better insight on the IR spectra reported in Fig. 13a allows to realize that a minor band is present below n0(CO).
As was the case for the main band, also this low-frequency band is cationic-specific, as it has been found to appear at 2108, 2113, 2117, 2119, and 2122 cm1 for Li+-Na+-, K+-, Rb+-, and Cs+-ZSM-5, respectively.167 A temperature depen- dent IR experiment, allowed Otero Arean et al.187 to prove that CO interacts with exchangeable cations M+ of zeolites to form both M+  CO and M+  OC adducts, responsible of the main (blue shifted) and minor (red-shifted) IR bands,respectively.
3.2.2
CO on Cu+-exchanged zeolites: The ability of IR to discriminate among different adsorbing sites and to highlight effects of adsorption-induced cation displacement. Copper- exchanged molecular sieves have been widely investigated after the discovery that Cu-ZSM-5 are active in the direct decomposition of nitric oxide to nitrogen and oxygen molecules.188194 Due to their superior catalytic activity, most of the data reported refer to more than 100% copper-exchanged samples195 prepared via a conventional ion exchange with aqueous solutions of cupric ions, which contain mixtures of copper ions in different aggregation and oxidation states.178,196204 The heterogeneity of copper species in catalysts prepared following this way is evident, and implies that a structural model for Cu cations cannot be confidently assessed. This makes the elucidation of structural and catalytic properties of isolated and clustered species a difficult subject.
Since the early nineties the Turin group has developed an ongoing research100,174,205216 in the characterization of Cu+-ZSM-5 samples prepared following an original exchange path, based on the reaction at 573 K between the zeolite (in the protonic form) and gaseous CuCl following eqn (3): Si(OH+)Al (surf) + CuCl(g) - Si(OCu+)Al (surf) + HCl(g) (3) It has been proven that the so obtained material can be considered as a model solid, containing only well defined isolated copper species in a single, well defined, oxidation state. Cu+-ZSM-5 samples prepared following our method has been of greatest help in understanding the local structure of Cu+ ions in zeolites that certainly affects their catalytic behavior. In fact, because of its model character, the system offers clear and simple spectroscopic, energetic and structural outputs which assignment is straightforward. This is the reason why the experimental results emerging from its charac- terization have been also used as model values for comparison of the computational outputs obtained in advanced quantum chemical studies.101,176,177,217222 It is finally worth recalling that this exchange method, having the advantage of directly introducing only Cu+ cations, was first applied to ZSM-5 matrix but was subsequently extended to faujasite,213,223,224 mordenite,224226 b224,226 and ferrierite227 molecular sieves.
The high coordinative unsaturation of the Cu+ cations hosted in zeolites is further demonstrated by their ability to form,depending on CO equilibrium pressure (PCO) and temperature,carbonyl complexes of high structural and spectroscopic quality.
At room temperature relatively stable adducts such as the mono-[Cu(CO)]+ and dicarbonyl [Cu(CO)2]+ complexes are observed,174,175,206,208,210212,226,228 (see Fig. 15a and b) which evolve to tricarbonyl [Cu(CO)3]+ species when the system is cooled down to liquid nitrogen temperature,206,208,210,211 see Fig. 15c. The occurrence of a Cu+  (CO) - Cu+  (CO)2 transformation has been definitively proved using two- dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) described here- after in section 3.2.4. The formation of nitrosyl adducts on the same Cu+ sites will be discussed in section 4.4.
When comparison is made with the homogeneous cupric polycarbonyls, it is worth mentioning that binary compounds of the type [CuI(CO)n]+ A have been observed in strong acidic media, such as H2SO4, CF3SO3H, FSO3H, BF3H2O and HF.159 The isolation of such complexes as solids is however very difficult and only in 1996 did Rack et al. report the formation and the structural and spectroscopic characteri- zation of [CuI(CO)n]+[AsF6] (n = 1, 2, 3) compounds.229,230 IR spectroscopy of CO dosed at increasing PCO on Cu+-zeolites is reported in Fig. 15a, b and c for ZSM-5, b, Y and mordenite hosting frameworks. For a description of the framework structures and for a scheme on the evolution of the n(CO) modes vs. PCO, please see Fig. 15d and e for Cu+-ZSM-5 and Cu+-Y, respectively. A larger portion of the Y framework is reported in Fig. 11a. At low PCO (Fig. 15a), a single band Downloaded by Indiana University - Purdue University at Indianapolis on 19 September 2012 Published on 01 November 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/C0CS00117A 4966 Chem. Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 is observed for the monocarbonylic complex in ZSM-5,b and mordenite zeolites. Conversely in Y zeolite two different Cu+  CO adducts are observed characterized by
n(CO) = 2160 and 2144 cm1, which are formed on two different cationic sites, labeled as II and II* respectively (see Fig. 15e).213 This IR evidence is supported by Rietveld refinement of XRPD data collected at the ESRF synchrotron,where two different cationic sites have been determined in the supercage.213 By increasing PCO (Fig. 15b), the formation of Cu+  (CO)2 adducts is observed for all samples, as proved by the splitting of the monocarbonyl band into two bands due to the nas(CO)2 and ns(CO)2 modes of the complex.206,208,213 The fact that both bands are IR active indicates that the intra- zeolitic Cu+  (CO)2 adducts have C2v symmetry (or lower),while the homogeneous counterparts are linear (DNh).229 A further increase of PCO (Fig. 15c) causes for ZSM-5, b and Y zeolites a nearly total Cu+  (CO)2 - Cu+  (CO)3 transfor- mation as indicated by the appearance of a new triplet of IR active bands. This means that we are dealing with a complex of symmetry rather lower than C3v, unlike homogeneous coun- terparts which form planar adducts of D3h symmetry.229 As far as mordenite is concerned, the presence of cations in the less accessible side pocket sites implies the co-presence of mono-, di- and tri-carbonyl adducts even at the higher PCO,225 resulting in a broader and rather unresolved IR spectrum (black curve in Fig. 15c). For the Y zeolite, it is worth noticing that, in spite of the presence of two cationic sites in the supercage, the IR spectrum obtained at high PCO indicates the presence of one only family of Cu+  (CO)3 adducts. This relevant fact is explained in terms of the high solvatation power of the CO molecules, which are able to extract the Cu+ cations in the more shielded position (site II*) as proved by both EXAFS and XRPD,213 see Fig. 15e. The set of spectra collected on Cu+Y represents a clear example of adsorption-induced effects cation displacement. A similar solvatation effect has been observed for Cu+-ZSM-5,208,210 Fig. 15 IR spectra of CO dosed, at liquid nitrogen temperature, on Cu+-ZSM-5 (red curves), Cu+-mordenite (black curves), Cu+-b (orange curves), and Cu+Y (blue curves) zeolites.

c indicates that ZSM-5 and b zeolites are more suitable for the formation of well defined, Cu+  (CO)n (n = 1, 2, 3) complexes, than Y or MOR zeolite and are exemplificative on how IR spectroscopy of adsorbed probe molecules is able to discriminate among different surface sites.
3.2.3
CO on Ag+(K+) and Cu+(Na+) exchanged ZSM-5: Discrimination between polarization, r-donation and p-back donation effects. The fact that Cu+ and Ag+ (two 11 (IB) of transition ions with analogous valence shell electronic configuration: 3d10 and 4d10, respectively) have the same charge and a very similar cationic radius then alkaline Na+ and K+ cations,234 R(Cu+) = 0.96 A vs. R(Na+) = 0.97 A
and R(Ag+) = 1.26 A vs. R(K+) = 1.33 A , implies that the local electric field experienced by CO adsorbed on such couple of cations hosted in the same site, should be almost the same and so does electrostatic interaction of metal carbonyl inter- action (section 3.2.1). This has been the driven idea of Kuroda et al.180 and of Bolis et al.174 who reported a combined IR and micro-calorimetric,investigation on the Cu+  (CO), Na+  (CO), Ag+  (CO) and K+  (CO) carbonyls formed at RT inside ZSM-5 zeolite. EXAFS was used to verify that Cu+ and Ag+ occupies the same cationic sites in ZSM-5.
Using this strategy Bolis et al.174 were able to disentangle the electrostatic interaction to s-donation and p-back donation interactions in both Cu+  (CO) and Ag+  (CO) adducts formed inside ZSM-5 zeolite. Of course we are dealing with simple conclusions that can be extracted from well conceived experiments. To assess a precise description of s-donation and p-back donation contributions for a given metalcarbonyl complex,appropriate ab initio calculations should be performed.176,177,218222 The room temperature PCO-dependent IR spectra of CO adsorbed on Cu+-ZSM-5 (top magenta/red curves) and Ag+-ZSM-5 (top blue curves) are reported in parts (a) and (b) of Fig. 16, respectively. For comparison also the highest coverage spectra obtained dosing CO on Na+- and K+-ZSM-5 are reported in the bottom parts as orange and cyan curves. As already discussed above (section 3.2.2) the [Cu(CO)]+ mono- carbonyl observed at low PCO (magenta spectrum, band at 2157 cm1), progressively evolves into [Cu(CO)2]+ (red curves,bands at 2178 cm1 and 2151 cm1) upon increasing PCO. Only monocarbonyl species are formed on Ag+-ZSM-5 at 300 K (top blue curves in Fig. 16b: band at 2192 cm1).174,180,235,236 A less spectacular [Ag(CO)]+ - [Ag(CO)2]+ is observed at 77 K,owing to the small shift between the symmetric asymmetric stretching modes of the dinitrosyl: 2190 and 2184 cm1.235,236 In this regard, please note that the interpretation of similar high coverage IR spectra in terms of a Cu+  (CO)2 complex on a single Cu+ site has been questioned in the literature,where the bands around 2178 cm1 and 2151 cm1 were ascribed to two monocarbonyls formed on two different Cu+ sites in ZSM-5.180,202,237 Proof that the PCO-dependent spectra evolution reported in Fig. 15a is actually due to a Cu+  (CO) - Cu+  (CO)2 transformation has been proved by two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) by Bolis et al.174 and will here be described in section 3.2.4.
Besides the overall similarity of the two systems, remarkable differences in both the spectroscopic and thermodynamic features have been observed. The spectral position of the CO stretching band of the monocarbonyl complex is blue- shifted with respect to the gas of a greater extent in the case of Ag+, D n(CO) = +49 cm1, than in the case of Cu+,
D
n(CO) = +14 cm1, see Table 1, opposite to what expected on the basis of either the sole electrostatic field or the com- bination of the electrostatic plus the s-coordination effects,larger in the case of Cu+ species. Indeed, notwithstanding the lower D n(CO), the zero-coverage enthalpy of adsorp- tion, DadsH,for [Cu(CO)]+ is greater than that of [Ag(CO)]+: B120 vs. B100 kJ mol1. These facts implies a much larger p-back bonding interaction for [Cu(CO)]+ compared to [Ag(CO)]+.174,180 As anticipated already, quoted authors174,180 evaluated the electrostatic contribution in the case for [Cu(CO)]+ and [Ag(CO)]+ complexes investigating the inter- action of CO with alkaline iso-radial cations (Na+ and K+ respectively) hosted in the same microporous MFI system was investigated. The pure electrostatic interaction between CO and Na+ or K+ cations resulted in DadsH B35 and B28 kJ mol1, respectively.
In Fig. 16c the shift of the CO stretching frequency, D n(CO), is reported as a function of the enthalpy of adsorption DadsH for a large set of systems investigated in ref. 174 (full symbols) and in the remaining literature (open symbols),180,202,237242,244247,243 see Table 1 for quantitative values. Collected data have been obtained through parallel experiments carried out on samples Fig. 16 Part (a): IR spectra of CO adsorbed at RT on Cu-ZSM-5 at increasing PCO (magenta, lowest coverage and red curves) and on Na-ZSM-5 (orange curve, highest PCO only). Vertical solid lines refer to the position of copper and sodium carbonyl species. Part (b): as part (a) for Ag-ZSM-5 (blue curves) and K-ZSM-5 (cyan curve).

Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 in comparable conditions in different laboratories. The reported data can be divided into three subgroups: (i) non-d/d0/d10 metal carbonyls (black circles); (ii) copper metal carbonyls (red squares); (iii) silver carbonyls (blue diamonds).
As far as non-d/d0/d10 metal carbonyls are concerned, a linear correlation between the spectroscopic and thermo- dynamic quantities is evident, resulting in:
D
nCO = [(1.03  0.05) cm1 mol (kJ)1] DadsH + (4  3) cm1 ,(4) with linear correlation parameter of R = 0.981.174 For non-d/d0 metal cations any contribution of p-back-donation is prevented,while this does not necessarily hold for d10 metals. Among the reported data, Zn2+ is the only example of d10 metal cation and behaves as non-d cases both when hosted in Y-zeolite cages or exposed at the surface of ZnO. Being the linearity observed in Fig. 16c based on a statistically significant number of pairs of experimental data, eqn (4) can be considered as an empirical rule of general validity for all non-d/d0 metal carbonyl complexes, allowing to infer calorimetric values from spectroscopic experiments and vice versa. The observed linear- ity implies that, when the polarization of the CO molecule and/or the s-coordinative capacity of the cation increases (as witnessed by the increasing D n(CO),248 also the strength of the interaction increases (as testified by the increase of DadsH). Thus either D n(CO) or DadsH measurements can be used to evaluate the Lewis acidic strength of coordinatively unsaturated non-d/d0 cationic sites.As far as the second and third sub-groups are concerned,spectroscopic and calorimetric data obtained on copper (red squares) and silver (blue diamonds) carbonyls lie in a completely different region of the DadsH/D n(CO) plane (Fig. 16c) and they do not correlate with the empirical rule reported in eqn (4). The interaction between the CO ligands and the metal transition cations is indeed much more complex than the one involving non-d/d0/d10 metal cations, in that a p-back donation is, at least partially, always operative.The p-back donation contribution is however larger for copper than for silver, as indicated by the larger deviation from the empirical line (4) of the former values. In order to attempt to single out the different p- and s-contributions it is Table 1 Adsorption Enthalpies, DadsH, in the zero-coverage limit and CO stretching frequencies shift, D n(CO) for CO adsorbed on metal cations systems reported in Fig. 16 (see the fifth column for the adopted symbols). First set of data refers to d0, d10 and non-d metals, whereas second and third sets to copper and silver carbonyls, respectively.

Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 4969 useful to analyze in details the different pairs of values reported in Table 1. The pair of values (DadsH = 120 kJ mol1 and
D
nCO = 17 cm1) obtained for the Cu+-ZSM-5 model system174 well agrees with the values reported by Kuroda et al.180 on Cu+/SiO2Al2O3.In Fig. 16c, the (D n(CO), DadsH) pairs characterized by negative D n(CO) values, refer to partially reduced copper species. It has been reported that in the case of CO adsorbed on [Cu(NH3)n]+ sites entrapped in the zeolite pores the CO frequency does suffer a red shift.210 Correspondingly, a lower enthalpy of adsorption (DadsH = 80 kJ mol1) with respect to the bare Cu+ sites was measured, indicating a weakening of the interaction. Indeed, the actual charge density of the copper cations is lower in the presence of charge-releasing NH3 ligands, as probed by independent XANES spectra.174 For this reason,the copper cations in the intra-zeolitic [Cu(NH3)n]+ complexes are have been defined as partially reduced.174 In order to confirm this suggestion, spectroscopic and thermodynamic data on the interaction of CO with partially reduced copper species grafted on a non porous ZnO matrix247 are reported in the diagram shown in Fig. 16c (open squares). A linear correlation, which slope is close to that of eqn (4) line, is empirically observed, in the 40120 kJ mol1 DadsH range, for the reported copper carbonyls:
D
nCO = [(1.21  0.07) cm1 mol (kJ)1] DadsH + (127  6) cm1 (5) with
R
=
0.993.
The positive value of the slope [(1.21  0.07) cm1 mol (kJ)1] of the linear correlation is surprising. Indeed, as far as classical carbonyls are concerned,159,161163 an increase of the p-back donation is accompanied by a decrease of the IR-spectroscopic shift and by a parallel enhancement of the M+C bond strength: this should imply a negative slope in the DadsH/D n(CO) plane,that does not match with the data reported in Fig. 16c. Bolis et al.174 explained this unexpected behaviour as following. The linear decrease of
D
nCO) observed by moving from [Cu(CO)]+ through [Cu(NH3)nCO]+ and Cu+/ZnO down to Cu0/ZnO is not due to a progressive increase of the p-back donation component of the CuCO bond, but to a progressive decrease of the net charge on the Cu(I) cations. This brings about to a progressive extinguishment of the electro- static component. This hypothesis explains why D n(CO) and DadsH correlate positively and why the slope obtained in eqn (5) is similar to that obtained for non-d/d0 system.
The decrease of the net charge on the cation in the [Cu(NH3)nCO]+ system, with respect to the pure carbonyl adduct is justified by the charge-releasing role played by ammonia ligands, whereas the effect observed on the Cu(I)/ZnO and Cu(0)/ZnO systems has been caused by progressive reducing treatments in H2.247 As for silver carbonyls formed in ZSM-5 or SiO2Al2O3 matrices. (blue diamonds in Fig. 16c), the result reported by Bolis et al.174 perfectly match those reported by Kuroda et al.180 Due to the limited number of calorimetric and spectroscopic pairs available for Ag carbonyls, it has not been possible to draw a correlation relationship between
D
nCO and DadsH values based on a solid statistical ground,as was done in the case of both Cu and non-d/d0/d10 metal carbonyls (eqn (5) and (4), respectively). This is particularly true owing to the lack of experimental data related to partially reduced Ag species in the low DadsH/D n(CO) region.
3.2.4
Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) study on the [Cu(CO)]+ - [Cu(CO)2]+ transformation in Cu+-ZSM-5.
Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) provides a useful tool to evaluate systematically the spectroscopic changes occurring to a system subjected to an appropriate external perturbation,249253 which corresponds to a variation of the PCO in our case. 2D-COS can then be used to assess statistic relationships between the different spectro- scopic features that are changing along the dynamic series, in order to extract valuable information that can be otherwise difficult to obtain. In the 2D-COS nomenclature the spectra collected upon varying PCO are defined as dynamic spectra and can be recorded before and during the application of the perturbation. A description of the mathematical development of 2D-COS is beyond the scope of the present section.
Therefore, for a further description of the mathematical formalism of 2D-COS, the reader is addressed to the original literature.249251,254,255 In this context it is just worth recalling that the relevance of 2D-COS spectroscopy applied to cata- lysts characterization has been demonstrated e.g. by the group of Caen22,256,257 and by Baiz et al.258 on metal carbonyls.
Parts (a) and (b) of Fig. 17 report a three-dimensional view of the 2D dimensional synchronous and asynchronous spectra, respectively, obtained from the dynamic spectra reported in Fig. 16a (red spectra). The 2D synchronous spectrum couples IR components which variation is mutually correlated, while the 2D asynchronous spectrum couples IR components which variations is not correlated along the series of dynamic spectra. The fact that the intensity of the 2D asynchronous spectrum (Fig. 17b) is negligible with respect to that of the synchronous one Fig. 17a) means that all IR features appearing in the spectra reported in Fig. 16a are mutually correlated. In other words the hypothesis that the components at 2157 and 2151 cm1 could be attributed to two different [Cu(CO)]+ complexes adsorbed on two different Cu(I) sites is definitively ruled out. To have a better insight on the 2D synchronous spectrum Fig. 17, part (c) reports the content of the three-dimensional part (a) with the two- dimensional contour-plot method. From Fig. 17c two features are evident. Firstly the bands at 2178 and 2151 cm1 correlate positively (red spots), i.e. they are two different vibrational modes of a single species. Secondly the band at 2157 cm1 correlates negatively (blue spots) with both 2178 and 2151 cm1 bands indicating that the species responsible of the 2157 cm1 is converted upon increasing PCO into a second species characterized by two IR modes at 2178 and 2151 cm1.
The Cu+  (CO)- Cu+  (CO)2 transformation suggested in sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 is then fully confirmed.

In the case of MIL-100 and MIL-101, carbon monoxide has revealed the co-presence of Lewis Cr3+ sites, hydroxiles and structural water in different proportions depending on the activa- tion pre-treatment, giving rise to a variety of adducts always characterized by positive shifts.22,259,260 The presence of weak Brnsted sites has been evidenciated in MIL-53-(Al),261 MIL-53-(Ga),261 in UiO-66,262,263 Ni-Cubane264 and in Ni-PiP.265 Here we report a summary of the results obtained upon adsorption, at low coverage, of CO in MOFs containing divalent metal ions with a coordinative vacancy and characterized by a very similar ionic radius (Fig. 18). In HKUST-1 CO forms adducts, hardly reversible at liquid nitrogen temperature,characterized by a band at 2178 cm1.117,266 The observed CO frequency, being very close to that found in the case of CPO-27-Mg267 (2175 cm1), where the adduct is readily reversible at liquid nitrogen temperature, suggests that in the case of Cu2+ a pure electrostatic and s-donation interactions are not sufficient to explain the features of Cu2+  (CO) complexes and a minor contribution of p back donation must be also considered. Similar considerations have to be addressed in the case of CPO-27-Ni268,269 and CPO-27-Co,where CO monocarbonyls give rise to bands at 2177 and 2160 cm1 respectively. Note that in the case of the Co form,the adducts are hardly reversible at room temperature, testifying the extremely strong interaction with the cobalt ions.

In this section we have chosen to discuss the Cr2+/SiO2 system.
The importance of the Phillips catalyst in the industrial PE production287,288 and of surface modified ones289291 makes Cr/SiO2 one of the most investigated systems by several experimental techniques.16,292294 Despite the huge amount of published literature, the structure of Cr6+/SiO2 and of its relative Cr2+/SiO2 (which is the most studied from a spectro- scopic point of view) is still unresolved. This is mainly due to the amorphous nature of the support that prevents the use of diffraction techniques and is responsible of heterogeneity in the grafted species. Also EXAFS spectroscopy, often used to investigate the local structure of amorphous systems, still did not fully elucidate the structure of Cr2+ sites due to the low Cr loading (0.5 wt%) and to its high reactivity toward O2/H2O poisons. Highly diluted systems should be measured in fluores- cence mode, a request that increases the acquisition times,making the contamination problems more severe.295298 Finally, the absence of a structural model and the difficulty in treating open shell systems makes a computational approach not straightforward.137,299,300 Indirect information on the coordination environment of Cr2+ sites have been obtained by vibrational spectroscopies of probe molecules. Interaction with CO was studied by in situ IR since the mid-seventies,16,301,302 probing the formation at room temperature of non classical161,162 (prevailing s-donation) carbonyls on a heterogeneity of Cr2+ sites. The nature of carbonyls turns to classical161,162 one (prevailing p-back donation) upon lowering the temperature (increasing the coverage), with a spectacular change in the IR spectra (from blue to cyan curves in Fig. 19a).
The whole set of spectra has been interpreted in terms of multiple CO addition model on three different surface families of isolated CrA, CrB, and CrC sites,16,302306 characterized by an increasing number of oxygen ligands. The scheme reported in Fig. 19b depicts this interpretation, that is summarized hereafter. Experiments performed at 300 K result in the appearance of the well known RT-triplet (bands at n(CO) = 2191, 2184, and 2179 cm1 in the blue spectrum of Fig. 19a) and are considered the fingerprint of the Cr2+/SiO2 system.
The 2191 cm1 peak is the stretching mode of CO s-bonded on a Cr2+ site possessing a high polarizing ability, named as B site, and able to coordinate only one CO molecule at
RT: CrB(CO). The 2184, and 2179 cm1 bands have been
assigned to symmetric and antisymmetric modes of a dicarbonyl formed at CrA sites: CrA(CO)2. CrC is not able to coordinate CO at RT.
The CrA and CrB families are able to coordinate further CO ligands at low temperature/high pressure (grey and cyan spectra in Fig. 19a), implying that the involved CrA and CrB species are both highly coordinatively unsaturated (although at different degrees). On such sites CrA(CO)3 and CrA(CO)3 are formed, both characterized by there n(CO) stretching modes: see Fig. 19b, violet and orange dotted vertical lines,respectively. The weak shoulder at B2200 cm1 (observable only at high CO pressure) indicates that at this stage CO ligands are filling also CrC family of unsaturated and weaker sites forming CrC(CO) adducts.
The hypothesis schematized in Fig. 19b implies that the formation of linear carbonyls, which progressive inset on Cr2+ sites implies a ligand displacement (adjacent surface siloxane groups) in order to allow the progressive Cr2+ - Cr2+(CO) - Cr2+(CO)2 - Cr2+(CO)3 evolution, thus adsorption-induced surface reconstruction. This behaviour is the direct evidence of the unique role of the surface in the optimization of the CrCO interaction. More recently Damin et al.307 performed in situ Raman experiments highlighting the presence of specific surface modes involving Cr2+ emerging from the silica background,because of the resonant intensification. These modes are signifi- cantly perturbed upon CO adsorption (insets in Fig. 19a). This is a clear, although indirect, proof that an important rearrange- ment of the local environment of the Cr2+ site at the silica surface occurs upon CO adsorption.
The first direct structural proof of such an adsorption induced Cr2+ mobility, foreseen by IR spectroscopy, came in 2010 only. Gianolio et al.233 performing an in situ, tempera- ture dependent, Cr K-edge EXAFS experiment proved that Cr2+ species grafted on SiO2 are extracted from the surface upon CO adsorption at 100 K exhibiting an increase of the average CrO distance of DRCrO = +0.08 A . At room temperature, low CO coverages, (blue curves in Fig. 19a and c) surface siloxane are still present in the local environment of Cr2+, preventing the adsorption of CO on sites CrC and limiting the CO addition to mono- and di-carbonyls On CrA and CrB sites,respectively.
Under such circumstances,the Cr2+  CO interaction can not be fully optimized, it is dominated by electrostatic and s-donation effects and the p-back donation is not fully operative, the D n(CO) is positive and we are dealing with non-classical carbonyls.161163 At low temperature, high CO coverages (cyan curves in Fig. 19a and c), the cooperative effect of three CO molecules on sites CrA and CrB allows (i) the displacement of adjacent siloxane ligands and the extraction of the Cr2+ ion from the silica surface (DRCrO = +0.08 A ). These combined effects allows a rearrangement of the Cr2+  CO interaction where the p-back donation can now be fully operative dominating the nature of the metalcarbonyl bond: D n(CO) becomes negative and the CrA,B(CO)3 complexes are transformed into classical carbonyls.161163 This structural flexibility is the key for understanding the catalytic activity of Cr2+ sites in presence of adsorbates.
Reversible modification of the active sites upon adsorption/ desorption of adsorbates have been already revealed by in situ IR (and /or Raman) combined with EXAFS in the case of isomorphously substituted TiIV species in TS-1308311 of counterions in zeolites,211,213,312 (discussed in section 3.2.2) an in the parent Ni2+/SiO2 case, as documented by Martra et al.231,232 In all cases these structural data, coupled with other spectroscopic results and ab initio calculations, have been of high relevance in achieving an overall comprehension of the site reactivity.

Carbonyls extended surfaces The extended surfaces obtained on sintered oxides, halides and metals represented since decades a materials-bridge able to connect the world of Surface Science, using perfect and clean vacuum-cleaved single crystal surfaces or thin films, to the world of Catalysis, using complex, hill-defined but highly active high surface area materials.10,14,138,182,298,313376 In section 3.3, some selected examples on the characterization of such class of materials with in situ IR spectroscopy is reported.
3.3.1
Coverage evolution of the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on extended oxide and halides surfaces: Dynamic and static shifts. Moving from CO adsorbed on isolated surface sites (section 3.2) to CO adsorbed on extended surfaces, the vibra- tional features of the adsorbed molecules became significantly more complex, see Fig. 20. This is due to the appearance of a coverage (y) dependence that progressively modifies the spectra from the lowest coverages (y - 0 limit) to the highest coverages (y - ymax limit). In most cases a 1 : 1 surface stoichiometry is reached and ymax = 1, but sometimes geometrical hindrance limitations among CO adsorbates may result in ymax o 1.
Anyhow, this shift will be defined as D n in the following:
D
n = n(CO)y-ymax n(CO)y-0 (6) Fig. 19 Part (a): Evolution of IR spectra of Cr2+/SiO2 (in the nCO region) as a function of CO coverage (black vacuo; blue: PCO = 100 Torr at 300 K; cyan: PCO = 100 Torr at 100 K; grey: intermediate coverages). Insets evidences the perturbation of Raman surface modes involving Cr2+ upon CO adsorption at RT (black in vacuo, lex = 442 nm; blue +CO , lex = 325 nm). Part (b): Schematic assignment of the carbonyl bands as a function of the CO coverage (driven by pressure/temperature depending IR experiments) according to the multiple CO addition model on three different surface families of sites: CrA, CrB, and CrC.

Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 4973 This shift has been ascribed to changes in lateral inter- actions among adsorbates.
As discussed by many authors,10,138,182,334,377394 in overlayers formed by very weakly adsorbed diatomic species, the interaction among the oscillators is essentially of the through space type. These interactions occur among the static and dynamic dipoles of the diatomic species. For this reason, the shift D n is the sum of two contributions:
D
n = D nstat + D ndyn (7) When the interaction energies become larger than those characteristic of simple physiosorption processes, other static effects must be considered as well, which, more appropriately,are classified as chemical. These effects, being transmitted through the solid, are also called through solid effects. Two types of chemical effects can be proposed: inductive and relaxation effects (which are not always independent). The first effect is associated with electronic density changes at a given site induced by adsorption at a neighboring site. This effect is absent when overlap forces are not operating (as e.g. is the case of CO on MgO(001), where electrostatic polarization forces are absolutely predominant). The relaxation effect is a through solid effect associated with changes in surface relaxa- tion associated with the formation of adlayers. In fact, upon Fig. 20 Coverage-dependent IR spectra of natural CO (12CO : 13CO = 99 : 1) dosed on selected oxides and halides (full line curves). The vertical blue arrows indicates the optical thickness of the samples (a.u. = absorbance units); the horizontal red arrows indicates the overall shift
D
n = n(CO)y-ymax n(CO)y-0. In the case of LaCr2O3, the red and green arrows were used to discriminate between the D n undergone by Cr3+  CO and La3+  CO adducts, respectively. On MgCr2O4 CO is adsorbed on Cr3+ sites only. The investigated TiO2 sample is a Degussa P25 sample, composed by anatase with small amounts of rutile. The dotted line curves reported for a-Cr2O3 and CuCl represent the y - ymax IR spectrum collected dosing 12CO-diluted 12CO/13CO isotopic mixture; from these spectra the value of D nstat can be directly obtained (violet horizontal arrows). For the CuCl case the n(CO) is plotted vs. PCO for both highly crystalline (red circles) and highly dispersed phase supported on g-Al2O3. Similar spectra obtained for the MgO and NiO systems are reported in Fig. 21, and Fig. 26a, respectively.

Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 adsorption at a given cationic position, the positive ions move towards an energetically more favorable position and the same do the negative ions in nearest neighbor positions and so on.
Although the effect is dying away with a few lattice constants,it is evident that adsorption at a given site modifies the structural situation in a small but non-negligible circular area around the adsorption centre, thus perturbing the adsorptive properties of other cationic sites within this circle. This effect is always present and is expected to have greater importance for chemisorption or for e.g. the CO/ZnO system (because of the tetrahedral coordination of zinc and oxygen) and on high index faces of other oxides exposing ions in low coordination sites (vide infra).
Experimentally, when dosing natural CO on given surface,only the overall shift (D n = D nstat + D ndyn) is obtained. The relative values of D nstat and D ndyn are evaluated by means of IR experiments performed with 12CO-diluted isotope mixtures,suggested by Hammaker et al.,378 which removes the dynamic coupling between 12CO and 13CO oscillators in diluted 12CO/13CO (x : y) mixtures with y c x (typically x = 515 and y = 9585). So the shift undergone by the minority of 12CO oscillators is subjected to the static shift only, because 12CO are statistically surrounded by 13CO oscillators, that does not couple with them as they are out of resonance:
D
nstat = D n(12CO in diluted 12CO/13CO mixtures) (8) Once D nstat has been measured from the experiments with diluted 12CO-13CO mixtures, eqn (8), then the value of D ndyn can be directly obtained from the D n value measured with natural CO simply inverting eqn (7). Table 2 reports of several halides and oxides the experimental values of the
12CO
stretching frequencies n(CO)y-0 and n(CO)y-ymax obtained from IR experiments performed dosing natural CO, and the
n(CO)y-ymax obtained from diluted isotopic mixtures. As discussed above, these values allow to obtain D n, D nstat and
D
ndyn. Available from literature data, also reported in Table 2 is the dynamic polarizability398,399 (av) of CO adsorbed on the different surfaces. av is obtained from D ndyn following the modified Hammaker equation:378 [( n(CO)y-0 + D ndyn)/ n(CO)y-0]2 = 1 + (y av S0)/(1 + y ae S0),(9) where ( n(CO)y-0 + D ndyn) is the stretching frequency at y - ymax in absence of static effects, ae is the electronic polarizability (ae = 1.98 A 3)380 and S0 is the direct dipolar sum. The free CO molecule is characterized by a0 v = 0.057 A
3:
the larger is the variation of av from a0 v, the stronger is the interaction of CO with the surface. From the data reported in Table 2, this occurs for NiO, a-Cr2O3 and CuCl.
The complexity of the IR spectroscopy of CO adsorbed on well defined oxide and halides surfaces is well documented by the set of coverage-dependent spectra reported in Fig. 20 (for ZnO,138 a-Cr2O3,334,383,384,389,400 MgCr2O4,10 LaCr2O3,10 TiO2 10,397 and CuCl),390 Fig. 21 (for MgO)14,17,182,389,401404 and Fig. 26a (for NiO).182,405407 The main components of the IR bands reported in those Figures are briefly commented on.
ZnO. The IR spectra of increasing doses of CO adsorbed at 77 K on ZnO pretreated at 673 K under vacuum are illustrated in Fig. 20. These spectra are characterized by strong absorp- tions in the 21902168-cm1 range.10,138,408 These absorptions,centered at frequencies higher than that of CO gas, correspond to polarized CO species s-bonded at the carbon end on Zn2+ sites. At y - 0 a single peak (due to the superposition of two unresolved components), tailing into the low frequency region,is observed at 2190 cm1. Upon increasing y, the A peak gradually shifts to lower frequencies and then declines while new bands (B, B0, B00) appear and disappear in succession. For y - 1 a single narrow component at 2168 cm1 (C band) dominates. The overall shift is D n = 22 cm1, being
D
ndyn = +6 cm1 and D nstat = 28 cm1, see Table 2. Like the A peak, also the C band is composite as can be clearly seen at intermediate coverages where two components are detected.
Table 2 CO stretching frequencies of natural CO (12CO : 13CO = 99 : 1) adsorbed on different halides and oxides at both low (y - 0) and high (y - ymax) coverages and of isotopic mixtures at high coverage (12CO : 13CO = x : y, being 5 o x o 15 : 95 > y > 85). From these experimentally measured n(CO) frequencies, the overall (D n), the dynamic (D ndyn) and the static (D nstat) shifts can be obtained according to eqn (6)(8). When available, also the dynamic polarizability (av) of adsorbed CO has been reported. Note that a0 v = 0.057 A 3 for the unperturbed CO molecule in the gas phase. Some of the PCO-dependent IR spectra used to obtain the data resumed in this table are reported in Fig. 20, Fig. 21c and Fig. 26a.

Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 4975 The composite structure of the A and C peaks has been attributed to CO adsorbed on Zn2+ sites located on (10 10) and (11 20) faces.10,138 The stepwise evolution of the spectra of adsorbed CO as a function of coverage is a unique charac- teristic of ZnO: the five bands arise from the stepwise occupa- tion of the surface Zn2+ sites, and correspond to different surroundings of any given CO molecules.138,385,386 a-Cr2O3. At low coverage Cr3+  CO adducts are observed at 2181 cm1. On the basis of the relative abundance of the faces defining the microcrystals shown (determined by a parallel HRTEM study), the 2179, 2172 cm1 doublet (y - 1) were assigned to CO on 5-fold and 4-fold coordinated Cr3+ ions of the ( 2116) face, while the peak at 2167 cm1 can be safely attributed to CO end-on adsorbed on Cr3+ ions of the (01 12) face.334,383,384,389,400 The overall shift is D n = 14 cm1, being

MgCr2O4. A preliminary HRTEM study revealed that the investigated MgCr2O4 spinel is composed of highly crystalline single crystal particles mainly exposing the (111) and (311) faces. The IR spectrum of adsorbed CO is dominated by the spectroscopic manifestations of Cr3+  CO adducts formed on the (111) face. At y - 0, the major peak is centered at 2169 cm1, which gradually shifts down to 2157 cm1 in the y - 1 limit, resulting in D n = 12 cm1, D ndyn = +10 cm1 and D nstat = 22 cm1, see Table 2. It has been shown that Mg2+ cations are not exposed to CO,10 so that all the spectro- scopy reported in Fig. 20 is related to the formation of Cr3+  CO adducts only. In addition to the main peak in the spectra of Fig. 20, two weak bands in the 21702185 cm1 range are detected which also slightly shift with coverage.
These bands are tentatively attributed by Zecchina et al.10 to CO adsorbed on Cr3+ centres located on (311) face or on edges or steps.
LaCr2O3.
Conversely to what was observed for the MgCr2O4 case, both Cr3+ and La3+ contribute to the IR spectra measured dosing CO on LaCr2O3.10 The spectra at increasing PCO adsorbed at 77 K on LaCrO3 activated at 1100 K show two main bands in the 21802165 cm1 and 21622155 cm1 range (see Fig. 20). Both components are gradually red-shifted by increasing y. By comparison with the IR spectra of CO dosed on La2O3 system409 and on a-Cr2O3 Fig. 21 Coverage dependence of the IR spectra of CO dosed at 60 K on hsa, sintered and smoke MgO samples: parts (a), (b) and (c), respectively.
All spectra have been vertically shifted for the sake of clarity. The decrease of the band intensity by moving from high (a) to low (c) surface area samples is remarkable. Parts (a0) abd (c0) reports the TEM micrographs of hsa and smoke MgO samples. Part (d): two structures of CO bonded to pairs of Mg2+ at step sites, responsible to the weak absorption at 21502146 cm1. Parts (ef): comparison of the IR spectra of CO adsorbed at 60 K and equilibrium pressure ranging from 103 (bottom spectrum in part e) up to 60 Torr (top spectrum in part e) on MgO smoke and at constant pressure and variable temperature on the (001) surface of UHV cleaved single crystal MgO (p-polarized spectra; Part f).

The band associated to Cr3+  CO adducts is subjected to the following shifts: D n = 14 cm1,
D
ndyn = +13 cm1 and D nstat = 27 cm1, while smaller shifts are observed for the La3+  CO: D n = 6 cm1,
D
ndyn = +7 cm1 and D nstat = 13 cm1, see Table 2.
TiO2. Degussa P25 titanium dioxide is composed mainly of the anatase phase with small amounts of rutile. Morpho- logically, the microcrystals are well defined, preferentially exposing the [010] face. The singleton measured at y - 0, is charaterized by a n(CO) = 2193 cm1, while the spectrum of CO adsorbed at maximum coverage (see Fig. 20) is dominated by a band at 2180 cm1.397 The extremely narrow bandwidth (FWHM o 1.5 cm1) of this component suggests that the respective Ti4+  CO complexes are formed on very regular surface planes and that the observed band at y = 1 is the collective in-phase stretching mode of an ordered 2-dimensional layer of parallel CO molecules polarized by 5-fold coordinated ions exposed on the predominant [010] planes. The following shifts have been obtained: D n = 13 cm1, D ndyn = +4 cm1 and D nstat = 17 cm1, see Table 2. These figures and the value of the dynamic polarizability av = 0.025 A 3, suggest that the surface Ti4+  CO bonds are dominated by electrostatic (polarization) forces.
The successive accurate
HRTEM
and FTIR investigation by Martra410 indicates clearly that commercial TiO2 samples (P25 by Degussa and TiO2 by Merck) are significantly different materials.
CuCl. The case of CuCl is quite particular. The IR spectra performed with natural CO resulted in an almost coverage independent n(CO),390 being D n = 2 cm1, see Table 2 and Fig. 20. However, this invariance is due to an almost perfect balance between two opposite and comparable effects,being D ndyn = +11 cm1 and D nstat = 13 cm1. When CuCl is obtained by ethylene reduction of highly dispersed CuCl2/Al2O3, the catalyst for ethylene oxychlorination,391,411414 then an important global shift is obtained. In this case
D
n = 14 cm1,391,393,394 see blue squares in Fig. 20. This impressive change in the PCO dependence of the IR spectra is due to the fact that supported CuCl is so highly dispersed (about 50% of Cu atoms are surface atoms) that there is no extended face to allow dipoledipole interaction. Under such circumstances, as demonstrated by an isotopic mixture experiment,391 the dynamic shift is switched off(D ndyn = 0) and D n = D nstat.MgO. On highly perfect MgO smoke crystals182 (vide infra Fig. 21c) the n(CO) moves from 2157 cm1 (for y - 0) down to 2148 cm1 (for y - ymax), resulting in is D n = 6 cm1,being D ndyn = +3 cm1 and D nstat = 11 cm1, and in av = 0.031 A 3, see Table 2.
NiO. The evolution of the IR spectra of CO dosed on low surface area NiO crystals as a function of coverage is reported in section 4.3 to allow a direct comparison with the series of spectra obtained dosing NO on the same material (vide infra Fig. 26a). On such a highly sintered NiO sample,the y - 0 limit results in a Ni2+ 5cus  CO characterized by a stretching frequency of 2152 cm1, that progressively shifts downwards to 2136 cm1 for (y E 1), resulting in
D
n = 16 cm1. With the aid of the isotopic substitution method, Escalona Platero et al.415 have calculated that
D
ndyn = +27 cm1 and D nstat = 43 cm1, and that av = 0.256 A 3, see Table 2. All these values are definitely higher than those found on MgO: this means that both the permanent and the dynamic dipoles and the associated charge oscillations from the adsorbate to the surface and vice versa during the stretching vibration, which have direct influence on av are substantially increased upon adsorption on NiO. This in turn indicates that the Ni2+  CO bond has not a purely electrostatic character (as in the Mg2+  CO case) and that some dp overlap forces play a small but definite role.416 The quantification of the chemical contribution in the Ni2+  CO bond is difficult to make on the basis of the IR results: however by considering the modest enhancement of av and the very reversible character of the CO species even at low temperature,it has been concluded that chemical forces still play only a minor role.10 Under these circumstances the assumption that the static shift is mainly due to dipoledipole (through space) effects can still be considered to be a valid approximation. The presence of a small back-donation in the Ni2+  CO bond also explains why the frequency of the CO peak is lower than that observed on MgO.
Summary. Besides the main IR band, which shifts upon PCO increase has been widely debated above, the IR spectra reported in Fig. 20, Fig. 21 and Fig. 26a contain several other minor features that allows a deep knowledge of the minority surface adsorbing sites, such as defects, edges and corners, that are usually the most reactive ones sites. The assignment of all such minor IR bands is however beyond the purposes of this review, and we refer to the quoted references for a complete description. Exception will be made for the MgO case, that has been chosen to be described in detail in the next Subsection as typical case study of the possibility to bridge the gap between Surface Science and Catalysis.
3.3.2
Tuning the surface area of MgO: A means to bridge the gap between surface science and catalysis. As clearly demonstrated for a-Cr2O3,340 NiO,417 CO14,418 and other oxides or halides10,248,377,389 the gap between the single crystals and polycrystalline samples is not so profound as it has been depicted in early studies. In this review we chosen MgO as case study to support this thesis.
The particles of MgO, even when prepared in highly dispersed form (200300 m2 g1), show a great tendency to assume a cubic habit and to expose low index (100) faces and terraces.10 In other words, these particles are intrinsically possessing the properties of single crystals (100) faces, the only difference being represented by the larger proportion of sites located on the edges and on the corners of the cubelets, see the TEM micrographs reported in Fig. 8a and Fig. 21a0. As a con- sequence it can be safely hypothesized that, as far as MgO is concerned, the above mentioned gap of understanding could be diminished and rationalized by studying samples with Downloaded by Indiana University - Purdue University at Indianapolis on 19 September 2012 Published on 01 November 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/C0CS00117A This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 Chem. Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 4977 specific surface areas gradually varying from 200300 to a few m2 g1, reaching asymptotically the single crystal surface (Fig. 21af).14 The IR spectra of increasing doses of CO adsorbed at 77 K on three different MgO samples of increasing crystallites perfection, hereafter hsa (already considered for the inter- action with H2, see section 2.5.1) sintered and smoke,are reported in parts (a), (b) and (c) of Fig. 21 (surface area E200, 35 and 10 m2 g1 respectively).10,389 The main features of the spectra illustrated in Fig. 21ac can be inter- preted in terms of Mg2+  CO adducts as detailed in the following: (i) the weak adsorption at about 2203 cm1, clearly observed only on the high surface sample (Fig. 21a), is due to Mg2+ 3cus  CO adducts; (ii) the absorption at 21702164 cm1 (Fig. 21a and b) appears as a shoulder at high coverages and becomes a well defined peak only for y - 0 and is ascribed to CO adsorbed on Mg2+ 4cus ions located on edges and steps (absent on smoke, see Fig. 21c); (iii) the dominant absorption at 21572148 cm1 (for y - ymax) is assigned to CO adsorbed on the ions of the predominant (001) faces: the narrow FWHM (4.5 cm1, for y - ymax) of this band in the most perfect sample (smoke), is remarkably small (Fig. 21c) and is correlated with the high perfection of the crystals which minimize the inhomogeneous broadening effects; (iv) the weak absorption at 21502146 cm1, distinctly observable on high surface area sample for y -0 only, has been assigned to CO bonded to pairs of Mg2+ at step sites, as schematized in the two structures reported in Fig. 21d.
The detailed comparison of the spectra obtained on smoke (Fig. 21e) and on single crystal (100) faces419 (Fig. 21f) indicates that the differences are negligible and that MgO crystals of the smoke sample exhibits (100) surfaces of single crystal quality, see the TEM micrograph reported in Fig. 21c0. The signal to noise of the spectra obtained on the MgO smoke sample is however two orders of magnitude higher than those obtained on the vacuum cleaved single because of the higher number of surface atoms exposed to the IR beam.
The same temperature dependent IR experiments that allowed to determine the heat of adsorption of H2 on the three different class of surface sites (Mg2+ 3cus, Mg2+ 4cus and Mg2+ 5cus) on MgO, see Fig. 9 in section 2.5, has been applied by Spoto et al.14 also on the CO adsorption on MgO.
The slopes give the adsorption enthalpies, which are very close for CO adsorbed on edge species: 21.9 and 22.6 kJ mol1 for the 2161 and 2170 cm1 bands respectively (linear and bridged, see Fig. 21d, Mg2+ 4cus sites). As for the band due to CO adsorbed on regular (100) terraces, the measured adsorption enthalpy is much lower: 12.5 kJ mol1. The heat of adsorption of CO on Mg2+ 3cus could not be extracted because the Mg2+ 3cus  CO was not desorbed upon heating the sample from 60 to 300 K.14
3.3.3
Supported palladium nanoparticles: How surface science can help catalyst characterization. Among noble metals, Palladium has been chosen as a case study because of its relevance in hydrogenation420426 and coupling reactions,427435 the most relevant being the MizorokiHeck436439 and the Suzuki440442 reactions. As reviewed here below the relevance of Pd in catalysis has driven an important effort of the surface science community to understand in deep detail the adsorption and reactivity properties of the most exposed Pd faces.
Vibrational spectroscopies such as infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS, also known as reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy, RAIRS),443446 sum frequency generation (SFG)447,448 spectroscopy and high resolution electron energy loss (HREELS),449 of adsorbed CO has been widely employed to characterize vacuum cleaved Pd(hkl) single crystal surfaces.335,338,348,361,450459 Surface science techniques have then been able to also characterize well defined metal clusters deposited on suitable substrates.446,460464 Three main categories of carbonyls can be identified, which are characterized by rather defined frequency regions for the CO stretching mode:456,465,466 (i) linear carbonyls (on-top sites) usually absorb in the B21302000 cm1 stretching region; (ii) 2-fold bridged carbonyls are characterized by a n(CO) in the B20001850 cm1 interval; (iii) 3-fold bridged carbonyls (on hollow sites) are defined by a CO stretching mode in the B19201800 cm1 region. In all cases we are dealing with classical carbonyls, where the p-back donation effects, causing a red shift of the n(CO), are largely dominant with respect to s-donation and electrostatic effects, both contributing to a blue shift of the n(CO),161,162,174 see section 3.1. The frequency ranges of linear, 2-fold and 3-fold bridged carbonyls reported above are quite large as different phenomena influence the observed n(CO). Due to the progressive build up of lateral lateral interactions among adsorbed CO molecules, the CO stretching frequencies of linear and bridged carbonyls show important blue shifts upon increasing y,443,458,467469 hereafter given in CO monolayers. It is worth noting that the exact frequency interval of the three categories of carbonyls, as well as the precise n(CO) vs. y evolution, may change slightly as a function of the experimental conditions (temperature, equilibrium pressure, etc.) and from author to author.335,338,348,361,443,450459 As far as Pd(111) surface is concerned (Fig. 22b), the evolution vs. y of the IRAS spectra measured upon dosing CO can be summarized as follows. (i) At the lowest y, only three-fold bridged carbonyls are observed, at a distinctly low
n(CO) around 1810 cm1.443,458,467 (ii) Increasing y up to
B0.5, CO molecules occupy either two-fold bridging sites or
three-fold hollow sites. This structure is essentially characterized by a band around 1920 cm1.458 (iii) Within y = 0.50.7,various complex overlayer structures have been reported.443,457,458 In particular, around y = 0.7, it has been suggested that some CO molecules are forced into a-top sites with a simultaneous reconstruction of the two-fold structure, resulting into a shift of the two-fold band up to 1946 cm1 and into the con- temporaneous appearance of a band around 2080 cm1, due to linear carbonyls (Fig. 22b).443 (iv) A further increase of y results in a progressive strength of these two last components that simultaneously shift upwards to 1952 and 2090 cm1,respectively.458 It is worth noticing that at these y values a small component around 2090 cm1 is often present in the IRAS spectra see e.g. Fig. 1 and 2 in ref. 467 or Fig. 2a in ref. 458 even if it is rarely discussed. This component, clearly in the region of linear carbonyls, can be assigned to carbonyls formed on a small fraction of defects. (v) At maximum coverage (y Z 0.75) a new surface rearrangement occurs, Downloaded by Indiana University - Purdue University at Indianapolis on 19 September 2012 Published on 01 November 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/C0CS00117A 4978 Chem.

A much simpler spectral evolution has been observed upon increasing y on the Pd(100) face.458 In this case only two-fold bridged carbonyls species have been observed whose n(CO) moves from 1895 cm1 (y E 0.05) up to 1995 cm1 at ymax, see Fig. 22a.458,470 From the in depth studies made by the surface science community, summarized above for the Pd(100)/CO and Pd(111)/CO systems taking benefit from the polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRAS) study of Ozensoy and Goodman,458 it will be Fig. 22 Part (a): In situ infrared reflection absorption (IRA) spectra for CO adsorption on Pd(100) at PCO = 1  106 Torr.
