Development of the Colic-Salvetti correlation-energy formula into a functional of the electron density Chengteh Lee, %'eitao Yang, and Robert G. Parr Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27514 (Received 20 May 1987; revised manuscript received 27 August 1987) A correlation-energy formula due to Colle and Salvetti [Theor. Chim. Acta 3'7, 329 (1975)], in which the correlation energy density is expressed in terms of the electron density and a Laplacian of the second-order Hartree-Fock density matrix,is restated as a formula involving the density and local kinetic-energy density.On insertion of gradient expansions for the 1ocal kinetic-energy density,density-functional formulas for the correlation energy and correlation potential are then obtained.Through numerical calculations on a number of atoms, positive ions, and molecules, of both open- and closed-shell type, it is demonstrated that these formulas,like the original Colle- Salvetti formulas,give correlation energies within a few percent.
I. INTRODUCTION
Interest in calculation of the correlation energy continues unabated. ' %e here report a new development,in which the Colle-Salvetti formula for calculating correlation energy from the Hartree-Fock second-order density ma- trix is converted into a density-functional formula.Let p(r) be the Hartree-Fock electron density and p2 "(r,,r2) be the diagonal element of the second-order Hartree- Fock reduced density matrix,

dtv3dr4 x p2" can also be expressed in terms of interparticle coordinates,p2 "(r,s), where ri+r2 f 2 , s=r,r2 .
The Colle-Salvetti formula for correlation energy then is r P2 "(r,r) 1+bP(r) [V,Pz "(r,s)], oexP[ cP ' (r)] p(r) 1+dp(r) (2) where a =0.049 18b=0.132, c =0.2533, and d =0.349.This formula was arrived at by Colle and Salvetti by a theoretical analysis accompanied by a series of approxi- mations,beginning (essentially) from the reasonable pro- position that the second-order density matrix including correlation may approximated by the Hartree-Pock second-order density matrix times a correlation factor.The constants a, b, c, and d in the final formula were ob- tained by a f][tting procedure using only the Hartree- Fock orbital for the hehum atom.Colle and Salvetti demonstrated that Eq. (3) gave good predicted correla- tion energies for atoms and molecules.They also pro- vided and tested a generalized form for open-shell sys- tems.Here we carry on the analysis of Eq. (3) itself.

For atoms, Clementi wave functions were used;for molecules,wave functions of Snyder and Basch.
These are in complete agreement with the re- sults of Colle and Salvetti,as they should be since Eq.
(10) follows directly from Eq. (3).
Consider next a system in a state described by a gen- eral single determinant,in which the a-spin electron density difFers from the P-spin electron density. (In the open-shell restricted Hartree-Fock case, which here is our primary concern, the a-spin orbitals are the same as the P-spin orbitals in the closed-shell part, but an excess of lx- or p-spin orbitals in the rest. ) Equation (4} is re- placed by p2 "(r1,r2) =-,'p(rl )p(r, ) so that p,""(r,r)= ,'p'(r) ,'[p',(r)+pp(r)],(12)

III. GRADIENT EXPANSION FGRMUI.AS
Equations (10) and (15) lack of being pure density functionals only because of the appearance in them of the Hartree-Pock local kinetic-energy densities tHF, tHF,and t HF, which depend on individual orbital densities.
If the view is adopted that the orbitals are the Kohn-Sham orbitals,then these quantities too are functionals of the density,and Eqs.
(10) and (15) are pure density- functional expressions [as would be Eq. (3) with this in- terpretation].
Eschewing that view for the presentone can turn Eqs.
(10) and (15) into explicit density- tT(r)=CP(r)'i,
C= ,
', (3n ) i (16) In terms of this, the conventional closed-shell gradient expansion of tHF gives,to zero order,to second order,tHF(r)=tTF(r)+[ ,'tg (r)+ ,', V' p],l functional formulas by using gradient expansionswhere- by t HF is expanded about the Thomas-Fermi local kinetic-energy density tTF.The Thomas-Fermi kinetic-energy density is given by DEVELOPMENT OF THE COLLE-SALVETTI CORRELATION-and so on.An alternative formula is provided by the mean-path approximation,to zero order,tH(r)=tTF(r)+[ ,'tn (r)

The zero-order formulas are obtained by striking out the terms within the parentheses in each case. The zero-order mean-path formula is obtained by replacing ,', with ,', in these terms.Table I gives numerical results obtained from these formulas.The second-order gradient formulas are hardly distin- guishable from the original Eqs. (10) and (15) and provide excellent representations of actual correlation energies.The conventional zero-order gradient formula and the zero-order mean-path formula are not quite as good.TABLE I.
