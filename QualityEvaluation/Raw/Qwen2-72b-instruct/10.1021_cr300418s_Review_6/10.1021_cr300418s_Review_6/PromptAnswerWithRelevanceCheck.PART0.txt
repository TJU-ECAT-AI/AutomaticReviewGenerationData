[1] "To do useful computations on a catalytic system, one has to deal with systems with a large number of electrons and perform a large number of calculations for all possible adsorption sites and reaction paths. In practice, only density functional theory (DFT) is efficient enough to satisfy these requirements."
[2] "The ordinary GGA-DFT (GGA stands for generalized-gradient approximation) does not give the correct electronic structure for most oxides of transition metals and rare-earth metals."
[3] "A temporary palliation is provided by the DFT+U method (165-167) in which a Hubbard-like correction is added to the DFT theory to prevent the delocalization of the d- or f-orbitals of the cations."
[4] "An alternative to GGA+U is to use a hybrid functional such as B3LYP (177) or HSE. (178-186) Both methods add some HartreeFock exchange energy to the GGA functional."
[5] "It is therefore preferable to use versions of DFT that include the van der Waals interaction, but this has been done infrequently for oxides."
[6] "Because we have very few precise binding energy measurements on well-defined, clean oxide surfaces, (30, 159-164) it is not clear to what extent GGA-DFT makes errors when calculating total energy differences, which are the quantities most important to catalysis."

1.Density functional theory (DFT) is essential for computational methods in catalysis due to its efficiency in handling large systems with numerous electrons, enabling the calculation of adsorption sites and reaction paths. However, standard GGA-DFT has limitations in accurately representing the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth metal oxides. The DFT+U method offers a temporary solution by adding a Hubbard-like correction to prevent orbital delocalization. Hybrid functionals like B3LYP and HSE are alternatives that improve accuracy by incorporating Hartree-Fock exchange energy. The inclusion of van der Waals interactions in DFT versions is beneficial but not commonly applied to oxides. The lack of precise binding energy data on clean oxide surfaces makes the accuracy of GGA-DFT in calculating total energy differences uncertain. Computational methods allow for the exploration of new catalytic materials that can then be synthesized experimentally.

1.密度泛函理论（DFT）在催化计算方法中至关重要，因为它在处理包含大量电子的大型系统时效率高，能够计算吸附位点和反应路径。然而，标准GGA-DFT在准确表示过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物的电子结构方面存在局限性。DFT+U方法通过添加类似Hubbard的校正来防止轨道离域，提供了一种临时解决方案。B3LYP和HSE等混合泛函是通过加入Hartree-Fock交换能量来提高准确性的替代方案。虽然包含范德华相互作用的DFT版本是有益的，但它们在氧化物中并不常见。由于在清洁氧化物表面上缺乏精确的结合能数据，GGA-DFT在计算总能量差时的准确性尚不清楚。计算方法允许探索新的催化材料，然后这些材料可以被实验合成。

1.Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT), are essential for accurately predicting the catalytic properties of doped oxides, as they require detailed knowledge of the surface morphology and composition under reaction conditions. DFT is efficient enough to handle the large number of electrons and calculations needed for catalytic systems. Small oxide cluster models can also be used for more accurate quantum chemistry methods, although the catalytic activity of these clusters is size-dependent. The choice of cluster size is critical, as too large a cluster requires DFT, while too small a cluster can lead to inaccurate models. Challenges include the uncertainty in GGA-DFT calculations for total energy differences, which are crucial for catalysis, and the need for corrections like DFT+U to prevent the delocalization of d- or f-orbitals. Hybrid functionals like B3LYP or HSE offer alternatives to GGA+U, but require more computational resources. Van der Waals interactions are often overlooked in GGA-DFT, affecting the accuracy of calculations for certain systems. Quantum calculations on heterogeneous catalysts often neglect spin-dependent terms, which can lead to issues in spin-forbidden transitions. Electron charge assignment in molecules is a debated topic in quantum chemistry. Despite these challenges, computational methods allow for the exploration of new catalytic materials that can be synthesized experimentally if they show promise.
