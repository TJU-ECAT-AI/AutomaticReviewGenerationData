[1] "To do useful computations on a catalytic system, one has to deal with systems with a large number of electrons and perform a large number of calculations for all possible adsorption sites and reaction paths. In practice, only density functional theory (DFT) is efficient enough to satisfy these requirements."
[2] "The ordinary GGA-DFT (GGA stands for generalized-gradient approximation) does not give the correct electronic structure for most oxides of transition metals and rare-earth metals."
[3] "A temporary palliation is provided by the DFT+U method (165-167) in which a Hubbard-like correction is added to the DFT theory to prevent the delocalization of the d- or f-orbitals of the cations."
[4] "An alternative to GGA+U is to use a hybrid functional such as B3LYP (177) or HSE. (178-186) Both methods add some HartreeFock exchange energy to the GGA functional."
[5] "It is therefore preferable to use versions of DFT that include the van der Waals interaction, but this has been done infrequently for oxides."
[6] "Because we have very few precise binding energy measurements on well-defined, clean oxide surfaces, (30, 159-164) it is not clear to what extent GGA-DFT makes errors when calculating total energy differences, which are the quantities most important to catalysis."
[7] "If they are promising, the experimentalists might attempt to synthesize them."

1.Density functional theory (DFT) is a computational method that can handle the large number of electrons and perform numerous calculations for all possible adsorption sites and reaction paths on catalytic systems, making it efficient for studying catalytic activity. However, the ordinary GGA-DFT does not accurately represent the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth metal oxides. The DFT+U method, which adds a Hubbard-like correction to prevent the delocalization of d- or f-orbitals, and hybrid functionals like B3LYP or HSE, which incorporate Hartree-Fock exchange energy, are alternatives that improve the accuracy of calculations. Including van der Waals interactions in DFT versions is preferable but not commonly done for oxides. The lack of precise binding energy measurements on clean oxide surfaces makes it uncertain how much error GGA-DFT introduces when calculating total energy differences, which are crucial for catalysis. Computational methods allow for the exploration of new catalytic materials that can then be synthesized experimentally if they show promise.

1.密度泛函理论（DFT）是一种计算方法，能够处理催化系统中的大量电子，并为所有可能的吸附位点和反应路径执行大量计算，使其在研究催化活性时效率高。然而，普通的GGA-DFT无法准确表示过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物的电子结构。DFT+U方法，通过添加类似Hubbard的修正来防止d-或f-轨道的离域，以及像B3LYP或HSE这样的混合泛函，通过加入Hartree-Fock交换能，是提高计算准确性的替代方案。在DFT版本中包含范德华相互作用是可取的，但对氧化物来说并不常见。由于在清洁氧化物表面上几乎没有精确的结合能测量，因此不清楚GGA-DFT在计算对催化作用至关重要的总能量差时会产生多少误差。计算方法允许探索新的催化材料，如果它们显示出前景，实验人员可能会尝试合成它们。
