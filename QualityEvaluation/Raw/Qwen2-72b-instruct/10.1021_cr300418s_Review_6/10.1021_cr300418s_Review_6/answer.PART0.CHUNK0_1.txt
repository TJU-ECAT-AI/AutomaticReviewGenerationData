[1] "To do useful computations on a catalytic system, one has to deal with systems with a large number of electrons and perform a large number of calculations for all possible adsorption sites and reaction paths. In practice, only density functional theory (DFT) is efficient enough to satisfy these requirements."
[2] "The ordinary GGA-DFT (GGA stands for generalized-gradient approximation) does not give the correct electronic structure for most oxides of transition metals and rare-earth metals."
[3] "A temporary palliation is provided by the DFT+U method (165-167) in which a Hubbard-like correction is added to the DFT theory to prevent the delocalization of the d- or f-orbitals of the cations."
[4] "An alternative to GGA+U is to use a hybrid functional such as B3LYP (177) or HSE. (178-186) Both methods add some HartreeFock exchange energy to the GGA functional. This removes some of the interaction of the electron with itself, a feature that plagues GGA-DFT."
[5] "Because we have very few precise binding energy measurements on well-defined, clean oxide surfaces, (30, 159-164) it is not clear to what extent GGA-DFT makes errors when calculating total energy differences, which are the quantities most important to catalysis."
[6] "It is therefore preferable to use versions of DFT that include the van der Waals interaction, but this has been done infrequently for oxides."
[7] "The quantum calculations performed on heterogeneous catalysts use a Hamiltonian that does not contain spin-dependent terms (such as the spinorbit coupling)."
[8] "A long-debated issue in quantum chemistry is how to assign electron charges to an atom that is part of a molecule."
[9] "The Bader charges are the real charges of the atom in a solid or a molecule."
[10] "Formal charges do not exist. They are defined by deciding arbitrarily that oxygen in an oxide has the charge 2 and then determining the charge of the cation so that the oxide is electrically neutral."

1.Density functional theory (DFT) is a computational method that is efficient enough to handle the large number of electrons and perform numerous calculations for all possible adsorption sites and reaction paths in catalytic systems. However, the ordinary GGA-DFT does not accurately represent the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth metal oxides. The DFT+U method, which adds a Hubbard-like correction to prevent the delocalization of d- or f-orbitals, offers a temporary solution. Hybrid functionals like B3LYP or HSE, which incorporate some Hartree-Fock exchange energy, are alternatives that reduce electron self-interaction issues. The accuracy of GGA-DFT in calculating total energy differences, crucial for catalysis, is uncertain due to a lack of precise binding energy measurements. Including van der Waals interactions in DFT versions is preferable but not commonly done for oxides. Quantum calculations on heterogeneous catalysts often neglect spin-dependent terms. Electron charge assignment in molecules is a debated topic, with Bader charges being preferred over arbitrary formal charges.

1.密度泛函理论(DFT)是一种计算方法，其效率足以处理催化系统中大量的电子，并对所有可能的吸附位点和反应路径执行大量计算。然而，普通的GGA-DFT无法准确表示过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物的电子结构。DFT+U方法，通过添加类似Hubbard的修正来防止d或f轨道的离域，提供了一个临时的解决方案。像B3LYP或HSE这样的混合泛函，通过结合一些Hartree-Fock交换能，是替代方案，可以减少电子自相互作用的问题。由于缺乏精确的结合能测量，GGA-DFT在计算对催化作用至关重要的总能量差方面的准确性是不确定的。在DFT版本中包含范德华相互作用是可取的，但对氧化物来说并不常见。在异质催化剂上的量子计算通常忽略了自旋依赖项。在分子中分配电子电荷是一个有争议的话题，Bader电荷优于任意的正式电荷。
