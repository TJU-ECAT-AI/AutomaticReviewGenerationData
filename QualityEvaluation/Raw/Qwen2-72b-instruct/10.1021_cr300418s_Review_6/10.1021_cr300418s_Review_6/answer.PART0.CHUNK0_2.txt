[1] "To do useful computations on a catalytic system, one has to deal with systems with a large number of electrons and perform a large number of calculations for all possible adsorption sites and reaction paths. In practice, only density functional theory (DFT) is efficient enough to satisfy these requirements."
[2] "The ordinary GGA-DFT (GGA stands for generalized-gradient approximation) does not give the correct electronic structure for most oxides of transition metals and rare-earth metals."
[3] "A temporary palliation is provided by the DFT+U method (165-167) in which a Hubbard-like correction is added to the DFT theory to prevent the delocalization of the d- or f-orbitals of the cations."
[4] "An alternative to GGA+U is to use a hybrid functional such as B3LYP (177) or HSE. (178-186) Both methods add some HartreeFock exchange energy to the GGA functional. This removes some of the interaction of the electron with itself, a feature that plagues GGA-DFT."
[5] "Because we have very few precise binding energy measurements on well-defined, clean oxide surfaces, (30, 159-164) it is not clear to what extent GGA-DFT makes errors when calculating total energy differences, which are the quantities most important to catalysis."
[6] "It is therefore preferable to use versions of DFT that include the van der Waals interaction, but this has been done infrequently for oxides."
[7] "The quantum calculations performed on heterogeneous catalysts use a Hamiltonian that does not contain spin-dependent terms (such as the spinorbit coupling)."
[8] "A long-debated issue in quantum chemistry is how to assign electron charges to an atom that is part of a molecule."
[9] "The Bader charges are the real charges of the atom in a solid or a molecule."
[10] "Formal charges do not exist. They are defined by deciding arbitrarily that oxygen in an oxide has the charge 2 and then determining the charge of the cation so that the oxide is electrically neutral."

1.Density functional theory (DFT) is a computational method that is efficient enough to handle the large number of electrons and perform numerous calculations for all possible adsorption sites and reaction paths in catalytic systems. However, the ordinary GGA-DFT does not accurately represent the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth metal oxides. The DFT+U method, which adds a Hubbard-like correction to prevent the delocalization of d- or f-orbitals, and hybrid functionals like B3LYP or HSE, which incorporate some Hartree-Fock exchange energy, are alternatives that improve the accuracy of DFT calculations. The lack of precise binding energy measurements on clean oxide surfaces makes it uncertain how much error GGA-DFT introduces when calculating total energy differences, which are crucial for catalysis. Including van der Waals interactions in DFT calculations is preferable but not commonly done for oxides. Quantum calculations on heterogeneous catalysts often use a Hamiltonian without spin-dependent terms, leading to challenges in accurately representing spin states. Electron charges in molecules are a debated topic, with Bader charges considered the real charges of atoms in solids or molecules, while formal charges are arbitrary and do not exist.

1.密度泛函理论（DFT）是一种计算方法，其效率足以处理催化系统中大量的电子，并对所有可能的吸附位点和反应路径执行大量计算。然而，普通的GGA-DFT无法准确表示过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物的电子结构。DFT+U方法，通过添加Hubbard-like校正来防止d-或f-轨道的离域化，以及像B3LYP或HSE这样的混合泛函，通过结合一些Hartree-Fock交换能，是提高DFT计算准确性的替代方案。由于在清洁氧化物表面上精确的结合能测量很少，GGA-DFT在计算总能量差时引入了多少误差尚不清楚，而总能量差对催化作用至关重要。在DFT计算中包含范德华相互作用是可取的，但对氧化物而言并不常见。在异质催化剂上的量子计算通常使用不含自旋依赖项的哈密顿量，导致在准确表示自旋状态方面存在挑战。分子中原子的电荷是一个有争议的话题，Bader电荷被认为是固体或分子中原子的真实电荷，而形式电荷是任意的，实际上并不存在。
