[1] "Computing accurately the catalytic properties of doped oxides requires a detailed knowledge of the morphology and the composition of the surface under reaction conditions."
[2] "In practice, only density functional theory (DFT) is efficient enough to satisfy these requirements."
[3] "It is also possible to make small oxide cluster models, which allow the use of more accurate quantum chemistry methods."
[4] "Experiments on gas-phase clusters (146) and on mass-selected clusters supported on solid surfaces (147-158) show that the catalytic activity of very small clusters depends strongly on their size."
[5] "If the size becomes too large, one has to resort to DFT. If it is too small, one can do accurate calculations, but the model is inaccurate."
[6] "Because we have very few precise binding energy measurements on well-defined, clean oxide surfaces, (30, 159-164) it is not clear to what extent GGA-DFT makes errors when calculating total energy differences, which are the quantities most important to catalysis."
[7] "A temporary palliation is provided by the DFT+U method (165-167) in which a Hubbard-like correction is added to the DFT theory to prevent the delocalization of the d- or f-orbitals of the cations."
[8] "An alternative to GGA+U is to use a hybrid functional such as B3LYP (177) or HSE. (178-186)"
[9] "Another shortcoming of GGA-DFT is its inability to describe van der Waals interactions."
[10] "The quantum calculations performed on heterogeneous catalysts use a Hamiltonian that does not contain spin-dependent terms (such as the spinorbit coupling)."
[11] "A long-debated issue in quantum chemistry is how to assign electron charges to an atom that is part of a molecule."
[12] "If they are promising, the experimentalists might attempt to synthesize them."

1.Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT), are essential for accurately predicting the catalytic properties of doped oxides, as they require detailed knowledge of the surface morphology and composition under reaction conditions. DFT is efficient enough to handle the large number of electrons and calculations needed for catalytic systems. Small oxide cluster models can also be used for more accurate quantum chemistry methods, although the catalytic activity of these clusters is size-dependent. The choice of cluster size is critical, as too large a cluster requires DFT, while too small a cluster can lead to inaccurate models. Challenges include the uncertainty in GGA-DFT calculations for total energy differences, which are crucial for catalysis, and the need for corrections like DFT+U to prevent the delocalization of d- or f-orbitals. Hybrid functionals like B3LYP or HSE offer alternatives to GGA+U, but require more computational resources. Van der Waals interactions are often overlooked in GGA-DFT, affecting the accuracy of calculations for certain systems. Quantum calculations on heterogeneous catalysts often neglect spin-dependent terms, which can lead to issues in spin-forbidden transitions. Electron charge assignment in molecules is a debated topic in quantum chemistry. Despite these challenges, computational methods allow for the exploration of new catalytic materials that can be synthesized experimentally if they show promise.

1.计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT），对于准确预测掺杂氧化物的催化性质至关重要，因为这需要在反应条件下对表面形态和组成有详细的了解。DFT足够高效，可以处理催化系统所需的大量电子和计算。小型氧化物簇模型也可以用于更精确的量子化学方法，尽管这些簇的催化活性取决于其大小。簇的大小选择是关键，因为太大的簇需要使用DFT，而太小的簇会导致模型不准确。挑战包括GGA-DFT计算中对总能量差的不确定性，这对催化作用至关重要，以及需要像DFT+U这样的修正来防止d-或f-轨道的离域。B3LYP或HSE等混合泛函提供了GGA+U的替代方案，但需要更多的计算资源。GGA-DFT中往往忽略了范德华相互作用，这会影响某些系统的计算准确性。在异质催化剂上的量子计算通常忽略了自旋依赖项，这可能导致自旋禁止跃迁的问题。分子中原子电荷的分配是量子化学中一个有争议的话题。尽管存在这些挑战，计算方法允许探索新的催化材料，如果显示出前景，实验人员可能会尝试合成它们。
