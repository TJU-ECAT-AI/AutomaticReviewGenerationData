Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides have been industrially used for the production of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes. The focus of research includes the effect of CO2 on the activity for the dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-based catalysts, the role of CO2 and the reaction mechanism, and the dynamic behavior of chromium oxide species. The study also investigates the kinetic analysis for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.
