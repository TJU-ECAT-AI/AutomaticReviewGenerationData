1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides have been industrially used for the production of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes. The focus of research includes the effect of CO2 on the activity for the dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-based catalysts, the role of CO2 and the reaction mechanism, and the dynamic behavior of chromium oxide species. The study also investigates the kinetic analysis for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。但是，它确实提到硅酸盐和氧化铝支持的铬氧化物在工业上用于通过相应烷烃的脱氢生产较低的烯烃，如乙烯，丙烯和异丁烯。研究的重点包括CO2对Cr基催化剂丙烷脱氢活性的影响，CO2的作用和反应机制，以及铬氧化物物种的动态行为。该研究还调查了Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3催化剂上丙烷与CO2脱氢的动能分析。
