Supported chromium catalysts with different support composition are studied by electron spin resonance 
spectroscopy (ESR), thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA), and 27Al 
magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic 
resonance (MAS-NMR). With ESR, the presence of C?+ (y-signal) and two types of Cr3+ 
(6- and B-signals) 
are observed; however, their concentrations are support-, loading-, and pretreatment-dependent. The C?+ 
loading increases with the alumina content of the support and can be maximized after moderate reduction 
temperatures and by using relatively low Cr loadings. Dispersed C13+ (6-signal) is formed by reduction, and 
its amount increases with A1 content of the support, Cr loading, and reduction temperature. On silica- 
alumina and alumina it is stable against recalcination. CrzO3-like clusters @-signal) are observed only on 
Cr/alumina after reduction and recalcination. TGA analysis indicates an increasing interaction strength between 
Cr and the support from silica over silica-alumina to alumina. The quenchiiig of the 27Al 
lines by paramagnetic 
Cr3+ 
was observed by 27Al 
MAS-NMR measurements on the recalcined samples. This quenching effect was 
stronger on the Crlalumina sample than on the Crlsilica-alumina samples, indicating C13+ substitution in 
octahedral A1 sites. The observed differences in redox behavior and dispersion of Cr between the catalysts 
are discussed in terms of the support properties and in relation with previous results obtained by diffuse 
reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). 
Introduction 
Supported chromium catalysts are known to possess interest- 
ing catalytic 
The most important industrial 
application is in the production of polyethylene, 
known as the 
Phillips Particle Form Process.6 These catalysts are usually 
activated by a high-temperature oxidative pretreatment, followed 
by reduction using ethylene or CO.' Our knowledge of these 
catalysts is-despite large efforts-largely qualitative: different 
oxidation states (Crzf, Cr3+, Cr5+, and C#'+) and different 
molecular structures (chromate, dichromate, etc.) have been 
identified with infrared spectroscopy* 
(IR), X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopyg (XPS), 
Raman spectroscopy1Â° (RS), diffuse 
reflectance spectroscopy" (DRS), and electron spin resonance12 
(ESR). However, if one ever wants to relate these species with 
catalytic performances, quantitative measurements are necessary. 
Therefore, a research program has been set up for the 
development of methods to quantify CP+ species (with n 
between 2 and 6) and to elucidate the molecular structure of Cr 
in inorganic oxides. In previous studies,13-15 
we have reported 
(1) the quantification of Cr2+, Cr3+, and Cfi+ by diffuse 
reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) after calcination, reduction, and 
recalcination, (2) the elucidation of the molecular structure of 
Cfi+ by DRS, and (3) the interaction between different probe 
molecules and supported Cr. Under hydrated conditions, the 
molecular structure is determined by the pH at zero point of 
charge (zpc) of the support and by the Cr loading. At low Cr 
loading, the chromate:dichromate ratio increases with increasing 
alumina content of the support or pH at ZPC of the support. At 
higher loadings, Cr is more polymerized, even on an alumina 
su~port.'~ 
On calcined surfaces, the molecular structure is 
support and loading dependent. At relatively low Cr loadings, 
the dichr0mate:chromate ratio is highest for silica, zero for

alumina, and in between for silica-aluminas. Upon reduction, 
octahedral C P  
and octahedral and tetrahedral Cr2+ 
are formed. 
The ratio tetrahedral:octahedral CrZ+ 
at constant loading and 
reduction temperature depends on the support and follows the 
order silica > silica-alumina > alumina. The ratio Crz+:Cr3+ 
increases with reduction temperature 
for all supports, but at the 
same reduction temperature, the ratio follows the sequence silica 
> silica-alumina > alumina. 
Complementary results obtained by electron spin resonance 
(ESR), 27Al 
magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance 
(MAS-NMR), and thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) are 
presented in this paper. The ESR spectra are quantified and 
related to the previously published quantitative DRS data. The 
link between silica and alumina is made through the investiga- 
tion of a series of silica-aluminas with different silica contents. 
The results will be discussed in terms of redox behavior and 
dispersion of Cr. An overall picture of the relative concentra- 
tions of Cr2+, 
Cr3+, 
C$+, and CI6+ on amorphous supports after 
different pretreatments emerges. 
Methods 
1. Sample Preparation and Characterization. The prepa- 
ration of Si02 (SA100) and SiOyA1203 with 20,40, and 60 wt 
% Si02 (SA20, 
SA40, and SA60) and the characteristics of these 
supports are described el~ewhere.'~~'~ 
Two A1203 supports, one 
(SAO(1)) from Rh6ne-Poulenc and the other homemade (SAO- 
(HM)), were used. Their preparation and physical properties 
were published elsewhere.13J4 The supported Cr catalysts were 
prepared by the incipient wetness technique with aqueous 
solutions of chromium(V1) trioxide ( 0 0 3 ) .  The chromium 
loadings were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, and 8 wt % Cr. The 
impregnated samples were dried at 50 "C for 8 h and granulated. 
The selected size fraction was 0.25-0.40 mm.

quartz flow cell with Suprasil window for diffuse reflectance 
spectroscopy (DRS) and a side arm 
for electron spin resonance 
spectroscopy (ESR). With this cell, it was possible to take DRS 
and ESR spectra after the same pretreatment. The DRS spectra 
were discussed in previous papers.13-16 All the samples were 
calcined at 550 "C. The catalysts with a Cr loading between 0 
and 0.8 wt % were subsequently reduced in a flow of CO at 
200, 300, 400, and 600 "C during 0.5 h and recalcined at 550 
"C. After each treatment ESR spectra were recorded between 
120 and 370 K. The ESR spectra were taken using a Bruker 
ER 200 D-SRC instrument in X-band at a microwave power of 
200 pW with a double rectangular TE1w mode cavity. Quan- 
titative measurements were performed with a Bruker ESP 300E 
instrument in X band. Absolute spin concentrations were 
determined after double integration of the obtained spectra by 
using Cu(acac)flCl (acac = acetylacetonate) mixtures as 
standards (number of spins: 1016-1019/g). 
2.2. Thermogravimetrical Analysis. Thermogravimetrical 
analyses were performed on powdered samples, typically 20- 
40 mg, using the TG-DTA 92 of Setaram. All samples were 
measured in a dynamic atmosphere of dry oxygen in helium. 
The supports, the Cr catalysts, and CrO3 were dried at 100 "C 
calcination for 1 h, followed by calcining for 0.5 h at 550 "C 
(heating rate of 10 "Umin) in situ in the thermobalance. 
2.3. 27Al 
MAS-NMR Spectroscopy. 27Al 
MAS-NMR mea- 
surements were performed using a Bruker MSL 400 spectrom- 
eter at 104.2 MHz in a magnetic field of 9.4 T, with a tipping 
angle of about 15" and a spinning frequency of 14.5 kHz. 
Approximately 2000 scans were accumulated. The spectra were 
deconvoluted into Gaussian bands, the individual bands were 
integrated, and the integrated areas were expressed per unit 
weight of dry catalysts. 
2.4. X-ray Diffraction. X-ray diffraction pattems were 
recorded using an automated Siemens diffractometer, equipped 
with a Kristalloflex K710 rontgengenerator and a position- 
sensitive detector of Inel.

proposed in the literat~re.'~,*~ 
This signal is formed on all 
supports. It attains its maximum intensity after reduction in 
the range 200-300 "C, the exact temperature depending on 
support and loading. Severe reduction pretreatments result in 
a total disappearance of this signal, while recalcination re- 
establishes it. The @-signal 
is ascribed to CrzOs-like clusters 
and is only formed on alumina after reduction and recalcination. 
Its amount increases with increasing Cr loading. The 8-signal, 
usually assigned to magnetically isolated or dispersed Cr3+ 
specie~,~J~,*~ 
is formed on all supports after reduction. Its 
amount increases with increasing reduction temperature and Cr 
loading and remains in the spectra after recalcination on silica- 
alumina and alumina.

y-Signal. The shape of the y-signal depends on the support as 
shown in Figure 2 for Cr/SAO(HM) and Cr/SA100. The 
y-signals of the Cr/SAn catalysts with n = 
20, 40, and 60 are 
similar to those of Cr/SAO, suggesting C P  
in Al-rich phases. 
The g values were obtained by simulation with an axially 
symmetric Hamiltonian. The signals are usually interpreted as 
due to axially symmetric [Cr04l3- species with g l  = 1.975- 
1.895 and gll= 1.895 and an axially distorted tetrahedral species 
with g l  
= 
1.980 and gll= 1.950, the latter signal being resolved 
on Si02 only. The increase of the line width in going from 
silica to alumina is probably due to interaction of the unpaired 
electron of Cr5+ with the 27Al 
nuclei (
Z
 
= 
5/2). In any case, all 
CP+ are surface species, because line broadening is observed 
in the presence of 0 2  
at room temperature. 
The intensities of the y-signal follow the Curie-Weiss law, 
independently of the pretreatment and Cr loading. As an 
example, the reciprocal of the ESR intensities is plotted as a 
function of temperature (Z-l-T plots) for Cr/SA100 in Figure 
3. It is clear that the plots are almost linear, after linear 
extrapolation, and intersect the abscissa at 100-110 K. This 
is in accordance with Curie-Weiss behavior22 
where C is the Curie constant, x the molar susceptibility, T the 
absolute temperature, and B the Weiss constant. B depends on 
the support composition. For Cr/SAO and Cr/SA40 8 is 
respectively around 35-45 and 0-10 K. The latter numbers 
are obtained by linear extrapolation from ESR intensity mea-

surements above 110 K. The validity of this extensive 
extrapolation was not verified. In any case, the data do show 
that the magnetic behavior of C F  
is strongly support dependent. 
The extent to which 8 deviates from zero is a measure of the 
extent of CrS+-CI5+ interaction. Small 8 
values mean magneti- 
cally dilute c$+ 
systems, and high 8 
values mean magnetically 
concentrated CrS+ systems. If this is taken as an indication of 
dispersion of Cr over the supports, then Cr dispersion increases 
in the order Si02 <
<
 A1203 < SiO~*Al203. 
1.2.2. ,&Signal. In our experiments, the #I-signal is only 
visible after reduction and recalcination of Cr/Al2O3 and can 
be easily studied after strong reduction and recalcination. The 
dependence of the &signal on pretreatment is shown in Figure 
4. It is observed that the ,&signal is broad and weak during 
the first reduction cycle. The peak-to-peak line widths (ppw) 
are in the range 1200-2000 G, while the g values are around 
2.45-2.09. 
Both parameters have a tendency to decrease with 
increasing reduction temperature. The signal becomes pro- 
nounced after recalcination with g = 
2.2 and a ppw of 900 G. 
Furthermore, the ppw decreases with increasing Cr loading. 
Above 320 K, the /3-signal follows the Curie-Weiss law, 
but its thermal behavior changes in the region 280-310 K, while 
lower temperatures broaden the signal. The NCel temperature 
(7") of a-CrzO3 is around 307 K,23 close to the 320 K, the 
limiting temperature for Curie-Weiss behavior of our samples. 
This indicates that the P-signal on alumina is due to CrzOs-like 
clusters, which are, however, too small in size or too small in 
number to be detected by XRD. The decrease of the ppw and 
the g value with reduction temperature suggests growing cluster 
sizes, the line w
e
 
being determined by exchange coupling 
and dipolar interaction between the Cr3+ 
ions. The first results

in an exchange narrowing of the resonance line; the second 
phenomenon gives line broadening." Therefore, smaller ppw's 
suggest larger Cr203-like clusters. Our results indicate 
that these 
clusters grow in size by increasing the reduction temperature, 
by increasing the Cr loading, and especially by recalcination. 
It is remarkable that no ,!%signal is observed on Cr/SiO~*A1203 
clusters and on Cr/SiOz, but it does not mean that CrzO3-like 
clusters are absent. The /?-signals on these supports may be 
broadened beyond detection. 
1.2.3. &Signal. The d-signal of dispersed Cr3+ 
ions appears 
on all the supports after reduction (Figure 5
)
.
 The intensity of 
this signal increases with increasing Cr loading and reduction 
temperature. For the same reduction temperature it increases 
with the alumina content of the support. The position of the 
signal is also a function of the support: the maximum of the 
d-signal is at higher fields for Cr/SA100 (g around 4.4) than 
for the other supports ( g  around 5.0-5.5). 
After recalcination 
the signal is absent in the Cr/SA100 samples but remains on 
the other supports. This suggests that isolated C$+ ions are 
stabilized in or on A1203 and SiOyA1203 in such a way that 
they resist oxidation.

is equal to l/2 
and gcs+ 
= 
(2gl+ g11)/3, while for the /I- 
and d-signal S C ~ +  
is 
3/2. The integrated areas of the different signals were obtained 
as follows. The y-signal was doubly integrated over a field of 
500 G centered around g = 
1.9 after a linear base line correction. 
If the /?-signal was superposed on the y-signal, a cubic base 
line correction was performed. The situation for the &signal 
is more complicated, because it is weak and its negative lobe 
probably extends to higher fields over a large field range. A 
rough estimate can be made by taking the area under the signal 
by single integration over a field of 3000 G centered around 
the maximum peak (after a linear base line correction). The 
area of the /?-signal was obtained by double integration of both 
the /I- and y-signal and subtraction of the intensity of the 
y-signal. 
The amount of C9+ is always low ( ~ 2 %  
of total Cr content), 
increases with increasing alumina content of the support, and 
reaches a maximum after reduction in the range 200-300 "C. 
The maximum is closer to 200 "C for Si02 and SiO2-Al203 
and 
to 300 C for A1203 (Figure 6). After reduction at 600 "C the 
signal has almost completely disappeared. It reappears after 
recalcination. When studied as 
a function of loading, the relative 
C$+ concentration is maximum at low Cr loadings (0.4 wt % 
for Cr/SAO, 0.2 wt % for Cr/SA40, and 1.0 wt % for Cr/SA100) 
and decreases with increasing Cr loading. Summarizing, the 
C$+ concentration can be maximized with a high aluminum 
content of the support, moderate reduction temperatures with 
CO, and relatively low Cr loadings. 
The amount of dispersed Cr3+ (&phase) increases with 
increasing alumina content and reduction temperature but is very

low in all cases (< 0.4% of the total Cr content) and can only 
be roughly quantified. Our attempts to quantify the /?-signal 
failed. 
From the total Cr content determined by chemical analysis 
(Crtot), 
the amounts of CP+ and Cr3+ determined by DRS,13 
and the amount of C$+ determined by EPR, one obtains 
This equation is valid up to 0.4 wt % for Cr/A1203, 0.2 wt % 
for Cr/Si02*A1203, 
and 0.1 wt % for Cr/SiO2. These limits are 
dictated by the quantitative DRS data.13 The amount of every 
Cr"+ species can now be plotted at different pretreatments as 
shown for A1203 in Figure 7. This figure is a refinement of 
our earlier published figure13 
in that [ C P ]  
is incorporated. The 
figures for Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Si02*A1203 are identical to the 
previously published figures, because [ C P ]  
is too small to be 
shown. 
For the calcined samples the amount of C?+ decreases sharply 
with the [Si02]:[A1203] ratio and increases linearly with the 
[chromate]:[dichromate] ratio as shown in Figure 8, at least at 
ratios 14. The chr0mate:dichromate ratio, obtained by DRS, 
is a measure of the dispersion of Cr, and therefore, [ C P ]  
can 
also be used as a dispersion criterion.

for example alumina. Case I is before anchoring (hydrated), 
while case I1 is after calcination (dehydrated). Thus, this figure 
shows the features upon calcination: dehydroxylation of the 
Cr catalyst is more extensive than that of the pure support 
because of the reaction of hydroxyls with Cr, and no or 
negligible clustering to Cr2O3 occurs (at least for low Cr 
loadings). In this case, a is positive, and the more Cr is 
anchored, the larger a. 
Additional evidence for this mechanism comes from (1) our 
direct observation of consumption of OH groups upon Cr 
deposition by calcination16 
and (2) the small amounts of Cr2O3- 
like clusters detected by EPR in the present study and by 
DRS.13-14 Then, the data of Table 1 show that the degree of 
interaction between Cr and the support increases from Si02 over 
Si02*A1203 
to A1203 and the degree of interaction, expressed 
per mole of Cr, decreases with increasing Cr loading, except 
for Cr/SiO2. The low a 
values of Cr/SiO2 are explained by the 
presence of some dichromate, which releases only one H20 per 
Cr upon chemisorption and by the presence of some Cr3+.13314

lines after deconvolution in a tetrahedral peak, an octahedral 
peak, and a peak of pentacoordinated 
AI3+. The octahedral peak 
of Cr/Si02*A1203 
is asymmetric due to quadrupolar interaction. 
For Cr/A1203 the overall intensity decreases with increasing Cr 
loading, and this is the most pronounced for the octahedral line. 
For Cr/Si02*A1203 the intensities are independent of the Cr 
loading. It is known from the literature that paramagnetic 
species, like Cr"+ with n < 6, quench 27Al 
lines in NMR27*28 
due to relaxation phenomena.29 The data show that only 
octahedral AI3+ of AI2O3 is affected, suggesting that part of 
C$+(d3) and CP(dl) 
occupies sites odin A1203 
in close vicinity 
of octhahedral 27Al. This, apparently, is not the case for Cr/ 
SiOyA1203.

Discussion 
The data reported here, combined with our previously 
published DRS  result^,^^-'^ allow the development of a quite 
general picture of the chemistry of Cr on oxides. 
Three species, C P ,  Cr3+, and Cr203-like clusters, are 
detected with EPR on supported Cr catalysts as y-, 6-, and 
P-signals, respectively. The shape, the g values, and intensities 
of these signals reflect the type of support and the Cr loading. 
The C$+ and C$+ signal intensities are proportional to the 
A1203 content of the supports but correspond to no more than 
2% 
of the total Cr content. Strong chromate adsorption sites, 
which prohibit Cr migration over the surface, are thought to be 
responsible for the generation of these C$+ and Cr3+ species, 
but some migration in the surface layers cannot be ruled out. 
In any case, the close proximity of A
l
 
is evident from (1) the 
broadening of the C$+ lines on A1203 with respect to SiO2, (2) 
the difference in position of the C$+ lines on A1203 with respect 
to Si02, and (3) the decrease of the 27Al 
Nh4R line intensity 
with Cr loading. It is also remarkable that the EPR signals of 
C$+ and Cr3+ on Si02*A1203 
resemble those of A1203, sug- 
gesting that these ions are preferentially located in the âA1203)â 
parts of silica-aluminas. 
If these y- and &signals are due to atomically dispersed C$+ 
and Cr3+, 
their intensities can be used as a dispersion criterion. 
This 
was confirmed by the linear relationship between the C$+ 
signal intensity and the chromate:dichromate ratio determined 
by DRS.13,14 The latter is also an indication of dispersion. The 
Cr3+ signal is too broad to quantify properly, and its intensity 
cannot be used as dispersion criterion, although it follows the 
same trend as the C$+ signal. The same is valid for the Curie- 
Weiss constant of CrS+ and its dependence on the type of 
support. Here, the 8 values of A1203 and SiO2*Al2O3 
are too 
uncertain. They do suggest, however, that dispersion is the 
lowest on Si02. The other dispersion criterion of this paper is 
the U-value. The larger a, 
the stronger the chromate anchoring 
and the better the dispersion. The trend is then alumina =- 
silica-alumina >
>
 silica, with silica-alumina closer to alumina 
than to silica. Thus, several criteria can be used to measure 
dispersion qualitatively. These criteria can be used in the whole 
Cr loading range: the higher the Cr loading, the lower Cr 
dispersion and the lower the U-values and [C$+]. However, 
the Curie-Weiss constant of C15+ is only function of the support 
type and only easy measurable for low Cr loadings. 
In summary, the proposed dispersion criteria all point toward 
the same trend: dispersion is the highest on A1203 and the 
lowest on Si02, with SiO2*Al2O3 
in between. If they are Al- 
rich, chromium preferentially interacts with the âAl203â parts 
of silica-aluminas. 
This support dependency of Cr dispersion can be explained 
by the amount and characteristics of the hydroxyl groups of 
the supports. It is known that the amount of hydroxyls increases 
with increasing A1 content of the support. The more OH groups 
available for anchoring Cr, the better Cr will be dispersed. 
Furthermore, alumina surfaces possess more basic OH groups, 
326 J. 
Phys. Chem., Vol. 99, No. 1, 1995 
which will react more readily with the acid Cr03 
resulting in a 
better dispersion. 
If dispersion of Cr is as indicated, then the amount and/or 
size of CrzO-Jike 
clusters should follow the reverse order: Si02 
> Si02~A1203 
> A1203. This cannot be seen from the P-signal 
in EPR. The intensity of the d-d 
transition in the range 
15 000-18 000 cm-l of Cr3+ in DRS behaves, however, as 
expected. Cr3+ 
is always seen on Si02 after calcination due to 
the reaction 2Cr03 - 
CrzO3 + 3/202. Such a reaction is also 
deduced from the a-values (Table 1). Therefore, CrzO3-like 
clusters are formed on Si02 already after calcination. As a 
consequence, the dispersion is less on silica than on the other 
supports. The nearly total absence of a P-signal on silica in 
EPR must then be attributed to line broadening beyond detection. 
Why this is so on silica and not an alumina requires a detailed 
investigation of the P-signal dependence on the amount, size, 
and shape of Cr2O3 clusters. 
Finally, the relation between dispersion of Cr and reduction 
to Cr2+ 
must be investigated. Cr2+ 
is only found in significant 
amounts on silica, and thus, there is a support and dispersion 
dependence. First of all, the interaction of Cr species is stronger 
with A1203 and Si02*A1203 
than with SiOz. The reason is the 
closeness of the ionic radii of C P  
(0.52 A) and Cr3+ 
(R(Cr3+oh) 
= 0.62 A) with that of A13+ (R(A13+oh) 
= 0.53 A)30 and the 
structural similarity between y-AlzO3 (a spinel-like structure in 
which octahedral and tetrahedral aluminum ions are randomly 
distributed and which is formed by cubic close-packed oxy- 
g e n ~ ~ ~ )  
and a-CrzO3 (a structure built up with close-packed 
oxygens in a hexagonal arrar~gement~~). 
This similarity can lead 
to an epitaxial growth of Cr2O3 clusters on the y-Al2O3 
surface, 
and therefore, it will be more difficult to reduce Cr3+ to Cr2+ 
on alumina than on silica. Finally, if aqueous solution standard 
reduction potentials are valid, then dichromate species are more 
easier reducible than chromate (to Cr3+).33 The former are 
present in significant amounts on Si02, and therefore, one 
expects the initial reducibility to follow the order Si02 > 
SiOz*A1203 > A1203. 
In summary, with X-band ESR spectroscopy Cr5+(d1) 
and 
two types of C9+(d3) (dispersed Cr3+ and CrzO3-like clusters) 
are measured. DRS spectroscopy probes the charge transfers 
of Cld+(do) in chromate and dichromate or polychromates and 
the d-d transitions of Cr2+(d4) 
and Cr3+(d3). Thus, DRS and 
ESR are complementary spectroscopic techniques with Cr3+ 
accessible by both techniques. In principle, Cr5+(d1) 
could also 
be detected by DRS, but less than 2% of the total Cr content 
being Cr5+ is too small for detection. DRS is unable to 
differentiate between atomically dispersed Cr3+ 
and CrzO3-like 
clusters, as is possible by ESR. Also, the amounts of Cr3+ 
measured with both techniques are not comparable. This 
suggests that only a small amount of Cr3+ is ESR-active. This 
speciation of the different oxidation states of Cr has recently 
been successfully extended to Cr molecular  sieve^.^^-^^ 
Conclusions 
Cr5+, Cr3+, and CrzO3-like clusters are the species detected 
on Cr-supported catalysts. The amounts of Cr5+ and Cr3+ 
increase from silica over silica-alumina to alumina but never 
exceed 2% of the total Cr content. Several qualitative 
dispersion 
criteria have been established: Cr5+ content, Curie-Weiss 
constant of Cr5+, 
and a-parameter. They all indicate that the 
dispersion is lowest on silica and highest on alumina with 
silica-alumina in between, but closer to alumina than on silica. 
This indicates that CYf preferentially interacts with the A1203 
parts of silica-alumina. 
DRS and ESR are complementary 
techniques for speciation of Cr oxidation states on inorganic 
surfaces.
