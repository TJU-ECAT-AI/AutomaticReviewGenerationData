A continuous-ﬂow reactor system with in situ monitoring of the
catalyst was developed. The catalyst surface was analyzed by col-
lecting UV–visible diffuse reﬂectance spectra through an optical
ﬁber placed in the catalyst bed. The system was tested with a se-
ries of chromia/alumina catalysts (1 wt% Cr) under the conditions
of propane dehydrogenation.
The fast reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+
under propane stream could be detected. Increase in the catalytic
activity with the alumina pretreatment temperature was tentatively
ascribed to the presence of θ-alumina, and decrease in the activity
during calcination to incorporation of Cr3+ inside the alumina sup-
port.

INTRODUCTION
Monitoring the events taking place in solid catalysts un-
der operating conditions is crucial for understanding the
reaction mechanism of many important chemical processes
(1–3). Techniques have been developed which allow the
studying of catalysts truly in situ, i.e., at high tempera-
tures and pressures in a stream of reactants. The most used
techniques have been infrared spectroscopy (4), Raman
spectroscopy (5, 6), M¨
ossbauer spectroscopy (7), nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (8, 9), X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (10–12), and UV–visible (vis) spectroscopy
(13–15). A challenge often remaining is the implementation
of the techniques without changing the catalytic properties
of the system under study.

The current note introduces a new approach for mea-
suring UV–vis diffuse reﬂectance (DR) spectra of an oper-
ating catalyst. The technique is based on the use of optical
ﬁber technology, by which the state of solid transition metal
oxide catalysts can be probed while they are positioned as a
ﬁxed bed in a catalytic reactor. Fiberoptic DR spectroscopy
has been used for a variety of applications, such as pigment
analysis (16), clinical diagnosis (17), and powder blend
quality control (18); but to our best knowledge, the current
work presents the ﬁrst application in the ﬁeld of heteroge-
neous catalysis. As an example, the changes taking place in
chromia/alumina catalysts during alkane dehydrogenation
are monitored by UV–vis DR spectroscopy. Alkane dehy-
drogenation is an industrially important process that is a
viable route, for example, for the production of high-purity
propene used for the production of polymer materials (19).
The effect of alumina pretreatment temperature for the
catalytic activity is studied. In addition, the differences in
activity caused by a deactivating thermal treatment of chro-
mia/alumina catalysts are investigated by in situ UV–vis
DR measurements. Finally, the performance of the current
setup as an in situ tool is compared with that of a system
reported earlier (13, 15), and differences are pointed
out.
METHODS
Chromia/alumina catalysts with about 1 wt% Cr were
prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. An aqueous
solution of CrO3 (UCB Chemicals) was impregnated onto
a commercial AKZO 001–1.5E alumina material that had
been pretreated in ambient air at 600, 800, or 1000◦C for
16 h. BET surface areas of 235, 177, and 154 m2/g were mea-
sured for the alumina supports, respectively. The catalysts
were aged and dried at 60 and 120◦C for 4 h, after which
they were calcined at 600◦C for 16 h or at temperatures
up to 1200◦C for 24 h. The higher calcination temperatures
were used to deliberately deactivate the catalysts.

25 ml/min feed of 10 vol% propane (Alphagas, 99.95 vol%)
in helium (Air Liquide, 99.995 vol%) and 0.2 g of catalyst
for 20 min. The catalysts were regenerated for 40 min by a
25 ml/min stream of 5% oxygen (Air Liquide, 99.5 vol%)
in helium. A helium ﬂush of 30 min separated the dehydro-
genation and regeneration steps. Three dehydrogenation
cycles were carried out. The outlet gases were analyzed on
line by a gas chromatograph (GC) (HP 5830A) equipped
with a ﬂame ionization detector and a packed column (n-
octane/Porasil C). The reported activities correspond to the
second cycle after 17.1 min of propane on stream unless oth-
erwise stated. Yields and selectivities were calculated on a
molar basis.
The catalysts were continuously monitored by optical
ﬁber UV–vis DR spectroscopy. A schematic representation
of the current setup is shown in Fig. 1A and a photographic
illustration in Fig. 1B. The setup consists of a tubular ﬁxed-
bed reactor ﬁtted inside a furnace, a UV–vis (deuterium–
halogen) light source (Top Sensor Systems DH-2000) and
a photodiode array detector (Ocean Optics SD-2000) con-
nected to the catalyst bed via optical ﬁber technology (Top
SensorSystemsFCB-UV400-MEcableandFCB-UV400G-
0.1-XHT high-temperature probe). The high-temperature
probe is separated by a few millimeters from the hot catalyst
particles placed in the ﬁxed-bed reactor. A spectrum of the
catalyst in the 200 to 800 nm region can be collected in less
than a second.
X-ray diffractograms were measured for some samples
with a Siemens D5000 X-ray Diffractometer. To investi-
gate whether Na diffuses to the surfaces of samples during
the heat treatment, alumina samples pretreated in air at
600, 800, 1000, and 1200◦C were analyzed by X-ray pho-
toelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS data were ob-
tained with a Vacuum Generators XPS system, using a
CLAM-2 hemispherical analyzer for electron detection.
Non-monochromatic AlKα X-ray radiation was used for
exciting the photoelectron spectra using an anode current
of 20 mA at 10 keV. The pass energy of the analyzer was
set at 50 eV, and data were collected at intervals of 0.1 eV.
Survey spectra were taken with a pass energy of 100 eV at
intervals of 0.5 eV.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The yield of propene for the series of chromia/alumina
catalysts, where the alumina pretreatment temperature and
the catalyst calcination temperature were varied, is shown
in Fig. 2. The data points (17.1 min on stream) represent
a “stable” situation of the catalysts, where all the Cr6+
has been converted to Cr3+ and the initial CO2, CO, and
H2O formation (20) no longer affects the product distri-
bution. Increasing the alumina pretreatment temperature
had a positive effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the
catalysts. This possibly was caused by the increased forma-
tion of the θ-alumina phase during the pretreatment, as
was observed by X-ray diffraction. α-alumina had not yet
been formed in the pretreatment at 1000◦C. Increasing the
calcination temperature of the chromia/alumina catalysts
above 600◦C resulted in loss of dehydrogenation activity.

255
Calcination at 1200◦C strongly deactivated all the catalysts
(propene yield of approximately 4%), but some activity
remained, since pure alumina pretreated at 1200◦C gave a
propene yield of 0.5%. XPS investigation showed that the
amount of Na present in the samples was close to the de-
tection limit and no accumulation had occurred onto the
sample surface during the heat treatment. Loss of activity
thus cannot be explained by diffusion of Na to block the
active sites. Conversionwise there was practically no dif-
ference between the catalysts prepared on different alumi-
nas; selectivity was generally higher (up to about 80%) the
higher the alumina pretreatment temperature. The catalyst
prepared on alumina pretreated at 600◦C suffered the least
deactivation when calcined at temperatures up to 1000◦C.
This could be due to the fact that chromium inhibits the
transformation of alumina from γ to α phase (21). Indeed,
peaks of α-alumina were observed in the X-ray diffrac-
tograms of catalysts calcined at 1200◦C, but their intensity
was smaller the lower the alumina pretreatment tempera-
ture.
UV–vis DR spectra were recorded continuously in situ
during the catalytic experiments. As an example, we dis-
cuss the spectra of two chromia/alumina catalysts, which
were both prepared on alumina pretreated at 600◦C, but the
calcination temperatures were 600 and 1200◦C. The former

calcination and during a 20 min propane feed. The solid-line arrow indicates the fast changes taking place during the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ during

is here referred to as the “fresh catalyst” and the latter as
the “deactivated catalyst.” The spectra of these catalysts
measured during three consecutive dehydrogenation–
oxidationcyclesareshowninFig.3.Acommonfeatureofall
the spectra measured at the end of oxidation was that there
was an absorption band centered at 25,000–26,000 cm−1,
which was due to Cr6+ (22). The Cr6+ present in the fresh
catalyst was readily reduced to Cr3+ during the ﬁrst 30 s
of propane on stream, in accord with the observations of
Hakuli et al. (20) which were made by a rapid Fourier trans-
fer infrared analysis of the gas phase products. For the de-
activated catalyst in all cycles and for the fresh catalysts in
the second and third cycles, Cr6+ was not stable during the
helium ﬂush but converted to Cr3+. This was evidenced by
the appearance of two absorption bands at about 16,000
and 23,000 cm−1 (23). During the propane feed, coke was
formed on the fresh catalyst, as evidenced by increasing in-
tensity in the whole wavenumber range of the spectrum,
and by that the yield of propane decreased from 13% to
12% during 13.1 min on stream. The presence of coke can
be seen in UV–vis DR spectra because polycyclic aromatic
structures have wide absorption bands in the UV–vis region
(24, 25). Darkening of the sample through coke formation
also may increase the overall intensity, leading to poorer
resolution of the spectra. On the deactivated catalyst, coke
256

formation as seen by UV–vis was almost negligible. During
the following oxidative regeneration, the overall intensity
decreased as a result of coke burn-off, and the Cr6+ signal
reappeared. However, it never reached its original intensity
during the 40-min oxidation. Oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ thus
seems to be a considerably slower process than reduction
of Cr6+ to Cr3+.
The UV–vis DR spectra can be used to investigate the
changes that have taken place during the deactivation pro-
cedure. The positions of the absorption bands are charac-
teristic of the coordination environment of Cr3+ (23). For
spectra measured at room temperature, Cr3+ located in-
side an α-alumina structure (i.e., ruby) has d–d transitions
at 18,150 and 24,700 cm−1 (23), whereas Cr3+ in Cr2O3 has
bands at 16,600 (26) and 21,700 cm−1 (27). According to
our measurements, increasing the measurement tempera-
ture from room temperature to 580◦C shifts the maximum
position of the bands at about 17,000 and 22,000 cm−1 to
lower energy by about 700 and 200 cm−1, respectively. The
apparent band maxima at the start of the propane feed for
the different catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. The energy of
the d–d transitions of Cr3+ increased with increasing calci-
nation temperature. Taking into account the effect of tem-
perature on the band maxima, the shift in absorption band
maxima indicates that most of the Cr3+ present in the cata-
lyst deactivated at 1200◦C had been incorporated in alu-
mina, which explains the low activity observed. We pro-
pose that the Cr3+ species with bands at about 16,000 and
23,000 cm−1 (as measured at 580◦C) were active dehydro-
genation sites. It needs to be noted that the UV–vis DR
results did not provide an explanation for the high activity
of catalysts prepared on alumina pretreated at 1000◦C.
Previously, the activity of supported chromia catalysts
were investigated in isobutane dehydrogenation at 350 to
500◦C (15). The catalysts were monitored in situ by UV–
vis DR spectroscopy in a Praying Mantis DR attachment
(Harrick) equipped with a photomultiplier detector. The
performances and requirements of the two setups are com-
pared in Table 1. The main advantage of the current ﬁberop-
tic setup compared with the Praying Mantis setup is the
speed of data collection: fast processes with the time scale

of seconds can be followed through the use of a photo diode
array detector. Note also that through the use of a catalytic
ﬁxed-bed reactor the conversion level is not limited because
of the spectroscopic requirements; high dehydrogenation
conversions could be obtained in this work (conversion up
to 24% in this study vs typically below 2% in (15)).
CONCLUSIONS
The activity and selectivity of chromia/alumina catalysts
increased when alumina pretreatment temperature was in-
creased from 600 to 1000◦C, perhaps because of the in-
creased amount of θ-alumina in the samples. Calcination
of the catalysts at 1200◦C resulted in severe deactivation.
Optical ﬁber UV–vis DR spectroscopy indicated that Cr6+
reduced to Cr3+ during the ﬁrst 30 s of propane on stream,
and this was followed by coke formation. The Cr6+ formed
during oxidative regeneration was not stable during an in-
ert ﬂush of the system but converted to Cr3+ even before
the start of the propane feed. A correlation was observed
between the dehydrogenation activity and Cr3+ absorption
maxima for catalysts prepared on alumina pretreated at a
constant temperature.
Monitoring the changes taking place in the coordination
environment and oxidation state of supported metal oxides
under reaction conditions was successful by optical ﬁber
UV–vis DR spectroscopy. This technique is generally ap-
plicable to transition metal ions, which possess absorption
bands in the UV–vis region. Its strength lies in the possibil-
ity of using a simple catalytic ﬁxed-bed reactor. Moreover, a
photo diode array detector enables a data collection speed
in the range of seconds.
