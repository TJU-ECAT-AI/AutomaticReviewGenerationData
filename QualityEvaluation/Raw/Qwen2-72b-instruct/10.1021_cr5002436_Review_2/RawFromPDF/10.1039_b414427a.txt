In continuation to the possibility of using a combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR set-up for conducting
qualitative Raman spectroscopy, the possibilities for quantitative Raman spectroscopic measurements of
supported metal oxide catalysts under working conditions without the need of an internal standard have been
explored. The dehydrogenation of propane over an industrial-like 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst was used as a model
system. During reaction, the catalytic solid was continuously monitored by both UV-Vis-NIR and Raman
spectroscopy. As the dehydrogenation proceeds, the catalyst gradually darkens due to coke formation and
consequently the UV-Vis-NIR diﬀuse reﬂectance and Raman scattered signal progressively decrease in intensity.
The formation of coke was conﬁrmed with TEOM, TGA and Raman. The measured Raman spectra can be used
as a quantitative measure of the amount of carbonaceous deposits at the catalyst surface provided that a
correction factor G(RN) is applied. This factor can be directly calculated from the corresponding UV-Vis-NIR
diﬀuse reﬂectance spectra. The validity of the approach is compared with one, in which an internal boron nitride
standard is added to the catalytic solid. It will be shown that the proposed methodology allows measurement of
the amount of carbonaceous deposits on a catalyst material inside a reactor as a function of reaction time and
catalyst bed height. As a consequence, an elegant technique for on-line process control of e.g. an industrial
propane dehydrogenation reactor emerges.
Introduction
Recent technical developments have tremendously increased
the popularity of Raman spectroscopy as a characterization
tool to obtain physico-chemical information on heteroge-
neously catalyzed reaction systems.1–17 Most characterization
studies based on Raman spectroscopy, however, are still
applied qualitatively, since besides the concentration of the
scattering species, variations in laser excitation intensity, in-
strumental settings, sample positioning, temperature ﬂuctua-
tions,
etc.
all
may
inﬂuence
the
Raman
intensities.
Furthermore, Raman intensities depend on the scattering and
absorption properties of the catalytic solid. As a consequence,
progressive darkening of the catalyst during reaction by
e.g. coke formation may strongly aﬀect the intensities of the
Raman spectra.
One way to quantify Raman spectra is by normalizing the
Raman bands of a species of interest to those of a speciﬁc
scattering species, which is assumed to remain unaﬀected with
reaction time. In principle, for supported metal oxide catalysts,
the Raman bands of the bulk support material can be used.
However, it should be noted that this is only true if the
intensity of the bulk material is not inﬂuenced by changes in
its surroundings. Diﬀerent loadings of a catalyst would change
the coverage of bulk material and therefore result in diﬀerent
band intensities of this bulk, while coverage of the bulk
material by for instance coke would also aﬀect the ‘visible
amount’ of bulk material.
Alternatively, an unreactive standard of known concentra-
tion may be mixed homogeneously with the catalyst. Such
internal standards should not interact with the catalyst materi-
al, or perturb or overlap the spectrum of the supported metal
oxide catalyst. Internal standards should also be strong Raman
scatterers, so that a small quantity produces a signal of
adequate intensity. Boron nitride (BN) may be such a standard
material since it exhibits only one intense and strong Raman
band at 1367 cm1, while the vibrational bands of most
supported metal oxides appear below 1200 cm1. Several
successful applications of an internal standard are available
in the literature.18–23
It is known that the scattering and absorption properties of a
catalytic solid can be described by the diﬀuse reﬂectance RN of
the solid, as measured with UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy.24–27
Progressive darkening of the catalytic solid due to e.g. coke
formation during reaction leads to a decreasing RN and the
proportionality between the Raman band intensities and the
concentration of the corresponding species is no longer valid.
In order to compare Raman intensities at diﬀerent times-on-
stream inside a catalytic reactor, the relationship between the
diﬀuse reﬂectance of the catalytic solid of inﬁnite thickness
(RN) and the Raman intensity (CN) must be known. As early
as 1967 Schrader and Bergmann28 derived an approximate
expression to correlate the Raman intensity CN to the diﬀuse
reﬂectance RN based on the Kubelka–Munk formalism. This
was later improved by Waters29 and Kuba and Knozinger30
into the following expression:
C1 ¼ rI0
s  GðR1Þ
ð1Þ
GðR1Þ ¼ R1ð1 þ R1Þ
ð1  R1Þ
ð2Þ
In eqn. (1) CN represents the observed Raman intensity for a
powdered sample of inﬁnite thickness, I0 the exciting Raman
laser intensity, r the coeﬃcient of Raman generation and s the
scattering coeﬃcient. The equation is valid based on the
assumption that the scattering of the solid s does not change.

This implies e.g. that the catalyst particles may not aggregate
during reaction leaving the scattering coeﬃcient s unaltered.
G(RN) can then be directly determined via eqn. (2) by measur-
ing RN with diﬀuse reﬂectance spectroscopy in the UV-Vis-
NIR region. Fig. 1 illustrates the dependence of G(RN) on RN.
It is evident that when RN - 1 the function G(RN) goes to
inﬁnity. Furthermore, small changes of RN between 0.9 and
1.0 strongly aﬀect the observed Raman intensity CN. Thus,
Raman intensities may undergo signiﬁcant time-dependent
decreases in the catalytic solid during reaction although the
density of the corresponding Raman sensitive species remains
unchanged. Fortunately, eqns. (1) and (2) then allow the
calculation of the true Raman intensity (rI0) of such species
assuming s to be constant. This means that CN has to be
divided by G(RN). In previous work,31,32 we have developed a
combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopic set-up
for studying catalytic solids under working conditions. The
equipment allows the simultaneous monitoring of UV-Vis-
NIR and Raman spectra revealing details respectively on the
oxidation state and coordination environment of supported
metal oxides and on the reaction intermediates and deactiva-
tion products (e.g. coke). The qualitative strengths of this
operando set-up have been extensively described earlier.31,32
However, with this set-up, one should be able to apply
Raman spectroscopy not only in a qualitative, but also in a
quantitative manner since the G(RN) of the catalytic solid can
be simultaneously measured as a function of reaction time. The
goal of this work is to explore the possibilities of the developed
set-up for performing quantitative Raman spectroscopy taking
the dehydrogenation of propane over an industrial-like Cr/
Al2O3 dehydrogenation catalyst as a case study. The developed
methodology will be compared with the use of BN as an
internal standard and it will be shown that the experimental
set-up is very suitable for Raman quantitation. We believe it
can be generally applied for studying supported metal oxide
catalysts in a quantitative manner under working conditions.
Experimental
A detailed description of the two experimental UV-Vis-NIR/
Raman set-ups used and the catalyst material under investiga-
tion, an industrial-like 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 alkane dehydrogena-
tion catalyst, can be found in recent publications of Nijhuis
et al.31,32 The catalyst was ballmilled for 15 min together with
the internal standard BN (Aldrich, 99%) in a 20 : 1 ratio to
obtain a homogeneously mixed powder. The furnace of the
reactor was heated to 585 1C (catalyst temperature of 550 1C)
with 10 1C min in a 20 vol% oxygen (Hoek Loos, 99.995%) in
He (Hoek Loos, 99.996%) ﬂow of 15 ml min1. After heating,
He was purged to remove all oxygen in the system and
subsequently a 9 vol% propane (Hoek Loos, 99.92%) stream
with a total ﬂow of 22 ml min1 was applied. All ﬂows given
are at standard temperature and pressure. On-line gas analysis
was performed using a Varian CP-4900 Micro GC equipped
with a Poraplot Q and a Molsieve 5A column and TCD
detectors. UV-Vis-NIR diﬀuse reﬂectance (DRS) spectra were
measured using a DH-2000 light source (Avantes) combined
with an Avaspec 2048 CCD spectrometer (Avantes) and a BI-
FL400 high temperature resistant probe (Ocean Optics). Ra-
man spectra were recorded using a Kaiser RXN spectrometer
equipped with a 532 nm diode laser (output power of 70 mW).
A 5.5’’ objective was used for beam focusing and collection of
the scattered radiation. Further details about the spectroscopic
equipment used can be found elsewhere.31 With the experi-
mental set-up described by Nijhuis et al.32 carbon deposits
could be measured as a function of the catalyst bed height
during and after propane dehydrogenation. All Raman spectra
were ﬁrst baseline-corrected in the spectral region 1100–1700
cm1 using Thermo Galactic Grams AI v. 7.0 software. This
software package was also used to determine Raman peak
areas. Tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) ex-
periments have been performed with Rupprecht & Pataschnick
TEOM 1500 PMA equipment using 100 mg of catalyst and a
gas mixture of propane (7 ml min1, Hoek Loos, 99.92%)) and
argon (20 ml min1, Hoek Loos, 99.995%). Prior to the uptake
experiment, the catalytic solid was dried and calcined under
oxygen (5 ml min1, Hoek Loos, 99.995%) and argon (10 ml
min1, Hoek Loos, 99.995%) at 600 1C. The start of the uptake
experiment (t ¼ 0) was deﬁned as the last data point before the
ﬁrst mass change. All mass changes were corrected for gas
density- and temperature-eﬀects by performing a blank run
over a reactor ﬁlled with quartz chips. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) has been performed using a Mettler Toledo
TGA/SDTA 851e instrument.

located at 1350 cm1 (slightly shifted from the 1367 cm1
position due to temperature eﬀects) decreases in intensity and
seems to broaden when the reaction proceeds. This is due to the
formation of coke as new Raman bands arise immediately after
the propane dehydrogenation cycle started. These new broad
bands are located at 1580 cm1 and at 1330 cm1, the latter
very close to the Raman band position of the BN standard.
These two Raman bands can be assigned based on literature
data of relevant reference compounds to the gradual formation
of polyaromatic compounds.33–38 However, as coke is expected
to be developing throughout the reaction, the amount of coke
should increase over time, resulting in increasing intensities of
the Raman bands at 1580 and 1330 cm1. However, this is
clearly not observed in Fig. 2. Based on the integrated band
intensities the amount of coke (as represented by the intensity
of the 1580 cm1 band) seems to increase up to 30 min (Fig. 2e)
followed by a gradual decrease. It is very unlikely that the
amount of coke ﬁrst increases and later on decreases during a
propane dehydrogenation cycle. In order to validate this
hypothesis we have performed TEOM experiments on the
same catalytic solid under experimental conditions, very close
to those used in our operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR reactor set-
up. The obtained data are summarized in Fig. 5. It was found
that the mass of the catalyst during a propane dehydrogenation
cycle at 550 1C gradually increases with increasing reaction
time up to 40 min-on-stream and then remains constant.
A possible explanation for the anomalous behavior of the
intensity of the Raman spectra is a gradual darkening of the
catalytic solid during propane dehydrogenation, which results
in two eﬀects, namely (1) absorption of the incoming laser light
and (2) absorption of the Rayleigh and Raman scattered light
(self-absorption). This assumption can be veriﬁed by analyzing
the corresponding UV-Vis-NIR diﬀuse reﬂectance spectra
(Fig. 3). Fig. 3a represents the spectrum of the catalytic solid
just before switching to a stream of propane at 550 1C. At this
starting point, the d–d transition of supported Cr2O3-like
oxides is clearly visible at around 15 700 cm1.39,40 A sharp
band at 18 800 cm1 (532 nm) is also observed due to the
Raman laser light picked up by the UV-Vis-NIR detector.
The reduction of initially present Cr61 to Cr31 in the begin-
ning of the reaction is presented in Fig. 3a and 3b. Fig. 3b–g
show a decrease in the diﬀuse reﬂectance of the catalytic solid
as propane dehydrogenation proceeds. This decrease is due to a
darkening of the catalyst and the absorption band of Cr2O3-
like oxides almost broadens beyond detection. This is not
surprising since the Raman spectra show that carbonaceous
species are formed at the active catalyst surface during reac-
tion. This results in a gradual coverage of the supported Cr2O3-
like oxides, which are becoming less accessible to the UV-Vis-
NIR and Raman laser probing the catalyst. Finally, Fig. 4
shows the on-line activity measurements of the catalytic solid
under investigation. It is clear that the propane conversion
increases with reaction time to reach a maximum activity of
56% after 17 min and then gradually decreases with increasing
time-on-stream. At the same time, the selectivity towards
propene slightly increases and reaches a rather stable value
of about 87%.

Quantitation of operando Raman spectra based on the
G(RN) correction factor and an internal boron nitride standard
As stated in the Introduction, two diﬀerent approaches to
quantify the time-resolved Raman spectra are compared in
this work. The ﬁrst method makes use of a correction factor
based on the UV-Vis-NIR diﬀuse reﬂectance spectra, further
denoted as the G(RN) correction factor. This correction factor
is determined for each Raman spectrum by calculating the
G(RN) value using eqn. (2) at 580 nm (580–532 nm E 18 800–
17 200 cm1 E 1580 cm1) as illustrated in Fig. 3. This
position in the UV-Vis-NIR spectrum corresponds to the coke
band at a Raman shift of 1580 cm1 in case a Raman laser

wavelength of 532 nm (18 800 cm1) is used. The values of
G(RN), calculated from the spectra of which a selection is
shown in Fig. 3, are included as an insert in Fig. 1. We found
that RN and thus G(RN) are decreasing as the reaction time
proceeds except for the ﬁrst minutes-on-stream. Here, the
reduction of Cr61 to Cr31 is mainly responsible for a small
increase in G(RN). Both a reduction and blackening of the
catalyst inﬂuence the color. However, this does not inﬂuence
the correctness of the G(RN) values since G(RN) is only
dependant on the color of the catalyst. So, the origin of this
changing color does not matter. Although RN only drops from
values of around 0.35 to 0.19, still this corresponds with a
decrease of G(RN) of more than 50%.
In a second step, the corresponding Raman spectra of Fig. 2
were divided by the corresponding values of G(RN) according
to eqn. (1) to obtain the true Raman intensities. The result of
this mathematical operation is shown in Fig. 6. It is evident
that the Raman bands due to coke formation at 1580 and 1330
cm1 gradually develop as a function of reaction time, while
the Raman band of BN decreases during the ﬁrst 30 min
(Fig. 6a–e) and remains constant thereafter. On the other
hand, Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra of Fig. 2 obtained after
normalizing the Raman bands of the carbonaceous deposits to
those of the inert internal standard BN. Here, a shoulder next
to the BN Raman band readily appears at around 1330 cm1
due to the formation of coke and this band grows in intensity
during the whole dehydrogenation period indicating that the
amount of coke increases. It is also clear that the coke band at
1580 cm1 is more pronounced than in Fig. 6.
In order to compare the two quantitation methods, the
integrated Raman peak intensities of the coke band at 1580
cm1 are plotted against reaction time in Fig. 8, together with
those obtained from the original Raman spectra. Similar
results have been obtained for the 1330 cm1 band, but because
this band overlaps with the Raman BN peak the values are
more scattered. The relative amounts measured with Raman
spectroscopy have been transformed into the exact amount of
coke present in the solid by measuring the catalyst samples
after reactions with TGA. This allows us to put real values to
the amount of coke in the catalyst sample as a function of
reaction time. It is evident that without any correction applied
the band intensities do not reﬂect the reality as the amount of
coke seems to go through a maximum. An observation, which
is clearly in contrast with the TEOM data. Instead, the data
obtained after applying one of the correction methods results
in coke uptake patterns, very similar to those obtained with the
TEOM technique. Indeed, quantitative Raman spectroscopy
indicates that a maximum amount of coke is formed after
about 40–50 min-on-stream. The small diﬀerences between the
TEOM method and both Raman quantitation methods should
be entirely related to the diﬀerent reactor designs used.

Combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy and
on-line activity measurements of a 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 propane
dehydrogenation catalyst, without using an internal boron
nitride standard
Since the Raman BN peak at 1350 cm1 overlaps with the coke
band at 1330 cm1 we have applied the same methodology to a
catalyst sample without BN. The obtained catalytic perfor-
mances are shown in Fig. 9. It was found that the selectivity
towards propene readily reaches a value around 92%, while the
conversion increases to a maximum value of about 50% after
34 min-on-stream. Trendwise these results are very similar to
those obtained for a catalyst containing BN, although the exact
maxima are not identical.
Based on the Raman spectra measured and by applying the
G(RN) correction factor one can quantify the 1330 and 1580
cm1 bands. The obtained results are included in Fig. 9. The

Raman bands gradually increases with increasing time-on-
stream and reaches a maximum after 34 min-on-stream, after
which a gradual but slow decrease takes place. This maximum
and decrease almost coincide with the corresponding conver-
sion plot. This indicates that after 34 min on stream the nature
of the coke is becoming more graphitic.33–38,41,42 In other
words, it seems that the initial coke formed is beneﬁcial for
the propane dehydrogenation as the propane conversion in-
creases with increasing coke content. After 34 min-on-stream a
maximum conversion has been reached, however at this point,
the type of coke is changing towards graphite, which is detri-
mental to the catalyst performance. Thus, a plausible explana-
tion for the activity data is that coke is formed and facilitates
the adsorption of propane near the active propane dehydro-
genation site; as the reaction proceeds this results in more coke
formation, which ﬁnally blocks the dehydrogenation site due
to graphitisation.

Coke proﬁles as a function of the catalyst bed height
In another experiment we have measured the Raman spectra
during a propane dehydrogenation cycle as a function of the
catalyst bed height. The corresponding G(RN) corrected Ra-
man spectra obtained after 250 min-on-stream are given in
Fig. 10 and both 1580 and 1330 cm1 Raman bands are clearly
visible. As expected the relative intensity of the Raman spectra
increases from top (reactor inlet) to bottom (reactor outlet).
After the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst was removed from
the reactor and the amount of coke was determined by TGA at
diﬀerent bed heights. These amounts should correspond ac-
cording to our methodology with the integrated intensity of the
G(RN) corrected Raman spectra. The result is shown in Fig. 11.
As expected there is a good correlation between the amount of
coke quantiﬁed with Raman spectroscopy and the amount of
coke independently measured with TGA. According to this
plot the error in our measurements is close to 10%. The
experiment also illustrates that propene formed during reaction
seems to be the precursor for the coke made at the catalyst
surface.
5.
Evaluation of Raman quantitation based on the G(RN)
correction factor
The proposed method provides an elegant and a more gen-
erally applicable procedure to determine in a quantitative
manner the amount of surface species measured with Raman
spectroscopy inside a catalytic reactor as a function of the
reaction time and catalyst bed height. The main advantage of
the developed method is that no additional compound is
required to quantify the measured Raman spectra. In this
particular set of experiments, boron nitride, although catalyti-
cally inert, is not a good internal standard since its Raman
peak clearly overlaps with one of the coke bands. In general, all
methods of referencing to an internal standard are highly
speciﬁc to the systems to which they are applied.
The assumption for Raman quantitation using the G(RN)
correction factor is that the scattering coeﬃcient s is constant
during the experiment. This means that quantitation is possible
within one experiment, but not straightforward when diﬀerent
catalyst samples in diﬀerent runs are compared. The developed
approach also shows excellent potential for remote sensing
applications. More in particularly, to monitor on-line the
amount of coke in e.g. an industrial propane dehydrogenation
reactor at diﬀerent positions in the reactor bed. Our data
illustrates that coke deposits are beneﬁcial for propene forma-
tion as long as the amount of coke is not too high and has not
been transformed into graphite-like coke deposits. In other
words, the developed technique is ideally suited for developing
an expert system to control this catalytic process on the basis of
spectroscopic data. The amount and type of coke can then be
monitored by using Raman spectroscopy and the obtained
data are analyzed in a quantitative manner with the aid of
UV-Vis-NIR diﬀuse reﬂectance spectroscopy. The latter tech-
nique, in addition, allows us to detect on the basis of the

Conclusions
Two diﬀerent methods of Raman quantitation, namely the use
of an internal boron nitride standard and a diﬀuse reﬂectance
correction factor have been explored in order to determine the
amount of coke present in a catalytic reactor during a propane
dehydrogenation cycle. It was found that both approaches are
suitable, but the use of a combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-
NIR set-up clearly has the advantage that no additional
compounds have to be added to the catalytic system under
investigation. Comparing the results to TGA/TEOM data has
proven the validation of the method. They all are in good
agreement with each other. The new method, in which a UV-
Vis correction factor is applied, allows with an estimated error
of 10% to quantify the amount of coke formed in a propane
dehydrogenation reactor as a function of catalyst bed height as
well as reaction time. The tools are now in place to develop an
expert system for spectroscopic control of an industrial pro-
pane dehydrogenation reactor.
It was also found that propene is the precursor for coke
formation at the catalyst surface and the ﬁrst coke made is
beneﬁcial for propane dehydrogenation. This is due to a
facilitated adsorption of propane. As the reaction proceeds,
the increased amount of coke formed in the neighbourhood of
the alkane dehydrogenation sites becomes more graphitic,
preventing the formation of propene and as a consequence
the activity drops. Thus, the amount of coke formed seems to
