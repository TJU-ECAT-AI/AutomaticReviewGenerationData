An empirical correlation is described for relating Raman stretching frequencies of chromium-oxygen 
(Cr-0) bonds to their 
bond lengths in chromium oxide reference compounds. An exponential fit of crystallographically determined Cr- 0 
bond lengths 
to Cr-0 
Raman symmetric stretching frequencies (800-1300 cm-') is presented along with a relation between Cr-0 
bond 
strengths and Raman stretching frequencies. These empirical correlations have led to a systematic method for determining the 
coordination and bond lengths of chromates. The developed method is illustrated for chromates with unknown local structure in 
Bi203 K,CrO, sillenite and for different supported chromium oxide catalysts. The obtained results are compared with those 
previously obtained by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. 
Raman spectroscopy is an excellent technique for the eluci- 
dation of molecular structures of complex transition metal 
oxides present as either bulk phases or as two-dimensional 
surface phases. '-, This is because Raman spectroscopy 
directly probes the structure and bonding of a metal oxide 
complex by its vibrational spectrum. Therefore, this technique 
can be successfully used to discriminate between different 
molecular structures on oxide surfaces. For example, mono-, 
di-, tri- and tetrachromate surface species were found to be 
present on hydrated surfaces of supported chromium oxide 
catalysts and the polymerization degree of the surface chro- 
mate species was found to depend on the specific iso-electric 
point of the inorganic ~ u p p o r t . ~ - ~  
Vibrational spectroscopy has also proven useful in the char- 
acterization of simple diatomic molecules. For many years 
there has been considerable interest in deriving expressions 
relating crystallographically determined bond lengths to 
observed vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules. The 
most common empirical expression relating harmonic force 
constant and interatomic distance for diatomic molecules is 
Badger's rule, which has been extended to many families of 
molecules but does not adequately relate bond distances to 
force constants in polyatomic  molecule^.^-^ Recently, the 
diatomic approximation was used by our group to justify the 
observed 
relationship 
between 
molybdenum-oxygen, lo 
vanadium-oxygen,' ' niobium-oxygen,' 
bismuth-oxygen' 
and, tungsten-oxygen14 bond lengths and their corresponding 
Raman stretching frequencies. However, a chromium-oxygen 
correlation does not exist in the literature and is required for 
better structural determination of Cr-0 
compounds and 
supported chromium oxide catalysts. 
In the present study, the diatomic approximation is used to 
establish empirical relationships between Cr- 0 
bond lengths 
and Raman stretching frequencies of chromium oxide refer- 
ence compounds in the solid state, the gas phase and in solu- 
tion. An exponential function was found to most reasonably 
describe the empirical dependence between the Cr-0 
bond 
length and Raman stretching frequency. The presented corre- 
lation is an invaluable tool for structural characterization of a 
chromium oxide compound because its Raman spectrum may 
be interpreted in terms of Cr-0 bond lengths. This is illus-

Experimental 
Chromium oxide reference compounds and supported 
chromium oxide catalysts 
The Raman spectra of the following chromium oxide reference 
compounds were collected in our laboratory: K,CrO, , 
K,Cr,O, and CrO, . 
The Raman band positions of CrO,Cl, , 
CrO,,-, 
Cr,O,'-,

and

were taken from the literat~re.'~-'' The investi- 
gated chromium oxide catalysts were: Cr/SiO, , Cr/Al,O, , 
Cr/Nb,O, , Cr/TiO, and Cr/ZrO, . Details about the prep- 
aration and the characteristics of these supported chromium 
oxide catalysts can be found el~ewhere.~-~*' 
8-24 The bismuth 
chromate compound was prepared by mixing stoichiometric 
amounts 
of 
Bi,O, 
(99.9%) 
with 
K,CrO, 
(with 
Bi : 
Cr = 18 : 
1). The mixture was ground in acetone with an 
agate mortar and pestle, dried in air overnight, and then 
heated at ca. 600°C for 72 h in air. The obtained sample was 
orange. The exact stoichiometry of this compound is 
unknown but can be denoted as a Bi203 
* K,CrO, compound. 
A reference sample without Cr, treated in identical conditions 
was made for comparison and had a yellow colour. 
Laser Raman spectroscopy 
Raman spectra were obtained by using a Spectra-Physics 
(Mountain View, CA, USA) Model 171 Ar' laser, where the 
exciting line was 514.5 nm. The laser power at the samples 
was maintained at 10-20 mW. The scattered radiation was 
then directed into a Spex Triplemate (Edison, NJ, USA) 
Model 1877 spectrometer coupled to a Princeton Applied 
Research OMAIII Model 1463 optical multichannel analyser 
equipped with an intensified photodiode array detector cooled 
thermoelectrically to - 
35 "C. Under ambient conditions, the 
laser beam was focused on the sample illuminator, where the 
sample typically spins at about 2000 rpm to avoid local 
heating. The scattered Raman light was reflected into the 
spectrometer by a 90" angle with the incident light, and was 
collected and analysed by the optical multichannel analyser. 
The overall spectral resolution was determined to be better 
than 2 cm-'. The catalysts were dehydrated at 500°C for 1 h

collected at room temperature by using a special designed cell. 
The reference compounds were measured as such. Ultrahigh- 
purity hydrocarbon-free oxygen (Linde gas, Union Carbide,

Theory 
Diatomic approximation 
Several types of approximations may be made in order to 
more easily interpret the Raman spectrum of a complex tran- 
sition metal oxide species. First, it is commonly assumed that 
the internal and external modes of the crystal are independent 
of one another. The internal modes of a molecular unit occur 
in the high-frequency region and constitute the normal vibra- 
tions of the molecular unit. The external modes occur at lower 
frequency and correspond to translations and vibrations of 
the molecular units within the crystal. Such a separation of 
the internal modes of the molecular unit contained within the 
crystal from the external modes of the crystalline lattice is an 
assumption of the site symmetry appr~ximation.~~ 
The site symmetry approach begins by assigning a high 
degree of symmetry at each site within a unit cell (usually, the 
actual symmetry at these sites is lower than that assigned). As 
the site symmetries within the crystalline lattice must be 
assigned beforehand, a detailed knowledge of the structure of 
the crystal is a prerequisite. The site symmetry approach leads 
to the total number of infrared- and Raman-active modes and 
allows the vibrational spectrum of a confined, distorted mol- 
ecule within the crystal to be directly compared to that of a 
similar molecule in free space or in solution. Thus, although 
the site symmetry approach is useful in allowing the observed 
Raman bands to be assigned to symmetry species, it does not 
directly yield structural information about metal oxide species 
contained within the crystalline lattice. 
In the present study, another type of approximation is used, 
called the diatomic approximation. Such an approximation is 
necessary for justifying the direct relationship observed 
between metal-oxygen bond lengths and Raman stretching 
frequencies in transition metal oxide compounds. Whereas the 
site symmetry approximation assumes that each metal oxide 
polyhedron is separated from the crystalline lattice, the 
diatomic approximation assumes that each distinct metal- 
oxygen is vibrationally independent of the crystalline lattice. 
Thus, to a first approximation, the Raman spectrum of a crys- 
talline metal oxide is a superposition of the stretching fre- 
quencies from an assembly of metal-oxygen 
diatomic 
oscillators. Each oscillator has a unique vibrational bond. If 
the metal-oxygen bond is assumed to act like a harmonic 
oscillator, then the stretching force constant may be found 
from its square-root dependence on vibrational frequency. In 
the present study, the diatomic approximation is shown to be 
justified for chromium oxide reference compounds within the 
experimental accuracy afforded by the measurement of 
Raman stretching frequencies and crystallographically deter- 
mined Cr-0 bond lengths. 
Relating Raman stretching frequency to bond length and bond 
order 
Many empirical and semi-empirical formulae are present in 
the literature of simple diatomic molecules. These formulae 
relate physical parameters such as bond distances, force con- 
stants and bond 
Efforts have also been directed 
at extending force constant/bond distance relationships to 
polyatomic molecules. Perhaps the most common expression 
relating bond lengths to force constants in diatomic molecules 
is Badger's rule. A general form of Badger's rule is expressed 
as: 
k-'/3 = 
(aij 
- 
dij)-'(R - 
d..) 
where k (mdyn A-') is the force constant for a particular 
bond, R (A) is the equilibrium bond length, and d, and aij 
are 
constants (fixed for designated bonds between atoms from 
rows i a n d j  
of the periodic table). Recently, Badger's rule has 
been used to correlate uranium-oxygen 
bond lengths with 
both symmetric and antisymmetric stretching frequencies for 
dioxo functionalities (UO,) in uranium oxide  compound^.^' 
In previous s t ~ d i e s ' ~ - ' ~  
and in the course of the present work, 
it was found that Badger's rule does not adequately correlate 
bond distances to stretching frequencies or force constants. 
This is because k -  1/3 is not a linear function of R but exhibits 
a slight curvature. Herschbach' 
encountered a similar 
problem in fitting cubic anharmonic force constants to inter- 
nuclear distances for diatomic molecules. Consequently, 
Herschbach applied an exponential fit to conveniently 
account for the slight curvature in the data.' Numerical fits of 
the present Cr-0 bond length/stretching frequency data have 
also led to a simple exponential dependence between Raman 
stretching frequencies and Cr-0 
bond lengths. Thus, in 
accordance with Herschbach's treatment, an exponential func- 
tion of the form: 
v = A exp(BR) 
(2) 
is applied in the present work as the most convenient method 
of relating Cr-0 stretching frequencies and bond distances in 
bulk, solution and gas phase chromium oxide reference com- 
pounds where v is the Cr-0 
stretching frequency, R is the 
Cr-0 interatomic distance, and A and B are fitting param- 
eters. If we assume that each Cr-0 
bond can be modelled 
after a harmonic oscillator, then the stretching frequency is 
directly proportional to the square root of the force constant. 
The Pauling bond strengths (in valence units), also referred 
to as bond orders or bond valences, of the Cr-0 bonds and 
the calculated valence state of the chromium cation are also 
useful in discussing the plausibility of proposed structures. 
30 
The bond valence reflects the relative strength of a chemical 
bond and shows the distribution of available valence electrons 
in the chemical bonding of a molecular species. Furthermore, 
according to Pauling's valence sum rule, there is a conserva- 
tion of valency associated with the metal cation. Hence, the 
calculated valence state can be compared to the formal oxida- 
tion state of the chromium cation and serves as a book- 
keeping device for the distribution among the available 
Cr-0 bonds. 
A general relationship has been developed by Brown and 
Wu3' that relates the cation-oxygen bond valence s to the 
interatomic distance R. The empirical expression for relating a 
Cr-0 bond length to its bond valence is: 
s(Cr-0) = 
(R/1.787)-5.0 
(3) 
where 1.787 
8, is the estimated bond length for a Cr-0 bond 
of unit valency. The empirical parameters of eqn. (3), 1.787 
and 5.0, were determined based on data from 23 Cr6+ 
 environment^.^' The valence sum rule, as discussed by 
Brown,30 is extremely useful in estimating valence states of 
chromium cations in chromate structures. The valence state of 
a chromium cation is calculated by adding the contributions 
from each Cr-0 
bond as determined by eqn. (3). For 
example, any deviation of a calculated valence state that lies 
outside 6.0 _+ 0.2 valence units suggests a source of error in 
the bond length data. Common sources of error may be 
attributed to a misassigned oxidation state or erroneously 
determined bond lengths. In the course of the present work we 
have found some research papers on the structural determi- 
nation of chromium oxide compounds, which show unreason- 
able Cr-0 distances. For example, a crystallographic study

The procedure for making assignments of the Raman 
stretching frequencies to Cr-0 
bond lengths for the chro- 
mium oxide reference compounds is straightforward. The 
shortest Cr-0 bonds of the reference compounds were corre- 
lated with the highest symmetric stretching frequencies 
[v,(CrO,); v,(CrO,) or v,(CrO,)] and are typically associated 
with the terminal Cr=O bonds of the chromate structures. 
The obtained results are plotted in Fig. 1, which shows the 
relation between the crystallographic Cr-0 bond lengths and 
corresponding Cr-0 stretching band positions, summarized 
in Table 1. A least square fit of the data to the exponential 
function, described by eqn. (2), yields the following expression 
for the bond length-stretching frequency correlation : 
(4) 
v = 13055 exp( - 
1.6419*R) 
where v is in cm-' and R is in A. 
The precision in the calcu- 
lation of a Cr-0 
bond length R from a measured Raman 
frequency using the bond length-stretching frequency corre- 
lation is 0.030 A. The standard deviation in the estimate of a 
Raman stretching frequency from an absolute Cr-0 
bond 
length is 46 cm-'. 
Bond order-stretching frequency correlations are also 
useful in the determination of chromate structures because the 
Cr-0 
bond order is representative of the strength of the 
chemical bond. The combined use of the empirical relation of 
Brown and Wu, eqn. (3), and the above bond length- 
stretching frequency correlation yields the following relation 
between the Pauling Cr-0 
bond strength (in valence units) 
and Raman stretching frequency: 
s(Cr-0) = [

Discussion 
Evaluation of the bond lengthtrength frequency correlation 
The Cr-0 correlation is derived from an exponential fit of 
the crystallographically determined bond distances and 
observed Raman stretching frequencies. Such a direct relation- 
ship between these two experimental observables is justified 
under the assumptions of the diatomic aproximation. The 
basic assumption behind this correlation is that each distinct 
Cr-0 
bond is entirely separated from its crystalline lattice. 
Such a separation means that there are no vibrational inter- 
actions between neighbouring Cr-0 
bonds in the lattice. 
Each isolated Cr-0 
bond exhibits a stretching frequency 
which is characteristic of its bond length. To a first approx- 
imation, the Raman spectrum is a superposition of these 
Cr-0 stretching frequencies. We have limited our analysis to 
the symmetric stretching frequency because this is the most 
intense high frequency band and consequently easy to

measure. However, because the diatomic approximation 
ignores the point symmetry of a molecule, symmetric and 
antisymmetric stretching frequencies cannot be distinguished 
and a particular assignment must be handled with care. 
There are both advantages and disadvantages of using the 
diatomic approximation to derive a correlation between 
Cr-0 bond distances and stretching frequencies. The advan- 
tage of the technique lies in its simplicity. Within the limits of 
experimental error (k46 cm- '), the diatomic approximation 
immediately provides a good estimate of Cr-0 
bond dis- 
tances (f0.030 A) from observed stretching frequencies. These 
spectroscopically determined bond distances can be expressed 
in terms of bond valences and evaluated to determine the 
plausibility of proposed structures. Conversely, if the bond 
distances of a metal oxide are already known, then the stretch- 
ing frequencies corresponding to these bonds may be predict- 
ed. The disadvantage of the diatomic approximation, but 
itself, does not lead to an assignment of the symmetry species 
of the Raman vibrational modes. 
Applications 
Determining stretching frequencies for ideal structures: CrO, 
and 00,. 
An interesting application of the developed Cr-0 
correlation is the prediction of Raman stretching frequencies 
for proposed chromate structures. The stretching frequencies 
for the perfect CrO, tetrahedron and CrO, octahedron can be 
estimated from the developed Cr-0 correlation. These ideal 
structures have a high degree of point-group symmetry (q 
and Oh, 
respectively). Consequently, vibrational interactions 
between bonds are expected to be significant. In spite of these 
significant vibrational interactions, the diatomic approx- 
imation may be used to provide an excellent estimate of the 
frequency of the totally symmetric Cr-0 stretching mode for 
each of these structures. This is because the magnitude of the 
vibrational interactions constants between neighbouring 
Cr-0 bonds is of the same order as the error associated with 
the experimental measurements of crystallographic Cr-0 
bond distances and Raman stretching frequencies. The 
stretching frequencies of the regular CrO, and CrO, struc- 
tures are estimated by first equally dividing the six valence 
units of bond order between the four bonds of the tetrahedron 
and the six bonds of the octahedron. This results in 
R(Cr-0) = 1.648 A for CrO, and R(Cr-0) = 1.787 8, for 
CrO, by eqn. (3). 
If these bond distances are considered absol- 
ute (without error), then the Cr-0 
correlation [eqn. (4)] 
yields symmetric stretching frequencies of 873 cm-' for the 
perfect CrO, tetrahedron and 694 cm-' for the perfect CrO, 
octahedron. 
A comparison of the predicted stretching frequency of the 
perfect CrO, structure with those of existing chromate com- 
pounds suggests that a perfect CrO, tetrahedron may exist. 
On the other hand, octahedral CrO, structures (with oxida- 
tion state 6) are not reported up to now4' and the calculated 
value must be only regarded as a prediction. The most perfect 
CrO, tetrahedron listed in Table 1 is present in K,CrO, 
which has a symmetric stretching frequency of 874 cm-'. 
Thus, the CrO, tetrahedron present in K,CrO, 
probably 
contain a perfect & structure. The CTO,(~~)'- 
is believed to 
have also a perfect & symmetry. However, the value is 26 
cm-' lower than 873 cm-', predicted for the perfect tetra- 
hedron, and is indicative for some irregularities, although the 
observed value lies within the standard deviation. All the 
other structures with four coordinated chromium, reported in 
Table 1, have a lower point symmetry and consequently their 
bond length deviates from 1.649 
A.

trum of the orange Bi,O,. K,CrO, sample (Bi :

According to eqn. (4), this stretching frequency corresponds 
with a R(Cr-0) = 1.687 A, only slightly higher than for a 
perfect CrO, tetrahedron. This is indicative for the presence of 
a Cr6+ site in the Br,O, K,CrO, compound with a slightly 
distorted & coordination. 
Determining the structure of supported chromium oxides. 
The determination of bond distances from Raman stretching 
frequencies is of most benefit when diffraction techniques are 
unable to detect oxygen positions because of the absence of 
long-range order. Such is the case for supported metal oxides 
which are present as two-dimensional metal oxide overlayers 
on high surface area oxide substrates. Consequently, diffrac- 
tion techniques are not suitable for studying the structures of 
surface metal oxides. One example of surface metal oxides is 
the surface chromium oxide species supported on different 
inorganic supports, which is known to be active in oxidation, 
dehydrogenation-hydrogenation 
and polymerization reac- 
tiom6 
The highest observed Raman stretching frequencies of series 
of supported chromium oxide catalysts are summarized in 
Tables 2 and 3, together with the calculated bond lengths and 
bond orders. Table 2 shows that for all dehydrated supported 
chromium oxide catalysts the bond order is near 2 and one 
can calculate a stretching frequency of 1015 cm-' for a perfect 
Cr-0 
bond (s = 
2). On the other hand, the hydrated cata- 
lysts have frequencies in the range 880-960 cm- ' 
and, conse-

* According to reference 5. 
quently, lower bond orders or high bond lengths are observed 
than for the dehydrated counterparts. Therefore, hydrated 
monochromate is dominant on alumina, titania, zirconia and 
niobia, whereas on a silica surface mainly dichromate is 
observed. Furthermore, the calculated bond lengths for 
hydrated Cr/SiO, and Cr/Al,O, catalysts agree with those 
previously obtained on the same samples by X-ray absorption 
spectro~copy.~ 
This confirms that the derived Cr-0 
corre- 
lation is physically meaningful and applicable for structure 
determination. 
In summary, the Cr-0 
correlation provides a powerful 
tool in the interpretation of Raman spectra of chromium 
oxide species on inorganic surfaces. In cases where diffraction 
techniques fall short of providing oxygen positions, Raman 
spectroscopy may be used to determine Cr-0 bond distances 
for the chromate species. Knowledge of the bond distances of 
a chromate species can lead to information concerning its 
coordination and structure. Such an approach should popu- 
larize Raman spectroscopy as a complementary technique to 
diffraction methods in the structural studies of complex tran- 
sition metal oxide systems. 
Conclusions 
An empirical correlation was established between Cr-0 
Raman stretching frequency and bond length. The correlation 
is based on Raman symmetric stretching frequencies and pre- 
viously reported crystallographic Cr-0 
bond lengths. The 
obtained correlation was further combined with Brown’s 
empirical correlation between Cr-0 
bond length and bond 
strength (in valence units) to derive a relation between stretch- 
ing frequency and bond strength. The developed relationships 
are expected to be of high importance to gain insight into 
structures of surface chromium oxide species, especially for 
those chemical systems which are not amenable to analysis by 
diffraction or other spectroscopic techniques. In this work, 
Raman stretching were predicted for the perfect CrO, and 
CrO, structures. The Cr-0 
bond distances of different sup- 
ported chromium oxide catalysts were determined from their 
Raman spectra. The Cr-0 
correlation is expected to aid in 
the determination of the structure of chromium oxide species 
on various oxide supports, which are heterogeneous catalysts 
for many industrially important reactions.
