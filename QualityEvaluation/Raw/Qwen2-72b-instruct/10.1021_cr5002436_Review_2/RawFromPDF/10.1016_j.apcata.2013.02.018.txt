(Cr2O3/Al2O3) catalysts
 with large  speciﬁc

 were  stud-
ied
 in  detail.
 The  chromium
 species  were  highly
 dispersed
 over
 the  catalyst
 with
 chromia
 loading  up  to
10
 wt.%.  The
 speciﬁc
 surface  area
 of  the  catalyst
 decreased,
 whereas
 the  amount  of
 surface
 Cr3+ species
and
 the  mole  ratio  of
 Cr3+ and  Cr6+ species
 (Cr3+/Cr6+)  increased
 with  the  increasing
 chromia
 loadings
(5–25
 wt.%)
 and  calcination
 temperature
 (500–900 ◦C),  respectively.
 The  addition
 of
 potassium
 to
 the  cat-
alyst
 system  greatly
 promoted
 isobutene
 selectivity
 and  catalyst  stability.
 The  catalyst
 with
 1.5  wt.% K2O
and
 10 wt.%  Cr2O3 loadings
 calcined  at  800 ◦C
 was  found  to  exhibit
 the  highest
 isobutane
 conversion
 60.1%
with
 the  isobutene
 selectivity
 up  to 93.2%  among  all  the  catalysts.
 The  maintainable
 catalytic
 reactivity
demonstrated
 the  high  stability
 of  the  catalyst
 in  ten  dehydrogenation-regeneration
 cycles.  Moreover,
it
 was proposed
 that the  Cr3+ species
 was  mainly
 the active  site  and  catalytic
 selectivity
 was  depended
on
 the surface  Cr3+/Cr6+ value
 over  the  catalyst.
 The  catalyst
 presented
 much  more
 stable
 dehydrogena-
tion
 activity
 compared
 with  the  conventional
 catalyst.
 Consequently,
 this  study  presents
 a  feasible
 way
to
 facile
 synthesis
 of  the  mesoporous
 MOF-derived
 Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts
 with  high  stability
 and  good

 Introduction
Catalytic
 
dehydrogenation
 
of
 
isobutane
 
over
 
the
 
chro-
mia/alumina
 (Cr2O3/Al2O3)
 catalyst
 is
 an
 industrially
 important
route
 for
 producing
 isobutene,
 a
 vital
 component
 for
 the
 synthesis
of
 MTBE
 (methyl
 tert-butyl
 ether)
 and
 ETBE
 (ethyl
 tert-butyl
 ether),
which
 are
 increasingly
 demanded
 as
 octane
 number
 boosters
 for
unleaded
 gasoline
 in
 the
 worldwide
 recently
 [1–6].
 Dehydrogena-
tion
 is
 typically
 performed
 at
 relatively
 high
 temperatures
 and
low
 pressures
 due
 to
 thermodynamic
 requirements.
 However,
reaction
 conditions,
 such
 as
 high
 temperature,
 usually
 facilitate
the
 thermal
 cracking
 and
 coke
 formation,
 thus
 result
 in
 reduced
isobutane
 conversion,
 decreased
 isobutene
 selectivity
 and
 severe
deactivation
 of
 the
 catalyst
 [7–9].
 It
 is
 therefore
 the
 key
 issue
 to
develop
 catalyst
 with
 the
 ability
 of
 possessing
 high
 and
 stable

Supported
 Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst
 has
 been
 applied
 for
 the
 isobu-
tane
 dehydrogenation
 on
 a
 commercial
 scale
 for
 years
 [10].
Currently,
 this
 catalyst
 system
 occupies
 more
 than
 half
 of
 the
 world
market
 of
 the
 commercial
 catalysts
 for
 parafﬁn
 dehydrogenation
[11].
 It
 is
 well
 known
 that
 the
 nature
 of
 surface
 chromia
 is
 related
to
 the
 catalytic
 activity
 and
 selectivity.
 The
 speciation
 of
 surface
chromia
 is
 strongly
 depended
 on
 the
 type
 of
 the
 support,
 the
chromium
 content
 and
 calcination
 treatment
 [1,2,12–15].
 De
 Rossi
et
 al.
 reported
 that
 Cr6+ species
 with
 minor
 amount
 of
 Cr5+ species
were
 produced
 on
 -Al2O3 and
 silica
 carriers,
 whereas
 Cr6+ and
 Cr5+
species
 in
 comparable
 amounts
 on
 the
 zirconia
 support
 [13].
 Cavani
et
 al.
 observed
 that
 the
 relative
 concentration
 of
 surface
 Cr3+ and
Cr6+ species
 increased
 with
 the
 increasing
 chromia
 loading.
 They
also
 found
 that
 only
 Cr3+ species
 were
 produced
 over
 the
 surface
 of
the
 reduced
 catalyst
 [2].  Besides,
 the
 researchers
 have
 been
 devoted
to
 improving
 the
 catalytic
 dehydrogenation
 activity
 and
 selectivity
as
 well
 as
 the
 catalyst
 stability.
 It
 has
 been
 reported
 that
 the
 addi-
tion
 of
 alkali
 metal,
 such
 as
 potassium,
 to
 the
 oxide
 catalyst
 system
usually
 promotes
 the
 catalytic
 selectivity
 of
 oleﬁns
 and
 improves

 of
 the
 catalyst
 to
 deactivation
 [2,6,16–22].  Many
preparation
 methods
 for
 the
 Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts
 described
 in
 the
literatures,
 such
 as
 incipient
 wetness
 impregnation,
 atomic
 layer
epitaxy
 (ALE),
 co-precipitation
 method
 and
 evaporation-induced
self-assembly
 (EISA)
 strategy,
 have
 been
 explored
 over
 the
 alkanes
dehydrogenation
 [2,7,15,23,24].
 However,
 the
 utilization
 of
 the
method
 that
 the
 precursor
 containing
 aluminium
 source
 impreg-
nated
 into
 the
 Cr-based
 framework
 to
 prepare
 the
 Cr2O3/Al2O3
catalyst
 for
 isobutane
 dehydrogenation
 has
 been
 paid
 little
 atten-
tion
 so
 far.
 The
 similar
 reports
 for
 this
 method
 were
 employed
 to
prepare
 the
 nickel
 catalysts
 in
 the
 reaction
 of
 methane
 decomposi-
tion
 [25–27].  This
 method
 may
 be
 contributable
 to
 a
 high
 dispersion
of
 chromium
 species
 over
 the
 support.

 us
to
 prepare
 the
 mesoporous
 Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst
 using
 it
 as
 a
molecular

 and

 [32–35].  In
 the
 current
work,
 the
 mesoporous
 Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst
 with
 large
 speciﬁc
surface
 area
 and
 high
 pore
 volume
 was
 synthesized
 by
 utilizing
 the
MIL-101

 as
 a
 molecular

 and
 chromium
 precursor,
aluminium

 (Al(i-OC3H7)3)
 as

 The
 chromia
 loadings,
 addition
 of
 potassium

 (K2O)
 and

 of
 the
 catalyst
 were
 investigated
 in
 detail
over
 the
 isobutane
 dehydrogenation.
 The

 In

MIL-101
 was
 synthesized
 by
 the
 solvothermal
 method
 accord-
ing
 to
 the
 previous
 literature
 with
 the
 exception
 that
 the
 mole
 ratio
of
 n(Cr(NO3)3·9H2O:n(H2BDC):n(HF):
 n(H2O)
 was
 1:1:0.5:280
 [36].
The
 as-synthesized
 MIL-101
 was
 degassed
 under
 reduced
 pressure
at
 150 ◦C
 for
 12
 h
 to
 remove
 the
 guest
 molecules.
 The
 pretreated
MIL-101
 (0.56
 g)
 was
 added
 into
 absolute
 ethanol
 (EtOH)
 solution
containing
 Al(i-OC3H7)3 (0.30
 mol
 L−1,
 100
 mL)
 and
 impregnated
by
 ultrasonic
 for
 1.5
 h.
 Afterwards,
 the
 mixture
 was
 stirred
 at
 50 ◦C
to
 evaporate
 slowly
 the
 solvent
 to
 form
 a
 green
 paste.
 The
 paste
was
 dried
 at
 120 ◦C
 overnight
 to
 obtain
 a
 bright
 green
 powder,
which
 was
 calcined
 at
 600 ◦C
 for
 4
 h
 in

 to
 obtain
 the
 catalyst,

To
 examine
 the
 additive
 K2O
 over
 the
 reactivity
 of
 isobutane
dehydrogenation,
 KOH
 (0.04

 together
 with
 Al(i-OC3H7)3 was
 dis-
solved
 in
 EtOH
 solution
 according
 to
 the
 preparation
 steps
 of
 the
catalyst
 10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600)
 mentioned

 obtain
 the
 cata-
lyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600)

 loading.
In
 order
 to
 investigate
 the
 calcination
 temperature
 over
 the
 cat-
alytic
 activity
 and
 selectivity
 of
 isobutane
 dehydrogenation,
 the
catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(T)
 (T

 was
 calcined
 at
 500 ◦C,
 600 ◦C,

 800 ◦C
 and
900 ◦C,
 respectively.
The
 reference

 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-
10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800)-R
 was
 prepared
 by
 impregnation
 method
 and
described
 as
 follows:
 KOH
 (0.04
 g)
 and
 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O
 (0.90
 g)
 were
dissolved
 in
 EtOH
 solvent
 (100

 After
 adding
 -Al2O3 (1.53
 g),
the
 mixture
 was
 stirred
 at
 50 ◦C
 to
 evaporate
 slowly
 the
 solvent
 to
form
 a

 The
 following
 preparation
 steps
 were
 the

 Catalytic
 tests
The
 reactivity
 of
 the
 each
 catalyst
 over
 isobutane
 dehydrogena-
tion
 was
 carried
 out
 in
 a
 continuous
 ﬂow
 reactor
 consisting
 of
 a
ﬁxed-bed
 quartz
 tube
 at
 600 ◦C.
 The
 each
 catalyst
 (0.60
 g,
 60–80

 was
 loaded
 in
 the
 reactor
 supported
 on
 the
 quartz
 sand,
then
 heated
 to
 the
 set
 temperature
 under
 the
 N2 ﬂow.
 The
 isobu-

 fed
 into
 the
 reactor
 during
 5
 min.
 The
 reaction

were
 analyzed
 for
 2
 h
 time-on-stream

 the
 fresh
 catalysts
 was
 changed
to
 the
 black
 one
 after
 the
 isobutane
 dehydrogenation.
 In
 case
 of
the
 ten
 dehydrogenation-regeneration
 cycles,
 the
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-
10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800)
 was
 regenerated
 under

 at
 650 ◦C
 for
 2
 h
 and
cooled
 down
 to
 room
 temperature,
 then
 utilized
 to
 the
 next

 Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts
The
 preparation
 procedure
 of
 the
 mesoporous
 Cr2O3/Al2O3 cat-
alysts
 is
 suggested
 in
 Scheme
 S1
 (See
 the
 supporting
 information).
The
 Al(i-OC3H7)3 molecules
 go
 into
 the
 framework
 of
 MIL-101
 by
adsorption
 and
 diffusion
 with
 ultrasonic
 impregnation
 method
 to
obtain
 a
 composite
 precursor.
 Then
 the
 precursor
 is
 directly
 cal-
cined
 at
 a
 set
 temperature
 by
 decomposing
 the
 organic
 part
 to
produce
 the
 Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.

 The
 characterizations
 of
 the
 fresh
 catalysts
3.2.1.
 Textural
 analysis
The
 N2 adsorption-desorption
 isotherms
 and
 pore
 size
 distri-
butions
 for
 the
 two
 series
 fresh
 catalysts
 xCr2O3/Al2O3(600)
 and
1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(T)
 are
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 S1.
 Hysteresis
 loops
between
 adsorption
 and
 desorption
 branches
 can
 be
 observed
 for
all
 the
 catalysts,
 which
 demonstrated
 the
 existence
 of
 mesopores.
Table
 1
 summarizes
 the
 textural
 data
 of
 the
 catalysts.
 The
 aver-
age
 pore
 sizes
 of
 the
 catalysts
 were
 located
 between
 7.79
 nm
 and
17.22
 nm,
 clearly
 demonstrated
 its
 mesoporosity.
 It
 can
 be
 notice-
ably
 seen
 that
 the
 xCr2O3/Al2O3(600)
 catalysts
 with
 large
 BET
speciﬁc
 surface
 areas
 (237.0–381.6
 m2 g−1)
 and
 high
 pore
 volumes
(0.78–1.24
 cm3 g−1)
 were
 obtained
 with
 this
 method,
 which
 were
much
 higher
 than
 that
 of
 the
 mesoporous
 Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts
prepared
 with
 EISA
 strategy
 reported
 by
 Shee
 et
 al.
 [24].
 For
 the
series
 xCr2O3/Al2O3(600)
 catalysts,
 the
 BET
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
decreased
 from
 381.6
 m2 g−1 to
 237.0
 m2 g−1 as
 the
 chromia
 load-
ing
 increased
 from
 5
 wt.%
 to
 25
 wt.%.
 This
 was
 due
 to
 that
 the
 small
chromia
 particles
 gradually
 aggregated
 to
 large
 ones
 over
 the
 sur-
face
 of
 the
 catalyst
 with
 the
 increase
 of
 Cr2O3 loading,
 thus
 blocking
a
 portion
 of
 pores
 and
 resulting
 in
 the
 decrease
 of
 the
 speciﬁc
 sur-
face
 area
 of
 the
 catalyst.
 The
 pore
 size
 distribution
 of
 the
 catalyst
became
 broader
 and
 the
 pore
 size
 of
 the
 catalyst
 grew
 larger
 from
9.52
 nm
 to
 12.32
 nm
 as
 the
 Cr2O3 loading
 increased
 from
 5
 wt.%
to
 15
 wt.%,
 which
 were
 probably
 due
 to
 that
 the
 porous
 MIL-101
framework
 had
 some
 inﬂuence
 over
 the
 pore
 structure
 of
 the
 cat-
alyst.
After
 K2O
 was
 introduced
 to
 the
 catalyst
 system,
 both
 the
 BET
speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 375.6
 m2 g−1 and
 pore
 volume
 1.24
 cm3 g−1 of
the
 catalyst
 10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600)
 slightly
 declined
 to
 334.8
 m2 g−1
and
 1.04
 cm3 g−1 over
 the
 one
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600).
 Nev-
ertheless,
 the
 addition
 of
 K2O
 had
 no
 remarkable
 inﬂuence
 over
 the
pore
 size
 (9.54
 nm)
 of
 the
 catalyst,
 which
 indicated
 that
 introduc-
tion
 of
 K2O
 caused
 no
 pore
 plugging
 of
 the
 mesoporous
 Cr2O3/Al2O3
catalyst.
In
 case
 of
 the
 series
 catalysts
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(T)
 calcined
at
 different
 temperatures,
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(500)
 possessed
the
 largest
 BET
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 (337.2
 m2 g−1)
 and
 highest
 pore
volume
 (1.17
 cm3 g−1).
 It
 was
 observed
 that
 both
 the
 BET
 speciﬁc
surface
 area
 and
 pore
 volume
 of
 the
 catalyst
 became
 smaller
 and
the
 pore
 size
 gradually
 grew
 larger
 at
 the
 calcination
 tempera-
ture
 from
 500 ◦C
 to
 900 ◦C.
 Moreover,
 the
 pore
 size
 distribution
of
 the
 catalyst
 grew
 broader
 with
 increasing
 calcination
 tem-
perature
 (especially
 calcined
 at
 800 ◦C
 and
 900 ◦C,
 respectively).
The
 phenomenon
 was
 probably
 ascribed
 to
 that
 a
 small
 portion
of
 the
 pores
 went
 collapsed
 at
 high
 calcination
 temperature.
 By
contrast
 with
 the
 reference
 catalyst
 (234.3
 m2 g−1),
 the
 catalyst
1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800)
 showed
 a
 smaller
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
190.9
 m2 g−1.
3.2.2.
 PXRD
 patterns
The
 PXRD
 patterns
 for
 the
 series
 fresh
 xCr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts
are
 presented
 in
 Fig.
 1A.
 No
 diffraction
 peaks
 are
 revealed
 in
 the
small
 angle
 range
 (0.6–5◦)
 of
 the
 series
 xCr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts
 (not
show),
 indicating
 their
 non-ordered
 pore
 structure.
 The
 crystalline
chromia
 phase
 was
 not
 visible
 in
 the
 PXRD
 patterns
 until
 the
 chro-
mia
 loading
 was
 up
 to
 15
 wt.%,
 suggesting
 that
 the
 sizes
 of
 chromia
particles
 were
 very
 small
 and
 the
 particles
 were
 highly
 dispersed
at
 least
 up
 to
 10
 wt.%
 loading
 on
 the
 alumina
 support
 [12].
 Fur-
thermore,
 the
 three
 broad
 and
 weak
 peaks
 at
 2
 
 =
 37.5◦,
 45.6◦and
66.5◦indicated
 the
 appearance
 of
 the
 crystalline
 -Al2O3 phase
 in
the
 support.
 However,
 the
 phase
 of
 alumina
 support
 was
 mainly
the
 amorphous
 phase
 calcined
 at
 600 ◦C.
The
 
PXRD
 
patterns
 
of
 
the
 
fresh
 
catalysts
 
1.5
 K2O-
10Cr2O3/Al2O3(T)
 calcined
 at
 different
 temperatures
 are
 described
in
 Fig.
 1B.
 Similar
 to
 the
 catalysts
 above,
 no
 peak
 signals
 were
observed
 in
 the
 small
 angle
 range
 for
 the
 series
 catalysts
 (not
 given),
also
 implying
 their
 non-ordered
 pore
 structures.
 K2O
 phase
 was
not
 revealed
 in
 the
 PXRD
 pattern
 of
 the
 K-doped
 catalyst,
 clearly
demonstrating
 that
 potassium
 species
 were
 highly
 dispersed
 on
the
 alumina
 support
 and
 had
 no
 signiﬁcant
 inﬂuence
 over
 the
phase
 of
 the
 catalyst.
 Moreover,
 the
 crystalline
 Cr2O3 phase
 was
not
 visible
 in
 the
 PXRD
 patterns
 of
 all
 the
 catalysts,
 indicating
that
 chromia
 species
 were
 highly
 dispersed
 and
 the
 calcination
temperature
 did
 not
 affect
 the
 dispersion
 of
 the
 chromia
 species.
Simultaneously,
 it
 was
 observed
 that
 the
 characteristic
 peak
 shape
and
 intensity
 of
 -Al2O3 phase
 in
 the
 PXRD
 patterns
 became
sharper
 and
 stronger
 with
 the
 higher
 calcination
 temperature,
suggesting
 that
 the
 support
 calcined
 at
 the
 higher
 temperature
possessed
 the
 pore
 wall
 with
 more
 crystalline
 -Al2O3 phase.
However,
 another
 crystalline
 phase
 -Al2O3 was
 visible
 in
 the
catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(900),
 implying
 that
 -Al2O3 phase
was
 partly
 transformed
 to
 -Al2O3 phase
 at
 900 ◦C.
3.2.3.
 TEM
 images
It  was
 very
 difﬁcult
 to
 obtain
 the
 clear
 TEM
 images
 due
 to
 the
samples
 were
 extremely
 sensitive
 to
 the
 electron
 beam
 and
 the
structure
 collapsed
 after
 a
 few
 minutes.
 However,
 the
 TEM
 images
of
 the
 fresh
 catalysts
 in
 Fig.
 2a–f
 can
 show
 their
 pore
 structures.
In
 accordance
 with
 the
 N2 adsorption-desorption
 characteriza-
tion,
 the
 pore
 size
 appeared
 to
 be
 9
 nm,
 10
 nm,
 12
 nm,
 17
 nm
 and
17.5
 nm
 over
 the
 catalysts
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3-Al2O3(T)
 calcined
 at
500 ◦C,
 600 ◦C,
 700 ◦C,
 800 ◦C
 and
 900 ◦C,
 respectively.
 The

 were

 It
 was
 noticeably

 that
 no

 were
over

 indicating
 that
 potassium
 and

were
 both

 XPS
 spectra
Table
 2
 summarizes
 the
 XPS
 data
 for
 the
 studied
 catalysts.
 The
Cr
 2p3/2
 XPS
 spectra
 of
 the
 samples
 divided
 by
 ﬁtting
 the
 dou-
blet
 peaks
 are
 described
 in
 Fig.
 S2.
 The
 bands
 were
 located
 at
 the
binding
 energy
 (BE)
 =
 576.5–577.4
 eV
 and
 579.4–580.3
 eV,
 which
were
 attributed
 to
 Cr3+ and
 Cr6+ species,
 respectively
 [2,14,37–40].
As
 expected,
 the
 total
 amount
 of
 surface
 chromium
 enhanced
from
 1.46%
 to
 4.81%
 with
 the
 increasing
 chromia
 loading
 for
 the
series
 catalysts
 xCr2O3/Al2O3(600).
 The
 mole
 ratio
 of
 Cr3+ and
 Cr6+
(Cr3+/Cr6+)
 increased
 from
 1.30
 to
 2.05
 over
 the
 catalyst
 with
 chro-
mia
 loading
 from
 5
 wt.%
 to
 20
 wt.%.
 Nevertheless,
 the
 Cr3+/Cr6+
value
 decreased
 to
 1.57
 over
 the
 catalyst
 25Cr2O3/Al2O3(600).
 It
was
 calculated
 that
 the
 amounts
 of
 surface
 Cr3+ and
 Cr6+ species
both
 increased
 with
 the
 increasing
 chromia
 loading,
 whereas
 the
amount
 of
 Cr3+ species
 increased
 more
 greatly
 than
 that
 of
 Cr6+
species
 over
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 series
 catalysts
 up
 to
 20
 wt.%
 chromia
loading.
The
 addition
 of
 K2O
 to
 the
 catalyst
 system
 led
 to
 the
 total
 amount
of
 surface
 Cr
 species
 increasing
 slightly
 from
 1.78%
 to
 2.01%.
 The
Cr3+/Cr6+ value,
 however,
 decreased
 largely
 from
 1.68
 to
 1.16.
 It
 was
observed
 that
 the
 amount
 of
 surface
 Cr3+ species
 decreased
 slightly
and
 the
 amount
 of
 surface
 Cr6+ species
 increased
 dramatically
 upon
the
 K2O
 addition
 to
 the
 catalyst,
 which
 indicated
 that
 K2O
 could
stabilize
 the
 Cr6+ species
 mainly
 at
 the
 expense
 of
 the
 inner
 -Cr2O3
phase
 [2,20].
In
 case
 of
 the
 series
 catalysts
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(T),
 the
total
 surface
 chromium
 and
 potassium
 amounts
 of
 the
 catalyst
gradually
 increased
 with
 the
 calcination
 temperature
 from
 500 ◦C
to
 900 ◦C,
 which
 was
 probably
 due
 to
 that
 the
 abatement
 in
 spe-
ciﬁc
 surface
 area
 of
 the
 catalyst
 resulted
 in
 the
 decline
 for
 the
dispersion
 of
 chromium
 and
 potassium
 species
 over
 the
 catalyst.
The
 surface
 Cr3+/Cr6+ value
 was
 0.87
 over
 the
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-
10Cr2O3/Al2O3(500),
 demonstrating
 that
 the
 amount
 of
 Cr6+
species
 was
 more
 than
 that
 of
 Cr3+ species
 over
 the
 surface
 of
 the
catalyst
 calcined
 at
 500 ◦C.
 However,
 the
 Cr3+/Cr6+ value
 increased
from
 1.16
 to
 2.57
 with
 the
 calcination
 temperature
 increasing
from
 600 ◦C
 to
 900 ◦C,
 indicating
 that
 Cr3+ gradually
 became

 over
 the
 surface
 of
 the

 with
 the
 higher

 as
 were
 shown
 in
 Table
 2.
 By
 comparison,
the
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800)
 and
 the
 reference
 cata-
lyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800)-R
 presented
 a
 similar
 Cr3+/Cr6+
value
 (1.91
 and
 1.96,
 respectively).
 The
 surface
 Cr3+ amount
 over
the
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800)-R
 was
 1.56%,
 which
 was
more
 than
 that
 (1.29%)
 of
 the
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800).
This
 meant
 that
 the
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800)
 had
 more
inner
 type
 of
 Cr3+ species
 than
 the
 reference
 catalyst,
 indicating
 that
the
 catalyst
 possessed
 a
 more
 stable
 support
 structure[11,41].
 In
 a
word,
 both
 Cr3+ and
 Cr6+ species
 were
 observed
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
fresh
 catalysts,
 their
 different
 concentrations
 were
 mainly
 depend-
ing
 on
 the
 overall
 chromia
 loadings,
 the

 and

 An
 additional
 weak
 band
 at
 581
 nm
observed
 for
 the
 series
 catalysts
 was
 probably
 due
 to
 another
 d-d
transition
 (A2g→T2g)
 of
 Cr3+ in
 octahedral
 symmetry.
 The
 inten-
sity
 of
 the
 latter
 band
 in
 the
 spectra
 increased
 with
 the
 increasing

 Consequently,
 the
 amount
 of

 steadily
 increased

 higher

 was
 well
 consistent
 with

 H2-TPR
 proﬁles
The
 H2-TPR
 proﬁles
 of
 the
 studied
 catalysts
 are
 described
 in
Fig.
 4.
 All
 the
 samples
 showed
 a
 single
 H2 consumption
 peak
(Tmax)
 at
 350–366 ◦C,
 corresponding
 to
 the
 reduction
 of
 the
dispersed
 Cr6+ to
 Cr3+ species
 [20,24,38,44].
 The
 Tmax of
 the
 cat-
alyst
 10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600)
 was
 located
 at
 356 ◦C.
 By
 comparison,
the
 similar
 Tmax 357 ◦C
 was
 observed
 over
 the
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-
10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600),
 indicating
 that
 the
 reducibility
 of
 the
 catalyst
was
 independent
 of
 the
 K2O
 addition.
 It
 was
 noteworthy
 that,
moreover,
 the
 Tmax of
 the
 series
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(T)
was
 a
 slightly
 downward
 shift
 with
 the
 increasing
 calcination
temperature,
 suggesting
 that
 the
 interaction
 between
 Cr6+ and
 alu-
minium
 or
 oxygen
 species
 became
 weaker
 at
 the
 higher
 calcination
temperature.

 Isobutane
 dehydrogenation
The
 products
 observed
 for
 isobutane
 dehydrogenation
 were
mainly
 isobutene
 and
 trace
 amounts
 of
 carbon
 monoxide,
 methane,
ethane,
 ethylene,
 propane,
 propylene
 and
 n-butene
 besides
 the
unreacted
 isobutane.
3.3.1.
 The
 dehydrogenation
 reactivity
 over
 the
 catalysts
The
 reactivity
 over
 the
 series
 catalysts
 xCr2O3/Al2O3(600)
 with
the
 increasing
 TOS
 for
 the
 isobutane
 dehydrogenation
 is
 plotted
in
 Fig.
 5.
 As
 the
 Cr2O3 loading
 increased,
 the
 initial
 isobutane
conversion
 and
 initial
 isobutene
 yield
 increased
 to
 the
 maxi-
mum
 49.1%
 and
 40.0%
 over
 the
 catalyst
 10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600),
 then
slightly
 decreased
 thereafter.
 Meantime,
 the
 initial
 catalytic
 activity
achieved
 at
 its
 maximum
 18.3
 mmol
 g−1 h−1 (Table
 2),
 demonstrat-
ing
 that
 the
 catalyst
 10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600)
 possessed
 the
 highest
activity
 among
 the
 series
 catalysts
 [45].
 It
 was
 observed
 that
the
 highest
 initial
 isobutene
 selectivity
 84.9%
 was
 obtained
 over
the
 catalyst
 20Cr2O3/Al2O3(600).
 For
 each
 catalyst,
 moreover,
 the
isobutane
 conversion
 and
 isobutene
 yield
 gradually
 reduced

 which
 was
 due
 to
 the
 coke
 formation
over
 the
 catalyst
 [3,9,14,46]. It
 was
 not
 difﬁcult
 to
 notice
 that
 the
isobutane
 conversion
 and
 isobutene
 yield
 of
 the
 catalyst
 with
 lower
Cr2O3 loading
 decreased
 more
 slightly
 than
 that
 of
 the
 catalyst
 with
higher
 Cr2O3 loading
 during
 the
 dehydrogenation
 reaction,
 demon-
strating
 that
 the
 catalyst
 5Cr2O3/Al2O3(600)
 exhibited
 much
 higher
stability
 among
 the
 series
 catalysts
 over
 the
 dehydrogenation.
The
 catalytic
 reactivity
 over
 the
 series
 catalysts
 1.5
 K2O-
10Cr2O3/Al2O3(T)
 for
 the
 isobutane
 dehydrogenation
 are
 shown
in
 Fig.
 6.
 By
 comparison
 with
 the
 catalyst
 10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600),
 the
isobutane
 conversion
 had
 no
 signiﬁcant
 increase
 over
 the
 K-doped
catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600).
 Nevertheless,
 the
 isobutene
selectivity
 greatly
 increased
 by
 7.1–8.1%,
 indicating
 that
 potassium
was
 an
 effective
 promoter
 to
 the
 catalytic
 selectivity.
 Moreover,
 it
was
 observed
 that
 the
 isobutane
 conversion
 and
 isobutene
 selec-
tivity
 of
 the
 K-doped
 catalyst
 decreased
 more
 slightly
 than
 that
 of
the
 catalyst
 10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600),
 indicating
 that
 the
 deactivation
rate
 of
 the
 catalyst
 was
 greatly
 suppressed
 by
 K2O
 addition.
 The
similar
 effect
 of
 K2O
 over
 the
 dehydrogenation
 was
 reported
 by
the
 previous
 literatures
 [6,14,16,20,21].
As
 for
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 calcination
 temperature
 over
 the
 dehy-
drogenation
 reactivity
 (Fig.

 the
 initial
 isobutane
 conversion
and
 initial
 isobutene
 yield
 increased
 to
 the
 maximum
 60.1%

 over

 Simulta-
neously,
 the
 catalyst
 exhibited
 the
 optimum
 initial
 catalytic
 activity
22.4
 mmol
 g−1 h−1 among
 the
 series
 catalysts.
 It
 was
 observed
that
 the
 initial
 isobutene
 selectivity
 was
 up
 to
 93.2%
 over
 the
catalyst
 calcined
 at
 800 ◦C.
 With
 the
 increasing
 calcination
 tem-
perature,
 the
 initial
 isobutene
 selectivity
 increased
 and
 achieved
 at
the
 maximum
 94.3%
 over
 the
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(900).
Moreover,
 it
 was
 obviously
 noticed
 that
 the
 isobutane
 conversion
and
 isobutene
 yield
 over
 the
 catalyst
 calcined
 at
 higher
 temper-
ature
 decreased
 more
 quickly
 during
 the
 reaction,
 indicating
 that
the
 catalyst
 calcined
 at
 lower
 temperature
 was
 more
 stable
 over
the
 dehydrogenation.
 Also,
 the
 decreased
 isobutane
 conversion
 and
isobutene
 yield
 of
 each
 catalyst
 with
 the
 increase
 of
 the
 TOS
 over
the
 dehydrogenation
 was
 assigned
 to
 the
 coke
 deposition
 over
 the
catalyst
 [3,9,14,46].
3.3.2.
 The
 active
 chromium
 species
In
 case
 of
 the
 valence
 of
 the
 active
 chromium
 species,
 the
 active
species
 in
 dehydrogenation
 is
 Cr3+,
 or
 both
 Cr3+ and
 Cr2+,
 or
 coor-
dinative
 unsaturated
 Cr3+ according
 to
 the
 previous
 literatures
[1,4,5,7,14,47–49].  Therefore,
 it
 is
 still
 an
 open
 question
 in
 the
 lit-
eratures.
 In
 our
 experiment,
 it
 was
 suggested
 that
 Cr3+ was
 mainly
the
 active
 site
 for
 isobutane
 dehydrogenation
 and
 the
 isobutene
selectivity
 was
 depended
 on
 the
 surface
 Cr3+/Cr6+ value
 over
 the
catalyst.
Table
 2
 clearly
 shows
 the
 catalytic
 activity
 of
 isobutane
 dehy-
drogenation
 over
 the
 catalysts.
 With
 regard
 to
 the
 series
 catalysts
xCr2O3/Al2O3(600),
 it
 was
 observed
 that
 the
 catalytic
 activity
increased
 with
 the
 increasing
 surface
 Cr3+ amount
 over
 the
 catalyst
with
 chromia
 loading
 up
 to
 10
 wt.%.
 The
 catalyst
 xCr2O3/Al2O3(600)
with
 chromia
 loading
 more
 than
 15
 wt.%
 exhibited
 the
 lower
 cat-
alytic
 activity
 than
 the
 catalyst
 10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600),
 which
 was
ascribed
 to
 the
 larger
 and
 lower
 dispersed
 chromia
 particles
over
 the
 these
 catalysts,
 consistent
 with
 the
 PXRD
 results.
 It
 was
observed
 that
 the
 isobutene
 selectivity
 increased
 with
 the
 increas-
ing
 Cr3+/Cr6+ value
 over
 the
 series
 catalysts
 xCr2O3/Al2O3(600),
agreement
 with
 the
 XPS
 results.
 For
 the
 series
 K-doped
 catalysts
calcined
 at
 different
 temperatures,
 the
 catalytic
 activity
 increased
with
 the
 increasing
 surface
 Cr3+ amount
 over
 the
 catalysts.
 The
slightly
 decreased
 activity
 over
 the
 K-doped
 catalyst
 calcined
 at
900 ◦C
 was
 probably
 assigned
 to
 the
 appearance
 of
 -Al2O3 in
 the
support
 and
 low
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 of
 the
 catalyst.
 Moreover,
 the
isobutene
 selectivity
 increased
 with
 increasing
 Cr3+/Cr6+ value
 over
the
 series
 catalysts.
Based
 on
 these
 results
 and
 the
 data
 in
 Table
 2,
 we
 concluded
 that
the
 catalytic
 activity
 was
 improved
 with
 the
 increase
 of
 surface
 Cr3+
amount
 over
 the
 catalyst
 with
 highly
 dispersed
 chromium
 species
and
 the
 isobutene
 selectivity
 was
 enhanced
 with
 the
 increasing
surface
 Cr3+/Cr6+ value.
 In
 addition,
 the
 TOF
 (turnover
 frequency)
over
 the
 catalysts
 with
 highly
 dispersed
 chromium
 species
 were
1.6
 ±
 0.2
 h−1. This
 meant
 that
 the
 activity
 per
 Cr3+ site
 over
 the
 cat-
alysts
 was
 almost
 the
 same.
 Analogously,
 De
 Rossi
 et
 al.
 found
 that
the
 activity
 per
 atom
 of
 chromium
 was
 the
 same
 over
 the
 Cr-based
catalysts
 with
 different
 chromia
 loadings
 [47].
 Lugo
 and
 Lunsford
also
 observed
 the
 same
 turnover
 frequency
 over
 the
 unsupported
and
 supported
 chromium
 oxide
 catalysts
 [50].
3.3.3.
 The
 dehydrogenation-regeneration
 cycles
 of
 the
 catalyst
In
 order
 to
 examine
 the
 regenerative
 ability
 and
 stability
of
 the
 catalyst
 during
 the
 isobutane
 dehydrogenation,
 the
 ten
dehydrogenation-regeneration
 cycles
 over
 the
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-
10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800)
 were
 investigated
 (Fig.
 7).
 It
 was
 calculated
that
 the
 initial
 isobutane
 conversion,
 isobutene
 selectivity
 and
yield
 were
 55.3%,
 92.7%
 and
 51.3%
 in
 the
 ﬁrst
 cycle,
 respectively.
In
 the
 tenth
 cycle,
 by
 comparison,
 the
 initial
 isobutane
 conver-
sion,
 isobutene
 selectivity
 and
 yield
 were
 54.2%,
 93.4%
 and
 50.6%,
Fig.
 7.

respectively.
 Moreover,
 it
 was
 calculated
 that
 the
 catalytic
 activ-
ity
 was
 29.6
 mmol
 g−1 h−1 in
 the
 ﬁrst
 cycle
 and
 29.0
 mmol
 g−1 h−1
in
 the
 tenth
 cycle,
 which
 was
 maintainable
 during
 the
 ten
 cycles
(Table
 2).
 The
 basically
 unchanged
 activity
 and
 selectivity
 during
the
 ten
 dehydrogenation-regeneration
 cycles
 indicated
 the
 high
regenerative
 ability
 and
 high
 stability
 of
 the
 catalyst.
3.3.4.
 The
 comparison
 of
 the
 activity
 with
 the
 reference
 catalyst
The
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800)
 was
 compared
 with
the
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800)-R
 prepared
 by
 impreg-
nation
 method
 over
 the
 isobutane
 dehydrogenation
 (Fig.
 8).
 It
was
 observed
 that
 the
 reference
 catalyst
 exhibited
 a
 slightly
higher
 initial
 isobutane
 conversion
 and
 comparable
 isobutene
selectivity
 (about
 94.0%)
 by
 contrast
 with
 the
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-
10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800).
 This
 was
 probably
 assigned
 to
 that
 the
 refer-
ence
 catalyst
 presented
 more
 surface
 Cr3+ species
 and
 comparable
Cr3+/Cr6+ value
 with
 the
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800),
in
 accordance
 with
 the
 XPS
 characterization.
 However,
 the
isobutane
 
conversion
 
and
 
isobutene
 
yield
 
of
 
the
 
reference
catalyst
 decreased
 more
 rapidly
 compared
 with
 the
 catalyst
1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800),
 indicating
 that
 the
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-
10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800)
 possessed
 a
 more
 stable
 activity
 during
 the
dehydrogenation.
 It
 may
 be
 due
 to
 the
 stabilization
 of
 the

 The
 characterizations
 of
 spent
 and
 regenerated
 catalysts
3.4.1.
 N2 adsorption-desorption
 measurements
The
 BET
 speciﬁc
 surface
 areas
 and
 pore
 properties
 of
 the
 spent
and
 regenerated
 catalysts
 are
 presented
 in
 Table
 1.
 Compared
 with
the
 fresh
 catalyst,
 the
 spent
 one
 had
 a
 slightly
 smaller
 speciﬁc
 sur-
face
 area
 190.9
 m2 g−1,
 lower
 pore
 volume
 0.65
 cm3 g−1 and
 smaller
pore
 size
 12.28
 nm.
 The
 reason
 for
 this
 was
 probably
 due
 to
 that
coke
 deposition
 on
 the
 spent
 catalyst
 inhibited
 a
 portion
 of
 the
 pore,
thus
 leading
 to
 the
 slight
 decrease
 in
 the
 textural
 performance
 of
the
 catalyst.
 During
 the
 ten
 dehydrogenation-regeneration
 cycles,
the
 basically
 invariant
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 (177.9
 →
 172.1
 m2 g−1)
and
 pore
 volume
 (0.55
 →
 0.53
 cm3 g−1)
 of
 the
 regenerated
 catalyst
from
 the
 ﬁrst
 to
 tenth
 cycle
 demonstrated
 its
 high
 stability
 of
 the
catalyst.

 PXRD
 patterns

 displays
 the
 PXRD
 patterns
 of
 the
 spent
 and
 the
 tenth
regenerated
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800).
 It
 was
 observed
that
 no
 potassium
 and
 chromia
 phases
 appeared
 in
 the
 PXRD
 pat-
tern
 of
 the
 corresponding
 spent
 catalyst,
 implying
 that
 the
 reaction
conditions
 had
 no
 signiﬁcant
 inﬂuence
 over
 the
 dispersion
 of
 these
species.
 The
 potassium
 and
 chromia
 phases
 were
 not
 visible
 over
the
 tenth
 regenerated
 catalyst,
 demonstrating
 the
 high
 phase
 sta-
bility
 of
 the
 catalysts
 during
 the
 ten
 cycles
 over
 the
 isobutane
dehydrogenation.
3.4.3.
 TEM
 images
The
 TEM
 images
 of
 the
 spent
 catalysts
 are
 presented
 in
 Fig.
 3g–i.
The
 worm-like
 mesopores
 of
 the
 spent
 catalysts
 suggested
 that
 the
pores
 were
 non-ordered,
 which
 were
 very
 similar
 to
 that
 of
 the
corresponding
 fresh
 catalysts.
 It
 was
 clearly
 seen
 that
 no
 chromia
particles
 were
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 alumina
 support,
 indicating
 its
high
 dispersion
 over
 the
 spent
 catalysts.
 These
 results
 implied
 again
the
 high
 stability
 of
 the
 catalyst,
 which
 was
 in
 good
 agreement
with
 the
 N2 adsorption–desorption
 and
 PXRD
 characterizations.
Moreover,
 the
 morphology
 of
 the
 carbon
 residues
 was
 not
 clearly
observed
 on
 the
 spent
 catalysts,
 indicating
 the
 carbon
 residues
were
 amorphous.

 XPS
 spectra
The
 XPS
 data
 of
 the
 spent
 and
 regenerated
 catalyst
 1.5
 K2O-
10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800)
 are
 presented
 in
 Table
 2.
 Compared
 with
 the
fresh
 catalyst,
 it
 was
 observed
 that
 only
 Cr3+ species
 were
 over
the
 spent
 catalyst,
 indicating
 that
 Cr6+ species
 was
 reduced
 by
the
 reaction
 molecules.
 Moreover,
 the
 amounts
 of
 surface
 potas-
sium
 and
 chromium
 species
 both
 increased
 largely
 over
 the
 spent
catalyst,
 which
 was
 probably
 due
 to
 the
 decrease
 of
 the
 speciﬁc
surface
 area
 led
 to
 the
 low
 dispersion
 of
 the
 two
 species
 over
the
 surface
 of
 the
 catalyst.
 After
 re-calcination
 in
 air,
 the
 Cr6+
species
 were
 observed
 over
 the
 regenerated
 catalyst,
 suggesting
that
 a
 portion
 of
 Cr3+ species
 were
 oxidized
 to
 Cr6+ in
 the
 re-
calcination
 process.
 The
 invariantly
 unchanged
 amount
 of
 Cr3+
species
 (1.41%
 →
 1.40%)
 and
 Cr3+/Cr6+ value
 (2.22
 →
 2.22)
 were
responsible
 for
 the
 maintainable
 activity
 and
 selectivity
 during
 the
ten
 dehydrogenation-regeneration
 cycles.

 Conclusions
In
 summary,
 the
 no-ordered
 mesoporous
 Cr2O3/Al2O3 cata-
lysts
 with
 large
 speciﬁc
 surface
 areas
 (149.4–381.6
 m2 g−1)
 and
high
 pore
 volume
 (0.77–1.24
 cm3 g−1)
 were
 successfully
 synthe-
sized
 from
 a
 Cr-based
 MOF
 material
 MIL-101
 as
 the
 molecular
host
 and
 chromium
 precursor.
 The
 reactivity
 of
 isobutane
 dehy-
drogenation
 was
 investigated
 over
 the
 catalysts.
 The
 pore
 texture,
structural
 phase,
 the
 reducibility
 and
 the
 surface
 concentrations
of
 Cr3+ and
 Cr6+ species
 over
 the
 catalysts
 were
 depending
 on
the
 chromia
 loadings
 and
 calcination
 temperature.
 The
 K2O
 addi-
tion
 to
 the
 catalyst
 slightly
 decreased
 the
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
and
 the
 surface
 Cr3+/Cr6+ value.
 However,
 it
 greatly
 improved
 the
isobutene
 selectivity
 and
 reduced
 the
 deactivation
 rate.
 The
 cata-
lyst
 1.5
 K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(800)
 calcined
 at
 800 ◦C
 exhibited
 high
isobutene
 selectivity
 up
 to
 93.2%
 at
 the
 highest
 isobutane
 conver-
sion
 of
 60.1%.
 The
 catalytic
 activity
 increased
 with
 the
 increasing
amount
 of
 Cr3+ species
 over
 the
 catalysts
 with
 highly
 dispersed
chromium
 species
 and
 the
 catalytic
 selectivity
 was
 enhanced
 with
the
 increasing
 surface
 Cr3+/Cr6+ value
 of
 the
 catalyst.
 The
 main-
tainable
 activity
 and
 selectivity
 over
 isobutane
 dehydrogenation
in
 the
 ten
 dehydrogenation-regeneration
 cycle
 demonstrated
 the
very
 high
 stability
 and
 regenerative
 ability
 of
 the
 catalyst.
 Compare
with
 the
 catalyst
 prepared
 by
 impregnation
 method,
 the
 catalyst
in
 this
 work
 presented
 more
 stable
 activity
 in
 the
 dehydrogena-
tion.
 This
 study
 presents
 a
 feasible
 way
 to
 facile
 synthesis
 of
 the
Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts
 with
 good
 catalytic
 performance
 and
 high
stability
 from
 a
 MOF
 material.
