aking most of our fuels and chemi-
cals from fossil hydrocarbons is 
unsustainable. However, until cost-
effective renewable sources are developed, 
natural gas could provide a secure economi-
cal alternative to petroleum. Proven reserves 
of natural gas have doubled in the last decade 
( 
1), mainly from increases in “unconven-
tional” gas found with shale (shale gas), coal 
(coal bed methane), and in low-permeability 
“tight” sandstones (tight gas) (see the ﬁ
 rst 
ﬁ
 gure). Today, because it is not easy to con-
vert methane into heavier molecules, natural 
gas (composed largely of methane) is mostly 
burned for heating and electrical power gen-
eration; a tiny fraction is used in vehicles. 
Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into 
higher-value chemical intermediates and liq-
uid products could reduce our need for oil 
and help lower its shipping costs, which are 
higher than those of petroleum or coal on an 
energy-delivered basis. In addition, such pro-
cesses might recover the large quantities of 
gas now ﬂ
 ared or vented from fossil reser-
voirs ( 
2).
The challenge in converting natural gas 
into liquids, olefins, alcohols, ethers, and 
other high-value products is to exploit reac-
tions that only partially oxidize alkanes and 
stop short of complete combustion to CO2. 
Improvements in process efﬁ
 ciency and eco-
nomics will come when new chemistry is 
integrated into novel engineering systems. 
Process chemistry—including free-radical 
routes or catalytic partial oxidation—already 
allows a fraction of the heavier alkanes in nat-
ural gas (ethane, propane, and butane) to be 
converted into more-valuable chemical prod-
ucts. Further innovations should increase the 
efﬁ
 ciency and expand the uses of these prod-
ucts and may also lead to ways to harness 
methane, which is typically between 70 and 
90% of the carbon in natural gas.
Today, we activate most light alkanes by 
homolytically cleaving bonds using high tem-
peratures (cracking) to create a complex radi-
cal reaction network that produces mixtures 
of coproducts and hydrogen (H2). Almost all 
industrial chemical processing of natural gas 
is performed with steam. In “steam crackers,” 
the steam acts as a relatively unreactive dilu-
ent that favors fragmented radical formation 
and minimizes solid carbon (coke). Direct 
reaction with water is kinetically limited by 
very short reaction times. A high yield of eth-
ylene and propylene can be achieved under 
properly selected reaction conditions when 
the primary feed is ethane; but steam crack-
ing still produces a mixture of oleﬁ
 n prod-
ucts along with other hydrocarbons and H2. 
Adjusting the conditions can bring the reac-
tion toward equilibrium in “steam reform-
ing,” where synthesis gas (H2 and CO) is pro-
duced. Reforming of light alkanes accounts 
for ~50% of the world’s H2 production used 
to produce ammonia and other important 
commodity chemicals. Synthesis gas made 
by reforming natural gas is used to make over 
45 billion kg of methanol per year and high 
molecular weight linear alkanes ( 
3).
It would seem that between cracking for 
olefin production and reforming to make 
synthesis gas, all of the chemistry needed 
to make use of natural gas is already avail-
able. However, steam cracking of ethane pro-
duces a mixture of products, ~15% of which 
are not high-value chemicals. Steam reform-
ing is costly; it requires high operating pres-
sures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700° 
to 1000°C) in expensive reactors with heat 
transfer and coke management challenges. 
Overall efﬁ
 ciencies are 75% or lower. New 
low-temperature, high-yield alkane conver-
sion chemistries that are relatively insensi-
tive to common natural gas impurities are 
needed if we want to do better than cracking 
and reforming.
The problem is to both activate the strong 
C−H bonds and, under the same conditions,

The extensive contribution of post-
transcriptional regulation to cyclic mRNA 
abundance might explain why the connec-
tions between core clock mechanisms and 
circadian-regulated processes have been 
challenging to define. But at the same 
time, it opens up several additional ques-
tions. If transcriptional regulation is not 
driving the rhythmicity for the majority 
of cycling mRNAs, is the rhythmic tran-
scription required for function? To what 
extent does CIRP regulate the differ-
ence in nascent and steady-state mRNA 
levels observed by Koike et al.? In addi-
tion to the phase of expression, examina-
tion of the interplay between transcriptional 
and posttranscriptional regulation may 
elucidate aspects of rhythmic expression 
such as amplitude of mRNA cycles. Under-
standing the regulation of amplitude can 
aid in identifying clinical targets to address 
the reduction in circadian amplitude 
observed with aging and some metabolic 
disorders.
Although the studies of Koike et al. 
and Morf et al. will likely shift the focus 
in mammalian circadian outputs to post-
transcriptional regulation, the question 
remains of how the wide range of phases of 
circadian expression can be achieved. 
Steps toward answering this will include 
identifying the mechanisms by which 
RNA-regulatory processes, such as those 
involving CIRP, achieve specificity for 
their targets. Certainly, the models in which 
generation of overt rhythms is controlled 
primarily by transcriptional mechanisms 
require serious revision.

PERSPECTIVES
maintain control of the subsequent reaction 
intermediates and elementary steps—the 
sites for activation of C−H bonds must be 
relatively inactive for further oxidation. In 
general, greater selectivity comes at the cost 
of lower reaction rates. In nature, methane 
monooxygenase systems can have tremen-
dous selectivity to partial oxidation products 
such as methanol; however, the conditions 
and overall volumetric rates cannot be scaled 
up for large chemical production volumes.
Under milder conditions than required 
for cracking or reforming, catalytic dehy-
drogenation of light alkanes selectively pro-
duces oleﬁ
 ns and H2. Worldwide, more than 
100 billion kg of oleﬁ
 ns are produced per 
year, and demand for propylene is increas-
ing faster than it can be produced from tra-
ditional sources. Catalytic dehydrogenation 
provides selectivity to a single oleﬁ
 n prod-
uct much higher than from cracking and can 
make use of the abundant propane in shale 
gas. The endothermic reaction requires sub-
stantial energy input, low reaction pressures, 
and a high temperature (~500°C) to achieve 
even a low conversion. The alkane/oleﬁ
 n sep-
aration is difﬁ
 cult, requiring high pressure 
and low temperature. New engineering solu-
tions such as low-cost hydrogen-membrane 
reactors to selectively remove hydrogen can 
help improve yields by driving the equilib-
rium-limited reaction forward. Use of inno-
vative chemistry to selectively 
remove (react) the hydrogen 
produced from alkane dehy-
drogenation without affect-
ing the partial oxidation prod-
uct is a major challenge for 
chemists. A long-sought goal 
is high yields from oxida-
tive dehydrogenation (ODH) 
using oxygen to react away 
the hydrogen. Selective ODH 
of butane in DuPont’s maleic 
anhydride process uses a solid 
oxidizing agent, vanadium 
phosphorus oxide, to limit 
butane’s oxidation. The solid 
is reoxidized in a separate 
reaction step. The overall pro-
cess is profitable and shows 
that cost-effective partial oxi-
dation is possible.
Although there has been 
commercial success in mak-
ing butadiene for rubber by 
ODH of butene with O2, the 
high-yield production of ole-
fins from alkanes by ODH 
has proven more challenging. 
Some progress for partial oxi-
dation of other alkanes has been made with 
vanadium and molybdenum oxides ( 
4). A sin-
gle commercial plant in the Middle East uses 
a molybdenum-based oxide catalyst to con-
vert very low-cost ethane to acetic acid; sub-
stantial improvements in ODH catalysts are 
still needed for widespread adoption.
A small amount of iodine facilitates the 
selective ODH of butane over metal oxide 
catalysts ( 
5). Iodine may participate in the 
same kinetic steps occurring in oxyhaloge-
nations whereby hydrogen halides are oxi-
dized by O2 to form reactive halogens, which 
in turn oxidize the alkanes, resulting in read-
ily separated alkyl halide products. Recent 
work combining theory and experiment has 
improved our understanding of methane oxy-
halogenation as a potentially selective par-
tial oxidation pathway ( 
6). Oxyhalogenation 
has been evaluated by industrial scientists as 
the lowest-cost natural gas-to-liquids (GTL) 
conversion process for converting methane 
to liquid fuels ( 
7). Oxychlorination of eth-
ane to produce vinyl chloride is a commercial 
process competing successfully with the less 
direct conversion of an ethylene intermediate 
to vinyl chloride.
In all the oxyhalogenation processes, cor-
rosive components must be safely managed, 
which can increase the capital and mainte-
nance costs substantially. With advances in 
corrosion science, lower cost, corrosion-
resistant materials are increasingly available 
and may enable large-scale processes to be 
implemented safely and economically. One 
example is a platinum-catalyzed homoge-
neous system for conversion from methane 
to methyl bisulfate (CH3OSO3H) in sulfuric 
acid, which can achieve ~90% selectivity ( 
8). 
The reactivity of the methyl bisulfate on the 
Pt catalyst active site is lower than that of the 
methane reactant, overcoming a major limita-
tion of other alkane activation catalysts, and 
resulting in a single-pass yield of more than 
70%.
Non–oxygen-containing oxidizing agents 
that might allow more control over the ther-
modynamics are promising alternatives 
that can eliminate water and carbon oxides 
as potential by-products. Oxidizing light 
alkanes with bromine or chlorine is facile 
under mild conditions and produces stable 
alkylhalides that are readily converted to hal-
ogen-free products. Bromine is used com-
monly for functionalization in organic syn-
thesis because it is relatively easy to add and 
easy to remove (the C−Br bond is weaker 
than the C−Cl bond). Furthermore, bromine’s 
high molecular weight makes the alkylbro-

Changing production sources. Worldwide, about half of the known 
natural gas is in “conventional,” highly permeable geologic forma-
tions, often together with liquid petroleum. The other half is the 
“unconventional gas” found in more diffuse, low-permeability geo-
logic formations. In the United States, conventional gas production 
peaked in the 1990s and today represents less than half of the annual 
U.S. gas production (

Preventable Forms of Autism?
NEUROSCIENCE

Inborn errors of metabolism underlying some 
cases of autism present possibilities for 
prevention and treatment.
mides easy to separate by distillation from 
nonbrominated hydrocarbons. Ethyl or pro-
pyl bromides form with high selectivity and 
are readily dehydrobrominated to ethylene or 
propylene or oligomerized to high molecu-
lar weight hydrocarbons ( 
9). Under moderate 
conditions, methane reacts with bromine to 
produce a high yield of methylbromide and 
HBr. By-products are readily separated, and 
dibromomethane reacts on transition met-
als with H2 to produce similar products, as 
observed from Fischer-Tropsch chemistry 
with synthesis gas ( 
10). Methylhalides, espe-
cially methylbromide, behave chemically like 
methanol on zeolites (see the second ﬁ
 gure) 
to produce oleﬁ
 ns or liquid fuels ( 
11– 
13). 
Much less heat is generated, and there is no 
need to ﬁ
 rst produce methanol.
Ultimately, the bromine used for activa-
tion must be regenerated, either by oxidation 
of the HBr or by electrolysis to produce Br2 
and H2 (see the second ﬁ
 gure). Electrochemi-
cal recovery of bromine could make use of 
renewable process integration whereby tem-
porally varying wind or solar electricity is 
used to drive electrolysis of stored HBr to 
produce a bromine (a liquid at room tem-
perature) reservoir used continuously in the 
hydrocarbon process.
Low-cost natural gas availability has 
beaten all expectations. In 2005, the U.S. 
government and chemical industry were pre-
paring to import massive quantities of lique-
ﬁ
 ed natural gas because of expected short-
falls in domestic supplies, and in 2008, coal 
was announced as the future hydrocarbon 
feedstock of choice ( 
14). It is likely that natu-
ral gas, and possibly methane hydrates, will 
provide ample supplies of light alkanes for 
chemical processing for decades to come. A 
major challenge for chemical science is to 
invent new efﬁ
 cient and cost-effective pro-
cesses for making use of alternative resources 
to replace those now made from oil. Such pro-
cesses using natural gas are part of a stepwise 
transition toward a future where fuels and 
chemicals are produced from economically 
and environmentally sustainable sources.

A
utism has attracted enormous 
attention in recent years primarily 
because of the high incidence and 
the impact it has on patients’ lives and their 
families, given its medical, social, ﬁ
 nancial, 
and emotional burdens ( 
1,  
2). There is grow-
ing acceptance that the incidence and preva-
lence of autism have dramatically increased 
over the past 20 years ( 
3), although some of 
the increase relates to changing diagnostic 
terminology and criteria. The use of DNA 
microarrays and exome sequencing to detect 
pathological copy number variants (CNVs) 
and point mutations, respectively, is mak-
ing progress in identifying genetic causes of 
autism. The recent conﬁ
 rmation that pater-
nal age is a risk factor for autism relates to 
the occurrence of de novo point mutations 
that can now be discovered through next-
generation sequencing ( 
4). However, for vir-
tually all of the pathological CNVs and point 
mutations causing autism, there is no deﬁ
 ni-
tive or curative therapy, although CNVs can 
be detected using invasive prenatal diagnosis. 
On page 394 of this issue, Novarino et al. 
( 
5) use exome sequencing in consanguine-
ous families to discover an inborn metabolic 
error associated with autism, epilepsy, and 
intellectual disability, in which the clinical 
manifestations are likely to be treatable or, 
even better, preventable.
Empirical results reveal that the more 
severe and complex the autistic phenotype, 
the greater the likelihood that a causative 
mutation can be found. Most of the patients 
at the more severe end of the spectrum also 
have intellectual disability, and there is sub-
stantial overlap in the etiology for this group 
compared to that for intellectual disability in 
general. It has emerged from recent genetic 
studies that the number of different CNV loci 
and individual genes that—when mutated—
can cause autism ranges into the hundreds, 
reflecting extreme genetic heterogeneity 
( 
6) (https://gene.sfari.org/). Another recur-
ring observation is that the same genotype, 
whether CNV or point mutation, can give rise 
to a broad spectrum of phenotypes including 
autism, intellectual disability, schizophrenia, 
bipolar disorder, and epilepsy with various 
combinations of these being present in a sin-
gle patient (variable expressivity), but with 
complete lack of penetrance (no symptoms) 
also occurring with such genotypes ( 
7).
Novarino et al. identiﬁ
 ed a point muta-
tion in a gene encoding the branched-chain 
keto acid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK). 
BCKDK inactivates an enzyme complex 
that converts branched-chain amino acids to 
the corresponding keto acids. Thus, defec-
tive BCKDK results in unchecked degrada-
tion and depletion of branched-chain amino 
acids. This is effectively the reverse of the 
metabolic problem present in maple syrup 
urine disease, where deﬁ
 ciency of the same 
enzyme complex leads to toxic accumula-
tion of branched-chain amino acids and their 
metabolites. In a mouse model of BCKDK 
deﬁ
 ciency, similar metabolic and neurobe-
havioral abnormalities are found, and the 
animals improve upon dietary supplementa-
tion with branched-chain amino acids.
Assuming that it would be desirable to 
prevent rather than reverse symptoms of 
BCKDK deficiency, newborn screening 
could be explored. Over 50 inborn errors 
of metabolism are detectable by newborn 
screening, and its use in treatable disorders is 
particularly beneﬁ
 cial. It is not clear whether 
BCKDK deﬁ
 ciency would be easily detected
