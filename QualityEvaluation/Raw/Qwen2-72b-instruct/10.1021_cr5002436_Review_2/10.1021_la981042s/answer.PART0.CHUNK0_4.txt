1.The document does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail the evolution of these catalysts. It focuses on the study of Ga/Cr mixed oxide pillared solids as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane under inert and oxidative conditions. The research highlights the significance of Cr(III) species with coordination vacancies in activating propane molecules under inert conditions and oxygen under oxidative conditions, leading to the production of propene and water. The document does not cover the key industrial applications and research focus areas such as structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms that have contributed to the significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

1.该文件没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览，也没有详细描述这些催化剂的演变。它专注于研究Ga/Cr混合氧化物支柱固体作为在惰性和氧化条件下丙烷脱氢的催化剂。研究强调了Cr(III)物种与配位空位在惰性条件下激活丙烷分子和在氧化条件下激活氧气的重要性，导致丙烯和水的产生。该文件没有涵盖关键的工业应用和研究焦点领域，如结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制，这些都对铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的重要性做出了贡献。
