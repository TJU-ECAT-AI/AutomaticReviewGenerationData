1.The document does not provide historical context or evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. It focuses on the study of Ga/Cr mixed oxide pillared solids as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane under inert and oxidative conditions. The research highlights the role of Cr(III) with coordination vacancies in activating propane molecules under inert conditions and oxygen under oxidative conditions, leading to the production of propene and water. The study also investigates the effect of potassium ion exchange on the catalytic activity and deactivation of the catalysts.

1.该文件没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史背景或演变。它专注于研究Ga/Cr混合氧化物支柱固体作为在惰性和氧化条件下丙烷脱氢的催化剂。研究强调了Cr(III)与配位空位在惰性条件下激活丙烷分子以及在氧化条件下激活氧气的作用，导致丙烯和水的产生。该研究还调查了钾离子交换对催化剂催化活性和失活的影响。
