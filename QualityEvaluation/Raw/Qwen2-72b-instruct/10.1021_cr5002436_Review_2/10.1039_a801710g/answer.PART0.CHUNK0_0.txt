1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it highlights their significance in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the production of important commodity chemicals. Chromium-on-silica is used as a polymerization catalyst for high density polyethylene (HDPE), and chromium-on-alumina is employed in light paraffin dehydrogenation processes such as Houdry CATOFIN and CATADIENE. The focus of research on these catalysts includes understanding their molecular structure and its relation to catalytic performance, with an emphasis on in situ spectroscopic studies under conditions close to real catalytic conditions.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。然而，它强调了它们在脱氢过程中，特别是在生产重要商品化学品中的重要性。铬-二氧化硅用作高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）的聚合催化剂，而铬-氧化铝则用于轻质石蜡脱氢过程，如Houdry CATOFIN和CATADIENE。这些催化剂的研究重点包括理解其分子结构及其与催化性能的关系，特别强调在接近实际催化条件的条件下进行原位光谱研究。
