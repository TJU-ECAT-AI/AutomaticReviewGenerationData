1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it highlights the significance of supported chromium oxide catalysts in chemical industries for the production of important commodity chemicals. Chromium-on-silica is used as the Philips polymerization catalyst for the production of high density polyethylene (HDPE), and chromium-on-alumina is used as a light paraffin dehydrogenation catalyst in the Houdry CATOFIN and CATADIENE processes. The focus of research on these catalysts includes the elucidation of the molecular structure of chromium oxides and their relation with catalytic performances. Recent studies have aimed to understand the catalytic action of supported metal oxide catalysts under conditions as close as possible to real catalytic conditions through in situ spectroscopic studies combined with on-line activity/selectivity measurements.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。然而，它强调了支撑铬氧化物催化剂在化学工业中生产重要商品化学品的重要性。铬-二氧化硅用作菲利普斯聚合催化剂，用于生产高密度聚乙烯（HDPE），而铬-氧化铝用作Houdry CATOFIN和CATADIENE工艺中的轻质石蜡脱氢催化剂。这些催化剂的研究重点包括阐明铬氧化物的分子结构及其与催化性能的关系。最近的研究旨在通过原位光谱研究与在线活性/选择性测量相结合，尽可能在接近实际催化条件的情况下理解支撑金属氧化物催化剂的催化作用。
