1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it highlights their significance in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the production of important commodity chemicals. Chromium-on-silica is used as a polymerization catalyst for high density polyethylene (HDPE), and chromium-on-alumina is employed in light paraffin dehydrogenation processes such as Houdry CATOFIN and CATADIENE. The focus of research on these catalysts includes understanding their molecular structure and its relation to catalytic performance, with an emphasis on in situ spectroscopic studies under conditions close to real catalytic conditions.

1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it highlights the significance of supported chromium oxide catalysts in chemical industries for the production of important commodity chemicals. Chromium-on-silica is used as the Philips polymerization catalyst for the production of high density polyethylene (HDPE), and chromium-on-alumina is used as a light paraffin dehydrogenation catalyst in the Houdry CATOFIN and CATADIENE processes. The focus of research on these catalysts includes the elucidation of the molecular structure of chromium oxides and their relation with catalytic performances. Recent studies have aimed to understand the catalytic action of supported metal oxide catalysts under conditions as close as possible to real catalytic conditions through in situ spectroscopic studies combined with on-line activity/selectivity measurements.
