Box 6100, FIN-02015 HUT, Finland Received 28 January 1999; received in revised form 19 July 1999; accepted 19 July 1999 Abstract Atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), a technique relying on saturating gassolid reactions, was applied in the preparation of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts using Cr(acac)3 vapor and air as source materials for CrOx. Vaporized Cr(acac)3 was reacted with preheated Al2O3, and the surface complex formed was treated with air to remove the ligand residues. The Cr loading increased from 1.3 to 12.5 wt.% as the number of saturating Cr(acac)3 and air reactions was increased from one to 10.
CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts were also prepared from solution by incipient wetness impregnation (0.321 wt.%). XPS and UVVIS measurements of the catalysts revealed the presence of both Cr6+ and Cr3+. Although the oxidation state distribution was similar, H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and solubility measurements indicated that Cr6+ surface sites were in stronger interaction with Al2O3 and more uniformly distributed in the catalysts prepared by ALE than by impregnation. On the basis of the activity of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation of i-butane, we propose that the dehydrogenation reaction uses both reduced Cr6+, i.e. redox Cr3+, and exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites. Furthermore, the dehydrogenation reaction must be insensitive to the size of the CrOx ensembles since activities were similar for the catalysts prepared by ALE and impregnation.
The decay of the dehydrogenation activity in successive prereductionreactionregeneration cycles was attributed to a decrease in the number of redox Cr3+ sites. 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 cata- lysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]. The surface chemistry and characterization of chromium in inorganic oxides were recently reviewed by Weckhuy- sen et al. [3]. There is now a general consensus that the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present Corresponding author. depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and catalyst support. It is generally accepted that, on cal- cined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,311].
At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+,which resists oxidation [1,3,5,711]. The occurrence of Cr3+ is related to the formation of Cr2O3 clusters,and in part, to the presence of highly dispersed Cr3+ species [5,8].
Reduction of Cr6+ (and Cr5+) under dehydro- genation conditions or during the prereduction of CrOx/Al2O3 has been concluded to result mainly in the 0926-860X/00/$  see front matter 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

formation of Cr3+, i.e. redox Cr3+ [3,4,7,8,10,1214].
Al2O3 support appears to stabilize Cr3+ against re- duction below the 3+ state [1,15], although some papers also describe the formation of Cr2+ [1620].
Accordingly, the most recent papers conclude that re- dox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reac- tion [7,8,10,1214]. Some earlier papers [16,18,19],and Slovetskaya et al. [20], nevertheless, propose Cr2+ on Al2O3 to be active as well. In our work [21],we showed that Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ by hydrogen,methane, or n-butane at 580C [21], and in accor- dance with others [7,8,10,1214], we proposed that the redox Cr3+ sites are active in dehydrogenation.
Conventionally, CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared from Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solution by impregnation.
New ways of preparing catalysts are, nevertheless,constantly being sought with the aim of obtaining well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface [22,23]. In a favorable situation, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst can be improved by selecting an appropriate precursor and conditions for catalyst preparation [24]. One approach to obtain- ing well-defined supported oxide catalysts is the use of atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) [25,26], which is a solvent-free technique relying on saturating gassolid reactions. Kytkivi et al. [27] have recently described the preparation of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts by ALE,where chromium acetyl acetonate (Cr(acac)3) vapor and air were used as source materials for CrOx. The C/Cr ratio of the sample measured after the first sat- urating reaction of Cr(acac)3 at 200C indicted that one acac ligand was released from Cr(acac)3 in the surface reaction, leaving two ligands bound to the surface Cr complex. The sterical effect of these re- maining two ligands results in a high dispersion of the chromium species. The Cr loading can be increased by removing the remaining ligands by air treatment and repeating the saturating reactions of Cr(acac)3 and air. CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts with Cr loading up to
8.8 wt.% (seven cycles) have been prepared [27].
In the present study, the saturating reaction of Cr(acac)3 with Al2O3 was investigated in detail by recording FT-IR spectra of the surface Cr complex.
Furthermore, catalysts were prepared by ALE with a Cr loading up to 12.5 wt.% Cr (10 cycles). The ALE catalysts, together with catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation were examined for oxidation state distribution of chromium (XPS and wet-chemical method), dispersion of CrOx (H2-TPR, solubility of Cr6+ surface species, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and IR), and activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of CrOx/Al2O3
2.1.1. Support
The catalyst support was g-Al2O3 (AKZO Alu- mina 000-1.5 E) with a particle size of 0.20.4 mm,a surface area of 195 m2 g1, and a pore volume of
0.49 cm3 g1. Al2O3 was preheated at 600C for 16 h
in a muffle furnace before the Cr precursor was intro- duced by using ALE or the impregnation technique.
2.1.2. ALE
The preheat treatment of Al2O3 was continued at 450C for 3 h in a fixed-bed flow-type reactor [2527] (F-120 Microchemistry Ltd.) under a pres- sure of 510 kPa in nitrogen flow (99.995%, AGA).Solid Cr(acac)3, i.e. Cr(C5O2H7)3 (99%, Riedel-de Hen) was vaporized at 190C and then transported,in nitrogen, downwards through the Al2O3 bed. The reaction of Cr(acac)3 was carried out at 200C fol- lowed by a nitrogen purge for at least 2 h at the reaction temperature [27]. The amount of Cr(acac)3 vapor was kept high enough to ensure surface satura- tion. To remove the ligand residues from the samples,air treatment was started at 200C and continued at 600C for 34 h. To increase the Cr concentration of the samples, Cr(acac)3, nitrogen, and air sequences were repeated between one and 10 times. To decrease the Cr concentration, dipivaloylmethane (C11H20O2, Fluka) was reacted with Al2O3 at 200C before the introduction of Cr(acac)3 to the reactor [27].
2.1.3. Impregnation
The preheat treatment of Al2O3 was continued at 200C for 2 h under a pressure of 0.4 kPa. A pore volume amount of the aqueous solution of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (>97%, Fluka) was added to the support to yield catalysts with 0.3, 1.4, 3.4, 7.9, 8.8,11, 14, 15, 16, and 21 wt.% Cr. The samples were stored overnight at room temperature and dried under

0.4 kPa in a rotavapor for 2 h at 60C. Calcination was
performed in a fixed bed flow reactor with synthetic air at 600C for 3 h. The highest Cr loadings were obtained by repeating the impregnation step. Between the steps, the catalyst was calcined at 600C for 3 h under a flow of synthetic air.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
In the ALE catalysts, the carbon concentration after Cr(acac)3 adsorption was analyzed with a Leco CR12 carbon analyzer. Cr concentration was measured by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) [28].
After the catalysts were heated in a muffle furnace for 13 h at 600C, the Cr6+ concentration was measured by dissolving as a chromate in NaOH solution and de- termining the concentration by UVVIS spectropho- tometry [28]. The experiment was also performed by using water as a dissolving agent.
Specific surface areas were determined by means of nitrogen adsorption and condensation (BET method) using Micromeritics ASAP 2400 equipment. XRD measurements were done with a Siemens Diffrac 500 diffractometer and Cu Ka radiation. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination (Jeol JSM 840 A fitted with a PGT IMIX III energy dispersive X-ray (EDS)), the catalyst particles were embedded in epoxy resin and the cured block was cut with a microtome [27].
X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were measured with an X-probe model 101 spectrometer (Surface Science Instruments, VG Fisons) equipped with a monochromatized Al Ka X-ray source, as has been described earlier [21,27]. All binding energies were
