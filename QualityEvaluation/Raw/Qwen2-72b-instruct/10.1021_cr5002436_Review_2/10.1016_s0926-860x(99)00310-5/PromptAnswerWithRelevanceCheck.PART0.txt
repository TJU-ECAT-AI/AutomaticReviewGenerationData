Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does focus on the preparation and characterization of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of i-butane. The key research areas include the use of Atomic Layer Epitaxy (ALE) and impregnation techniques for catalyst preparation, the analysis of chromium oxidation states (Cr6+ and Cr3+), the dispersion of CrOx on the Al2O3 support, and the activity of the catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions. The study also examines the decay of dehydrogenation activity in successive prereduction-reaction-regeneration cycles, attributing it to a decrease in the number of redox Cr3+ sites.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。但是，它确实专注于CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的制备和表征，用于i-丁烷的脱氢。关键研究领域包括使用原子层外延（ALE）和浸渍技术制备催化剂，分析铬氧化态（Cr6+和Cr3+），CrOx在Al2O3支撑上的分散，以及催化剂在脱氢反应中的活性。该研究还检查了在连续预还原-反应-再生循环中脱氢活性的衰减，将其归因于还原Cr3+位点数量的减少。
