Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been widely used in many catalytic reactions since their discovery. Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes. The reaction is endothermic and inevitably controlled by the thermodynamicequilibrium, requiring substantial energy consumption. Supported chromium oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant is frequently accompanied by deep oxidation, resulting in a decrease in product selectivity. Carbon dioxide as one of the major greenhouse gases has recently been considered as a source of carbon. Catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide into several organic compounds has been intensively studied. In fact, carbon dioxide can also act as a mild oxidant and utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions, such as CO2 reforming of methane and oxidative coupling of methane, has been reported. Carbon dioxide was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and isobutane over supported chromium oxide. The reductionoxidation property and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions.

1.自发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已在许多催化反应中得到广泛应用。硅和氧化铝支持的铬氧化物在工业上用于通过脱氢生产较低的烯烃，如乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯。该反应是吸热的，不可避免地受热力学平衡控制，需要大量能量消耗。支持的铬氧化物还被研究用于较低烷烃的氧化脱氢或氧气氧化其他有机化合物。然而，氧气作为氧化剂的使用通常伴随着深度氧化，导致产品选择性降低。二氧化碳作为主要温室气体之一，最近被认为是一种碳源。二氧化碳催化氢化为几种有机化合物已被广泛研究。事实上，二氧化碳也可以作为温和的氧化剂，二氧化碳在一些部分氧化反应中的利用，如甲烷的CO2重整和氧化偶联，已被报道。发现二氧化碳可以增强在支持的铬氧化物上乙烷、丙烷和异丁烷的脱氢。在这些催化反应中，铬物种的还原氧化性质和支持物上的适当分散性很重要。
