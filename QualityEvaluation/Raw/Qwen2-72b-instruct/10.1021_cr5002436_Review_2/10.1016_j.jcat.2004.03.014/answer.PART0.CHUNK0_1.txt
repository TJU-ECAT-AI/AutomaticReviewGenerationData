1.Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been widely used in many catalytic reactions since their discovery. Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes. The reaction is endothermic and inevitably controlled by the thermodynamicequilibrium, requiring substantial energy consumption. Supported chromium oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant is frequently accompanied by deep oxidation, resulting in a decrease in product selectivity. Carbon dioxide as one of the major greenhouse gases has recently been considered as a source of carbon. Catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide into several organic compounds has been intensively studied. In fact, carbon dioxide can also act as a mild oxidant and utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions, such as CO2 reforming of methane and oxidative coupling of methane has been reported. Carbon dioxide was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and isobutane over supported chromium oxide. The reductionoxidation property and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions.

1.自发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂在许多催化反应中得到了广泛应用。硅和氧化铝支持的铬氧化物在工业上用于通过脱氢生产较低的烯烃，如乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯。反应是吸热的，不可避免地受到热力学平衡的控制，需要大量的能量消耗。支持的铬氧化物也被研究用于较低烷烃的氧化脱氢或用氧气氧化其他有机化合物。然而，氧气作为氧化剂的使用通常伴随着深度氧化，导致产品选择性的降低。二氧化碳作为主要的温室气体之一，最近被认为是一种碳源。二氧化碳催化氢化为几种有机化合物的研究已经广泛进行。事实上，二氧化碳也可以作为温和的氧化剂，利用二氧化碳在一些部分氧化反应中的作用，如甲烷的CO2重整和甲烷的氧化耦合，已经被报道。发现二氧化碳可以增强在支持的铬氧化物上对乙烷、丙烷和异丁烷的脱氢。在这些催化反应中，铬物种的还原-氧化性质和在支持物上的适当分散性是重要的。
