1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based catalysts are among the most active, selective, and stable in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The redox mechanism proposed for these catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. The focus on structure, active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms has contributed to the significance of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。但是，它确实提到铬氧化物基催化剂在与CO2一起的丙烷脱氢反应中是最活跃，最选择性和最稳定的催化剂之一。为这些催化剂提出的氧化还原机制需要氧化还原Cr物种（Cr6+，Cr5+或Cr3+），其浓度受铬负载，制备条件，铬前体化合物和支撑材料性质的影响。对结构，活性位点，支撑材料和反应机制的关注对这些催化剂在脱氢过程中的重要性做出了贡献。
