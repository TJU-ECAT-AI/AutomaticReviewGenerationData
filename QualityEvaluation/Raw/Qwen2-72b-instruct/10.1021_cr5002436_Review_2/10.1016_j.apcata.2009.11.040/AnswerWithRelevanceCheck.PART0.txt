          The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it highlights that chromium oxide-based catalysts are significant in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, particularly in the presence of CO2. The focus is on the structure and active sites of these catalysts, with an emphasis on achieving high dispersion of chromium oxide species for enhanced catalytic activity. The support materials, such as mesoporous SBA-1 materials, are crucial for providing a large surface area and accessible pores for reactant molecules. Promoters and reaction mechanisms are also important, with CO2 acting as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over chromium oxide-based catalysts. The redox mechanism proposed for these catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. The focus on structure, active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms has contributed to the significance of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

          文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。然而，它强调了铬氧化物基催化剂在丙烷脱氢制丙烯中的重要性，特别是在二氧化碳存在的情况下。重点在于这些催化剂的结构和活性位点，特别强调了为了增强催化活性，需要实现铬氧化物种的高分散。支撑材料，如SBA-1介孔材料，对于提供大表面积和反应物分子可及的孔隙至关重要。促进剂和反应机制也很重要，其中二氧化碳在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯的铬氧化物基催化剂上作为氧化剂。为这些催化剂提出的氧化还原机制需要氧化还原Cr物种（Cr6+，Cr5+或Cr3+），其浓度受铬负载，制备条件，铬前体化合物和支撑材料性质的影响。对结构，活性位点，支撑材料和反应机制的关注对这些催化剂在脱氢过程中的重要性做出了贡献。
