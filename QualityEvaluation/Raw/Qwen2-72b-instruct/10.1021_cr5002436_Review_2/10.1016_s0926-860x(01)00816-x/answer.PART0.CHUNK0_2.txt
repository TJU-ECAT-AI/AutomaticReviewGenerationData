[1] "Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
[2] "During World War II, catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was practiced for the production of butenes that were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to yield high-octane aviation fuel."
[3] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."
[4] "Important aspects in dehydro- genation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."
[5] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
[6] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."
[7] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum."
[8] "Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
[9] "However, there are a number of issues related to safety and process upsets that need to be addressed."
[10] "Important objectives in oxydehydrogenation are attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin and minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant."
[11] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidantparaffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
[12] "While catalytic dehydrogenation reflects a relatively mature and well-established technology, oxydehydrogenation can in many respects be characterized as still being in its infancy."
[13] "Oxydehydrogenation, however, offers substantial thermodynamic advantages and is an area of active research in many fronts."

1.Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. During World War II, chromia-alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butanes to produce high-octane aviation fuel. Dehydrogenation processes have evolved to employ chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts. The focus has been on achieving near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation. Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 30-60%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10-C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 10-20%. In 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3-C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10-C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation. Oxydehydrogenation, which employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum, is still in its infancy but offers substantial thermodynamic advantages. Research is focused on attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin, minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant, and investigating the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene.

1.催化石蜡脱氢生产烯烃自20世纪30年代末以来一直在商业使用。在第二次世界大战期间，使用铬酸铝催化剂将丁烷脱氢以生产高辛烷值航空燃料。脱氢过程已经发展到使用铬酸铝催化剂，最近使用铂或改性铂催化剂。重点是实现接近平衡的转化率，同时最小化副反应和焦炭形成。商业过程催化脱氢丙烷和丁烷的转化率在30-60%之间，而C10-C14石蜡的催化脱氢通常在10-20%的转化率水平下运行。2000年，通过催化脱氢生产了近700万吨C3-C4烯烃和200万吨C10-C14范围烯烃。氧脱氢，使用含钒催化剂，最近使用铂，仍处于起步阶段，但提供了实质性的热力学优势。研究集中在实现高选择性到烯烃与高转化率的石蜡，最小化潜在危险的石蜡和氧化剂混合物，并调查使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂将乙烷转化为乙烯。
