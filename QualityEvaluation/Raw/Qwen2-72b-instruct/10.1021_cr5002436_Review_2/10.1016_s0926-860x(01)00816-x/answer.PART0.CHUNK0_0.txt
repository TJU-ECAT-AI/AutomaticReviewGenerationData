[1] "Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
[2] "During World War II, catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was practiced for the production of butenes that were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to yield high-octane aviation fuel."
[3] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."
[4] "Important aspects in dehydro- genation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."
[5] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
[6] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."
[7] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum."
[8] "Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
[9] "However, there are a number of issues related to safety and process upsets that need to be addressed."
[10] "Important objectives in oxydehydrogenation are attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin and minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant."
[11] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidantparaffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
[12] "While catalytic dehydrogenation reflects a relatively mature and well-established technology, oxydehydrogenation can in many respects be characterized as still being in its infancy."
[13] "Oxydehydrogenation, however, offers substantial thermodynamic advantages and is an area of active research in many fronts."

1.Chromia-alumina catalysts have been used in catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation since the late 1930s, initially for the production of butenes during World War II, which were then converted into high-octane aviation fuel. These catalysts have evolved to include platinum or modified platinum catalysts, which are used in commercial processes for the dehydrogenation of propane and butanes, achieving per-pass conversions of 30-60%. The focus in dehydrogenation has been on approaching equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation. In 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation. Oxydehydrogenation, which employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum, is still in its infancy but offers substantial thermodynamic advantages. Research in this area is focused on attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin, minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant, and investigating the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene.

1.自20世纪30年代末以来，铬酸铝催化剂已被用于催化石蜡脱氢，最初是在第二次世界大战期间用于生产丁烯，然后将其转化为高辛烷值航空燃料。这些催化剂已经发展到包括铂或改性铂催化剂，这些催化剂被用于丙烷和丁烷的脱氢商业过程中，实现了30-60%的每程转化率。脱氢的重点是接近平衡转化率，同时最小化副反应和焦炭形成。2000年，通过催化脱氢生产了近700万吨C3C4烯烃和200万吨C10C14范围的烯烃。氧化脱氢，使用含钒和最近的铂的催化剂，仍处于起步阶段，但提供了实质性的热力学优势。该领域的研究集中在以高转化率获得高选择性的烯烃，最小化潜在危险的石蜡和氧化剂混合物，并研究将二氧化碳用作将乙烷转化为乙烯的氧化剂。
