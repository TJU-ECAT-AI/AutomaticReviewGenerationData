1.Chromia-based catalysts have been used in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes since the early 1930s. A comprehensive review of the literature up to 1954 can be found in Emmett's book on catalysis. Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to produce high-octane aviation fuel. Independent development was carried out by UOP in the United States and ICI in the UK. The first UOP-designed plant began operation in Billingham, England, in 1940. Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, which allowed for higher per-pass conversion. Typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K. A review of the process chemistry is provided by Bhasin. In this chapter, both chromia and vanadia are examined, although vanadia is not used commercially. The oxide surfaces have been analyzed by a wide range of techniques before, during, and after the reaction. The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known. Catalyst regeneration is periodic and by oxidation. Commercial reactor designs take different approaches to managing deactivation and regeneration. The CATOFIN process, which uses a chromium oxide catalyst, is of particular interest. The CATOFIN process technology is currently owned by Sd-Chemie and offered for licensing by ABB Lummus. The process converts propane to propene over a fixed-bed chromia alumina catalyst. It takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated, the reactor is purged with steam, then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke. This is followed by evacuation, reduction, and another cycle. The cycle time is typically 15-25 minutes. In the classic process, the regenerating gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, leading to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front moves through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction. Operation is generally at 823-873 K and 0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm. The overall operation is similar to that described for propane to propene, with conversion in the region of 50% per pass and selectivity for isobutane to isobutene of greater than 90%; the selectivity of propane to propene is > 86%. A recent patent describes a catalyst formulation consisting of 20% Cr, 1% Zr as ZrO2, 0.75% Mg as MgO, supported on alumina with an alkali metal oxide promoter such as Na2O at 0.75%.

1.自20世纪30年代初以来，铬酸盐基催化剂已被用于轻烷烃的脱氢反应。Emmett关于催化作用的书中包含了1954年以前的全面文献综述。基于铬酸盐的商业工艺已运行超过60年。在第二次世界大战期间，铬酸盐/氧化铝催化剂被用于丁烷的脱氢，以生产高辛烷值航空燃料。美国的UOP（当时为Universal Oil Products）和英国的ICI（Imperial Chemical Industries）也进行了独立开发。1940年，第一个由UOP设计的工厂在英格兰东北部的Billingham开始运营。Houdry通过使用低于大气压的系统，实现了显著的工艺发展，这在当时高压是行业标准的情况下是一项创新举措。这使得每道工序的转化率得以提高。目前商业反应器的典型操作条件为0.3-0.5 atm和823-923 K。Bhasin提供了关于工艺化学的详细综述。在本章中，我们考察了铬酸盐和钒酸盐，尽管钒酸盐并未在商业上应用。氧化物表面在反应前、反应中和反应后都经过了广泛的分析。在轻烷烃脱氢过程中，由于碳质物质在催化剂表面的沉积，导致铬酸盐催化剂失活，这是众所周知的。催化剂的再生是周期性的，通过氧化进行。商业反应器的设计采用了不同的方法来管理失活和再生。CATOFIN工艺，使用铬酸盐催化剂，尤其值得关注。CATOFIN工艺技术目前由Sd-Chemie拥有，并由ABB Lummus提供许可。该工艺在固定床铬酸盐氧化铝催化剂上将丙烷转化为丙烯。它在一系列固定床反应器中以循环方式运行。在一个完整的循环中，烃类被脱氢，反应器用蒸汽冲洗，然后通入空气以重新加热催化剂并烧掉沉积的焦炭。随后进行抽空、还原，然后开始另一个循环。循环时间通常为15-25分钟。在经典工艺中，再生气体（加热气体）与工艺气体同向流动，导致进料端的温度高于出口端。随着时间的推移，由于脱氢反应的吸热性质，床层前端会冷却，从而在床层中形成温度前沿。操作通常在823-873 K和0.3 atm下进行。CATOFIN还被商业用于异丁烷到异丁烯的转化。反应条件通常是923 K和0.5 atm。总体操作类似于丙烷到丙烯的描述，每道工序的转化率在50%左右，异丁烷到异丁烯的选择性超过90%；丙烷到丙烯的选择性大于86%。最近一项专利描述了一种催化剂配方，包含20% Cr，1% Zr作为ZrO2，0.75% Mg作为MgO，以氧化铝为载体，含有0.75%的碱金属氧化物促进剂，如Na2O。
