A comprehensive review of the pre-1954 literature can be found in Emmett's book on catalysis. Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to produce butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel. There was independent development by UOP in the United States and ICI in the UK. The first UOP-designed plant began operation in Billingham, England, in 1940. Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, which was highly innovative in an industry where high pressure is the norm. This allowed for a higher per-pass conversion, and typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3 to 0.5 atm and 823 to 923 K. A good review of the process chemistry is provided by Bhasin. In this chapter, both chromia and vanadia are examined, although vanadia is not used commercially, it has been thoroughly studied for these reactions. The oxide surfaces have been analyzed by a wide range of techniques before, during, and after the reaction.

1.自20世纪30年代初以来，铬酸盐系统对轻烷烃的脱氢作用就已知是一种催化过程。Emmett关于催化作用的书中可以找到1954年以前文献的全面回顾。基于铬酸盐催化剂的商业过程已经运行了60多年。在第二次世界大战期间，铬酸盐/氧化铝催化剂被用于丁烷的脱氢，以产生丁烯，然后二聚化和氢化，以生产高辛烷值的航空燃料。美国的UOP（当时为Universal Oil Products）和英国的ICI（Imperial Chemical Industries）也进行了独立开发。第一个由UOP设计的工厂于1940年在英格兰东北部的Billingham开始运营。Houdry通过使用低于大气压的系统，做出了重大的工艺发展，这在高压是常态的行业中是一个高度创新的举措。这样可以实现更高的每程转化率，实际上，当前商业反应器的典型操作条件是0.3至0.5 atm和823至923 K。关于过程化学的一个很好的回顾是Bhasin提供的。在这一章中，我们将考察铬酸盐和钒酸盐，尽管钒酸盐没有商业使用，但已经对这些反应进行了彻底的研究。氧化物表面已经通过一系列技术在反应前、反应中和反应后进行了分析。

1.Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been used in dehydrogenation processes since the early 1930s. During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were used to dehydrogenate butane to produce high-octane aviation fuel. UOP and ICI independently developed this technology in the United States and the UK, respectively. The first UOP-designed plant was put into operation in Billingham, England in 1940. Houdry made significant process improvements by using a sub-atmospheric pressure system, which allowed for higher per-pass conversion. Current commercial reactors typically operate at 0.3 to 0.5 atm and 823 to 923 K. Bhasin's review provides a good overview of the process chemistry. In this chapter, we will examine both chromia and vanadia, although vanadia is not commercially used, it has been extensively studied for these reactions. The surface of the oxide has been analyzed by a variety of techniques before, during, and after the reaction. The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes is well known, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface. Catalyst regeneration is periodic and by oxidation. Commercial reactor designs for this process take different approaches to manage deactivation and regeneration. The CATOFIN process, which uses a chromium oxide catalyst, is of particular interest. The CATOFIN process technology is currently owned by Sd-Chemie and licensed by ABB Lummus. The process converts propane to propene over a fixed-bed chromia-alumina catalyst. The process takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate cyclically. In one complete cycle, hydrocarbons are dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam, then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke deposited during the reaction cycle. These steps are followed by evacuation and reduction, and then another cycle begins. The cycle time is typically 15 to 25 minutes. In the classic process, the regenerating (heating) gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, initially resulting in a higher temperature at the feed than at the exit. Over time, a temperature front moves through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction. Operation is generally at 823 to 873 K and 0.3 atm. The CATOFIN process is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm. The overall operation is similar to that described for propane to propene, with conversion in the region of 50% per pass and selectivity for isobutane to isobutene greater than 90%; the selectivity of propane to propene is greater than 86%. A recent patent provides a catalyst formulation consisting of 20% Cr, 1% Zr as ZrO2, 0.75% Mg as MgO, supported on alumina with an alkali metal oxide promoter such as Na2O at 0.75%.

1.自20世纪30年代初以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已被用于脱氢过程。在第二次世界大战期间，铬酸/氧化铝催化剂被用于脱氢丁烷，以生产高辛烷值航空燃料。UOP和ICI分别在美国和英国独立开发了这项技术。第一个UOP设计的工厂于1940年在英格兰东北部的Billingham投入运营。Houdry通过使用低于大气压的系统，对工艺进行了重大改进，这在当时高压是常态的行业中是一项高度创新的举措。这样可以实现更高的每程转化率。目前商业反应器通常在0.3至0.5 atm和823至923 K的条件下运行。Bhasin的评论提供了关于过程化学的很好概述。在本章中，我们将研究铬酸和钒酸，尽管钒酸没有商业使用，但已对这些反应进行了彻底研究。氧化物表面在反应前、反应中和反应后已经通过多种技术进行了分析。在轻烷烃脱氢过程中，铬酸催化剂的失活是众所周知的，这是由于碳质物种沉积在催化剂表面。催化剂的再生是周期性的，通过氧化进行。商业反应器设计针对此过程采取了不同的方法来管理失活和再生。CATOFIN工艺，使用铬氧化物催化剂，是特别感兴趣的。CATOFIN工艺技术目前由Sd-Chemie拥有，并由ABB Lummus提供许可。该工艺在固定床铬酸/氧化铝催化剂上将丙烷转化为丙烯。该过程在一系列固定床反应器中以循环方式运行。在一个完整的循环中，烃类被脱氢，反应器用蒸汽冲洗，然后用空气加热催化剂，烧掉反应循环中沉积的焦炭。这些步骤后跟排空和还原，然后开始另一个循环。循环时间通常为15至25分钟。在经典工艺中，再生（加热）气体与工艺气体同向进料，最初导致进料处的温度高于出口。随着时间的推移，由于吸热反应冷却床的前端，温度前沿将穿过床。操作通常在823至873 K和0.3 atm下进行。CATOFIN工艺也用于商业上将异丁烷转化为异丁烯。反应条件通常是923 K和0.5 atm。总体操作类似于丙烷转化为丙烯的描述，转化率在每程50%左右，异丁烷转化为异丁烯的选择性大于90%；丙烷转化为丙烯的选择性大于86%。最近的专利提供了一种催化剂配方，包括20% Cr，1% Zr作为ZrO2，0.75% Mg作为MgO，支持在氧化铝上，具有如Na2O的碱金属氧化物促进剂，含量为0.75%。

1.自20世纪30年代初以来，铬酸盐基催化剂已被用于轻烷烃的脱氢反应。Emmett关于催化作用的书中包含了1954年以前的全面文献综述。基于铬酸盐的商业工艺已运行超过60年。在第二次世界大战期间，铬酸盐/氧化铝催化剂被用于丁烷的脱氢，以生产高辛烷值航空燃料。美国的UOP（当时为Universal Oil Products）和英国的ICI（Imperial Chemical Industries）也进行了独立开发。1940年，第一个由UOP设计的工厂在英格兰东北部的Billingham开始运营。Houdry通过使用低于大气压的系统，实现了显著的工艺发展，这在当时高压是行业标准的情况下是一项创新举措。这使得每道工序的转化率得以提高。目前商业反应器的典型操作条件为0.3-0.5 atm和823-923 K。Bhasin提供了关于工艺化学的详细综述。在本章中，我们考察了铬酸盐和钒酸盐，尽管钒酸盐并未在商业上应用。氧化物表面在反应前、反应中和反应后都经过了广泛的分析。在轻烷烃脱氢过程中，由于碳质物质在催化剂表面的沉积，导致铬酸盐催化剂失活，这是众所周知的。催化剂的再生是周期性的，通过氧化进行。商业反应器的设计采用了不同的方法来管理失活和再生。CATOFIN工艺，使用铬酸盐催化剂，尤其值得关注。CATOFIN工艺技术目前由Sd-Chemie拥有，并由ABB Lummus提供许可。该工艺在固定床铬酸盐氧化铝催化剂上将丙烷转化为丙烯。它在一系列固定床反应器中以循环方式运行。在一个完整的循环中，烃类被脱氢，反应器用蒸汽冲洗，然后通入空气以重新加热催化剂并烧掉沉积的焦炭。随后进行抽空、还原，然后开始另一个循环。循环时间通常为15-25分钟。在经典工艺中，再生气体（加热气体）与工艺气体同向流动，导致进料端的温度高于出口端。随着时间的推移，由于脱氢反应的吸热性质，床层前端会冷却，从而在床层中形成温度前沿。操作通常在823-873 K和0.3 atm下进行。CATOFIN还被商业用于异丁烷到异丁烯的转化。反应条件通常是923 K和0.5 atm。总体操作类似于丙烷到丙烯的描述，每道工序的转化率在50%左右，异丁烷到异丁烯的选择性超过90%；丙烷到丙烯的选择性大于86%。最近一项专利描述了一种催化剂配方，包含20% Cr，1% Zr作为ZrO2，0.75% Mg作为MgO，以氧化铝为载体，含有0.75%的碱金属氧化物促进剂，如Na2O。

1.Chromia-based catalysts have been used in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes since the early 1930s. A comprehensive review of the literature up to 1954 can be found in Emmett's book on catalysis. Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to produce high-octane aviation fuel. Independent development was carried out by UOP in the United States and ICI in the UK. The first UOP-designed plant started operation in Billingham, England in 1940. Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, which allowed for higher per-pass conversion. Typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K. A good review of the process chemistry is provided by Bhasin. Both chromia and vanadia have been thoroughly examined for these reactions, although vanadia is not used commercially. The oxide surfaces have been analyzed by a wide range of techniques before, during, and after the reaction. The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known. Catalyst regeneration is periodic and by oxidation. Commercial reactor designs take different approaches to manage deactivation and regeneration. The CATOFIN process, which uses a chromium oxide catalyst, is of particular interest. The CATOFIN process technology is currently owned by Sd-Chemie and offered for licensing by ABB Lummus. The process converts propane to propene over a fixed-bed chromia alumina catalyst. It takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam, then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke. This is followed by evacuation and reduction, and then another cycle begins. The cycle time is typically 15-25 minutes. In the classic process, the regenerating gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, leading to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front moves through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction. Operation is generally at 823-873 K and 0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm. The overall operation is similar to that described for propane to propene, with conversion in the region of 50% per pass and selectivity for isobutane to isobutene of greater than 90%; the selectivity of propane to propene is > 86%.
