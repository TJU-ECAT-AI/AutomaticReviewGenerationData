1.The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s. A comprehensive review of the pre-1954 literature can be found in Emmett's book on catalysis. Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to produce butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel. There was independent development by UOP in the United States and ICI in the UK. The first UOP-designed plant began operation in Billingham, England, in 1940. Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, which was highly innovative in an industry where high pressure is the norm. This allowed for a higher per-pass conversion, and typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3 to 0.5 atm and 823 to 923 K. A good review of the process chemistry is provided by Bhasin. In this chapter, both chromia and vanadia are examined, although vanadia is not used commercially, it has been thoroughly studied for these reactions. The oxide surfaces have been analyzed by a wide range of techniques before, during, and after the reaction.

1.自20世纪30年代初以来，铬酸盐系统对轻烷烃的脱氢作用就已知是一种催化过程。Emmett关于催化作用的书中可以找到1954年以前文献的全面回顾。基于铬酸盐催化剂的商业过程已经运行了60多年。在第二次世界大战期间，铬酸盐/氧化铝催化剂被用于丁烷的脱氢，以产生丁烯，然后二聚化和氢化，以生产高辛烷值的航空燃料。美国的UOP（当时为Universal Oil Products）和英国的ICI（Imperial Chemical Industries）也进行了独立开发。第一个由UOP设计的工厂于1940年在英格兰东北部的Billingham开始运营。Houdry通过使用低于大气压的系统，做出了重大的工艺发展，这在高压是常态的行业中是一个高度创新的举措。这样可以实现更高的每程转化率，实际上，当前商业反应器的典型操作条件是0.3至0.5 atm和823至923 K。关于过程化学的一个很好的回顾是Bhasin提供的。在这一章中，我们将考察铬酸盐和钒酸盐，尽管钒酸盐没有商业使用，但已经对这些反应进行了彻底的研究。氧化物表面已经通过一系列技术在反应前、反应中和反应后进行了分析。
