1.Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been used in dehydrogenation processes since the early 1930s. During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were used to dehydrogenate butane to produce high-octane aviation fuel. UOP and ICI independently developed this technology in the United States and the UK, respectively. The first UOP-designed plant was put into operation in Billingham, England in 1940. Houdry made significant process improvements by using a sub-atmospheric pressure system, which allowed for higher per-pass conversion. Current commercial reactors typically operate at 0.3 to 0.5 atm and 823 to 923 K. Bhasin's review provides a good overview of the process chemistry. In this chapter, we will examine both chromia and vanadia, although vanadia is not commercially used, it has been extensively studied for these reactions. The surface of the oxide has been analyzed by a variety of techniques before, during, and after the reaction. The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes is well known, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface. Catalyst regeneration is periodic and by oxidation. Commercial reactor designs for this process take different approaches to manage deactivation and regeneration. The CATOFIN process, which uses a chromium oxide catalyst, is of particular interest. The CATOFIN process technology is currently owned by Sd-Chemie and licensed by ABB Lummus. The process converts propane to propene over a fixed-bed chromia-alumina catalyst. The process takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate cyclically. In one complete cycle, hydrocarbons are dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam, then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke deposited during the reaction cycle. These steps are followed by evacuation and reduction, and then another cycle begins. The cycle time is typically 15 to 25 minutes. In the classic process, the regenerating (heating) gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, initially resulting in a higher temperature at the feed than at the exit. Over time, a temperature front moves through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction. Operation is generally at 823 to 873 K and 0.3 atm. The CATOFIN process is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm. The overall operation is similar to that described for propane to propene, with conversion in the region of 50% per pass and selectivity for isobutane to isobutene greater than 90%; the selectivity of propane to propene is greater than 86%. A recent patent provides a catalyst formulation consisting of 20% Cr, 1% Zr as ZrO2, 0.75% Mg as MgO, supported on alumina with an alkali metal oxide promoter such as Na2O at 0.75%.

1.自20世纪30年代初以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已被用于脱氢过程。在第二次世界大战期间，铬酸/氧化铝催化剂被用于脱氢丁烷，以生产高辛烷值航空燃料。UOP和ICI分别在美国和英国独立开发了这项技术。第一个UOP设计的工厂于1940年在英格兰东北部的Billingham投入运营。Houdry通过使用低于大气压的系统，对工艺进行了重大改进，这在当时高压是常态的行业中是一项高度创新的举措。这样可以实现更高的每程转化率。目前商业反应器通常在0.3至0.5 atm和823至923 K的条件下运行。Bhasin的评论提供了关于过程化学的很好概述。在本章中，我们将研究铬酸和钒酸，尽管钒酸没有商业使用，但已对这些反应进行了彻底研究。氧化物表面在反应前、反应中和反应后已经通过多种技术进行了分析。在轻烷烃脱氢过程中，铬酸催化剂的失活是众所周知的，这是由于碳质物种沉积在催化剂表面。催化剂的再生是周期性的，通过氧化进行。商业反应器设计针对此过程采取了不同的方法来管理失活和再生。CATOFIN工艺，使用铬氧化物催化剂，是特别感兴趣的。CATOFIN工艺技术目前由Sd-Chemie拥有，并由ABB Lummus提供许可。该工艺在固定床铬酸/氧化铝催化剂上将丙烷转化为丙烯。该过程在一系列固定床反应器中以循环方式运行。在一个完整的循环中，烃类被脱氢，反应器用蒸汽冲洗，然后用空气加热催化剂，烧掉反应循环中沉积的焦炭。这些步骤后跟排空和还原，然后开始另一个循环。循环时间通常为15至25分钟。在经典工艺中，再生（加热）气体与工艺气体同向进料，最初导致进料处的温度高于出口。随着时间的推移，由于吸热反应冷却床的前端，温度前沿将穿过床。操作通常在823至873 K和0.3 atm下进行。CATOFIN工艺也用于商业上将异丁烷转化为异丁烯。反应条件通常是923 K和0.5 atm。总体操作类似于丙烷转化为丙烯的描述，转化率在每程50%左右，异丁烷转化为异丁烯的选择性大于90%；丙烷转化为丙烯的选择性大于86%。最近的专利提供了一种催化剂配方，包括20% Cr，1% Zr作为ZrO2，0.75% Mg作为MgO，支持在氧化铝上，具有如Na2O的碱金属氧化物促进剂，含量为0.75%。
