1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail their key industrial applications and research focus areas such as structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes. The focus of the literature is on a comparative study of the activity of chromium oxide deposited on different silica supports in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现铬氧化物基催化剂以来的历史概览，也没有详细说明其关键的工业应用和研究重点领域，如结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制，这些都促成了它们在脱氢过程中的重要性。文献的重点是对不同硅胶支撑上沉积的铬氧化物在丙烷与CO2脱氢过程中的活性的比较研究。
