Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The document does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. It focuses on a comparative study of chromium oxide deposited on different silica supports in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key aspects highlighted are the preparation methods, characterization techniques, and the influence of support properties on the dispersion of chromium species and their oxidation states. The study emphasizes the role of Cr6+ species as crucial for high activity in the dehydrogenation process, and the reduction of these species to Cr3+ and Cr2+ during the reaction, which participate in the non-oxidative pathway of propene formation. The presence of CO2 is shown to promote the dehydrogenation of propane by consuming hydrogen produced in the reaction, shifting the equilibrium towards propene formation.

1.该文件没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。它侧重于比较研究,研究了不同硅酸盐载体上沉积的铬氧化物在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢中的作用。突出的关键方面包括制备方法、表征技术以及载体性质对铬物种分散和氧化态的影响。该研究强调Cr6+物种对于脱氢过程中的高活性至关重要,并且这些物种在反应过程中被还原为Cr3+和Cr2+,参与非氧化路径的丙烯形成。二氧化碳的存在被证明通过消耗反应中产生的氢来促进丙烷的脱氢,使平衡向丙烯形成的方向移动。
