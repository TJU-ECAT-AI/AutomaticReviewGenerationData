1.The document does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. It focuses on a comparative study of chromium oxide deposited on different silica supports in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key aspects highlighted are the preparation methods, characterization techniques, and the influence of support properties on the dispersion of chromium species and their oxidation states. The study emphasizes the role of Cr6+ species as crucial for high activity in the dehydrogenation process, and the reduction of these species to Cr3+ and Cr2+ during the reaction, which participate in the non-oxidative pathway of propene formation. The presence of CO2 is shown to promote the dehydrogenation of propane by consuming hydrogen produced in the reaction, shifting the equilibrium towards propene formation.

1.该文件没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。它侧重于在二氧化碳存在下不同硅酸盐支撑体上沉积的铬氧化物对丙烷脱氢的比较研究。突出的关键方面包括制备方法、表征技术以及支撑体性质对铬物种分散和氧化态的影响。研究强调Cr6+物种对于脱氢过程的高活性至关重要，并且这些物种在反应中被还原为Cr3+和Cr2+，参与非氧化路径的丙烯形成。二氧化碳的存在被证明通过消耗反应中产生的氢来促进丙烷的脱氢，使平衡向丙烯形成的方向移动。
