1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail the evolution of these catalysts. However, it does mention that high-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are very active and selective in the dehydrogenation reaction, which is crucial for the production of light alkenes, particularly propylene for polypropylene production. The increasing demand for propene due to the growing polypropylene market has led to extensive research on the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of the active chromium oxide site, and deactivation routes. The focus of recent research has been on the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of this industrially important catalytic system, with particular attention to the role of CrO moieties with chromium in its tri- or divalent state as the active site for CH activation. The literature also discusses the possible involvement of coke deposits in alkane dehydrogenation reactions and the role of supported chromium oxide species in the formation of such deposits.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览，也没有详细描述这些催化剂的演变。但是，它确实提到高负载的Cr/Al2O3催化剂在脱氢反应中非常活跃和选择性，这对轻烯烃，特别是用于聚丙烯生产的丙烯的生产至关重要。由于聚丙烯市场的增长，对丙烯的需求不断增加，这导致了对支撑铬氧化物的分子结构，活性铬氧化物位点的性质以及失活途径的广泛研究。最近的研究重点是阐明这个工业上重要的催化系统的反应机制，特别关注CrO基团中三价或二价状态的铬作为CH活化活性位点的作用。文献还讨论了焦炭沉积物在烷烃脱氢反应中的可能作用，以及支撑铬氧化物物种在形成此类沉积物中的作用。
