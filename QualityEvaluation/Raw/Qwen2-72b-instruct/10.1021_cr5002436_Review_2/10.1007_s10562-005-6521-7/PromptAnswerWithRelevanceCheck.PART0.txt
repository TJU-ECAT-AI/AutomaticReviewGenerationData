1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that high-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are very active and selective in the dehydrogenation reaction to produce light alkenes, which are crucial for the chemical industry, particularly for the production of polypropylene. The increasing demand for propene due to the growing polypropylene market has led to extensive research on the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of the active chromium oxide site, and deactivation routes. The focus is on understanding the reaction mechanism of this industrially important catalytic system, which is not well studied, especially for supported chromium oxide catalysts. The literature discusses the dehydrogenation mechanism over a Cr3+-O site supported on a high-surface oxide, involving the activation of the CH bond by reacting with a coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ center, leading to the formation of a new OH group and a Cr-alkyl bond. The alkene is formed by hydrogen transfer from the alkyl to Cr, which is thought to be the rate-determining step. The reaction cycle is completed by the formation of H2 and the regeneration of the Cr3+-O active site. Another possible mechanism involves the addition of ethane to a hydrochromium site, leading to the formation of Cr-Ethyl and molecular H2, followed by b-H transfer to Cr and ethene desorption. The literature also discusses the role of coke deposits in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, suggesting that carbon nanomaterials could be active catalyst materials in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene. The goal of the paper is to elucidate if carbon deposits are active in the dehydrogenation of ethane and to extend the work of Burwell on alumina-supported chromium oxide catalysts.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。但是，它确实提到高负载的Cr/Al2O3催化剂在脱氢反应中非常活跃和选择性，用于生产轻烯烃，这对化学工业至关重要，特别是用于生产聚丙烯。由于聚丙烯市场的增长，对丙烯的需求不断增加，这导致了对支撑铬氧化物的分子结构、活性铬氧化物位点的性质以及失活途径的广泛研究。重点在于理解这个工业上重要的催化系统的反应机制，这在支撑铬氧化物催化剂中研究得不够充分。文献讨论了在支撑在高表面氧化物上的Cr3+-O位点上的脱氢机制，涉及通过与配位不饱和的Cr3+中心反应激活CH键，导致形成新的OH基团和Cr-烷基键。通过从烷基到Cr的氢转移形成烯烃，这被认为是速率决定步骤。通过H2的形成和Cr3+-O活性位点的再生完成反应循环。另一种可能的机制涉及乙烷添加到氢铬位点，导致Cr-Ethyl和分子H2的形成，随后是b-H转移到Cr和乙烯解吸。文献还讨论了在烷烃脱氢反应中焦炭沉积物的作用，表明碳纳米材料可能是乙基苯氧化脱氢到苯乙烯的活性催化剂材料。论文的目标是阐明碳沉积物是否在乙烷脱氢中具有活性，并将Burwell关于氧化铝支撑的铬氧化物催化剂的工作扩展到氧化铝支撑的铬氧化物催化剂上。

The focus of recent research has been on the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of this industrially important catalytic system, with particular attention to the role of CrO moieties with chromium in its tri- or divalent state as the active site for CH activation. The literature also discusses the possible involvement of coke deposits in alkane dehydrogenation reactions and the role of supported chromium oxide species in the formation of such deposits.
