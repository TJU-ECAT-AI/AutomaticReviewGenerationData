1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that high-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are very active and selective in the dehydrogenation reaction, which is important for the production of light alkenes, particularly propylene for polypropylene production. The increasing demand for propene due to the growing polypropylene market has initiated many research activities in both academia and chemical industries. The focus of research has been on the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of the active chromium oxide site, and possible short- and long-term deactivation routes. Surprisingly, not much study has been devoted to the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of this industrially important catalytic system.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。但是，它确实提到高负载的Cr/Al2O3催化剂在脱氢反应中非常活跃和选择性，这对于轻烯烃的生产，特别是用于聚丙烯生产的丙烯非常重要。由于聚丙烯市场不断增长，对丙烯的需求日益增加，这在学术界和化工行业引发了大量研究活动。研究的重点是支撑铬氧化物的分子结构，活性铬氧化物位点的性质，以及可能的短期和长期失活途径。令人惊讶的是，没有多少研究致力于阐明这种工业上重要的催化系统的反应机制。
