1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail the evolution of these catalysts. However, it does mention that high-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are very active and selective in the dehydrogenation reaction, which is of key importance to the development of chemical industries, particularly in the production of high-purity propylene for polypropylene. The increasing demand for propene due to the growing polypropylene market has initiated many research activities in both academia and chemical industries. In the last decade, a significant amount of knowledge has been gathered regarding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of the active chromium oxide site, and the possible short- and long-term deactivation routes. Surprisingly, not much study has been devoted to the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of this industrially important catalytic system.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览，也没有详细描述这些催化剂的演变。但是，它确实提到高负载的Cr/Al2O3催化剂在脱氢反应中非常活跃和选择性，这对化学工业的发展至关重要，特别是在生产高纯度丙烯用于聚丙烯方面。由于聚丙烯市场不断增长，对丙烯的需求不断增加，这在学术界和化工行业引发了大量研究活动。在过去十年中，已经收集了大量关于支撑铬氧化物的分子结构、活性铬氧化物位点的性质以及可能的短期和长期失活途径的知识。令人惊讶的是，没有太多的研究致力于阐明这种工业上重要的催化系统的反应机制。
