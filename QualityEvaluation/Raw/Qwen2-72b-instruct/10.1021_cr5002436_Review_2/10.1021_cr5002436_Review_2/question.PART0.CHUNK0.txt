4.2 Chromium Oxide-Based Catalysts
Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933. (143) During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels. These catalysts have been applied to several processes for the dehydrogenation of light olefins henceforth. (26) Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied.
4.2.1 Nature of the Active Sites
Because the adsorption of paraffin molecules takes place on CrO sites, understanding the exact nature of these species under dehydrogenation reaction conditions is critically important. (144) On freshly prepared catalysts a number of surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+, have been identified. Furthermore, chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia and amorphous chromia have been identified through a variety of techniques. (145-148) The relative concentration of these species seems to be dependent on a number of factors, such as chromium loading (relative to the surface area), the calcination treatment used during catalyst preparation, and the support employed. This is illustrated in Figure 13, where chromium species deposited on SBA-15 (a mesoporous silica) and alumina are compared by Raman spectroscopy. Different species are observed depending on the Cr loading: at low loadings isolated CrO42 species predominate, while at higher concentrations CrOCr species become prevalent due to the formation of Cr2O3 crystallites. These crystallites are more readily formed on SBA-15 than on alumina, as the interaction between chromium oxide and SBA-15 is relatively weak.
Prior to the 1990s, the study of the structure of chromium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts had been restricted to conditions far removed from those found under real operation. For this catalytic system, this represented a great limitation, as the reaction mixtures are believed to reduce chromium oxide species. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. As is shown in Figure 14 with XANES and in Figure 15 with UVvis spectroscopy, it was observed that surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction and that polychromate is more easily reduced than monochromate. (151-153) Consequently, Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, as well as a mixture of both Cr3+ and Cr2+ have been all proposed as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. (154-157) Cr6+ or Cr5+ have not been observed to be active for the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit Cr6+/Cr5+ species do appear to be the precursor of active Cr3+ sites. This has been assigned to the fact that reduction of Cr5+ species leads to the formation of monomeric Cr3+ active sites. Indeed, it has been observed that Cr5+ species that are not reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere can be reduced by alkanes. (150, 158-161) With respect to coordination, it appears that Cr3+ sites need to be coordinatively unsaturated to show catalytic activity. (162) Indeed, a semiquantitative relationship has been found between the amount of pseudo-octahedral Cr3+ formed during reduction and the dehydrogenation activity shown by the catalyst. (152, 153) Furthermore, it has been observed that isolated Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies are formed on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of an alkane. Thus, it appears that these catalysts contain coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ under reaction conditions. Experiments performed with Cr loadings above monolayer coverage, which have been shown to include crystalline chromia clusters, suggest that bulk Cr3+ ions in a perfect octahedral environment are inactive toward alkane dehydrogenation. Admittedly, these fully coordinated Cr3+ species are highly stable, whereas coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species would try to attain the stability of bulk Cr3+ ions by adsorbing alkane molecules from the gas phase.
With respect to nuclearity, the need for a highly dispersed active phase is highlighted by the fact that, while activity first rises with increasing chromium loading, a drop in activity is observed when the loading is such that crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming, as illustrated in Figure 16. (163-165) The fact that activity and Cr loading hold an almost linear relationship below monolayer coverage suggests that both isolated and clustered Cr3+ centers are catalytically active. Actually, three different types of Cr3+ ions have been spectroscopically detected at these loadings: (1) Cr3+ species formed by reduction of surface Cr6+/Cr5+ ions; (2) isolated centers of Cr3+ ions stabilized by the alumina surface; and (3) small amorphous (and thus XRD invisible) Cr3+ clusters. (29, 49) Determining the individual contributions of these species to catalytic performance has proven to be extremely challenging. Some studies correlating dehydrogenation activity with Cr-speciation suggested that a vast majority of catalytic activity can be ascribed to the dispersed Cr3+ phase, the role of the other phases being the replenishment of the depleted Cr3+ surface phase during long runs. (152, 153, 166) More detailed studies involving the calculation of turnover frequencies (TOF) have led some workers to propose that multinuclear Cr3+ sites are more active than isolated Cr3+ ions, a proposition that finds both support and dissent in the literature. (147, 160, 163, 167-169) Kumar et al. observed that when γ-alumina was employed as the catalyst support, oligomeric chromium oxide species would display the highest activity and selectivity. However, when SBA-15 was used as the carrier, isolated chromia species with coordination number larger than 4 showed the highest activity. (149) It is clear that the optimal nuclearity of active Cr3+ sites remains a topic still under debate.
Albeit selectivity has been found to be insensitive to chromium loading, it does change over time. (170) At first, the selectivity toward alkenes is fairly low and the catalyst produces mainly carbon oxides, as is shown in Figure 17. This is attributed to the fact that during this induction period, highly oxidized, and thus catalytically inactive, chromium species are being reduced to active chromium species with lower oxidation states. Eventually, a high selectivity of 93.6% can be reached at a conversion of 55%. (29) To summarize, in recent years dehydrogenation activity has been mostly assigned to Cr3+ species that are both dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated. Thus, it seems that active sites need to fulfill oxidation state, coordination, and nuclearity requirements. In fact, these and other factors, such as the origin of Cr3+ species, have been used by some workers to classify the catalytically active sites. (171-173) It should also be mentioned that many other factors could also influence the activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts. For instance, the addition of CO2 as a mild oxidant is known to improve the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing the evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which effectively shifts the equilibrium toward product formation. (174-176) At the same time, CO2 is ineffective at oxidizing catalytically active Cr3+ species to catalytically inactive Cr5+ or Cr6+ species. (150, 177, 178) To obtain high activity, the operating conditions also need to be considered, because activity is directly proportional to both the reaction temperature and the partial pressure of the alkane. Moreover, alkane conversion has been found to be inversely proportional to space velocity, and selectivity has been found to be directly proportional to alkene selectivity. In studies where Cr/Al2O3 catalysts were used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, it was found that when the space velocity (GHSV) decreased from 3600 to 600 h1, ethane conversion increased from 27.6% to 31.4%, while selectivity to ethylene decreased from 91.7% to 64.9%. (179) This effect has been attributed to the fact that lower space velocities favor ethane activation as well as methane and coke formation.
In conclusion, it is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions.
4.2.2 Catalyst Deactivation
Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose their activity due to the deposition of coke, and as is the case with Pt-based catalysts, they need to be periodically regenerated. Experiments performed using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), shown in Figure 17, revealed that the weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages (1040 min) of the reaction, no additional carbon being deposited after this time. However, conversion continues to drop beyond this point, which indicates that the carbon originally deposited becomes more detrimental for the catalytic activity over time. Although the catalysts recover most of their activity after each reactionregeneration cycle, the loss of activity is not entirely reversible. Indeed, the heat released through the combustion of coke during regeneration leads to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, which causes the amount of catalytically active Cr species to decrease with each regeneration step. (29) This phenomenon has been measured by UVvis spectroscopy, as shown in Figure 18. In the figure, a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is treated at 1100 C for 12 h, which results in the bands corresponding to Cr3+ species to shift, signaling the incorporation of Cr3+ species into the alumina support. Consequently, the dehydrogenation activity shown by the catalyst drops, and an almost linear relationship has been found between activity and the amount of Cr6+ species on the catalyst surface (as measured after the regeneration step). (150, 166, 181) Two processes are believed to lead to the dissolution of Cr3+ into the Al2O3 carrier and result in catalytically inactive Cr3+ species. First, the sintering of the alumina may cause entrapment of the Cr species inside the bulk of the support. As an additional effect, the loss of alumina surface area reduces the ability of the support to stabilize Cr6+ species formed during the regeneration step. (154, 182) Consequently, Cr3+ ions migrate into the support. Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction. (145, 183) Of note is the fact that in the presence of γ-alumina, entrapment is believed to be the dominant process, while in its absence migration is favored. (145, 183) At elevated temperatures, γ-alumina undergoes a thermodynamically driven transformation to θ- or even α-alumina, which coincides with a considerable loss in surface area. It is unknown whether the presence of chromia facilitates or hinders the sintering of the alumina support, as some authors have found the presence of chromia to enhance sintering, while other research groups have observed the opposite. (172, 184-186) The transformation of γ-alumina to α-alumina can be restrained by doping the support with silica, zirconia, magnesia, or lanthana. For example, Wachowski et al. observed that when a small amount of La2O3 is added to Al2O3, the transition of θ-alumina to α-alumina occurs at a temperature 136 C higher relative to when no lanthana is added. (187, 188) The authors found that the use of cations having ionic radius larger than Al3+, which tend not to dissolve in Al2O3, in combination with a preparation method capable of affording high dopant dispersion, is most effective in preventing the formation of α-alumina.
It is important to note that the advantages offered by the combustion of coke during the regeneration step far outweigh these unwanted side effects. First and foremost, the heat released in this step is harnessed to fuel the dehydrogenation reaction, making coke deposition not completely undesirable. Furthermore, oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ during regeneration also accomplishes the redispersion of chromia crystallites. The latter is particularly important, given that the sintering of chromia under dehydrogenation conditions has also been reported to be a contributing factor to the reversible deactivation of chromium-based catalysts. (171, 172) Another interesting example of a deactivation phenomenon caused by a change in surface composition related to the nature of the support has been observed on catalysts comprising mesoporous silica as carrier. Indeed, by analyzing this material via XPS before and after 6 h of time-on-stream, an important amount of Cr3+ species was found to be reduced to Cr2+ by the hydrogen evolved during the anoxic dehydrogenation reaction. In turn, the resulting Cr2+ species were found to be inactive in dehydrogenation.
4.2.3 Role of the Support
The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity. Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated. These include the incipient wetness impregnation of alumina with CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 solutions (if an alkali ion is added, an aqueous solution of its chromate salt is used), the coprecipitation of Al(OH)3 and Cr(OH)3 from Al3+ and Cr3+ solutions, a type of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) involving volatile chromium compounds being deposited on alumina called atomic layer deposition, and the decomposition of complexes including both alumina and chromium. All of these methods are followed by a calcination step at approximately 600 C. Increasing the calcination temperature above 600 C causes a loss of dehydrogenation activity, probably due to the incorporation of Cr into the Al2O3 framework, as discussed in the preceding section. (182) Very recently, an interesting synthesis strategy for preparing a mesoporous CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst by using a Cr-containing metalorganic-framework filled with an alumina precursor and subsequently combusting the organic material was reported. The resulting catalyst shows excellent thermal stability and is very active for isobutene dehydrogenation. (189) Interestingly, increasing the pretreatment temperature of the alumina support has a positive effect on the TOF shown by the resulting catalyst, which has been attributed to an increase in the number of multinuclear Cr3+ sites. (172) In addition, this pretreatment will result in a more stable Al2O3 polymorph, which is less likely to sinter. However, the use of alumina as support is not free of drawbacks. For instance, Al2O3 can catalyze cracking and coking due to its surface acidity, which leads to a drop in both activity and selectivity. A solution for this is the doping of alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions, which can effectively poison these undesirable acid sites.
The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated. Indeed, the low surface acidity of this oxide and the fact that chromia imparts an enhanced sintering resistance to ZrO2 make the latter a viable substitute for alumina. (159, 160) De Rossi et al. have reported that catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than the corresponding catalysts supported on silica or alumina. (167, 168, 181, 190) This has been attributed to an increase in the amount of surface Cr5+ that is produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2. The latter improves activity because Cr5+ forms catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions, as has already been mentioned. In turn, the high amount of Cr5+ on this catalyst has been attributed to the strong interaction between chromia and the basic support. (170) The choice of zirconia over alumina as the catalyst support offers the additional advantage of preventing the formation of CrAl mixed oxides. Nevertheless, Cr2O3/ZrO2 has been observed to deactivate faster than other less active catalysts including Cr2O3/Al2O3, which has been partially imputed to the higher coking rate displayed by Cr2O3/ZrO2. Additionally, XPS studies suggest that chromiazirconia catalysts also favor the formation of chromium carbides, which are inactive in dehydrogenation and consequently cause catalyst deactivation. (170) De Rossi and co-workers have also concluded that albeit Cr/ZrO2 catalysts can outperform their alumina- and silica-supported counterparts, zirconia-supported formulations could be further improved by increasing the surface area and the thermal stability of Cr2O3/ZrO2. This has inspired other workers to produce chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts with high surface areas and highly dispersed active sites. For example, Fujdala and Tilley have reported the use of a cothermolysis method involving several thermolytic molecular precursors to produce a Cr/Si/Zr/O catalyst capable of showing propane conversions greater than 35% and propylene selectivities exceeding 90% at 450 C. (191) According to the authors, the aforementioned values are among the best reported in the literature, particularly at such a low temperature. Korhonen et al. attempted to combine the high surface area of alumina with the basic nature of zirconia by covering an alumina support with a zirconia layer. (192) However, the resulting CrOx/Al2O3ZrO2 catalyst displayed inferior activity as compared to the benchmark CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst.
The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. (193) Surface area considerations also explain the fact that titania does not constitute a good support, as CrOx easily sinters due to its weak interaction with TiO2. However, an active and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst has been obtained by preparing a titania mesoporous material with Cr dopants. (177) Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) results suggest that there is a direct relationship between catalytic activity and the reducibility of the catalysts (see Figure 19). (179) Indeed, studies on the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane have revealed that catalytic activity based on ethane conversion and ethylene yields follows the order CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41  CrOx/MgO  CrOx/Si-2 (Si-2 is the abbreviation of silicalite-2 zeolite, which has been described as a silica analogue of the aluminosilicate zeolite ZSM-11 (194)), a reverse order being found for the reduction temperature of the chromium species on the aforementioned catalyst supports.
CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. (195) Some of these catalysts were found to achieve ethane conversions of 2730% and selectivity toward ethylene of 7175%. The method used for introducing Cr into the LDH precursors was found to determine several properties of the resulting mixed oxides, such as surface area, catalytic performance, coking resistance, and thermal stability against sintering.
Finally, the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials has been particularly informative with regards to the influence that acidity has on catalytic behavior. In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane, catalysts based on these materials display an initial conversion of 18.1% with a selectivity toward propylene of 87.1% at 550 C. (162) Interestingly, it has been observed that while the selectivity of this material toward cracking decreases with time-on-stream, its selectivity toward the alkene tends to remain constant. The latter has been explained by assigning the occurrence of cracking and dehydrogenation reactions to strong and medium strength acid sites, respectively. The authors argue that strong acid sites are rapidly deactivated, inhibiting cracking reactions and favoring the production of the alkene.
4.2.4 Role of the Promoters
Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. This phenomenon has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites. (154, 189) Additionally, the presence of alkali metal promoters increases the dispersion of the active phase by assisting the formation under oxidizing conditions of Cr6+ complexes that subsequently give rise to Cr3+ under a reducing atmosphere.
A notable exception to this promotion effect has been found in the doping with K+ of several PDH catalysts, such as chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, galliumchromium mixed oxides pillared α-zirconium phosphate, and chromia/zirconia. (162, 196) For these materials, doping with K+ results in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity. According to some authors, this indicates that oxygen ions play an active role in the dissociative adsorption of propane and/or in the desorption of hydrogen. Indeed, these workers contend that in these catalysts, potassium forms bonds with oxygen anions, which causes some properties, such as the Lewis acidity and the coordinative unsaturation of the latter, to be altered in a way that hinders catalysis. (181, 190) A similar argument has been used to explain the drop in activity observed when doping chromia/zirconia catalysts with sodium, although this effect has not been observed for alumina-based formulations.
An artists impression of a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is shown in Figure 20, while Table 4 offers an overview of the different CrOx catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, as discussed in the previous section. As was the case in Table 3, in Tables 49 the activity of the catalysts is compared using their specific activity, as calculated according to the definition accompanying each table. The use of TOF was precluded by the fact that in oxide-based catalysts there exists a wide array of active species (e.g., monomers, oligomers, polymers, and crystalline species) exhibiting different degrees of catalytic activity and accessibility (some of these species are in the bulk as opposed to on the surface), which makes the determination of the actual number of active sites impossible.
