[1] "Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933."
[2] "During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels."
[3] "Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied."

1.Since their discovery in 1933 by Frey and Huppke, chromium oxide-based catalysts have been a focus of extensive research. In the 1940s, these catalysts, specifically chromia supported on alumina, were utilized by UOP for the industrial dehydrogenation of butane to produce butene, which was then processed to create high-octane aviation fuels. The significant industrial importance of chromium oxide formulations has driven extensive studies on various aspects including their structure under different conditions, the nature of active sites, the role of support materials, the impact of alkali metal promoters, and the mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions.

1.自1933年Frey和Huppke首次报道Cr2O3的脱氢活性以来，基于铬氧化物的催化剂一直是研究最活跃的配方之一。20世纪40年代，UOP使用以氧化铝为载体的铬酸盐催化剂，工业上脱氢丁烷以生产丁烯，然后将其二聚化和氢化以形成高辛烷值的航空燃料。鉴于包含铬氧化物的配方的工业相关性，这些催化剂在不同反应条件下的结构，活性位点的性质，载体的作用，碱金属促进剂的影响以及这些催化剂上的脱氢反应机制都得到了深入研究。
