[1] "Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933."
[2] "During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels."
[3] "Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied."

1.Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have been extensively studied and applied industrially. In the 1940s, they were used by UOP to dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which was then processed into high-octane aviation fuels. The focus of research on these catalysts has included their structure under various reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support material, the effects of alkali metal promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction.

1.自1933年首次发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经得到了广泛的研究和工业应用。20世纪40年代，UOP使用这些催化剂将丁烷脱氢生成丁烯，然后进一步加工成高辛烷值的航空燃料。对这些催化剂的研究重点包括它们在不同反应条件下的结构、活性位点的性质、载体材料的作用、碱金属促进剂的影响以及脱氢反应的机制。
