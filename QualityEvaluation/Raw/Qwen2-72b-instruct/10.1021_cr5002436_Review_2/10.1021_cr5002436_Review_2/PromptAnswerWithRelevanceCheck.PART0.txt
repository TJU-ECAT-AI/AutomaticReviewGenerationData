[1] "Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933."
[2] "During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels."
[3] "Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied."

1.Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have been a focus of extensive research and development. In the 1940s, these catalysts were used industrially by UOP for the dehydrogenation of butane to produce butene, which was then processed into high-octane aviation fuels. The key areas of research have included understanding the structure of the catalysts under various reaction conditions, identifying the nature of the active sites, examining the role of support materials, studying the effects of alkali metal promoters, and elucidating the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction.
