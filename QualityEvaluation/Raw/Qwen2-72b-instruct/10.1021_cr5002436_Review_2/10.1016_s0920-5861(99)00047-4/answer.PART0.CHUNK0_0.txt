[1] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."
[2] "The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mclver [6], and by Kearby [7]."
[3] "Subsequently, numerous papers have been published in the literature on CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts [850]."
[4] "All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identification of the active sites; (b) influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selectivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism."

1.Since the discovery of supported chromium oxide catalysts by Frey and Huppke in the 1930s, these catalysts have been recognized for their superior properties in alkane dehydrogenation. Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts have become the commercial catalyst of choice. The main results concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s were summarized in review papers by Poole and Mclver, and by Kearby. Since then, numerous papers have been published on CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3, and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts. Newer studies primarily focus on identifying the active sites, the influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation and catalytic activity/selectivity, and elucidating the dehydrogenation mechanism.

1.自从Frey和Huppke在1930年代发现支撑铬氧化物催化剂以来，这些催化剂因其在烷烃脱氢中的优越性能而被广泛认可。Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂已成为商业催化剂的首选。关于Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂的主要结果直到1960年代末期在Poole和Mclver以及Kearby的综述论文中进行了总结。此后，关于CrOx/SiO2，CrOx/Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2催化剂的大量论文已经发表。新的研究主要集中在识别活性位点，制备和处理条件对铬氧化物物种化和催化活性/选择性的影响，以及阐明脱氢机制。
