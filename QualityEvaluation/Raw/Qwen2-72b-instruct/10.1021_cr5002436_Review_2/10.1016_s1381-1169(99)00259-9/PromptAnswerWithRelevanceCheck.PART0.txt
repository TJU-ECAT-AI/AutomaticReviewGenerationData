Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail the evolution of these catalysts. It focuses on the dehydrogenation of isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts, studying the relationship between catalyst activity and chromium speciation under various conditions such as reaction temperature, support composition, and gas composition. The key research areas highlighted include the use of in situ UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for monitoring chromium oxidation states and the application of experimental design to derive structure-activity relationships in heterogeneous catalysis.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览，也没有详细描述这些催化剂的演变。它专注于异丁烷在支撑铬氧化物催化剂上的脱氢，研究了在不同条件下，如反应温度、支撑材料组成和气体组成，催化剂活性与铬物种之间的关系。突出的关键研究领域包括使用原位UVVis漫反射光谱法监测铬的氧化态，以及应用实验设计来推导异相催化中的结构-活性关系。
