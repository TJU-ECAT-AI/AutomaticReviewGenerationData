1.The document does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail the evolution of these catalysts. However, it does mention that supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of several important commodity chemicals. Cr/SiO2 catalysts are known as the Phillips catalyst for the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butene. The industrial importance of chromium oxide catalysts has attracted a great deal of interest in industrial and academic research toward the elucidation of the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides. This subject has been recently reviewed by us and there is now a general consensus that different oxidation and coordination states of Cr (Crn+ with n = 2, 3, 5, and 6) can be present, which depend on the pretreatment, the Cr loading, and the support type and composition.

1.该文件没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览，也没有详细描述这些催化剂的演变。但是，它确实提到，支撑铬氧化物催化剂在化学工业中对于生产几种重要的商品化学品至关重要。Cr/SiO2催化剂作为菲利普斯催化剂用于生产高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）和线性低密度聚乙烯（LLDPE），Cr/Al2O3催化剂用于丁烷脱氢制丁烯。铬氧化物催化剂的工业重要性引起了工业和学术研究的极大兴趣，旨在阐明支撑铬氧化物的分子结构。这个主题最近由我们进行了综述，现在普遍认为，不同的氧化和配位状态的Cr（Crn+，n = 2, 3, 5, 6）可以存在，这取决于预处理，Cr负载和支撑类型和组成。
