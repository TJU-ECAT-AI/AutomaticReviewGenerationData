1.The document does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail the evolution of these catalysts. However, it does highlight the industrial importance of chromium oxide catalysts for the production of commodity chemicals, such as their use as the Phillips catalyst for the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), and their application in the dehydrogenation of butane to butene. The research focus areas mentioned include the elucidation of the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, which depends on factors such as pretreatment, chromium loading, and support type and composition. The document also discusses the use of Raman spectroscopy as a technique for studying the different oxidation and coordination states of chromium on various supports, which is crucial for understanding the active sites and reaction mechanisms in dehydrogenation processes.

1.该文件没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览，也没有详细描述这些催化剂的演变。然而，它确实强调了铬氧化物催化剂在生产商品化学品方面的工业重要性，例如，它们作为菲利普斯催化剂用于生产高密度聚乙烯(HDPE)和线性低密度聚乙烯(LLDPE)，以及在丁烷脱氢制丁烯中的应用。提及的研究重点领域包括阐明支撑铬氧化物的分子结构，这取决于预处理、铬负载量和支持物类型和组成等因素。该文件还讨论了拉曼光谱作为一种研究不同氧化和配位状态的铬在各种支持物上的技术，这对于理解脱氢过程中的活性位点和反应机制至关重要。
