1.The document does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail the evolution of these catalysts. However, it does mention that supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of several important commodity chemicals. Cr/SiO2 catalysts are known as the Phillips catalyst for the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butene. The industrial importance of chromium oxide catalysts has attracted a great deal of interest in industrial and academic research toward the elucidation of the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides.

1.该文件没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览，也没有详细描述这些催化剂的演变。然而，它确实提到，支撑的铬氧化物催化剂在化工行业中对于生产几种重要的商品化学品至关重要。Cr/SiO2催化剂作为菲利普斯催化剂，用于生产高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）和线性低密度聚乙烯（LLDPE），而Cr/Al2O3催化剂用于丁烷脱氢制丁烯。铬氧化物催化剂的工业重要性引起了工业界和学术界对支撑铬氧化物分子结构阐明的极大兴趣。
