1.The document does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does focus on the study of supported chromium oxide catalysts using in situ Raman spectroscopy under catalytic conditions. The research highlights the evolution of surface chromium oxide species on various oxide supports and their reactivity in methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation. The study contributes to the understanding of the structure and redox behavior of chromium oxide catalysts, which are crucial for their industrial applications in the production of commodity chemicals, such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) using Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the dehydrogenation of butane to butene using Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. The document emphasizes the importance of understanding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, which depends on the pretreatment, Cr loading, and support type and composition. The study also reveals that the redox behavior of supported chromium oxides is strongly dependent on the specific support ligand, and that the catalytic action of supported chromium oxide catalysts in redox reactions is determined by its reduction and reoxidation properties.

1.The document does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail the evolution of these catalysts. However, it does highlight the industrial importance of chromium oxide catalysts for the production of commodity chemicals, such as their use as the Phillips catalyst for the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), and their application in the dehydrogenation of butane to butene. The research focus areas mentioned include the elucidation of the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, which depends on factors such as pretreatment, chromium loading, and support type and composition. The document also discusses the use of Raman spectroscopy as a technique for studying the different oxidation and coordination states of chromium on various supports, which is crucial for understanding the active sites and reaction mechanisms in dehydrogenation processes.
