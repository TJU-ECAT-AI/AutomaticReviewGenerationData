Chromium oxide-based catalysts have played a pivotal role in the chemical industry since their discovery in 1933, particularly in dehydrogenation processes. Initially, these catalysts were recognized for their ability to facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons into more valuable products by removing hydrogen atoms. Over the decades, their industrial significance has grown exponentially, driven by advancements in their formulation and understanding of their catalytic properties. Research on chromium oxide catalysts has been multifaceted, encompassing the development of new synthesis methods, the exploration of their structure-activity relationships, and the optimization of their performance under various conditions. This has led to the creation of more efficient and selective catalysts, which are crucial for the production of chemicals such as ethylene and propylene, key components in the manufacturing of plastics and other materials. The ongoing research not only enhances the economic viability of dehydrogenation processes but also addresses environmental concerns by reducing byproducts and energy consumption.
