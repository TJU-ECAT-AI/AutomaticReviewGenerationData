1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that these catalysts have industrial applications in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the synthesis of butenes and butadiene from n-butane. The focus of the research is on the characterization of chromium oxide supported on alumina, examining the effects of chromium and potassium loading on the catalyst's activity in isobutane dehydrogenation. The study aims to understand the relationships between the activity in dehydrogenation of paraffins and the nature of chromium species in an industrial-like catalyst.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。但是，它确实提到这些催化剂在脱氢过程中具有工业应用，特别是在从正丁烷合成丁烯和丁二烯方面。研究的重点是表征支撑在氧化铝上的铬氧化物，考察铬和钾负载对催化剂在异丁烷脱氢中的活性的影响。该研究旨在理解在类似工业催化剂中，石蜡脱氢的活性与铬物种的性质之间的关系。
