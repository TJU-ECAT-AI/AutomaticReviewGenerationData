1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that these catalysts have industrial applications in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the synthesis of butenes and butadiene from n-butane, and in the synthesis of isobutene from isobutane for MTBE production. The research focus areas include the effects of chromium oxide loading, calcination temperature, and the nature of the support material on the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. The literature also discusses the role of alkali metal dopants, such as potassium, in promoting activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。但是，它确实提到这些催化剂在脱氢过程中具有工业应用，特别是在从正丁烷合成丁烯和丁二烯，以及从异丁烷合成异丁烯用于MTBE生产中。研究重点领域包括铬氧化物负载量、煅烧温度以及支撑材料的性质对催化剂活性和选择性的影响。文献还讨论了碱金属掺杂剂（如钾）在促进脱氢反应中的活性和选择性中的作用。
