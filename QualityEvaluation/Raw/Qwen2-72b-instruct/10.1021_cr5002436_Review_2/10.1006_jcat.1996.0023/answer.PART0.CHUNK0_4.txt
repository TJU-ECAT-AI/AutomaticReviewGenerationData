1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that these catalysts have industrial applications in dehydrogenation processes, specifically the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene. The research focus areas include the characterization of the catalysts using various techniques such as XPS, UVVisNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, XRD, and chemical analysis. The effects of preparation parameters like calcination temperature and chromium oxide loading on the nature of the chromium species are also investigated. The role of alkali metal dopants, such as potassium, in promoting activity and selectivity is another area of interest. The structure of the catalyst, including the support material and the active sites, is studied to understand the relationships between activity in dehydrogenation of paraffins and the chromium species present.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。然而，它确实提到这些催化剂在脱氢过程中有工业应用，特别是异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯。研究重点领域包括使用各种技术，如XPS、UVVisNIR漫反射光谱、XRD和化学分析，对催化剂进行表征。研究了制备参数，如煅烧温度和铬氧化物负载量，对铬物种性质的影响。碱金属助剂，如钾，促进活性和选择性的作用是另一个感兴趣的研究领域。催化剂的结构，包括支撑材料和活性位点，被研究以理解在脱氢过程中活性与存在的铬物种之间的关系。
