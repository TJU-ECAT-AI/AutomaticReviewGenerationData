1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that these catalysts have industrial applications in dehydrogenation processes, specifically the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene. The research focus areas include the characterization of the catalysts using various techniques such as XPS, UVVisNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, XRD, and chemical analysis. The effects of preparation parameters like calcination temperature and chromium oxide loading on the nature of the chromium species are also investigated. The role of alkali metal dopants, such as potassium, in promoting activity and selectivity is another area of interest. The structure of the support material, in this case, alumina, and its interaction with the chromium species are also critical to the catalytic performance.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。然而，它确实提到这些催化剂在脱氢过程中有工业应用，特别是异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯。研究重点领域包括使用各种技术，如XPS、UVVisNIR漫反射光谱、XRD和化学分析，对催化剂进行表征。制备参数如煅烧温度和铬氧化物负载量对铬物种性质的影响也是研究的重点。碱金属助剂，如钾，在促进活性和选择性方面的作用是另一个感兴趣的研究领域。支撑材料的结构，本例中为氧化铝，及其与铬物种的相互作用对催化性能也至关重要。
