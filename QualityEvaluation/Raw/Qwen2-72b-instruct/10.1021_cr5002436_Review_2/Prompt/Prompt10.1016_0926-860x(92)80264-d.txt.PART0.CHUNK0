Propane dehydrogenation on chromia/zirconia catalysts Sergio De Rossi*, Giovanni Ferraris, Silvia Fremiotti, Alessandro Cimino and Valerio Indovina Centro di Studio S.A.C.S.O.

(+39-6) 490631 (Received 6 August 1991) Abstract The activity of CrO,/ZrOa (ZC) catalysta (0.05 to 0.8% chromium by weight) in the dehydrogenation of propane at 723-823 K has been investigated in a flow apparatus.
The apparent activation energy is 70 f 10 kJ mol-. Samples were activated by heating with oxygen at 773 K followed,in most cases,by reduction to a controlled extent with carbon monoxide or hydrogen.
At T 2 773 K the catalyst prered- uction is not significant in determining both the initial rate and ita trend with time-on-stream,while at 723 K the catalyst prereduction affects these features.
The formation of coke leads to deactivation,which is slowed down by adding hydrogen or water to the reactants,while it is made faster by adding propene.
Activity and selectivity are completely restored by treating the catalyst with oxygen in flow at 773 K for 0.5 h. Zirconia displays a dehydrogenation activity at T 2 773 K, poisoned by small amounts of water.
The average turnover frequency (per total surface chromium atom) is nearly independent of the chromium content, indicating that the active centre is mononuclear.
After reduction with carbon monoxide, samples contain CP and Cr in nearly equal amounts.
A subsequent selective oxidation of Cr to Cr with water at 773 K hardly affects the activity, therefore suggesting that Crm species are active.
The detrimental effect of the potassium addition on the activity suggests that Oa- ions adjacent to Cr active species are involved in the dehydrogenation site.
Keywords: propane dehydrogenation,chromia/zirconia catalysts, zirconia support, chromium active species.
INTRODUCTION
The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has a considerable industrial importance because it represents a route to obtaining alkenes for polymeriza- tion and other organic syntheses from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydro- carbons. The activity and selectivity of chromia-supported catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation has been known for many decades [ 1,2]. Dehydrogenation thermodynamics require high temperature (typical range 773-373 K) to ob- tain convenient yields of alkenes, and therefore the choice of a proper support is of particular importance. Gamma-alumina is widely employed since it is a refractory high surface area material, but it presents the undesired feature of

The acidic sites responsible for the side reactions can be poisoned with alkali ions (very often potassium) with satisfactory results. The existence of this problem suggests the opportunity of investigating other supports with dif- ferent acid-base properties; in this respect, zirconia possesses interesting fea- tures, as for instance, the presence of weakly acidic and basic sites [3] and sufficient resistance to thermal sintering when chromium is present [4,5 1. In- deed, zirconia has recently received increasing attention in connection with its possible use as a catalyst support [
61. Moreover, Hino and Arata [ 71 report
that chromia on zirconia displays higher activity in the dehydrocyclization of hexane in comparison with chromium on other supports.
In our laboratory the preparation and characterization of the CrO,/ZrOz system has been investigated for some years. In particular, the chemical and textural properties of the solid and the stability of the different chromium species on its surface have been studied by various techniques, including dif- ferential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD ) , electron spin res- onance (ESR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS ), infrared spectros- copy (IR), and gas volumetric redox cycles [ 5,8-101. The catalytic properties of low-temperature reactions, namely Hz-D2 equilibration and propene hydro- genation, have also been examined [ 11,121. The activity for both reactions was related to coordinatively unsaturated Cr species.With this background, a study of propane dehydrogenation has been under- taken with the aim of investigating: (i) the parameters influencing the activity and the deactivation, (ii) the regeneration of the deactivated catalyst, and (iii) the nature of the active sites.The present paper deals with the results concerning catalysts with low chro- mium loading (up to 0.8 wt.%, corresponding to a surface concentration of 1.8 a&, nm -2) in which all chromium ions are actually accessible to the reactant.Cr0,/Zr02 catalysts with higher chromium content, close to that of the indus- trial chromia/alumina catalysts, are under investigation.
EXPERIMENTAL
Apparatus The activity was measured in a flow apparatus at atmospheric pressure. The equipment has previously been described in detail [ 121. In essence, it is com- posed of two sections. The first is an all-glass vacuum line, with a circulation loop of volume 0.15 1, equipped with an MKS Baratron pressure transducer (sensitivity 1 N mm2) and a magnetically driven recirculation pump (flow- rate=0.8 1 min-) for catalyst conditioning and adsorption measurements.The second part is a flow section for catalytic runs. The catalyst (usually 0.5 g) in the form of powder of about 0.1 mm average diameter was placed on a 115 fritted disk sealed inside a silica reactor which could be connected to the vac- uum line or to the flow section by means of a four-way valve. The reactor temperature was controlled within +- 1 K by a commercial device.The analysis of reactants and products was carried out with a gas chroma- tograph (C. Erba GC 6006 Vega series 2) with a column (2 m in length, 4 mm internal diameter) filled with silica gel 60-80 mesh and employing nitrogen as carrier gas. A temperature program from 343 to 403 K and a flame ionization (FID ) detector in series to a hot wire (HWD ) detector were used. The system allowed the separation of hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethene, propane and pro- pene, in this order. The areas of the gas chromatographic peaks were evaluated by an integrator (Spectra Physics mod. SP4290).Catalysts supports Zirconia was prepared by hydrolysis of zirconium oxychloride, dried at 383 K and used as such or calcined in air for 5 h at 773 K or 923 K [5]. The materials are indicated as ZrOz ( T), where 2 specifies the temperature (K) of the treatment in air. A potassium containing support (0.5% K by weight) was obtained by contacting a portion of Zr0,(773) with a solution of KNO, and KOH at pH = 9. After stirring for 72 h, the sample was filtered and dried at 383 K for 5 h. The sample is designated as ZrOzK0.5 (773). cro.Jzro, Chromia/zirconia catalysts (ZC ) were prepared by equilibrium adsorption of CrV species, a method illustrated in detail elsewhere [ 51. To obtain the samples used in the present study the support ZrOz (773) or ZrOz (923) was contacted with a chromic acid solution of suitable concentration at a given pH (usually 1 by HN03 addition, 8 in one case by KOH addition) under stirring for 72 h and then filtered and dried at 383 K. The CrO,/ZrO,samples are designated as ZCx (2)) where x specifies the chromium content (wt.-% ) and 2 the calcination temperature (K) of the support used.CrO,K,O/ZrO, Specimens containing both chromium and potassium were prepared follow- ing different ways: (a) ZrOz (773) was added to a solution, containing suitable amounts of K2C!r04 and KNOB, whose pH was adjusted to 9 with KOH. After stirring the suspension for 72 h the solid was filtered and dried at 383 K; (b) ZrO, (773 ) was stirred for 72 h with a chromic acid solution at pH = 1, filtered and dried at 383 K for 5 h. The ZC sample so obtained was calcined at 773 K in air for 5 h, then suspended and stirred for 72 h in a solution (pH =9 by KOH addition) containing a suitable amount of KN03 and finally filtered and dried at 383 K. The CrO,,KzO/ZrOz specimens are indicated as ZCKz,y(T), where x 116

All catalysts investigated with some of their features are listed in Table 1.
Surface area Measurements of surface area were carried out in the same apparatus em- ployed for the activity measurements with a standard volumetric BET method using nitrogen as adsorbate at 77 K.
Gases Hydrogen (99.999% ), propane (99.8)) nitrogen (99.998)) carbon monoxide (99.995) and oxygen (99.995) were purchased from S.O.L. Propene (99.5) and helium (UHP) were obtained from Matheson. Reacting gases (hydrogen, pro- pane and propene) were passed through commercial purifiers (Matheson model 6406). Carbon monoxide for catalyst prereduction in circulation was liquefied at 77 K, distilled, and the middle fraction was used. Oxygen was dried over magnesium perchlorate.
Procedure Before reaction the catalysts were subjected to a standard oxidation (8.0. ) in a flow of dry oxygen at 773 K for 0.5 h. This conditioning allowed starting the 117 catalysis experiments with a clean surface where chromium had an average oxidation state, fi, of about 5.5 [5,8]. Then the catalyst could be prereduced or not before the catalytic run. Prereductions were carried out in circulation with carbon monoxide or hydrogen at 423-623 K for 0.5 h after outgassing at 383 K for 0.5 h, or in a flow of hydrogen at 623-773 K after 10 min purging with nitrogen at 773 K. When prereduction was performed in circulation the amount of reducing agent (carbon monoxide or hydrogen) consumed and the amount of the oxidation product released (carbon dioxide or water ) after outgassing at 723 K were measured. In the prereductions with carbon monoxide, the amount of carbon dioxide released at 723 K is 10 to 15% less than the amount of carbon monoxide consumed at 623 K. In the prereductions with hydrogen the water release at 723 K is only 50% of the hydrogen consumed at 623 K, the other 50% remaining adsorbed on the surface. The extent of reduction (e/Cr=electrons per chromium atom) could be determined as previously il- lustrated [5,8,12] in detail. In carbon monoxide prereductions e/Cr determi- nations could be based either on carbon monoxide consumed or on carbon dioxide released, while in hydrogen prereductions e/Cr calculations could only be based on the hydrogen consumed, due to the large amount of water retained by the surface. Unless otherwise specified the reported e/Cr values were cal- culated from the amount of reducing agent consumed (carbon monoxide or hydrogen). Before starting the catalysis experiments, samples were always conditioned at the reaction temperature with flowing nitrogen for about 10 min.
Most of the dehydrogenation experiments were carried out with a reactant mixture containing 5% molar propane in nitrogen with total flow-rate of 20-200 ml min-. When studying the influence of the various reacting species on propane dehydrogenation and on propene hydrogenation the feed compo- sition was suitably changed.
Rates were evaluated as propene molecules leaving the reactor per second from experiments in which conversion did not exceed 50% of the equilibrium value. These rates represent average values along the catalyst bed. However,in the worst condition (50% of the equilibrium value), assuming first order reaction, the rate is underestimated by about 30% with respect to the rate at near-zero conversion. This maximum discrepancy is not significant when look- ing at large effects. In some cases, as for instance in experiments devoted to the determination of kinetic parameters, rates were measured at low conver- sion (not exceeding 10% ) .
The absence of limitations on the reaction rates by mass transfer phenom- ena was preliminarily checked. The lack of influence of the external diffusion was established by changing the total flow-rate in order to vary the thickness of the gaseous film around the catalyst particle. Assuming a first order reac- tion, the calculated kinetic constant was found to be independent of flow-rate.Concerning the diffusion into the pore structure of the catalyst (prevailingly 118 mesoporous: pore volume = 0.11-0.14 ml g-l and average pore radius = 3-9 nm [ 5 ] ) , the dimensionless parameter !E= $#, where q is the effectiveness factor and qJ is the Thiele modulus, has been determined for ZC0.8 (773) at 823 K.The calculation yielded y/=0.041. By entering Yinto operational graphs [ 131,an q value= 1 was derived, thereby pointing to a negligible limiting effect of internal diffusion. It is concluded that in our conditions the reaction takes place under a true chemical regime.Usually the reaction was followed for 3 to 5 h with a first analysis at 5 min from the start and then about every 15 min. Since the reaction rate varies with time-on-stream (r) and different trends were observed depending on catalyst conditioning, activities will be referred to the initial rates ro, obtained by ex- trapolation to r= 0, as specified under Results.Pulse experiments were also carried out. A glass sample loop of volume 1.7 ml, connected by a four-way stopcock to the vacuum line, was filled with pro- pane at room temperature and the pressure (about 3 kN m-) was measured.By means of another four-way stopcock the sampled hydrocarbon could be withdrawn by the nitrogen carrier of the gas chromatograph (flow-rate = 42 ml min-l), passed through the catalyst, and then transferred into the chromato- graphic column. An interval of 15 min (the analysis time) between pulses was usually adopted.
RESULTS
The influence of the pretreatment The rate of propane dehydrogenation, r, at 723 K, on a catalyst submitted to various pretreatments, is reported in Fig. 1 as a function of the time-on- stream r. The data refer to ZC0.8 (773) and are representative of the behaviour observed on all ZC catalysts. Before testing the catalytic activity, the
ZC0.8 (773) sample was in all cases submitted to the S.O.
treatment and there- after either exposed directly to the reactant (not prereduced catalyst) or pre- reduced with carbon monoxide or hydrogen to various extents (e/Cr ), as spec- ified in Fig. 1. An inspection of the data shows that (i) when prereduced with CO (e/Cr = 1.9 to 3.0 -t 0.1)) the sample is more active than when prereduction is omitted or performed with hydrogen and (ii) the same activity is measured on both the non-prereduced sample and the sample prereduced with hydrogen.
As regards the variation of the catalytic activity with r, two different trends can be discerned depending on the pretreatment adopted. Trend A: the activity is at its maximum at the beginning of the experiment and progressively decays thereafter as observed on the sample prereduced with carbon monoxide at e/Cr = 3.0 (1st cycle) or 2.8 (9th cycle). Trend B: the activity increases during the first 50 min on stream and then progressively decays, as observed on (i) the non-prereduced sample, (ii) the hydrogen prereduced sample and (iii) the 119 0 60 120 time on stream I min 160 Fig. 1.

Re- gardless of the pretreatment adopted, when the reaction is carried out at higher temperature (773 K or above) the initial increase of activity is absent and the same activity is measured on the non-prereduced samples and on samples prer- educed with either carbon monoxide or hydrogen.
Conversion and selectivity The conversion and selectivity aspects will now be considered. Fig. 2 illus- trates the behaviour of the catalyst ZC0.4 (923) prereduced with carbon mon- oxide at 623 K. Conversions and selectivity to propene are calculated with respect to the sum of C, to C3 hydrocarbons. The sum is always a large fraction ( 2 95% ) of the propane at the inlet of the reactor but it does not exactly match the propane itself because of the formation of products which escape the GC analysis. On the whole, selectivity increases with r from 85 to 98% after 100 min and the corresponding conversion to propene decreases.from 54 to 19% after the same amount of time. The amount of coke formed during the reaction at 823 K was measured in separate experiments of different duration (5,20 and 200 min ), in which the ZC0.4 (923) catalyst showed the usual activity and selectivity. The amount of carbon deposited at the end of each experiment,determined from the molecules of carbon dioxide obtained after heating with oxygen at 773 K for 0.5 h, was 1.6,7.2 and 25*101 carbon atoms, respectively.From these values, average coking rates of 6*101 carbon atoms s-l (in the interval 0 to 20 min) and 1.6*10 carbon atom s- (in the interval 20 to 200 min) were calculated. Considering that the flow of the reactant propane is 1 c (r::c:40 60 120 time on stream I min Fig. 2. Conversion and selectivity.

Within the experimental error, the latter values account for all products which escape GC analysis. Other products, if present, are at very low concentration ( I 1% ).
The deactivation and reversibility of ZC catalysts During the reaction at 673 to 823 K, all ZC catalysts undergo a deactivation process, as illustrated above for the ZCO.8 (773) catalyst (Fig. 1) at 723 K and
ZCO.4(923) (Fig. 2) at 823 K. For experiments showing the trend A, rates
measured during the first 60 min on stream are well fitted by the deactivation expression In r = In r. - az, in which a! is a deactivation coefficient and r. is the rate at r= 0. The points at the higher time-on-stream can equally be fitted with the above expression but with a lower slope ((Y ). As regards the experi- ments showing the trend B (maximum activity after about 50 min on stream),the fitting of the experimental points was restricted to the region where the activity is decreasing. Because of the lower slope in this region, the r. values,calculated from B type trends, are underestimated by about 25%.The catalytic activity can be entirely restored by means of the 8.0. treatment after the slow deactivation occurring during prolonged time-on-stream. In par- ticular, on all ZC catalysts, a complete recovery of activity was observed after performing several cycles consisting of (i ) 9.0. treatment (ii) prereduction with carbon monoxide or hydrogen (omitted in some cases), (iii) dehydrogenation reaction at 723 to 773 K. An example showing the complete reversibility of the 121 ZC system is found in Fig. 1, where the ninth catalytic experiment of the se- quence shows the same activity as that measured in the first. Surface areas measured at the end of a sequence of catalytic experiments were unchanged with respect to those measured on the as prepared catalysts. The extent of reduction, measured with carbon monoxide at 623 K (e/C&3.0) on the S.O. samples, was also nearly unaffected through the series of the above-mentioned cycles. The temperature of the catalytic experiments should not exceed that of the initial support thermal treatment in order to show full restoration of activ- ity after a cycle. Thus, when a dehydrogenation experiment at 823 K was car- ried out on samples of the ZC (773) series only a partial recovery of the cata- lytic activity (70%), a substantially lower value of e/Cr (1.8 instead of 3.0) and lower surface area were observed in subsequent experiments after the S.O. treatment. In contrast, samples ZC(923), when used for the dehydrogenation up to 823 K, completely recover the catalytic activity and maintain reducibility (e/Cr) and surface area. Accordingly, experiments at 823 K were generally carried out on samples ZC (923).The catalytic activity of samples heated in water vapour at 773 K The catalytic activity of carbon monoxide prereduced samples, in which Cr was selectively oxidized to Cr by a subsequent treatment with water at 773 K [8,9,14,15 I, was investigated by means of pulse experiments on the
ZC0.8 (773) catalyst. After the 8.0.
treatment, the catalyst was prereduced with carbon monoxide at 623 K (e/Cr = 3.0) before injecting several pulses of pro- pane (p=3 kN m-) at intervals of 15 min, in sequence. After a second s.o.,the sample was once again reduced with carbon monoxide (e/Cr = 3.0) and then heated in a water atmosphere at 773 K for 1 h (pn20 = 3 kN m -2) before injecting pulses of propane, as above. In order to avoid restoring Cr from reduction of Cr with propane, the dimension of the propane pulses (1.1. 1018 molecules) was kept very small compared to the total chromium content in the sample (47. 1018 atoms). The results show that rates measured at 773 K are nearly the same in the two cases, indicating that heating with water at high temperature does not affect (or affects very little) the activity of the catalyst (Fig. 3). The material balance in the two experiments (with or without the water treatment) shows that after each pulse, 65% of the introduced propane is recovered as a mixture of unreacted propane, propene and ethane from the carbon monoxide-reduced sample, and 85% from the sample further reacted with water at 773 K.Rates at 773 K measured from pulse and flow experiments on the ZC0.8 ( 773 ) catalyst are 6.0*1017 and 9.9*1017 molecules s-l, respectively. However, when rates are normalized with respect to the pressure of propane (nearly first order,vide infra), the two resulting values are found to be in good agreement (pro- pane pressure 3 and 5 kN mm2 in pulse and flow experiments, respectively). 122 100

The activity of the zirconia support The zirconia support exhibits some activity for the dehydrogenation of pro- pane at or above 773 K. Rates from flow experiments at various temperatures have been measured on the ZrOz (773) sample that was pretreated differently,and a few selected examples are reported in Fig. 4. On the whole, a strong increase of activity at 773 K is apparent upon increasing the outgassing tem- 123 perature from 723 to 873 K. The beneficial effect of cleaning the surface at high temperature is also confirmed by the gradual increase of activity observed when the dehydrogenation experiment is carried out at 773 K on a sample previously evacuated at lower temperature (723 K). This behaviour strongly suggests an important role of the surface hydration and accordingly the cata- lytic activity was tested in specific experiments in which water was pread- sorbed on zirconia, as illustrated below.
First, the reaction was carried out at 723 K for 120-160 min on ZrOz (773) previously outgassed at 723 K (Fig. 5a) or 873 K (Fig. 5b). Subsequently, the catalyst, rapidly evacuated at the reaction temperature, was placed in contact with an amount of outgassed water corresponding to about 2% of the mono- layer. Next, the reactant flow was reestablished over the catalyst and the re- action rate was measured. Finally, after about 1 h on stream, the temperature was increased from 723 to 773 K and the same procedure was repeated. At both reaction temperatures (723 and 773 K), a drop of activity is observed after water adsorption (indicated by an arrow in Fig. 5a,b). The drop is substantially larger on the zirconia evacuated at 873 K. When a similar experiment is per- formed at 773 K on the ZCO.05 (773) sample, a similar drop of activity is ob- served after the addition of water. With this catalyst, however, the residual activity after exposure to water is definitely higher as compared to that mea- sured at 773 K on the analogously treated zirconia sample (50 1016 and 1. 1016 molecules s-l, respectively). No drop of activity is observed after the water time on stream/min Fig. 5. Effect of water adsorption on the catalytic activity of ZrOz and ZC (0.5 g) .

The dependence of activity on the chromium content A nearly-linear increase of catalytic activity with increasing chromium con- centration is observed. The results at two temperatures (723 and 773 K) are shown in Fig. 6, where the specific initial rates (C,H, molecules s-l mV2) are reported as a function of the surface concentration of chromium (Cr atoms nmm2). The line corresponding to the experiments at 773 K does not pass through the origin since a contribution to the activity of the most dilute ZC samples is given from the zirconia support at this temperature.
The apparent activation energy, E,, has been found to be nearly independent of the chromium content. Specifically, a value of E, = 70 ? 10 kJ mol-1 has been calculated from Arrhenius plots of samples ZCO.3(773), ZCO.3( 773) pH=&ZCO.8(773) and ZCO.4(923).
The influence of potassium addition Potassium-containing samples ZCK are definitely less active compared to ZC samples of similar chromium content (Fig. 7). The data also show that the
ZC0.3 (
773 )pH = 8 catalyst has nearly the same catalytic activity as ZC0.3 ( 773).
Therefore, the lower activity of the potassium-containing samples can not be ascribed to the different preparation pH (pH=9).
An analogous decrease of activity upon addition of potassium is also observed for the pure support, as shown from the comparison between the ZrO,K0.5(773)11 catalyst (practi- cally inactive) and pure zirconia.

Influence of the composition of the reactants Hydrogen, water or propene were individually added to the reactant mixture to study their influence on the reaction rate and deactivation coefficients (a).
As regards hydrogen, the relevant results are presented in Fig. 8a for ZC0.8 ( 773 ) at 723 and 773 K. At each temperature, the addition of hydrogen (i) reduces the initial activity and (ii) slows down the deactivation process. The influence of the addition of water to the reactant mixture was studied on ZC0.8 (773) at 773 K and 823 K, and an effect similar to that of hydrogen was found. The reaction was carried out with the feed gases saturated with outgassed water (Fig. 8b, solid squares). Both dehydrogenation and deactivation rates are lower in comparison with those measured in a separate experiment with a dry feed (Fig. 8b, open circles). When water is no longer added to the reactants (Fig. 8b, open squares), both the dehydrogenation and deactivation processes be- come faster. The addition of propene leads to a faster deactivation (Fig. 8c,solid circles), in contrast to the effect of hydrogen or water. Neither hydrogen nor water treatments up to 823 K were effective in the regeneration of a spent catalyst. The only way to regenerate a spent catalyst was by flowing oxygen at
773 K.
Concerning the kinetics of the reaction, it is known that the reaction takes place with a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and a Hougen and Watson- type rate expression should be adopted [ 161. A quantitative assessment of the influence of the pressures of the reactants on the rate can more simply be obtained through an empirical power-law expression:r= -&jP&I&,- pE,n,%-I,Pk,126 100

The values of the exponents a, c, p and y were determined from In r vs. In p plots for ZCO.8 (773) at 723 K (Fig. 9) and 773 K, and for ZC0.25 (923) at 723
K. The main results are summarized in Table 2. The assumption that the above
reported rate equation still holds at equilibrium introduces a constraint termed thermodynamic consistency of the kinetic equation [ 171. This implies: Cy-a=- n, fl- b = n and y - c = n, were l/n = CT is the stoichiometric number of the reaction [ 181. .The n values (from y-c) and the corresponding stoichiometric numbers are also reported in Table 2. The figures suggest o= 1, as found previously for the dehydrogenation of butane [ 19-211.
DISCUSSION
Extent of reduction and surface hydration The catalytic activity of ZC catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane at T 2 773 K is little affected by the reduction procedure adopted before catalytic runs. The result shows that the reactant stream (propane) is, at these tem- peratures, as effective in the sample reduction as either hydrogen or carbon monoxide at 623 K. However, when the reaction is carried out at lower tem- perature (
T=
723 K), activity trends A or B are observed depending on the prereduction mode. One is then led to focus attention on the product of the reduction process ( CO2 from CO, H,O from Hz, CO2 and Hz0 from propane) as being responsible for the different behaviour: activity trends A or B at lower temperature, and absence of trend B at higher temperature. In the present and in previous studies from our group [ 5,121 it has been found that, while a large fraction (85-90%) of the carbon dioxide arising from reduction with carbon monoxide is desorbed at 723 K, only 50% of the water produced in the reduc- tion with hydrogen is desorbed at 723 K. Therefore we attribute the activity trend B to the slow elimination of water during time-on-stream. Trend B is not observed at and above 773 K due a fast desorption of water. The decrease 128 of activity observed when water is added to the reactants (Fig. 8a) agrees with the above explanation.Chromium species active in the reaction, however, are not sites on which water is preferentially adsorbed. It is likely that the support acts as a sink for the water adsorbed on chromium containing sites. This is suggested by exper- iments where the activity is measured after adsorption of a small quantity of water (about 2% of the monolayer, at 723 or 773 K) on ZrOz, ZCO.05 (773) and
ZC0.3 (773). The activity of the three samples is almost suppressed, substan-
tially reduced, and practically unaffected, respectively. It is therefore con- cluded that water is bonded to sites adjacent to active chromium species only when water is present in a large amount (reduction with hydrogen or propane,continuous flow of damp reactants), otherwise water is adsorbed on sites of the support whose activity is consequently suppressed.
The activity of zirconiu Previous studies from our and other laboratories [12,22] showed that the activity of zirconia for low-temperature alkene hydrogenation substantially increases with increasing outgassing temperature, a feature common to other oxides as, for instance, ZnO [
231. A similar behaviour has now been found for
propane dehydrogenation at 723-823 K. This fact, taken together with the strong poisoning effect observed upon addition of small amounts of water, sug- gests that the activity of zirconia is due to coordinatively unsaturated zirco- nium ions which are formed at low concentration upon surface dehydration.
Deactivation of ZC catalysts Coke formation is the main cause of loss of activity during dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [ 24,251. The amount of coke formed on ZC0.4 (923) at 823 K reaches the value of about one carbon atom per chromium atom in 5 min and is about 11 carbon atoms per chromium atom at z= 200 min. After 5 min, the conversion to propene is nearly at its maximum value and after 200 min it is still one fourth of the initial conversion, thus showing that a large fraction of the active chromium is free of carbonaceous deposit. This suggests that coke grows at a high rate and the coking process also involves support sites, as in- dicated by the similar deactivation behaviour of pure zirconia.The influence of the reactant composition is now briefly considered. The addition of hydrogen to the reactants has a negative effect on the catalytic activity, reflected by the negative order, c, found for the forward reaction (de- hydrogenation). In terms of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism this means that there is competition between propane and hydrogen for the same site. The other effect of hydrogen is to slow down the deactivation as previous studies [ 24,26,27 ] have also noted. Water also reduces the deactivation rate, probably 129 with a mechanism similar to that of hydrogen. In fact, a substantially larger amount of methane is formed when water is present in the feed. Since methane is likely produced by hydrogenation of carbon-containing species strongly held on the surface and that are precursors of coke, water would act as a source of hydrogen with the result of delaying the formation of well-structured coke,removable only by an oxidizing treatment at sufficiently high temperature
(773 K).
Coming to the effect of propene, whose presence makes the deactivation faster, it is likely that the alkene or surface species originating from it are the precursors of coke, as suggested by Kiinig and TQtenyi in their study of ethane dehydrogenation on unsupported Cr,O, [ 26,271.Requirements of the active chromium sites The nudearity of chromium species As shown in Fig. 6, a linear variation of the specific initial rate of propane dehydrogenation with the chromium surface concentration is observed. The activity of the support is not negligible in chromium-diluted samples, but it can be subtracted in order to obtain the activity due to chromium species. It is then possible to calculate an average turnover frequency per chromium atom, N (C3H6 molecules produced per second and per total chromium atom) for different catalysts, i.e., for different surface chromium concentration. The N values at 723 K and 773 K are reported in Fig. 10 for the various catalysts subjected to different pretreatments. As expected from the linear correlation shown in Fig. 6, essentially constant N values are calculated at each reaction temperature over the whole chromium concentration range, namely 1.12 0.3 and 2.3 5 0.3-10-2 molecules s-l a6: at 723 K and 773 K, respectively.

%rf / atom me2 Fig. 10. Average turnover frequency per Cr atom, N, at 723 K (0 ) and 773 K (Cl ) vs. surface concentration of chromium. 130 assumption that chromium is randomly distributed on the zirconia support,the constancy of Nsuggests that special configurations of the active sites, such as pairs in Cr-0-Cr arrangements, are unnecessary since an increase of N with chromium concentration would otherwise be expected. However, the presence of pairs or higher polynuclear chromium species should not be detrimental,otherwise a decrease of N at high chromium loading would be expected. More- over, the result conforms to previous findings [5,8,9 ] that no clustering of chromium occurs up to 1.8 chromium atom nm-, i.e., the maximum surface concentration attainable on ZrOp (773) with the equilibrium adsorption procedure.
A constancy of N for the dehydrogenation of ethane at 768 K on Cr0,/Si02 catalysts has been obtained by Lugo and Lunsford [ 151, but in a narrower concentration range (up to 0.24 chromium atom nmm2). In a different context,the problem of the complexity of the site has been investigated by Bileon et al. [ 281 for the dehydrogenation of propane at 633-663 K on Pt-Au alloys, coming to the conclusion that single platinum atoms are active for the reaction.The active oxidation state of chromium This problem has been investigated by Lugo and Lunsford on Cr0,/Si02 [ 151 and by Slovetskaya and Rubinshtein [ 141, Van Reijen et al. [ 291 and Ashmawy [30] on CrOJy-A1203.They favour the view that CJ species are responsible for the activity of the above systems in alkane dehydrogenation.Other authors [26,27,31,32], however, suggest that Cr species are active. The results of Fig. 3 with pulses of propane lead us to conclude that in the CrOJ Zr02 system the dehydrogenation activity is related to Cr species. In fact,the catalyst after S.O. contains nearly the same amounts of Cr and Cr (fi= 5.5)) while after prereduction with carbon monoxide at 623 K (e/Cr N
3.0)
the average oxidation state of chromium fi is 5.5-3.0 N
2.5, i.e. about 50% CJ
and 50% Cr [ 5,8,10]. After exposure to water at 773 K for 1 h, Cr is oxidized to Cr, on evidence from IR [ 91 and ESR [
81. Since exposure to water deter-
mines only a small decrease of catalytic activity, and the fraction of Cr which might be reduced by the propane is negligible due to the small size of the pulse,a role played by Cr can be ruled out. The Cr species (ESR /&signal, assigned to chromia-like particles [8,10] ) coming from the Cr oxidation differ from those formed upon reduction with carbon monoxide of the 8.0. catalyst (dis- persed Cr species with two coordinative vacancies, on IR evidence [lo] ). The Cr"' p-species may be either inactive or have a substantially lower activity for the reaction, as found previously for the hydrogenation of propene on the CrOJ ZrO, system [
121. The small decrease of activity observed after reaction with
water at 773 K can be accounted for by considering that the coordinative un- saturation requirements of a small fraction of active sites could be lost upon water adsorption. A decreasing of coordinative unsaturations of some chro- 131 mium sites is in fact suggested by the material balance showing a reduced ad- sorption capacity of the samples reacted with water before pulse-experiments.
The role of the support The support can act in an indirect way by stabilizing different oxidation states and different coordinative unsaturation of the chromium species. More- over, the support can directly participate in the active site through the oxygen ions bonded to both chromium and support cations. One argument in favour of the participation of these oxygen ions comes from the negative effect of potassium addition on the catalytic activity of the CrO,/ZrOz system. In fact,potassium is very likely bonded to 02- ions, whose properties (for instance, Lewis basicity and coordinative unsaturation) are therefore changed. Oxygen near chromium in the active site can be involved in the dissociative adsorption of propane as well as in the hydrogen desorption.
CONCLUSIONS
The CrO,/ZrOo system is active and selective in the dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propene at 723-823 K. The surface composition of the catalyst (nature of chromium species) and therefore its catalytic activity are mainly controlled by the reaction atmosphere. The mode of catalyst prereduction is not impor- tant at the high temperature of propane dehydrogenation. Some deactivation of the catalyst (more marked at higher temperature) occurs during time-on- stream due to the formation of coke. The activity and selectivity of the catalyst,however, are completely recovered by treatment with oxygen at 773 K, pro- vided that the reaction temperature does not exceed the temperature at which the support was precalcined.
The active centres are mononuclear Cr species. Surface 02- ions adjacent to the Cr active species are most probably involved in the dehydrogenation site.
