a b s t r a  c  t The  reactivity of isobutane dehydrogenation over  a  series of  non-ordered mesoporous chromia/alumina (Cr2O3/Al2O3) catalysts with large  specific surface area  (149.4381.6 m2 g1)  and  high  pore  volume (0.771.24 cm3 g1),synthesized using a metal-organic framework MIL-101  as  a  molecular host  and chromium precursor,aluminium isopropoxide (Al(i-OC3H7)3)  as  the  aluminium precursor,were  stud- ied in  detail.
The  chromium species  were  highly dispersed over the  catalyst with chromia loading  up  to 10 wt.%.  The specific surface  area of  the  catalyst decreased,whereas the  amount  of surface Cr3+ species and the  mole  ratio  of Cr3+ and  Cr6+ species (Cr3+/Cr6+)  increased with  the  increasing chromia loadings (525 wt.%) and  calcination temperature (500900 C),  respectively.
The  addition of potassium to the  cat- alyst system  greatly promoted isobutene selectivity and  catalyst  stability.
The  catalyst with
1.5  wt.% K2O
and 10 wt.%  Cr2O3 loadings calcined  at  800 C was  found  to  exhibit the  highest isobutane conversion
60.1%
with the  isobutene selectivity up  to 93.2%  among  all  the  catalysts.
The  maintainable catalytic reactivity demonstrated the  high  stability of  the  catalyst in  ten  dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.  Moreover,it was proposed that the  Cr3+ species was  mainly the active  site  and  catalytic selectivity was  depended on the surface  Cr3+/Cr6+ value over  the  catalyst.
The  catalyst presented much  more stable dehydrogena- tion activity compared with  the  conventional catalyst.
Consequently,this  study  presents a  feasible way to facile synthesis of  the  mesoporous MOF-derived Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts with  high  stability and  good catalytic reactivity over  isobutane dehydrogenation. 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction Catalytic
dehydrogenation
of
isobutane
over
the
chro- mia/alumina (Cr2O3/Al2O3) catalyst is an industrially important route for producing isobutene,a vital component for the synthesis of
MTBE
(methyl tert-butyl ether) and
ETBE
(ethyl tert-butyl ether),which are increasingly demanded as octane number boosters for unleaded gasoline in the worldwide recently [16].
Dehydrogena- tion is typically performed at relatively high temperatures and low pressures due to thermodynamic requirements.
However,reaction conditions,such as high temperature,usually facilitate the thermal cracking and coke formation,thus result in reduced isobutane conversion,decreased isobutene selectivity and severe deactivation of the catalyst [79].
It is therefore the key issue to develop catalyst with the ability of possessing high and stable Corresponding author at: State Key Laboratory for Oxo Synthesis and Selec- tive Oxidation, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000,

Supported Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been applied for the isobu- tane dehydrogenation on a commercial scale for years [10].
Currently,this catalyst system occupies more than half of the world market of the commercial catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation [11].
It is well known that the nature of surface chromia is related to the catalytic activity and selectivity.
The speciation of surface chromia is strongly depended on the type of the support,the chromium content and calcination treatment [1,2,1215].
De Rossi et al. reported that Cr6+ species with minor amount of Cr5+ species were produced on -Al2O3 and silica carriers,whereas Cr6+ and Cr5+ species in comparable amounts on the zirconia support [13].
Cavani et al. observed that the relative concentration of surface Cr3+ and Cr6+ species increased with the increasing chromia loading.
They also found that only Cr3+ species were produced over the surface of the reduced catalyst [2].  Besides,the researchers have been devoted to improving the catalytic dehydrogenation activity and selectivity as well as the catalyst stability.
It has been reported that the addi- tion of alkali metal,such as potassium,to the oxide catalyst system usually promotes the catalytic selectivity of olefins and improves

General 456 (2013) 188 196 189 the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation [2,6,1622].  Many preparation methods for the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts described in the literatures,such as incipient wetness impregnation,atomic layer epitaxy
(ALE),
co-precipitation method and evaporation-induced self-assembly
(EISA)
strategy,have been explored over the alkanes dehydrogenation [2,7,15,23,24].
However,the utilization of the method that the precursor containing aluminium source impreg- nated into the Cr-based framework to prepare the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst for isobutane dehydrogenation has been paid little atten- tion so far.
The similar reports for this method were employed to prepare the nickel catalysts in the reaction of methane decomposi- tion [2527].  This method may be contributable to a high dispersion of chromium species over the support.

BDC
= 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) is one of the porous Cr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).
It has a large BrunauerEmmettTeller
(BET)
specific surface area about 4100 m2 g1 and high pore volume about
2.0
cm3 g1 [2831].  Its two large mesopores with
2.9
and
3.4
nm pore diameters together with its considerable chromium content (21.7%) stimulate us to prepare the mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst using it as a molecular flask and chromium precursor [3235].  In the current work,the mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst with large specific surface area and high pore volume was synthesized by utilizing the
MIL-101
framework as a molecular host and chromium precursor,aluminium isopropoxide (Al(i-OC3H7)3) as the aluminium precur- sor.
The chromia loadings,addition of potassium oxide
(K2O)
and calcination temperature of the catalyst were investigated in detail over the isobutane dehydrogenation.
The high isobutene selectiv- ity
93.2%
at the high isobutane conversion of
60.1%
was obtained in the experiment.
In order to study the stability and regenerative ability of the catalyst,the ten dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles were carried out.

Catalysts synthesis
MIL-101
was synthesized by the solvothermal method accord- ing to the previous literature with the exception that the mole ratio of n(Cr(NO3)3·9H2O:n(H2BDC):n(HF):n(H2O) was
1:1:0.5:280
[36].
The as-synthesized
MIL-101
was degassed under reduced pressure at
150 C
for 12 h to remove the guest molecules.
The pretreated
MIL-101
(0.56 g) was added into absolute ethanol (EtOH) solution containing Al(i-OC3H7)3 (0.30 mol
L1,
100 mL) and impregnated by ultrasonic for
1.5
h.
Afterwards,the mixture was stirred at
50 C
to evaporate slowly the solvent to form a green paste.
The paste was dried at
120 C
overnight to obtain a bright green powder,which was calcined at
600 C
for 4 h in air to obtain the catalyst,denoted as 10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600).
The catalysts xCr2O3/Al2O3(600) (x wt.% stands for the weight ratio of Cr2O3 loading in the cata- lysts and the number in parentheses represents for the calcination temperature) with different Cr2O3 loadings (525 wt.%) were pre- pared through controlling the addition amount of
MIL-101.
To examine the additive
K2O
over the reactivity of isobutane dehydrogenation,
KOH
(0.04 g) together with Al(i-OC3H7)3 was dis- solved in EtOH solution according to the preparation steps of the catalyst 10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600) mentioned above to obtain the cata- lyst

K2O-10Cr2O3/Al2O3(600) with

In order to investigate the calcination temperature over the cat- alytic activity and selectivity of isobutane dehydrogenation,the catalyst
