A Quantitative Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy Study of Supported Chromium Catalysts Bert M. Weckbuysen,' Leo M. De Ridder, and Robert A. Schoonheydt Centrum voor Opperulaktechemie en Katalyse, K.U. Leuven, Kardinaal Mercierlaan 92, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium Received: December 4, 1992; In Final Form: February 2, 1993 The diffuse reflectance spectra of chromium supported on alumina, on silica, and on silica-alumina have been investigated after calcination, CO reduction, and recalcination. A method for quantifying the Cr6+, Cr3+,and Cr2+ concentrations was developed. After calcination at 550
OC,
the chr0mate:dichromate ratio is m, 0.56, and
2.18
on respectively alumina, silica, and silica-alumina. Reduction results in the formation of three new species:octahedral Cr3+, octahedral Cr2+,and pseudotetrahedral Cr2+. On silica and silica-alumina, the relative proportions of these three species depend on the reduction temperature. On alumina, only octahedral Cr3+ and small amounts of octahedral Cr2+ were observed after reduction. Recalcination reestablishes the chromate:dichromate ratio; however, this regeneration is complete only on silica. On alumina and silica-alumina, about one-third and two-thirds respectively of the total Cr content remain as Cr3+. The sensitivity of Cr6+ to reduction is greater on silica than on alumina and silica-alumina. This is indicated by the increase of the Cr2+:Cr3+ ratio from alumina over silica-alumina to silica.
Introduction Chromium on silica (Cr/SiOz) is the famous Phillips catalyst for the polymerizationof ethyleneunder relatively low pressures.] This catalyst is the basis for the Phillips particle-form process in the production of high-density polyethylene,2 and the use has been extended to the production of linear low-density polyethylene3 and the copolymerization of ethylene and butene- 1 .4 Chromium on silica-alumina (Cr/Si02*A1203) catalyses the polymerization of propylene5 and chromium on alumina (Cr/A1203) catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, in dehydrocycliza- tion, and in catalytic reforming.6 The Phillips catalyst is one of the most studied and yet most controversial systems,' while the studies of Cr/A1203 and Cr/ Si02.Al203 are more limited. All these studies deal with the formation and nature of the chromium species on the catalyst surface or with the associated problem of identifying the valence state of the species which are responsible for catalysis. Different techniques,such as infrared spectroscopy (IR)? diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS)? X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),lo Raman spectroscopy,Il and electronspin resonance (ESR),12 were used. There is a general consensus that the detectable oxidation states are Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+,and Cr2+.However, the coordination geometry of these surface complexes and the degree of polym- erization of Cr on the surface are a matter of debate.After calcination, most of the Cr is stabilized as Cr6+ on the Si02 and Alz03 surfaces;only the exact mechanism of stabilization and the molecular structure of the stabilized Cr6+ species are points of discussion. According to Hogan and McDaniel, only chromate is formed on the Si02 surface,I3J4 while other research groups favor the formation of dichromate.15-19 Raman studies on Cr/Si02 give evidence for mono-,di-, tri-, and tetramers under hydrated conditionsZo and highly distorted monochromate under dehydrated conditions.21 On A1203,mostly chromate is formed after calcination.17v22 However, Raman studies reveal the presence of monomers and dimers under hydrated conditions20 and polymeric oxide species under dehydrated  condition. To our knowledge, the molecular structure of Cr on Si0yA1203 is not yet reported in the literature.Reduction of the calcined catalysts results in the formation of traces of Cr5+, Cr3+,and Cr2+,but the relative proportion of these species depends on the reduction temperature and on the

Cr3+ is mostly thought of as octahedral, but according to Myers and Lunsford, a small part can be in a lower symmetry.24 Cr2+ can be unsaturated, tetrahedrally coordinated, and square- Table I give a survey of DRS absorption bands and proposed assignments. All these DRS studies are qualitative, describing the different oxidation states formed after calcination and reduction. However,the data of different groups cannot be easily compared because of differences in pretreatments and Cr loadings.
Therefore, the purpose of this work is a quantitative study of chromium-supported catalysts by DRS. This technique allows the quantitative determination of Cr2+, Cr3+, and Cr6+ after calcination,reduction,and recalcination at least at small loadings.
The redox behavior of Cr on Al203, SO2,and Si02.A1203 will be discussed. planar,18,19.26.29 Experimental Section Sample Preparation and Characterization. 1 .
Preparation.
Si02 and SiO2.A1203 were home-made. Si02 was prepared by mixing 2 vol parts H20 at pH 2 (adding HCl) and 1 vol part tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) during 5 h at room temperature.
The mixture was titrated under stirring to pH 6 with a NH40H solution of pH 9.5. After 16 h of gelation, the gel was dried at 130

for respectively 3 and 16 h. The so-obtained cake was crushed. Si02.A1203 with 40 wt 5 % Si02 was prepared following a modified method of Chen et al.33 TEOS (35.5 g) and aluminum triisoprop'xide (65.36 g) were mixed in 128 mL of ethanol during 30 min at room temperature. After adding 35 mL of 1 M HCl, the hydrolysis started and the solution was mixed for 1 h. Acid hydrolysis resulted in a sol and a flocculated phase, suggesting a hetero- geneous SiOyA1203.

Pretreatment and Spectroscopy. 1. Pretreatment.
The samples were dried at 50 O
C
for 8 h and granulated. The size fraction of 0.16-0.25 mm was loaded in a quartz flow cell with Suprasil window for DRS and a side arm for ESR. With this cell, it was possible to take DRS and ESR spectra after the same pretreat- ment. The ESR spectra will be discussed in a following paper.
The samples were subsequently dried at
90 O
C
during 16 h followed by calcination at 550 O
C
during 6 h in an oxygen stream. DRS spectra were recorded on these calcined samples. The samples were then reduced with CO at 200,300,400, and 600 O
C
during 30 min. After each reduction step, DRS spectra were taken. In the last step, the samples were recalcined in oxygen during 6 h at 550 O
C
and DRSspectra were taken again. The same procedure was followed for the supports without chromium. Their spectra were used as reference. An oxygen flow of 3600 mL/h and a CO flow of 1800 mL/h were used for all the treatments.
2. DiffuseReflectanceSpectroscopy. DRS spectra
were taken on a Varian Cary 5 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer at room temperature. The spectra were recorded against a halon white reflectance standard in the range 2200-200 nm. The computer processing of the spectra consisted of the following steps: (1) subtraction of the baseline; (2) conversion to wavenumber; (3) calculation of the Kubelka-Munk (KM) funtion; (4) subtraction of the spectrum of the parent support from that of the chromium- supported catalysts measured after the same treatment. The spectra were deconvoluted with the Spectra Calc program of Galactic Industries Corp. into Gaussian bands. The values of the KM function at the band maxima were used for quantitative
DRS. Spectra of the solutions of K2Cr04,
K2Cr207,and Cr- (NO3)3-9H20 were taken at room temperature on a Cary 17, in the range of 800-210 nm. The spectra of the solids (K2Cr04, K2Cr207, Cr(N03)3.9H20,and Cr203) were taken on a Varian Cary 5 UV-vis-NIR at room temperature in the range 2200- 200 nm.
