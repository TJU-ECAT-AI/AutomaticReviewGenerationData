1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail their key industrial applications and research focus areas such as structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that supported Cr-based catalysts have exhibited excellent performances for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction, and that the distribution of Cr2O3 on the supports and the surface chromium species structure, which determine the activity of catalysts, are influenced by the nature of supports. The literature focuses on the investigation of the effect of Ce on the activity of Cr/SBA-15 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览，也没有详细说明其关键的工业应用和研究重点领域，如结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制，这些都促成了它们在脱氢过程中的重要性。但是，它确实提到，支持的Cr基催化剂在氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中表现出优异的性能，Cr2O3在支撑材料上的分布和表面铬物种结构，决定了催化剂的活性，受支撑材料性质的影响。文献重点研究了Ce对Cr/SBA-15催化剂在乙烷与CO2脱氢反应中活性的影响。
