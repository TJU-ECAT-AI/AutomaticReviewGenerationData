1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail their key industrial applications and research focus areas such as structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that supported Cr-based catalysts have exhibited excellent performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, specifically the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The focus of the research is on the effect of cerium (Ce) modification on the activity of Cr/SBA-15 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. The cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species is crucial for the reaction mechanism.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览，也没有详细说明其关键的工业应用和研究重点领域，如结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制，这些都促成了它们在脱氢过程中的重要性。但是，它确实提到，支持的Cr基催化剂在氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中表现出优异的性能，特别是乙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢。研究的重点是铈(Ce)改性对Cr/SBA-15催化剂脱氢乙烷与CO2活性的影响。Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间的循环对反应机制至关重要。
