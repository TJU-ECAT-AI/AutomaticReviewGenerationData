If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. It focuses on the investigation of CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with carbon dioxide. The key research focus areas include the effect of Ce on the activity of Cr/SBA-15 catalysts, the cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, and the enhancement of catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2.

1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail their key industrial applications and research focus areas such as structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that supported Cr-based catalysts have exhibited excellent performances for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction, and that the distribution of Cr2O3 on the supports and the surface chromium species structure, which determine the activity of catalysts, are influenced by the nature of supports. The literature focuses on the investigation of the effect of Ce on the activity of Cr/SBA-15 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2.
