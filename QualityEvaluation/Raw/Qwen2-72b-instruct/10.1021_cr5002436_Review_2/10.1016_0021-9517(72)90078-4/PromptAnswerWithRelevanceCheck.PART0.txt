1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail the evolution of these catalysts in industrial applications. However, it does focus on the study of dehydrogenation of isobutane over a series of chromia-alumina solid solutions, examining the intrinsic activities and stability of these catalysts. The research highlights the role of chromium ions of various charges in the catalytic process and the deactivation mechanism. The study suggests that the substitution of phases with a low content of chromia for richer phases could improve the catalytic performance. The focus areas include the structure of solid solutions, the activity of different phases, the effect of chromium content, and the mechanism of dehydrogenation and deactivation.

1.文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览，也没有详细说明这些催化剂在工业应用中的演变。然而，它确实专注于一系列铬酸铝固溶体在异丁烷脱氢反应中的研究，考察了这些催化剂的内在活性和稳定性。研究强调了不同电荷的铬离子在催化过程中的作用以及失活机制。研究建议，用低含量铬酸盐相替代更富有的相可以提高催化性能。研究的重点领域包括固溶体的结构、不同相的活性、铬含量的影响以及脱氢和失活的机制。

1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail the evolution of these catalysts in industrial applications. The focus of the literature is on the study of the activity of true Cr2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions in dehydrogenation processes, specifically the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene. The research highlights the intrinsic activities and stability of different solid solutions, the role of chromium ions in catalytic activity and deactivation, and the potential benefits of substituting phases with a low content of chromia for richer phases in usual dehydrogenation catalysts. The literature does not cover the broader industrial applications and research focus areas related to chromium oxide-based catalysts, such as structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms in dehydrogenation processes.
