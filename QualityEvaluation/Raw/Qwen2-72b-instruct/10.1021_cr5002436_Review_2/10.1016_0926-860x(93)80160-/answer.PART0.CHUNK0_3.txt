1.The document does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail the evolution of these catalysts or their key industrial applications and research focus areas. The literature focuses on the study of isobutane dehydrogenation on chromia/zirconia catalysts, examining aspects such as activity, selectivity, deactivation, and the influence of pretreatment and reactant composition. It does not address the broader context of chromium-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

1.该文件没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览，也没有详细说明这些催化剂的关键工业应用和研究重点领域。文献专注于研究异丁烷在铬酸锌催化剂上的脱氢，考察了活性、选择性、失活以及预处理和反应物组成的影响。它没有涉及铬基催化剂在脱氢过程中的更广泛背景。
