1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it detail the key industrial applications and research focus areas that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes. The document focuses on a specific study of isobutane dehydrogenation on chromia/zirconia catalysts, examining factors such as activity, selectivity, deactivation, and the influence of pretreatment and reactant composition.
