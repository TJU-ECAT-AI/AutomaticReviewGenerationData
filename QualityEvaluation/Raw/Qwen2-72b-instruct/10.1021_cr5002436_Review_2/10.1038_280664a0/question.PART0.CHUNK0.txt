I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Silicalite-2, a silica analogue of the aluminosilicate zeolite ZSM-11 THE structure of silicalite, a new polymorph of silica which was first prepared by Flanigen et al.1, is so similar to that of the silica-rich aluminosilicate zeolite ZSM-5 (ref. 2) that we suggest that it should be regarded as the aluminium-free end member of this zeolite series. Therefore it should be possible to prepare silica analogues of other silica-rich aluminosilicate zeolites such as ZSM-11 (ref. 3), ZSM-12 (ref. 4), ZSM-21 (ref. 5) and ZSM-34 (ref. 6). We report here the preparation of what we believe is the analogue of ZSM-11, which we call silicalite-2, adopting the terminology silicalite-1 for the form prepared by Flanigen et al.1 The silicalite-1, ZSM-5, ZSM-11 and, by inference, silicalite-2 frameworks contain 4-, 5- and 6-membered rings linked to form a system of channels with 10-membered ring openings13. In silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 the channels are a combination of linear and zig-zag1,2, while in ZSM-113 and silicalite-2 all the channels are linear. The lack of substitutional aluminium results in silicalites having no significant catalytic or cation exchange properties compared with the zeolites. However, silicalites are unusual in that they are the only known hydrophobic forms of silica and are capable of absorbing organic molecules up to 6 Å kinetic diameter. Thermogravimetric studies of silicalites-1 and -2 containing absorbed long straight-chain hydrocarbon compounds (C4C16) show that degassing occurs in two stages, which we consider to be due to self-blocking of the channels at intersection points.

How have chromium oxide-based catalysts evolved since their discovery in 1933, and what are the key industrial applications and research focus areas (such as structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms) that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
