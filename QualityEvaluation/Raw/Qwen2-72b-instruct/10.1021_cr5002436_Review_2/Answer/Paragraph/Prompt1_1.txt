Recent studies have shown that carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, can act as a mild oxidant, enhancing the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and isobutane over supported chromium oxide. The catalysts' reduction-oxidation property and dispersion of chromium species are key factors in these reactions.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2004.03.014"},
{"DOC": "Since 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, with CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts showing excellent performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with CO2. Research highlights the impact of cerium (Ce) on Cr/SBA-15 catalysts, the cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, and the enhancement of catalytic activity for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2. The cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is pivotal for the reaction mechanism, contributing to the catalyst's effectiveness in dehydrogenation processes.", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-008-9569-3"},
{"DOC": "Chromium oxide-based catalysts, discovered in 1933, have evolved from chromia-alumina to include platinum, significantly impacting dehydrogenation processes. During WWII, these catalysts were pivotal in producing high-octane aviation fuel. Today, they achieve 30-60% conversion rates for propane and butanes, and 10-20% for C10-C14 paraffins, with 7 million metric tons of C3-C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10-C14 olefins produced in 2000. Research aims to approach equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation. Oxydehydrogenation, employing vanadium and platinum catalysts, is less established but offers thermodynamic advantages, focusing on high selectivity to olefins and the safe use of oxidants, with carbon dioxide as a potential safer alternative.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(01)00816-x"},
{"DOC": "Since 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in dehydrogenation processes, with a focus on the influence of support properties on chromium species dispersion and oxidation states. Cr6+ species are crucial for high activity, reducing to Cr3+ and Cr2+ during the reaction, participating in the non-oxidative pathway of propene formation. CO2 promotes dehydrogenation by consuming hydrogen, shifting the equilibrium towards propene production.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.molcata.2011.08.019"},
{"DOC": "Since 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, playing a key role in industrial dehydrogenation processes, specifically in converting isobutane to isobutene, synthesizing butenes and butadiene from n-butane, and producing isobutene for MTBE. Research has focused on the impact of preparation parameters like calcination temperature and chromium oxide loading on the nature of chromium species. The role of alkali metal dopants, such as potassium, in enhancing activity and selectivity, and the interaction between the support material, typically alumina, and chromium species, are critical to catalytic performance.
