{"DOC": "Chromium oxide-based catalysts, discovered in 1933, have evolved significantly, with chromia-alumina catalysts used in WWII for dehydrogenating butanes to produce aviation fuel. These catalysts have since advanced to include platinum and modified platinum variants, focusing on achieving near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation. Commercially, dehydrogenation processes convert propane and butanes at 30-60% per-pass, and C10-C14 paraffins at 10-20%. In 2000, 7 million metric tons of C3-C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10-C14 olefins were produced. Oxydehydrogenation, employing vanadium and platinum catalysts, is a developing area offering thermodynamic advantages, with research targeting high selectivity and conversion rates while addressing safety concerns.
