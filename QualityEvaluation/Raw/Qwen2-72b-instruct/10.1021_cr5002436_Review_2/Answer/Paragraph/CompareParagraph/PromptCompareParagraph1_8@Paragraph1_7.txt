Deactivation is attributed to carbonaceous material formation on the catalyst surface \[10.1016/0021-9517(72)90078-4\]. A key finding suggests that substituting phases with low chromia content for richer ones could enhance the activity and stability of dehydrogenation catalysts \[10.1016/0021-9517(72)90078-4\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, and reaction mechanisms. The role of high dispersion of chromium oxide species, facilitated by mesoporous supports, and the influence of CO2 as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation have been pivotal in enhancing catalytic activity. The use of in situ Raman spectroscopy has deepened our understanding of surface chromium oxide species on various supports, revealing the molecular structure's dependence on pretreatment, Cr loading, and support type. The redox behavior of supported chromium oxides is support-ligand specific, impacting their catalytic action in redox reactions. Future research might focus on developing catalysts with tailored support properties to enhance dispersion and control the oxidation state of chromium species, aiming for higher activity and stability. The exploration of alternative oxidants, such as CO2, could lead to more sustainable and efficient dehydrogenation processes. Additionally, the use of advanced characterization techniques could provide deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of chromium oxide species during dehydrogenation, guiding the design of next-generation catalysts.
