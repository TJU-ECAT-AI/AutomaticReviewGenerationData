Research focuses on minimizing side reactions and coke formation, with recent investigations into using carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(01)00816-x"},
{"DOC": "Since 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, with a focus on their role in dehydrogenation processes. A comparative study highlights the importance of chromium oxide deposited on silica supports, emphasizing preparation methods and the influence of support properties on chromium species dispersion and oxidation states. Cr6+ species are crucial for high activity, reducing to Cr3+ and Cr2+ during the reaction, participating in the non-oxidative pathway of propene formation. CO2's presence promotes dehydrogenation by consuming hydrogen, shifting the equilibrium towards propene production, showcasing the catalysts' industrial significance.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.molcata.2011.08.019"},
{"DOC": "Since 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, playing a crucial role in industrial dehydrogenation processes, particularly in converting isobutane to isobutene and synthesizing butenes and butadiene from n-butane. Research highlights the impact of preparation parameters, such as calcination temperature and chromium oxide loading, on the nature of chromium species. Alkali metal dopants, like potassium, enhance activity and selectivity. The structure of support materials, such as alumina, and its interaction with chromium species are critical for catalytic performance.

{"DOC": "Since 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, with a focus on CrOx/Al2O3 for dehydrogenation processes. Key research areas include catalyst preparation techniques, chromium oxidation states, CrOx dispersion, and activity in dehydrogenation reactions. Studies show that dehydrogenation activity decays over successive cycles due to a decrease in redox Cr3+ sites, highlighting their importance. The role of exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites and the impact of CrOx ensemble size on catalyst activity have also been investigated, demonstrating the multifaceted research contributing to the significance of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00310-5"}
