          The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that these catalysts have industrial applications in dehydrogenation processes, specifically the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, and in the synthesis of butenes and butadiene from n-butane, as well as the synthesis of isobutene from isobutane for MTBE production. The research focus areas include the characterization of the catalysts using various techniques such as XPS, UVVisNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, XRD, and chemical analysis. The effects of preparation parameters like calcination temperature and chromium oxide loading on the nature of the chromium species are also investigated. The role of alkali metal dopants, such as potassium, in promoting activity and selectivity is another area of interest. The structure of the support material, in this case, alumina, and its interaction with the chromium species are also critical to the catalytic performance. The literature also discusses the relationships between the activity in dehydrogenation of paraffins and the nature of chromium species in an industrial-like catalyst.

          文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。然而，它确实提到这些催化剂在脱氢过程中有工业应用，特别是异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯，从正丁烷合成丁烯和丁二烯，以及从异丁烷合成异丁烯用于MTBE生产。研究重点领域包括使用各种技术，如XPS、UVVisNIR漫反射光谱、XRD和化学分析，对催化剂进行表征。研究了制备参数，如煅烧温度和铬氧化物负载量，对铬物种性质的影响。碱金属助剂，如钾，促进活性和选择性的作用是另一个感兴趣的研究领域。支撑材料的结构，本例中为氧化铝，及其与铬物种的相互作用对催化性能也至关重要。文献还讨论了在类似工业催化剂中，石蜡脱氢的活性与铬物种的性质之间的关系。
