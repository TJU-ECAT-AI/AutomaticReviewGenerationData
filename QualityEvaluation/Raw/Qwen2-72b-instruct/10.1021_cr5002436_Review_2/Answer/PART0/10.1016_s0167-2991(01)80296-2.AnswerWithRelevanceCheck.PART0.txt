          Supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes, particularly effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane, and in ethene polymerisation. The focus of research on CrOx/A1203 catalysts has been on understanding the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions, the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism, and catalyst deactivation. Studies have often been performed on samples with lower chromium content than what is used in industrial dehydrogenation catalysts, which contain 12-14 wt-% chromium. The maximum activity in dehydrogenation is reached at chromium loadings between 14 and 16 wt-%. The importance of studying high chromium loading CrOx/A1203 catalysts is highlighted, as they are more representative of industrial dehydrogenation catalysts.

          支撑铬氧化物催化剂在各种工业过程中被广泛使用，特别是在丙烷和丁烷等轻烷烃的脱氢中特别有效，以及在乙烯聚合中。CrOx/A1203催化剂的研究重点在于理解催化剂在脱氢条件下的结构、催化位点的性质、反应机制和催化剂失活。研究通常在铬含量低于工业脱氢催化剂中使用的样品上进行，工业脱氢催化剂中含12-14 wt-%的铬。脱氢的最大活性在14至16 wt-%的铬负载下达到。该文件还强调了研究高铬负载CrOx/A1203催化剂的重要性，因为这些催化剂更代表工业脱氢催化剂。
