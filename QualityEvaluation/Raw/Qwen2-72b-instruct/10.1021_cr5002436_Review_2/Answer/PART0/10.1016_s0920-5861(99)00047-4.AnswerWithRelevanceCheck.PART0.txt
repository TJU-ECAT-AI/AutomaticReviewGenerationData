          [1] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."
          [2] "The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mclver [6], and by Kearby [7]."
          [3] "Subsequently, numerous papers have been published in the literature on CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts [850]."
          [4] "All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identification of the active sites; (b) influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selectivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism."

          Since the discovery of supported chromium oxide catalysts by Frey and Huppke in the 1930s, these catalysts have been recognized for their superior properties in alkane dehydrogenation, leading to the widespread use of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts in industry. The main findings regarding Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s were summarized in review papers by Poole and Mclver, and by Kearby. Since then, extensive research has been conducted on various chromium oxide catalysts supported on different materials, including SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2. The focus of these newer studies has been on identifying the active sites, understanding the influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation and catalytic activity/selectivity, and elucidating the dehydrogenation mechanism.

          自从Frey和Huppke在1930年代发现支撑的铬氧化物催化剂以来，这些催化剂因其在烷烃脱氢中的优越性能而被广泛认可，导致Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂在工业中的广泛应用。直到1960年代末，关于Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂的主要发现被Poole和Mclver以及Kearby在综述论文中总结。从那以后，对各种支撑在不同材料上的铬氧化物催化剂进行了广泛的研究，包括SiO2，Al2O3和ZrO2。这些新研究的重点是识别活性位点，理解制备和处理条件对铬氧化物特性和催化活性/选择性的影响，以及阐明脱氢机制。
