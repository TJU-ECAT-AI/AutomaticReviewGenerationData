          The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. It focuses on the investigation of CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with carbon dioxide. Key research focus areas include the effect of Ce on the activity of Cr/SBA-15 catalysts, the cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, and the enhancement of catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. Supported Cr-based catalysts have exhibited excellent performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, specifically the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The focus of the research is on the effect of cerium (Ce) modification on the activity of Cr/SBA-15 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. The cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species is crucial for the reaction mechanism.

          文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。它专注于CrCe/SBA-15催化剂用于氧化脱氢乙烷至乙烯与二氧化碳的研究。关键的研究焦点领域包括Ce对Cr/SBA-15催化剂活性的影响，Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间的循环，以及增强催化活性用于乙烷与CO2的脱氢。支持的Cr基催化剂在氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中表现出优异的性能，特别是乙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢。研究的重点是铈(Ce)改性对Cr/SBA-15催化剂脱氢乙烷与CO2活性的影响。Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间的循环对反应机制至关重要。
