          The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. It focuses on the preparation and characterization of chromia/alumina catalysts prepared by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) from the vapor phase, using sequential saturating reactions of Cr(acac)3 vapor and air. The catalysts were tested in the dehydrogenation of i-butane to i-butene. The study aimed to explore the relationship between the surface species and the behavior of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation process. The key findings include the uniform distribution of the catalytically active material throughout the catalyst particles, the dispersion of Cr species in a monolayer up to 7.4 wt% of Cr, and the presence of both Cr3+ and Cr6+ species even at low loadings. The activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane continued to increase beyond monolayer coverage.

          文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史概览。它专注于通过原子层外延(ALE)从气相制备和表征氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂，使用Cr(acac)3蒸气和空气的顺序饱和反应。这些催化剂在i-丁烷脱氢为i-丁烯的反应中进行了测试。该研究旨在探索表面物种与催化剂在脱氢过程中的行为之间的关系。关键发现包括催化活性物质在催化剂颗粒中的均匀分布，Cr物种在高达7.4 wt%的Cr中以单层分散，以及即使在低负载下也存在Cr3+和Cr6+物种。i-丁烷脱氢的活性在超过单层覆盖后继续增加。
