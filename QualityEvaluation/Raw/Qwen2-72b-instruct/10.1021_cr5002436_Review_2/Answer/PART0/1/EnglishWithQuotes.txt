A comprehensive review of the literature up to 1954 can be found in Emmett's book on catalysis. Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were used to dehydrogenate butane to produce high-octane aviation fuel. Independent development was carried out by UOP in the United States and ICI in the UK. The first UOP-designed plant began operation in Billingham, England, in 1940. Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, which allowed for higher per-pass conversion. Typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K. A good review of the process chemistry is provided by Bhasin. Both chromia and vanadia have been thoroughly examined for these reactions, although vanadia is not used commercially. The oxide surfaces have been analyzed by a wide range of techniques before, during, and after the reaction. The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known. Catalyst regeneration is periodic and by oxidation. Commercial reactor designs take different approaches to manage deactivation and regeneration. The CATOFIN process, which uses a chromium oxide catalyst, is of particular interest. The CATOFIN process technology is currently owned by Sd-Chemie and offered for licensing by ABB Lummus. The process converts propane to propene over a fixed-bed chromia alumina catalyst. It takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam, then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke. This is followed by evacuation and reduction, and then another cycle begins. The cycle time is typically 15-25 minutes. In the classic process, the regenerating gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, leading to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front moves through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction. Operation is generally at 823-873 K and 0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm. The overall operation is similar to that described for propane to propene, with conversion in the region of 50% per pass and selectivity for isobutane to isobutene of greater than 90%; the selectivity of propane to propene is > 86%.

During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were used to dehydrogenate butane to produce high-octane aviation fuel. Independent development was carried out by UOP in the United States and ICI in the UK. The first UOP-designed plant began operation in Billingham, England, in 1940. Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, which allowed for higher per-pass conversion. Typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K. A good review of the process chemistry is provided by Bhasin. Both chromia and vanadia have been thoroughly examined for these reactions, although vanadia is not used commercially. The oxide surfaces have been analyzed by a wide range of techniques before, during, and after the reaction. The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known. Catalyst regeneration is periodic and by oxidation. Commercial reactor designs take different approaches to manage deactivation and regeneration. The CATOFIN process, which uses a chromium oxide catalyst, is of particular interest. The CATOFIN process technology is currently owned by Sd-Chemie and offered for licensing by ABB Lummus. The process converts propane to propene over a fixed-bed chromia alumina catalyst. It takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam, then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke. This is followed by evacuation and reduction, and then another cycle begins. The cycle time is typically 15-25 minutes. In the classic process, the regenerating gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, leading to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front moves through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction. Operation is generally at 823-873 K and 0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm. The overall operation is similar to that described for propane to propene, with conversion in the region of 50% per pass and selectivity for isobutane to isobutene of greater than 90%; the selectivity of propane to propene is > 86%.

During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were used to dehydrogenate butane to produce high-octane aviation fuel. Independent development was carried out by UOP in the United States and ICI in the UK. The first UOP-designed plant began operation in Billingham, England, in 1940. Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, which allowed for higher per-pass conversion. Typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K. A good review of the process chemistry is provided by Bhasin. Both chromia and vanadia have been thoroughly examined for these reactions, although vanadia is not used commercially. The oxide surfaces have been analyzed by a wide range of techniques before, during, and after the reaction. The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known. Catalyst regeneration is periodic and by oxidation. Commercial reactor designs take different approaches to manage deactivation and regeneration. The CATOFIN process, which uses a chromium oxide catalyst, is of particular interest. The CATOFIN process technology is currently owned by Sd-Chemie and offered for licensing by ABB Lummus. The process converts propane to propene over a fixed-bed chromia alumina catalyst. It takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam, then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke. This is followed by evacuation and reduction, and then another cycle begins. The cycle time is typically 15-25 minutes. In the classic process, the regenerating gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, leading to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front moves through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction. Operation is generally at 823-873 K and 0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm.

During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were used to dehydrogenate butane to produce high-octane aviation fuel. Independent development was carried out by UOP in the United States and ICI in the UK. The first UOP-designed plant began operation in Billingham, England, in 1940. Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, which allowed for higher per-pass conversion. Typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K. A good review of the process chemistry is provided by Bhasin. Both chromia and vanadia have been thoroughly examined for these reactions, although vanadia is not used commercially.

The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known. Catalyst regeneration is periodic and by oxidation. Commercial reactor designs take different approaches to manage deactivation and regeneration. The CATOFIN process, which uses a chromium oxide catalyst, is of particular interest. The CATOFIN process technology is currently owned by Sd-Chemie and offered for licensing by ABB Lummus. The process converts propane to propene over a fixed-bed chromia alumina catalyst. It takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam, then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke. This is followed by evacuation and reduction, and then another cycle begins. The cycle time is typically 15-25 minutes. In the classic process, the regenerating gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, leading to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front moves through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction. Operation is generally at 823-873 K and 0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm.

During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were used to dehydrogenate butane to produce high-octane aviation fuel. Independent development was carried out by UOP in the United States and ICI in the UK. The first UOP-designed plant began operation in Billingham, England, in 1940. Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, which allowed for higher per-pass conversion.

The CATOFIN process, which uses a chromium oxide catalyst, is of particular interest. The CATOFIN process technology is currently owned by Sd-Chemie and offered for licensing by ABB Lummus. The process converts propane to propene over a fixed-bed chromia alumina catalyst. It takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam, then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke. This is followed by evacuation and reduction, and then another cycle begins. The cycle time is typically 15-25 minutes. In the classic process, the regenerating gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, leading to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front moves through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction. Operation is generally at 823-873 K and 0.3 atm.

However, it does mention that high-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are very active and selective in the dehydrogenation reaction, which is crucial for the production of light alkenes, particularly propylene for polypropylene production. The increasing demand for propene due to the growing polypropylene market has led to extensive research on the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of the active chromium oxide site, and deactivation routes. The focus of recent research has been on the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of this industrially important catalytic system, with particular attention to the role of CrO moieties with chromium in its tri- or divalent state as the active site for CH activation. The literature also discusses the possible involvement of coke deposits in alkane dehydrogenation reactions and the role of supported chromium oxide species in the formation of such deposits.

During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were used to dehydrogenate butane to produce high-octane aviation fuel. Independent development was carried out by UOP in the United States and ICI in the UK. The first UOP-designed plant began operation in Billingham, England, in 1940. Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, which allowed for higher per-pass conversion. Typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K. A good review of the process chemistry is provided by Bhasin. Both chromia and vanadia have been thoroughly examined for these reactions, although vanadia is not used commercially. The oxide surfaces have been analyzed by a wide range of techniques before, during, and after the reaction. The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known. Catalyst regeneration is periodic and by oxidation. Commercial reactor designs take different approaches to manage deactivation and regeneration. The CATOFIN process, which uses a chromium oxide catalyst, is of particular interest. The CATOFIN process technology is currently owned by Sd-Chemie and offered for licensing by ABB Lummus. The process converts propane to propene over a fixed-bed chromia alumina catalyst. It takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam, then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke. This is followed by evacuation and reduction, and then another cycle begins. The cycle time is typically 15-25 minutes. In the classic process, the regenerating gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, leading to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front moves through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction. Operation is generally at 823-873 K and 0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm.

In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam, then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke. This is followed by evacuation and reduction, and then another cycle begins. The cycle time is typically 15-25 minutes. In the classic process, the regenerating gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, leading to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front moves through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction. Operation is generally at 823-873 K and 0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm. The overall operation is similar to that described for propane to propene, with conversion in the region of 50% per pass and selectivity for isobutane to isobutene of greater than 90%; the selectivity of propane to propene is > 86%.
