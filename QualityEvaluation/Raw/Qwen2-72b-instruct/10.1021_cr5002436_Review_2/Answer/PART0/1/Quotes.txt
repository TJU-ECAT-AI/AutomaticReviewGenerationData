          [18] "The process takes place in a series of fi xed - bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis."
          [19] "In one complete cycle,hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam then sub- jected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke, which is deposited during the reaction cycle."
          [20] "These steps are followed by an evacuation and reduction and then another cycle is begun."
          [21] "The cycle time is typically 15 25 minutes."
          [22] "In the classic process, the regenerating (heating) gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, which leads initially to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit."
          [23] "With time on stream, a temperature front will move through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction."

          [2] "During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels."
