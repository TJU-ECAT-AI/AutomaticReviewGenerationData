Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. It focuses on the study of propane dehydrogenation on chromia/zirconia catalysts, investigating parameters influencing activity, deactivation, regeneration, and the nature of active sites. The key research areas include the influence of pretreatment, conversion and selectivity, deactivation and reversibility, surface hydration, dependence of activity on chromium content, apparent activation energy, influence of potassium addition, and the effect of reactant composition on reaction rates and deactivation coefficients. The study highlights the role of mononuclear Cr species and adjacent O2- ions in the active site for dehydrogenation.
