1.The document does not provide a historical overview of the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes, such as the dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane, and in ethene polymerisation. The focus of research on CrOx/A1203 catalysts has been on understanding the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions, the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism, and catalyst deactivation. The document also notes that studies have often been performed on samples with lower chromium content than what is used in industrial dehydrogenation catalysts, which contain 12-14 wt-% chromium. The maximum activity in dehydrogenation is reached at chromium loadings between 14 and 16 wt-%.

1.该文件没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的演变历史概述。但是,它确实提到,支撑铬氧化物催化剂广泛用于各种工业过程,例如丙烷和丁烷等轻烷的脱氢,以及乙烯聚合。CrOx/A1203催化剂的研究重点在于理解催化剂在脱氢条件下的结构,催化位点的性质,反应机制和催化剂失活。该文件还指出,研究通常在铬含量低于工业脱氢催化剂中使用的样品上进行,工业脱氢催化剂中含12-14 wt-%的铬。脱氢的最大活性在14至16 wt-%的铬负载下达到。
