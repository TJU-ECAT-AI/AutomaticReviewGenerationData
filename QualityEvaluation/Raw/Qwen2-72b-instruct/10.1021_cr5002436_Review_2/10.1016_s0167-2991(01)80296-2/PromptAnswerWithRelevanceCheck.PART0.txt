Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The document does not provide a historical overview of the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes, particularly effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane. The focus of research on CrOx/A1203 catalysts has been on understanding the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions, the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism, and catalyst deactivation. The document also highlights the importance of studying high chromium loading CrOx/A1203 catalysts, as these are more representative of industrial dehydrogenation catalysts.

1.该文件没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂演变的历史概览。然而，它确实提到，支撑铬氧化物催化剂在各种工业过程中被广泛使用，特别是在丙烷和丁烷等轻烷烃的脱氢中特别有效。对CrOx/A1203催化剂的研究重点在于理解催化剂在脱氢条件下的结构、催化位点的性质、反应机制和催化剂失活。该文件还强调了研究高铬负载CrOx/A1203催化剂的重要性，因为这些催化剂更代表工业脱氢催化剂。

1.The document does not provide a historical overview of the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes, such as the dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane, and in ethene polymerisation. The focus of research on CrOx/A1203 catalysts has been on understanding the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions, the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism, and catalyst deactivation. The document also notes that studies have often been performed on samples with lower chromium content than what is used in industrial dehydrogenation catalysts, which contain 12-14 wt-% chromium. The maximum activity in dehydrogenation is reached at chromium loadings between 14 and 16 wt-%.
