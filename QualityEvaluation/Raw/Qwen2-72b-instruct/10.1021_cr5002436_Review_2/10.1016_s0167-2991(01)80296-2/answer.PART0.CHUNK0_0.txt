1.The document does not provide a historical overview of the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does mention that supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes, particularly effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane. The focus of research on CrOx/A1203 catalysts has been on understanding the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions, the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism, and catalyst deactivation. The document also highlights the importance of studying high chromium loading CrOx/A1203 catalysts, as these are more representative of industrial dehydrogenation catalysts.

1.该文件没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂演变的历史概览。然而，它确实提到，支撑铬氧化物催化剂在各种工业过程中被广泛使用，特别是在丙烷和丁烷等轻烷烃的脱氢中特别有效。对CrOx/A1203催化剂的研究重点在于理解催化剂在脱氢条件下的结构、催化位点的性质、反应机制和催化剂失活。该文件还强调了研究高铬负载CrOx/A1203催化剂的重要性，因为这些催化剂更代表工业脱氢催化剂。
