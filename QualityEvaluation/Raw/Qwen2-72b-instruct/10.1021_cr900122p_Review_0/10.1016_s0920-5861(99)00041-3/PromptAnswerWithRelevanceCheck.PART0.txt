1. The literature does not provide specific details on how isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, the mechanisms involved in these processes, or how these principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as an example. However, it does discuss the role of redox properties of transition metal oxide-based systems and the contribution of radical-type, homogeneous, and heterogeneously-initiated homogeneous reactions over nonreducible metal oxide catalysts in the selective oxidation of light alkanes. The literature also mentions the importance of the interaction between the catalyst surface and the gas phase and how surface phenomena are affected by homogeneous phenomena in conditioning the final performance in terms of product distribution.

[1] "The mechanism which operates is com- pletely heterogeneous and includes the formation of an intermediate alkoxy species (or alkyl radical spe- cies). This occurs preferentially at lower temperatures (i.e. less than 4505008C for ethane, the temperature being a function of both (i) the reaction conditions,such as pressure and reactant concentration, and (ii) the alkane reactivity), and is often found for transition metal oxide-based catalysts. Either the olen or other 564"
[2] "The ratio of the rates of further reaction of this intermediate with activated oxygen, to give carbon oxides, and alkoxy evolution to the desired products, determines the selectivity of the reaction."
[3] "The reduced state achieved by treatment of the pyridinium salt could therefore be stabilized even under condi- tions which favor the reoxidation of molybdenum."
[4] "On the contrary, the oxidized catalyst was not selective in the oxidation of propane, and mainly yielded propene and carbon oxides."
[5] "The band at 700 nm is typical of Mo5 in heteropoly- blues, and its intensity is approximately proportional to the extent of molybdenum reduction [79]."
[6] "The catalyst which operates under fuel-lean conditions is less reduced than the catalyst which operates under hydrocarbon-rich conditions."
[7] "These data conrm the importance of the degree of molybdenum oxidation in heteropolycompounds used as heterogeneous catalysts for the selective oxidation of propane and of isobutane."
[8] "Since the oxidation state of molybdenum is a function of the gas-phase com- position, the optimal situation might be theoretically reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing con- ditions (i.e. at low hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio), thus under conditions which are typically less favourable for selectivity [55]."
[9] "In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, a catalyst for the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes and butadiene, the results of pulse tests showed that the selectivity to the desired product increased rapidly as the catalyst was progressively reduced (i.e. with increasing hydrocarbon pulse num- ber) [80,81]."
[10] "For the same reason, supported vanadium oxide systems in which partly reduced vanadium phases develop, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olens."
[11] "On the contrary, bulk V2O5 (found, for instance, at high vanadia loading in sup- ported systems) has a considerably lower selectivity to olens [8285]."
[12] "The oxygen species which are involved in the multi- electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions (even though probably limited to a few surface atomic layers) and chemisorbed species"
[13] "It seems that even though the vanadyl pyro- phosphate is very well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches'' or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment (either by chemical adsorption of oxygen, or by oxidation of vanadyl pyrophosphate layers to form VOPO4 phases, namely d-VOPO4), which make a fundamental contribution to the mechanism of forma- tion of maleic anhydride."
[14] "In some cases, VOPO4 phases are already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction [61]."
[15] "In addition, the formation of oxi- dized VOPO4 phases in the reactor will be affected by:(i) the reaction conditions, i.e. temperature and gas phase composition (differences in the average oxida- tion state of vanadium in the equilibrated catalyst unloaded from a xed bed may be expected between that of the catalyst placed at the reactor inlet, where the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio is the highest, and that at the exit, where the ratio is the lowest); and (ii) the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio [9]."
[16] "It was found that at low n-butane conversion (i.e. under conditions in which the consecutive contribution of maleic anhydride combustion is negligible) the selec- tivity was proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, and that at high n-butane conversion the selec- tivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreased as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increased."
[17] "It was proposed that a limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride but that excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride."
[18] "The existence of a limited amount of benecial V5 corresponds, in practice, to the necessity for discrete amounts on the catalyst surface of O-insertion sites which may favor the transformation of inter- mediates (i.e. olen species) to the nal product."
[19] "Also in the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO cat- alysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites."
[20] "In this case, the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed not only modies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and of carbon oxides, but also the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides [6063]."
[21] "The selectivity to products of interest is lowered to 1015%, while the formation of carbon oxides becomes largely kinetically favored."
[22] "At the same time,other by-products (aldehydes,ketones,hydrocarbon fragments) appear, which, on the contrary, are not observed at all for low n-pentane"
[23] "Therefore, when the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products (maleic and phthalic anhydrides) is hindered, due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites."
[24] "Under these condi- tions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen spe- cies either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state."
[25] "The main difference with respect to data reported in Fig. 1 therefore concerns the lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane rela- tive to those on heteropolycompound as the cata- lyst for isobutane oxidation."
[26] "It is interesting to note that when 1 mol% of 2- pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribu- tion of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane (i.e. 20 mol%) is oxidized [101]."
[27] "This indicates that when the olen is used as reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleo- philicity of the olenic reactant which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate."
[28] "An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olen never reaches the same values that are obtained with n- pentane [62,101]."

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by forming intermediate alkoxy species or alkyl radical species at lower temperatures, typically less than 450-500°C for ethane. This process is influenced by factors such as pressure, reactant concentration, and the reactivity of the alkane. The selectivity of the reaction is determined by the ratio of the further reaction of this intermediate with activated oxygen to give carbon oxides versus alkoxy evolution to the desired products. The reduced state of the catalyst, achieved through specific treatments, can be stabilized even under conditions that favor the reoxidation of the metal. In contrast, an oxidized catalyst is not selective in the oxidation of propane, mainly yielding propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation in the catalyst is crucial for the selective oxidation of propane and isobutane. The optimal situation might be reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing conditions. In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, the selectivity to the desired product increases rapidly as the catalyst is progressively reduced. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced vanadium phases, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olefins. Bulk V2O5 has a considerably lower selectivity to olefins. The oxygen species involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions and chemisorbed species. Even though the vanadyl pyrophosphate is well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment, contributing to the formation of maleic anhydride. VOPO4 phases are sometimes already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction. The formation of oxidized VOPO4 phases in the reactor is affected by the reaction conditions, such as temperature and gas phase composition, and the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio. At low n-butane conversion, the selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, while at high n-butane conversion, the selectivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreases as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increases. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride, but excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride. The existence of a limited amount of beneficial V5 corresponds to the necessity for discrete amounts of O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface, which favor the transformation of intermediates to the final product. In the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO catalysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites. The hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed modifies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and carbon oxides, as well as the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides. When the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products is hindered due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites. Under these conditions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen species either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state. The lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane relative to those on heteropolycompound as the catalyst for isobutane oxidation is a main difference. When 1 mol% of 2-pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribution of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane is oxidized. This indicates that when the olefin is used as a reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleophilicity of the olefinic reactant, which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate. An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olefin never reaches the same values obtained with n-pentane.

1.在异质催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过在较低温度下（通常小于450-500°C，对于乙烷）形成中间醇氧物种或烷基自由基物种来促进C-H键的活化。该过程受压力、反应物浓度和烷烃反应性等因素的影响。反应的选择性由该中间体与活化氧的进一步反应生成二氧化碳与醇氧物种向所需产物的演变之间的比率决定。通过特定处理实现的催化剂还原状态，即使在有利于金属再氧化的条件下也能稳定。相比之下，氧化催化剂在丙烷氧化中不具备选择性，主要产生丙烯和二氧化碳。催化剂中金属氧化程度对丙烷和异丁烷的有选择性氧化至关重要。如果在氧化条件下，即使在氧化条件下，也能保持还原、更具选择性的催化剂氧化状态，那么可能达到最佳情况。在氧化铝支持的钒氧化物的情况下，随着催化剂逐渐还原，对所需产物的选择性迅速增加。通过与底层支持物的相互作用稳定的部分还原钒相的支撑钒氧化物系统在形成烯烃方面更具选择性。V2O5的块体具有明显较低的烯烃选择性。参与n-丁烷多电子转化的氧物种既有体相氧离子也有化学吸附物种。尽管钒氧磷酸盐高度结晶且正式不含V5物种，但反应环境中会形成斑点或分散的V5物种，对马来酸酐的形成做出贡献。VOPO4相有时已经存在于催化剂中，特别是在化合物在反应前在空气中煅烧的情况下。反应器中氧化VOPO4相的形成受反应条件（如温度和气相组成）和钒氧磷酸盐的体相特征（如结晶度和P/V比）的影响。在低n-丁烷转化率下，选择性与烃氧比成正比，而在高n-丁烷转化率下，随着钒平均氧化度的增加，马来酸酐的选择性迅速下降。获得最高马来酸酐选择性需要有限量的表面V5，但过量的钒氧化会增强马来酸酐的连续燃烧。存在有限量的有益V5实际上对应于催化剂表面需要离散量的氧插入位点，这有利于中间体（即烯烃物种）向最终产物的转化。在VPO催化剂上的n-戊烷氧化中，产物分布受氧插入位点的可用性影响显著。烃氧比在进料中不仅改变选择性氧化产物与二氧化碳之间的相对比率，还改变马来酸与邻苯二甲酸酐之间的比率。当表面被吸附物种饱和时，由于氧插入位点的缺乏，最终稳定产物（马来酸和邻苯二甲酸酐）的形成受阻。在这些条件下，反应变得非选择性，因为中间烯烃物种在气相中解吸或被气相或直接在吸附状态下非选择性氧物种攻击。与异丁烷氧化催化剂杂多化合物相比，钒氧磷酸盐上n-戊烷氧化的活性位点的可用性较低是主要区别。当1 mol％的2-戊烯在空气中送入反应器时，观察到的产物分布与高浓度n-戊烷（即20 mol％）氧化时相同。这表明当烯烃用作反应物时，表面饱和发生在比n-戊烷低得多的烃分压下，这是由于烯烃反应物的高亲核性，使其与钒氧磷酸盐的路易斯酸中心的相互作用更容易。氧分压的增加有利于对酸酐的选择性，尽管与烯烃的选择性永远不会达到与n-戊烷相同。
