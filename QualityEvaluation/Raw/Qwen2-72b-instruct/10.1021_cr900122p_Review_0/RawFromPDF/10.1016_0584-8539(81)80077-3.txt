Abstract-In 
contrast with the different activities of fluorinated and chlorinated aluminas, the 
OH-bands of y- and q-A&O, are almost identical after halogenation with F, Cl, Br and I for lower 
coverages (0 < I), but excessive fluorination with imigration into the lattice causes greater changes. 
From a discussion of the OH-bands of silica-aluminas it may be concluded that a surface phase 
A1203-Si02 is formed, and Si-O-bands at 1632, 1865 and 1970cm- 
may be used to determine the 
SiO,-content of silica-aluminas. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
minas 
are playing 
an important 
role in catalytic 
chemistry. 
The activity 
of aluminas 
may be in- 
creased by addition of chlorine or fluorine. As can 
be seen from 
pyridine 
adsorption 
experiments, 
fluorided aluminas show Bronsted acidity as silica- 
aluminas 
do[l-4]; 
both types of catalysts 
are of 
similar activity for different 
reactions[5]. 
In con- 
trast to fluoridation, 
chlorination 
mainly leads to 
increased 
Lewis acidity [6,7]. In connection 
with 
kinetic 
studies 
we were interest 
in an i.r. spec- 
troscopic characterization 
of these oxides. 
2. EXPERIMENTAL 
A Fourier i.r. spectrometer (Digilab FTS-14) was used 
for the measurements with a high temperature measuring 
cel1[8]. Wafers of the oxide were heated 2h at 530°C 
prior to measurement at 280°C. The oftides used were 
Y-AI~O~ type C (Degussa), y-Al?O, 
(Merck), 
y-A120, 
prepared 
from hydroxide 
gel. v-AI,O, (from Bayerite), 
Si02 from hydroxide gel. Silica-aluminas were prepared 
from mixed hydroxide gels. The calcination temperature 
was 700°C. 
Aluminas were halogenated 
with gaseous HX (X = F, 
Cl, Br, I) in the measuring cell at 530°C. Fluorine could 
also be incorporated 
by soaking with NH,F-solution 
and 
calcination. 
The contents 
of Cl, Br and I were deter- 
minated in the used wafers by washing with Na2C03- 
solution and subsequent 
titration with AgNOj. 
Fluorine 
could not be extracted in the same way. 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1. Halogenated 
aluminas 
Earlier 
investigations 
[9-l 31 clearly 
show that 
OH-bands 
of y-A&O, are strongly 
influenced 
by 
interaction 
with HCI or HF adsorbed. 
In contrast 
to fluorine [l4], other halogens 
absorbed 
as am- 
moniumhalides 
on the oxide at least partially get 
desorbed 
by pretreatment 
of the oxide at 530°C. 
This process may be used to clean y-alumina 
type 
C (Degussa) from traces of chlorine. 
In order to avoid desorption, 
we treated samples 
of y-A&O, (Merck) and v-A&O, with HF, HCI. 
HBr and HI in the measuring 
cell in two steps: 
(a) reaction 
in the measuring 
part of the cell 
with 10 cm3 of HX,,, (X = F, Cl, Br, I) at 280°C. 
(b) reaction 
in 
the 
pretreatment 
zone 
with 
10 cm3 of HX at 530°C. 
Figure 
1 shows the OH-bands 
of halogenated 
y-Al,O, and Fig. 2 that of q-A1203. The content of 
halogens, which could be extracted from the used 
wafers, 
are given 
in Table 
1. The content 
of 
chlorine 
could vary to a certain 
extent 
without 
influence 
on the structure 
of the OH-bands. 
So 
y-Al,O1 with 2.3 x IO-” and 3.3 x 10e6 
mol Cl m-* 
show almost identical 
spectra as well as v-A&Ox 
with I .7 x lO-6 and 2.4 x 10e6 
mol Cl m-2. Evidently 
during halogenation 
OH-groups 
are substituted 
by 
halogen in the order of their basicity. So the band 
at 3770cm-’ 
can scarcely be seen after halogena- 
tion, 
and 
the intensity 
of the band 
at about 
3725 cm-’ is reduced 
compared 
with that of the 
band at cu. 3675 cm-‘. 
With both oxides interaction 
with Cl, Br and I 
led to the same spectra, 
while by fluorination 
completely 
different bands were obtained with the 
most intense band at 3715 cm-’ and a less intense 
band at 3650cm-‘. 
Comparing 
these spectra with 
those given by SCOCART et al. [ I] it became evident 
that the difference 
could be caused by a higher 
content 
of fluorine. 
Figure 3(a) shows spectra of 
y-A&O, fluorided by impregnation 
with NH,F with 
well defined content 
of F. From these spectra it 
follows that the bands of alumina with &< 1 are 
nearly the same as with the other halogenes except 
for a small shift (- lOcm-‘) 
of the main band. 
Greater 
amounts 
of fluorine, 
migrating 
into the 
lattice, cause the observed 
strong changes in the 
spectra. From Fig. 3(b) it follows that OH-groups 
of alumina containing 
6% F may greatly be desor- 
bed by heating the sample to 680°C. 
3.2. Silica-aluminas

The same bands 
were observed 
by 
PERI with a number 
of oxides with 65 to 100% 
Si02[18, 191. We investigated 
a greater number of 
silica-aluminas.

The two pure oxide samples 
(Al,O, and Si02) 
were prepared 
in the same way as the mixed 
oxides. 
Going from alumina 
to SiAI-10 and to 
SiAI-20 one observes 
a strong 
decrease 
of the 
intensity 
of the band at 3684cm-‘. 
The same is 
true 
for 
the 
less 
intense 
bands 
at

wavenumbers 
(3770 and 3795 cm-‘). The intensity 
of the band at 3770 is given in Fig. 5 as a function 
of Si02-content.

tesities

The composition 
of SiAI-40 is almost 
that of 
Si02A120, (37.08% SiO,). Probably 
this compound 
forms 
at least at the surface. 
Thus one might 
discuss 
two 
subsystems 
A120,A120,~Si02 
and 
SiO,Al,O,~SiO,. 
If this hypothesis 
is true, the 
spectra

should 
be a super- 
position 
of 
the 
spectra 
of 
the 
pure

dioxide absorbed 
as hydrogencarbonate 
is quickly 
desorbed and only the poisoning carbonate 
species 
are observed [21]. The formation 
of both species is 
reduced by fluorine as well as by chlorine (Fig. 9). 
For F containing 
aluminas 
showing mainly Bron- 
sted 
acidity 
this 
was 
to 
be 
expected. 
For 
chlorinated 
aluminas-for 
which 
the 
Lewis 
activity is increased- 
one may conclude 
that the 
activity of the Lewis centers 
must greatly be in- 
creased to give a higher overall activity, 
though 
the number of centers is reduced. 
In order to reproduce this effect, CO2 adsorption 
was investigated 
on chlorine 
containing 
q-A1203 
too (Fig. IO). The results were principally 
the same 
as with -y-AI,O,. Thus one may conclude 
that by 
halogenation 
the number 
of Lewis acid sites is 
reduced 
as on silica-aluminas 
[21]. The different 
catalytic 
behavior 
is caused 
by activation 
of 
different 
sites, Bronsted-sites 
by fluorination 
and 
on 
silica-aluminas 
[23] 
and 
Lewis-centers 
by 
chlorination.
