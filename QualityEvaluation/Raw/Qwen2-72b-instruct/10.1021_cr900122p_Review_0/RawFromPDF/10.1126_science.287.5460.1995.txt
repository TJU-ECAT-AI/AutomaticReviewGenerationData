Functionalization of Alkanes  
Huiyuan Chen,' Sabine ~chlecht,'

The formation of a single product from terminal functionalization of linear 
alkanes from a transition metal-catalyzed reaction is reported. The rhodium 
complex Cp*Rh(q4-C,Me,) 
(Cp*, C5Me5; Me, methyl) catalyzes the high-yield 
formation of linear alkylboranes from commercially available borane reagents 
under thermal conditions. These reactions now allow catalytic, regiospecific 
functionalization of alkanes under thermal conditions. The organoborane prod- 
ucts are among the most versatile synthetic intermediates in chemistry and 
serve as convenient precursors t o  alcohols, amines, and other common classes 
of functionalized molecules. 
Alkanes are among the most abundant but least 
reactive molecules. This low reactivity, partic- 
ularly at the terminal position of the alkane, has 
prevented their direct conversion into industri- 
ally important chemicals such as linear alco- 
hols, linear arnines, and a-olefms. Instead of 
selectively producing these desired products, 
which contain a single functional group at the 
end of an alkyl chain, reactions of alkanes 
typically form mixtures. When good selectivity 
is observed, internal positions or both internal 
and terminal positions of the alkane react to 
produce, for example, tert-butylhydroperoxide 
from isobutane or maleic anhydride from n- 
butane (1). Certain transition metals do react 
cleanly at the end of the alkane to produce 
n-alkyl complexes (2, 3),but these transforma- 
tions involve stoichiometric amounts of expen- 
sive metal reagents; catalytic reactions that se- 
lectively functionalize the terminal positions of 
alkanes are rare. Transition metalkcatalyzed de- 
hydrogenation gives alkene regioisomers (4-
6), and photocatal 
ytic carbonylation produces 
secondary photoproducts (7). Both processes 
also suffer from unfavorable thermodynamics. 
Enzymes that oxidize 
higher alkanes than meth- 
ane and ethane give regioisomeric mixtures. 
Here, we report a regiospecific catalytic func- 
tionalization of linear alkanes under thermal 
conditions:

reagents to form linear alkylboranes (Scheme 
1). These borane products are common, well- 
developed synthetic intermediates in organic 
chemistry. They are easily converted to amines, 
alcohols, alkenes, and other classes of function- 
alized molecules in a single step (8, 9).

We previously reported the stoichiometric 
reaction of transition metal-boryl complexes 
(L,M-BR,, where L is a ligand, M is a metal, 
and R is an organic substituent) with alkanes 
to produce linear alkylboranes: 
(10, 11). 
We then pursued a selective catalyt- 
ic reaction of alkanes that incorporates a sim- 
ilar stoichiometric step into a catalytic cycle. 
We disclosed the reaction of diboron reagents 
(R,BBR,; R, = pinacolate) with alkanes cat- 
alyzed by Cp*Re(CO), (Cp*, C,Me,; Me, 
methyl) to produce linear alkylboranes under 
photochemical conditions (12). This photo- 
chemistry led to the selective, catalytic reac- 
tions under the thermal conditions described 
below (13).

SCIENCE VOL 287

1995 
For thermal alkane functionalization, we 
focused on transition metal complexes that 
contained a Cp* ligand to provide structural 
similarity to our photocatalyst and to systems 
that add alkanes stoichiometrically (2, 3, 14- 
17). We also sought systems that would gen- 
erate boryl complexes from R,BBR, 
or 
HBR, by oxidative addition (18) and would 
form unsaturated boryl complexes by ther- 
mal dative-ligand dissociation. Metal polyhy 
drides extrude H, 
under thermal condi-
tions (19, 20), and alkene complexes dis- 
sociate alkene thermally. Thus, we initially 
tested Cp*IrH4 (1) (21) and Cp*Ir(C,H,), 
(2) (22) as catalysts for the reaction of 
(22). Indeed, complex 3 catalyzed the reac- 
tion of octane with pinBBpin at 1 
50°C to give 
complete conversion of pinBBpin to HBpin 
after 1 hour. The yield of n-octylBpin was 
actually higher than the amount of converted 
diboron reagent, which suggested that HBpin 
was also reacting with octane on this time 
scale. Heating for an additional 4hours led to 
complete consumption of HBpin and to the 
formation of n-octylBpin in 84% overall yield. 
Analysis of the borane products by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) 
showed that n-octylBpin was the only isomer 
formed. No products from functionalization at 
the internal positions were observed. The 2-oc- 
4,4,4',4',5,5,5',5'-octamethyl-2,2'-bi-l,3,2-tyl isomer was prepared independently from 
dioxaborolane (pinBBpin) (23) with octane: 
Reactions catalyzed by 10 mol% 1gave some 
functionalized product, but yields were low 
and never exceeded 20%. In contrast, reac- 
tions catalyzed by 10 mol% 2 gave 58% yield 
for the two-step process that produces two 
equivalents of 2-(1-octy1)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-
1,3,2-dioxaborolane 
(n-octylBpin) for each di- 
boron reagent (24). However, these reactions 
were slow; complete conversion of 4,433- 
tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane
(HBpin) gen- 
erated from pinBBpin and octane required 10 
days at 200°C. 
To accelerate this reaction, we used the 
second-row analog of 2, Cp*Rh(C,H,), 
(3) 
2-chlorooctane and was shown to be absent 
from the catalytic reaction mixtures by GC-MS 
techniques. However, a number of minor or- 
ganoborane products formed from the ethylene 
ligands. EthylBpin, C,H,(Bpin),, 
C,H,(Bpin),, 
and C,H,(Bpin), were all detected by GC-MS. 
These products were not prepared independent- 
ly andtherefore are known only by their ele- 
mental composition. It was clear that improved 
yields relied on limiting reactivity of the alkene 
ligands or reducing catalyst loads. 
Surprisingly, reactions catalyzed by the 
more labile vinylsilane complex Cp*Rh- 
(C,H,SiMe,), 
(4) (25) or the alkene-free com- 
plex Cp*Rh(H),(SiEG), (5) (26) occurred in 
lower yields than those catalyzed by 3. Thus, 
we tested the rarely studied 
hexamethylbenzene 
complex Cp*Rh(q4-C,Me,) 
(6) (27) that 
would extrude unreactive hexamethylben- 
zene. Reactions of pinBBpin with octane 
catalyzed by 5 mol% 6 at 150°C showed no 
ligand borylation products, and the rates 
were faster than those for reactions cata- 
lyzed by 4 or 5. Analysis of the crude 
reactions by GC again showed that the 
terminal product was the only octylborane 
formed. After 25 hours, complete conver-
sion of the borane had occurred, and the 
yield for the overall process in Eq. 2 was 
88%. Reactions catalyzed by hexamethyl- 
benzene complex 6 were initially slower than 
those catalyzed 
by bisiethylene) complex 3, but 
Table 1. Regiospecific, catalytic functionalization of alkanes, alkyl ethers, and benzene. A solution of 
catalyst and diboron compound was heated at 150°C.A known amount of dodecahydrotriphenylene 
(internal standard) was added to the reaction after complete consumption of both pinBBpin and HBpin. 
Yields were determined by CC 
for the overall reaction pinBBpin + R-H -+ RBpin + H

6 showed greater long-term activity. Reactions

sion and 72% yield for the overall reaction in 
Eq. 2 after 80 hours. The reaction catalyzed by 
1 mol% 3 under identical conditions gave 64% 
yield after 1 
10 hours. 
Table 1 shows the yields for reactions of 
several alkanes, di-n-butyl ether, and ben- 
zene with pinBBpin to form functionalized 
product and H,. Reactions of 2-methylhep- 
tane provided only products from primary 
C-H bond functionalization in a 5 : 1 mix- 
ture of regioisomers favoring functionaliza- 
tion of the less hindered methyl group. 
Reactions of methylcyclohexane were slow, 
perhaps because of the lower concentration 
and greater steric hindrance of the methyl 
groups. Reaction of di-n-butyl ether with the 
diboron reagent was rapid, but the subse- 
quent reaction of pinacolborane was slow. 
Thus, higher catalyst loadings were re-
quired, and lower yields were observed af- 
ter 80 hours than were observed for reac- 
tions of alkanes. Benzene was particularly 
reactive, and 82% yield of arylboronate 
ester was observed when using 0.5 mol% 
catalyst (328 turnovers). 
The clean reaction between octane and the 
HBpin formed in situ suggested that a dehy- 
drogenative coupling of pinacolborane with 
octane could be observed without initiating 
the reactions with diboron reagents. Indeed, 
reaction of pinacolborane with octane in the 
presence of 5 mol% 6 formed n-octylBpin in 
1
4 hours, in 65% yield: 
Again, the reactions were regiospecific for 
the terminal position of the alkane. 
The exclusive selectivity for borylation 
at alkane methyl groups results from kinet- 
ic factors. The reaction of pinBBpin with 
octane was conducted in the presence of 
2-(2-butany1)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-
1,3,2-
dioxaborolane in a sealed tube, and no 
isomerization of the 2-butyl boronate ester 
to the 1-butyl isomer occurred. Thus, the 
terminal product is not formed by isomer- 
ization of an internal alkylboronate ester 
formed initially. The high selectivity for 
the termini of alkanes is similar to that for 
the stoichiometric reaction of certain tran- 
sition metal complexes with linear alkanes 
(2, 3) and, in simple terms, results from a 
steric preference for formation of a linear 
metal-alkyl complex.

A detailed mechanism for the overall 
catalytic process cannot yet be deduced, but 
an outline of a potential mechanism is 
provided in Scheme 2. Oxidative addition 
of borane or diboron compound, depend- 
ing on the boron reagent present, could 
form a hydridorhodium boryl complex or a 
rhodium bis(bory1) complex. After elimina- 
tion of H, or borane to create an open 
coordination site, such complexes could 
then react with alkane to produce an alkyl- 
rhodium boryl complex. Rapid B-C bond 
formation would then lead to product. To 
probe for the presence of metal-boryl inter- 
mediates, we obtained "B nuclear magnet- 
ic resonance (NMR) spectra of reactions 
of the diboron compound with octane at 
high catalyst loads. We observed a reso- 
nance at 640 during the reaction, and this 
chemical shift, which is located downfield 
of the organoboronate esters and pina-
colborane, is characteristic of a metal-boryl 
species.

To determine the identity of this observed 
complex, we conducted a variety of reactions 
of pinBBpin and HBpin with nearly stoichi- 
ometric amounts of rhodium complex in al- 
kane solvent. Of these reactions, we found 
that the combination of silyl complex 5 and 
pinBBpin at 150°C in pentane solvent in a 
sealed tube most cleanly formed a metal-
boron complex that displayed the same "B 
NMR signal at 640 as was observed in the 
catalytic reaction:

Despite efforts using various reaction con- 
ditions, a maximum conversion to this 
complex of 60% was achieved. However, 
we were able to separate the two metal 
complexes from the free boron products. 
We could tentatively assign a structure for 
the metal-boron species as 7 from 'H NMR 
data of a mixture of the metal-boron com- 
plex and 5. A single pinacol methyl reso- 
nance was observed, which suggests the 
trans geometry of 7. A broad doublet signal 
was observed for the two hydrides at 
- 12.78 
ppm (coupling constant JH-, 
= 48 
Hz), which integrated 2 :15 versus the Cp* 
resonance. This signal did not show direct 
scalar B-H coupling, but line widths in-
creased with temperature. These data are 
consistent with slower time constants T, 
and small scalar couplings to the quadru- 
polar boron at higher temperatures (28). 
Reaction of isolated 7 with octane at 150°C 
was rapid and generated two equivalents of 
n-octylBpin per Cp*Rh fragment in 90% 
yield, confirming the presence of two boryl 
ligands on 7. Again, no internal alkylbo- 
rane products were formed. These data in- 
dicate that 7 is kinetically and chemically 
competent to be an intermediate in the cat- 
alytic reactions. 
If compound 7 or a species generated 
from 7 is an intermediate, then reactions 
catalyzed by alkene and arene complexes 3 
and 6 would show the same selectivity. 
Indeed, reaction of pinBBpin with an 
equimolar mixture of octane and octane-d,, 
showed a rate constant ratio kHlk,, (150°C) 
of 1.9 2 0.1 for reactions catalyzed by 3 
and 2.0 i 0.1 for those catalyzed by 6 (29). 
In addition, the product ratio from reaction 
of pinBBpin at the two termini of 2-meth- 
ylheptane was the same for reactions cata- 
lyzed by 3 (4.8 i 0.4) and 6 (5.3 i 0.4). 
The same selectivity (5.0 i 0.5) was ob- 
served with isolated 7, which suggests that 
it is involved in the catalytic process. Com- 
plicated HID exchange of the alkanes pre- 
vented accurate isotope effect measure-
ments for the stoichiometric reaction of 7 
with octane. 
Unusual thermodynamic properties of 
borane reagents provide the driving force 
for the overall process. The B-B, B-C, and 
B-H bond energies of closely related boron 
compounds have been determined compu- 
tationally (30, 31). From these data, the 
B-C (112 kcalimol) and B-H (111 kcali 
mol) bonds formed in the initial stage of the 
reaction are, taken together, 21 kcalimol 
stronger than the B-B (104 kcalimol) and 
C-H (98 kcallmol) (32) bonds broken, 
whereas the B-C and H, (104 kcalimol) 
bonds formed in the second stage are 7 
kcallmol stronger than the B-H and C-H 
bonds broken. 
The organoboranes produced by the bo- 
rylation process are among the most versa- 
tile synthetic intermediates in chemistry. 
Reactions of organoboranes with hydrogen 
peroxide, hydroxylamine, and CO yield al- 
cohols, amines, and ketones, respectively. 
Simple thermolysis under vacuum can pro- 
duce a-olefins (8, 33, 34). With the proper 
substituents at boron, this final process 
could extrude the same borane reagent that 
was used in the alkane fimctionalization step to 
allow recycling of the main group reagent for 
large-scale synthesis. In addition, this type of 
alkane fimctionalization could deliver a func- 
tional group to the end of an alkyl chain during 
the synthesis of more complex structures than 
those in linear alcohols, amines, or alkenes.
