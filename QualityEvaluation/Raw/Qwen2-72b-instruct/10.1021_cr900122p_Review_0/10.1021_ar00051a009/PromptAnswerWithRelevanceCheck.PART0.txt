Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

The document does not provide information on how isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, the mechanisms involved in these processes, or how these principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, specifically the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. However, it is known that in heterogeneous catalysis, isolated metal centers on oxide surfaces can activate C-H bonds through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, where oxygen from the oxide lattice is transferred to the alkane, or through H-abstraction, where a hydrogen atom is directly removed from the alkane. These processes are important in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the selectivity is controlled by the nature of the metal center and the reaction conditions.

如何在多相催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心促进C-H键的活化，这些过程中涉及什么机制（如Mars van Krevelen和H-抽提），以及这些原理如何应用于工业中选择性氧化烷烃，以丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例？

文件没有提供关于氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何在多相催化中促进C-H键活化，这些过程中涉及的机制，或这些原理如何应用于工业中选择性氧化烷烃，特别是丁烷转化为马来酸酐的信息。然而，已知在多相催化中，氧化物表面上的孤立金属中心可以通过Mars van Krevelen机制活化C-H键，其中氧化物晶格中的氧被转移到烷烃，或通过H-抽提，其中直接从烷烃中移除一个氢原子。这些过程在工业选择性氧化烷烃中很重要，例如丁烷转化为马来酸酐，其中选择性由金属中心的性质和反应条件控制。
