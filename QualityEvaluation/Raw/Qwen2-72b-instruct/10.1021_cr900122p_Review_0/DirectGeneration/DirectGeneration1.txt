C-H bond activation, a pivotal process in catalysis, has been extensively explored in the realm of heterogeneous catalysis, particularly focusing on the role of isolated metal centers on oxide materials. These centers, often found on the surface of metal oxides, exhibit unique electronic properties that facilitate the selective activation of C-H bonds in alkanes, a process that is otherwise kinetically and thermodynamically challenging. The activation mechanisms typically involve the oxidative addition of the C-H bond to the metal center, followed by a series of redox and/or acid-base reactions that lead to the formation of functionalized products. This approach has been instrumental in developing catalytic processes for the selective oxidation of alkanes, a significant advancement in the chemical industry. By precisely tuning the metal center's electronic and geometric properties, researchers have achieved high selectivity and efficiency in alkane oxidation, paving the way for sustainable and economically viable routes to produce value-added chemicals from abundant hydrocarbons.
