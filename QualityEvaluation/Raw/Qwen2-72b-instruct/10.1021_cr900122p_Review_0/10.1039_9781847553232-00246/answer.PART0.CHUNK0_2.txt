1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the selective oxidation of alkanes. The mechanism often involves the abstraction of hydrogen atoms (H-abstraction) or the donation of hydrogen ions (H+ donation). The principles of these processes are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This reaction has been well studied and sufficient data have been obtained to understand the mechanism and conditions for optimal yield. The catalytic performance of different metal oxide-based catalysts has been compared for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes, and the best operative conditions for achieving high yields have been analyzed. The selective oxidation of paraffins, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, involves addressing how to stop the oxidation at intermediate products without operating at very low contact times, understanding the mechanism of paraffin activation, and determining if selectivity is related to the activation mechanism.
