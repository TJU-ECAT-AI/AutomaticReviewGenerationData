1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the selective oxidation of alkanes. The mechanisms involved include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. The principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, which is a well-studied process. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts, which are used in this process, depends on the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, influenced by the type of aliphatic alcohol used, the temperature of reduction of V5+, and other parameters, affects the exposure of the (001) plane, creates strain in the crystallite, and influences the extent of reduction of V5+. A P/V ratio higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilizes the catalyst not only in the reactants' atmosphere but also for calcination in air at high temperatures. The reaction pattern for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites required. The rate-determining step is the first one, the activation of the paraffin, which is facilitated by the vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst with high selectivity.

1. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites varies depending on the preparation method, solvent type, and P/V ratio. The excess phosphorus in the precursor is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate, stabilizing the (VO)P207 phase. The P/V ratio, minimization of impurities, morphology, low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere, and the presence of additives like Zn2+ are crucial for avoiding the oxidation of the catalyst. Different phases in calcined catalysts can cooperate to improve catalytic behavior. The mechanism of the reaction involves the activation of n-butane with high selectivity by vanadium phosphates, which is a key property for the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the selective oxidation of alkanes. The mechanism often involves the abstraction of hydrogen atoms (H-abstraction) or the donation of hydrogen ions (H+ donation). The principles of these processes are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This reaction has been well studied and sufficient data have been obtained to understand the mechanism and conditions for optimal yield. The catalytic performance of different metal oxide-based catalysts has been compared for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes, and the best operative conditions for achieving high yields have been analyzed. The selective oxidation of paraffins, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, involves addressing how to stop the oxidation at intermediate products without operating at very low contact times, understanding the mechanism of paraffin activation, and determining if selectivity is related to the activation mechanism.

[25] "By means of electron microscopy,103 it has been observed that the dehydrated phase maintains the morphology of the precursor.

[28] "In catalysts activated in air, the transformation from an amorphous phase to an almost completely crystal- line vanadylpyrophosphate inside the reactor (in the presence of the reactant's mixture) requires more than 100 hours?6 The global effect in catalytic behavior is an increase in the yield of maleic anhydride,owing to the fact that the catalyst can operate at higher temperature and conversion maintaining high selectivity (values of 56 percent molar yield have been reached, as shown in Figure 4).Also in catalysts activated in nitrogen, where the fresh catalyst is a pyrphosphate? modifications in activ- ity occur along the frrst 100 hours. The temperature of the reactor is progres- sively decreased; as a consequence, the conversion of n-butane is decreased, but nevertheless the yield to maleic anhydride increases due to the fact that the selectivity is increased. During this activation procedure the structure of the pyrophosphate remains stable, with only a slight oxidation of vanadium (the average oxidation state increases from 4,000 to 4.004) and a slight decrease in the bulk atomic P/V ratio."
[29] "After the stage of activation, changes occur during prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture, in both the catalytic behavior and the physicochemical properties of the catalyst."
[30] "A fresh catalyst has been designated2 as a "nonequilibrated" one, while a catalyst after prolonged time-on-stream has been designated as an "equilibrated" one. In the same review: warning has been given against extrapolation of the initial activity of the catalyst to its behavior in industrial-like conditions."
[31] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
[32] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03).37-39 Equilibrated catalysts are no longer reoxidizable in air at 400 O C ,  contrary to a freshly prepared (VO),P,O, or with non- equilibrated catalysts."
[33] "However, they did not observe changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning,but only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004."
[34] "It is now possible to modify the previous explanation that has been given on the role of defects in nonequilibrated catalysts prepared in an organic medium. It has been proposed that defects increase the Lewis acidity of calcined catalysts, which is necessary for n-butane activation? Even though it is not yet possible to rule out that the defects are responsible for the higher activity of nonequilibrated catalysts,it Seems that their main role may be in directing or facilitating the transformation of the surface of a fresh catalyst (and perhaps a l s o"

How- ever, equilibrated catalysts prepared in an organic medium still maintain higher activity and selectivity than those prepared in an aqueous medium."
[37] "Therefore, the defects in the (100) crystal plane do not seem to be directly related to the higher activity resulting from organic preparation, and other factors must be taken into consideration to explain the better catalytic perfor- mance. These authors also have not observed big changes in bulk composi- tion and in P/V surface ratio during the conditioning time."

[39] "2.2.4 Rolc o f the PN Ratio. - Optimal catalyst composition presents a slight excess of phosphorus with respect to the stoichiometric value of the precursor. 10*16*19*41"
[40] "By means of XPS analysis,many inestigators,8** with the exception of Okuhara et al.$l have found a higher P/V ratio (in the range 1.5 to 3) on the surface than in the bulk. According to Okuhara et al.?l the differences in P/V ratio observed in the literature might be due to the use of incorrect reference compounds. By means of secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analyis:a surface atomic ratio higher than 5 was found, with a bulk P/V ratio lower than 1.1."
[41] "There is a general agreement that a high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of v4+ in (VO),P,O,?*J Reported in Figure 6 are the indexes of reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst as functions of the P/V ratio.44 The amount of V5+ observed in the catalyst after Figure 6 Effect of the P N  atomic ratio on the amount of V5+ and V3+ formed in air and in 2% H , In He In (VO),P,O,?"
[42] "In catalysts with a slight defect of phosphorus (P/V=0.95), a considerable increase of the ease of oxidation (with respect to the catalyst with P/V=l.O) occurs, and the reducibility remains high. For P/V ratios higher than 1, both the reoxidizability and the reducibility of the catalyst decrease considerably. It has been found that high relative amounts of V5+ increase the activity and decrease the selectivity, while the low reducibility of V4+ is an index of low activity. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity. According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
[43] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."

1. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by factors such as the method of preparation, P/V ratio, presence of additives, and activation and conditioning procedures at high temperatures. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent, with a slight excess of phosphorus and defects in the stacking of platelets. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites varies depending on the preparation method, solvent, P/V ratio, and other factors. The excess phosphorus is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate. The transformation of the precursor to the active phase can result in different phases, and the P/V ratio, morphology, and presence of additives play key roles in avoiding the oxidation of (VO),P207 and the intermediate amorphous phase to a V5+ phosphate. The activation procedure involves either activation in an oxygen-free atmosphere followed by introduction of the reactant mixture or calcination in air until a temperature lower than 400°C is reached. The conditioning procedure involves changes in the catalytic behavior and physicochemical properties of the catalyst during prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture. The equilibrated catalyst has stable V4+ and is no longer reoxidizable in air at 400°C. The P/V ratio influences the reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst, with a slight excess of phosphorus providing the right compromise for high activity and selectivity.

[14] "In summary, the effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."
[15] "In the preparation with benzyl alcohol as the reducing agent, many authors report the formation of platelets with stacking faults (deduced from the preferential broadening of the [Ool] reflection) attributed to the trapping of alcohol between the layers of the precursor and its release during actiation."

1. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has provided significant insights into the activation of paraffins. The catalyst used, (VO)2P2O7, has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature, and its properties and the mechanism of activation that allow high selectivity have been elucidated. The catalyst's ability to activate n-butane selectively is attributed to its unique properties, which include the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the P/V ratio, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation of the catalyst involves a complex chemistry that can influence the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and affect the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio is crucial, as a slight excess of phosphorus stabilizes the catalyst and prevents its oxidation. The morphology of the catalyst, particularly the exposure of the (100) plane, affects its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also influence the catalyst's behavior. The mechanism of the reaction involves several steps, including oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, which are facilitated by the polyfunctional nature of the V-P catalysts.
