[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of paraffin selective oxidation that has been well studied."
[2] "Sufficient data have been thus far obtained so that an attempt can be made in the present review to answer these questions."
[3] "For the gas-phase oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane. the catalytic performance of different metal oxide-based catalysts has been compared, and the best operative conditions to achieve the highest yield to olefins have been analyzed."
[4] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin.' The catalyst and the reaction have been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature?"
[5] "Knowledge of the type of active sites and the features of the activation mechanism that allow high selectivity to be obtained can be useful in improving selectivity and activity in the oxidation of other paraffins."
[6] "The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters,8 (2) embedding the precursor with Z r and Ti pyrophosphate' in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology.596"
[7] "The aim of this review is to confirm, modify, complete, or reject the main conclusions reported in a previous review? based on the results reported in the scientific literature of the last few years."
[8] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high tempera- ture."
[9] "The main difference ob- served in several precursors is the morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites."
[10] "The spectra confm previous findings: precursors prepared in an aqueous medium are more crystalline and exposure of the basal plane (001) is less pronounced; no preferential line broadening of the reflection relative to the (001) plane is observed?4"
[11] "In precursors prepared in an organic solvent (the most investigated preparation),the morphology depends on many factors such as: Nature of the solvent (aliphatic or aromatic P/V ratio;"
[12] "The following steps for the formation of the precursor in organic solvents can be Formation of colloidal V205 at the water-alcohol interface (this has been proposed by some authors," but according to others13 it is not an important Solubilization of V5+ through the formation of V'+-alcoholate (V& does not form soluble alcohol ate);' Reduction of the V'+-alcoholate in the liquid phase to solid V,O,by the organic compound (the solvent itself or another more reactive alcohol, such as benzyl alcohol) or by an inorganic reducing agent (HCl, S02);'3*'8 and proposed:step);"
[13] "In the preparation in an aqueous medium, the following steps for the formation of the precursor can be proposed: Reduction of V205 to a soluble V4+ species; After addition of H3P04 no precipitation occurs, due to the strong acid (while in a basic medium amorphous NH4V02HP04 forms22); Development of a (VO)HPO4.O.5H2O phase, together with another spurious amorphous phase, after complete evaporation of the solvent;516 and Alternatively, formation of the precursor by crystallization of pure (VO)HP04.0.5H20 through addition of water when the solution is highly concentrated (when it is very"
[14] "In summary, the effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."
[15] "In the preparation with benzyl alcohol as the reducing agent, many authors report the formation of platelets with stacking faults (deduced from the preferential broadening of the [Ool] reflection) attributed to the trapping of alcohol between the layers of the precursor and its release during actiation."
[16] "In summary, the effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."
[17] "The effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."
[18] "The P/V ratio. P/V ratios in the precursor higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilize (VO)P207 not only in the reactants atmosphere but also for calcination in a i r at high temperature."
[19] "Minimization of impurities. The presence of free V2o5,l9 even in traces, or of additives such as Mn2+,22 facilitates the oxidation of the vanadylpyro- phosphate also in the reactant mixture."
[20] "Morphology. It has been proposed that the oxidation of (VO),P207 starts at the side faces of the (100) plane.2630.31 Catalysts with a higher exposure of the (100) plane, such as those prepared in an organic medium, are therefore less oxidizable."
[21] "Low-temperature of treatment in oxygen-containing atmosphere."
[22] "Precursors prepared in an organic medium, thus more defective, transform at lower temperature?-*l Additives. For example, the presence of Zn2+ as a promoter avoids the overoxidation of the catalyst at high temperatre."
[23] "It has been found20732733 that different phases present in calcined catalysts can cooperate improving the catalytic behavior."
[24] "By means of electron microscopy,103 it has been observed that the dehydrated phase maintains the morphology of the precursor."
[25] "In catalysts activated in air, the transformation from an amorphous phase to an almost completely crystal- line vanadylpyrophosphate inside the reactor (in the presence of the reactant's mixture) requires more than 100 hours?6"
[26] "The global effect in catalytic behavior is an increase in the yield of maleic anhydride,owing to the fact that the catalyst can operate at higher temperature and conversion maintaining high selectivity (values of 56 percent molar yield have been reached, as shown in Figure 4)."
[27] "Also in catalysts activated in nitrogen, where the fresh catalyst is a pyrphosphate? modifications in activ- ity occur along the frrst 100 hours."
[28] "During this activation procedure the structure of the pyrophosphate remains stable, with only a slight oxidation of vanadium (the average oxidation state increases from 4,000 to 4.004) and a slight decrease in the bulk atomic P/V ratio."
[29] "A fresh catalyst has been designated2 as a "nonequilibrated" one, while a catalyst after prolonged time-on-stream has been designated as an "equilibrated" one."
[30] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
[31] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03).37-39 Equilibrated catalysts are no longer reoxidizable in air at 400 O C ,  contrary to a freshly prepared (VO),P,O, or with non- equilibrated catalysts."
[32] "It has been proposed that defects increase the Lewis acidity of calcined catalysts, which is necessary for n-butane activation?"
[33] "However, they did not observe changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning,but only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004."
[34] "Therefore, the defects in the (100) crystal plane do not seem to be directly related to the higher activity resulting from organic preparation, and other factors must be taken into consideration to explain the better catalytic perfor- mance."
[35] "According to Kubias et al.,37 during conditioning a transformation of the surf= occurs from a situation where termination with pyrophosphate groups predominates to one where orthophosphate groups predominate,with simultaneous oxidation of to"
[36] "Optimal catalyst composition presents a slight excess of phosphorus with respect to the stoichiometric value of the precursor. 10*16*19*41"
[37] "By means of XPS analysis,many inestigators,8** with the exception of Okuhara et al.$l have found a higher P/V ratio (in the range 1.5 to 3) on the surface than in the bulk."
[38] "There is a general agreement that a high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of v4+ in (VO),P,O,?*J"
[39] "Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity."
[40] "According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
[41] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."
[42] "A generally accepted reaction pattern is reported in Table 2."
[43] "None of these intermediates is observed among the reaction products under usual reaction conditions."
[44] "The rate-determining step is the first one."
[45] "The reaction pattern described in Table 2 has been proposed on the basis of the following experimental facts: Table 2 Proposed steps in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride Reaction Type of reaction n-butane + butenes Oxidative dehydrogenation butenes + butadiene Allylic oxidation butadiene + 2,5-dihydrofuran 2,5-dihydrofuran + furan Allylic oxidation furan + lactone lactone + maleic anhydride 1-4 oxygen insertion Electrophylic oxygen insertion Electrophylic oxygen insertion"
[46] "The reaction pattern proposed in Table 2, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites that are required."
[47] "The peculiarities of (VOhP20,in carrying out the reactions shown in Table 2 are the following: 1. A first key property is the ability to activate the paraffin (the first step of the reaction pattern) with high selectivity;in fact, vanadium phosphates other than the vanadylpyrphosphate or molybdenum oxide-based are known"

1. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has provided significant insights into the activation of paraffins. The catalyst used, (VO)2P2O7, has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature, and its properties and the mechanism of activation that allow high selectivity have been elucidated. The catalyst's ability to activate n-butane selectively is attributed to its unique properties, which include the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the P/V ratio, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation of the catalyst involves a complex chemistry that can influence the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and affect the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio is crucial, as a slight excess of phosphorus stabilizes the catalyst and prevents its oxidation. The morphology of the catalyst, particularly the exposure of the (100) plane, affects its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also influence the catalyst's behavior. The mechanism of the reaction involves several steps, including oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, which are facilitated by the polyfunctional nature of the V-P catalysts.

1. 选择性氧化n-丁烷制马来酸酐是一个研究得很好的工业过程，它为理解烷烃的活化提供了重要的见解。所使用的催化剂(VO)2P2O7在科学文献中得到了彻底的研究，其性质和允许高选择性的活化机制已经被阐明。催化剂选择性活化n-丁烷的能力归因于其独特的性质，包括(VO)HP04.0.5H20结晶体的形态、P/V比以及在高温下激活和调节前体的方法。催化剂的制备涉及复杂的化学，可以影响(001)平面的暴露，造成晶粒的应变，并影响V5+还原的程度。P/V比是关键的，因为磷的轻微过量可以稳定催化剂，防止其氧化。催化剂的形态，特别是(100)平面的暴露，影响其氧化性。在含氧气氛中低温处理和某些添加剂的存在也可以影响催化剂的行为。反应机制涉及几个步骤，包括氧化脱氢、烯丙基氧化和亲电氧插入，这些步骤由V-P催化剂的多官能性性质促进。
