[14] "In both organic and aqueous media preparations, the precipitate has a higher P/V ratio than the stoichiometric value required for the preursor.* The maximum value corresponds to an atomic P/V ratio equal to 1.1 (excess P, if any is utilized, remains in the solvent) for both preparations."
[15] "The localization of this excess phosphorus in the precursor has not yet been clarified.

1. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites varies depending on the preparation method, solvent type, and P/V ratio. The excess phosphorus in the precursor is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate, stabilizing the (VO)P207 phase. The P/V ratio, minimization of impurities, morphology, low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere, and the presence of additives like Zn2+ are crucial for avoiding the oxidation of the catalyst. Different phases in calcined catalysts can cooperate to improve catalytic behavior. The mechanism of the reaction involves the activation of n-butane with high selectivity by vanadium phosphates, which is a key property for the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

1. 选择性氧化n-丁烷至马来酸酐是经过深入研究的工业过程，已在科学文献中进行了彻底的调查。V-P基催化剂的催化行为受前体制备方法、P/V比、添加剂的存在以及在高温下激活和调节前体的方法的影响。根据制备方法、溶剂类型和P/V比的不同，(VO) HP04.0.5H20晶体的形态会有所不同。前体中过量的磷吸附在钒磷酸盐的表面，稳定了(VO)P207相。P/V比、杂质的最小化、形态、在含氧气氛中低温处理以及Zn2+等添加剂的存在对于避免催化剂氧化至关重要。在煅烧催化剂中，不同的相可以协同作用，改善催化行为。反应机制涉及通过钒磷酸盐高选择性地激活n-丁烷，这是将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的关键属性。
