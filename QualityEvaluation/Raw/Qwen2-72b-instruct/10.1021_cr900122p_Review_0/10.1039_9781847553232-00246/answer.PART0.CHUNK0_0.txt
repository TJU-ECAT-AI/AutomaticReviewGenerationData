[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of paraffin selective oxidation that has been well studied."
[2] "Sufficient data have been thus far obtained so that an attempt can be made in the present review to answer these questions."
[3] "For the gas-phase oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane. the catalytic performance of different metal oxide-based catalysts has been compared, and the best operative conditions to achieve the highest yield to olefins have been analyzed."
[4] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin.' The catalyst and the reaction have been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature?"
[5] "The aim of this review is to confirm, modify, complete, or reject the main conclusions reported in a previous review? based on the results reported in the scientific literature of the last few years."
[6] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."
[7] "The main difference ob- served in several precursors is the morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites."
[8] "The type of aliphatic alcohol influences the temperature of reduction of V 5 which is kinetically controlled and complete only when benzyl alcohol (which forms benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) is utilized, when a long reduction time is used, and when the phosphoric acid is added."
[9] "The effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."

[12] "The rate-determining step is the first one. Indeed, the initial rate of oxidation of 1-butene is from 2045 to 60 times2 higher than that of n-butane."
[13] "The reaction pattern proposed in Table 2, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites that are required."
[14] "The peculiarities of (VOhP20,in carrying out the reactions shown in Table 2 are the following: 1. A first key property is the ability to activate the paraffin (the first step of the reaction pattern) with high selectivity;in fact, vanadium phosphates other than the vanadylpyrphosphate or molybdenum oxide-based are known"

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the selective oxidation of alkanes. The mechanisms involved include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. The principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, which is a well-studied process. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts, which are used in this process, depends on the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, influenced by the type of aliphatic alcohol used, the temperature of reduction of V5+, and other parameters, affects the exposure of the (001) plane, creates strain in the crystallite, and influences the extent of reduction of V5+. A P/V ratio higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilizes the catalyst not only in the reactants' atmosphere but also for calcination in air at high temperatures. The reaction pattern for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites required. The rate-determining step is the first one, the activation of the paraffin, which is facilitated by the vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst with high selectivity.

1.氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过提供活性位点促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。涉及的机制包括Mars van Krevelen机制和H-抽象。这些原理应用于工业选择性氧化烷烃，例如丁烷转化为马来酸酐，这是一个研究得很好的过程。V-P基催化剂的催化行为，用于此过程，取决于前驱体的制备方法、P/V比、添加剂的存在以及高温下的激活和调节方法。(VO)HP04.0.5H20晶体的形态，受所用脂肪醇类型、V5+还原温度和其他参数的影响，影响(001)平面的暴露，造成晶体中的应变，并影响V5+还原的程度。P/V比高于化学计量量不仅在反应物气氛中稳定催化剂，而且在高温下在空气中煅烧。丁烷氧化为马来酸酐的反应模式，这是机制的第一近似，显示了获得马来酸酐所需的初级步骤和所需的活性位点类型。决定速率的步骤是第一步，即烷烃的活化，这由具有高选择性的钒酸盐催化剂促进。
