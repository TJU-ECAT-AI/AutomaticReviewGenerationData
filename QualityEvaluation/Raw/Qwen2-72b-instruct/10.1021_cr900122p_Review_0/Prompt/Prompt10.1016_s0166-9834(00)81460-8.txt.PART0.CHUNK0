ABSTRACT
The hydrogen exchange reaction between CD, and CH, was investigated over alumina, silica, titanium oxide, magnesia, and alumina modified with acid and base.
When evacuated at 600C. alumina was found to be most active followed by magnesia while silica and titanium oxide were totally inactive at any temperatures up to
600C.
Alumina modified with 9% of K-CO, retained about 20% of the oriqinal activity, but one impregnated with 5%ofJH2S0,+completely lost the actiiity.
It was found that the surface density of active sites of alumina measured with carbon dioxide with the aid of TPD was one order of magnitude smaller than that estimated previously.
The exchange reaction between CD, and the surface hydroxyl groups was also studied and the involvement of the surface hydroxyl groups in the CD,-CH,exchange reaction was discussed.
INTRODUCTION
The conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons has attracted wide attention since natural gas became an important alternative source of energy.
In almost any catalytic process for the conversion of methane, the rupture of the C-H bond of methane is required as the first step.
The hydrogen exchange of methane may be used as a test reaction to evaluate the capability of catalyst for splitting the bond.
The catalytic exchange of hydrogen between methane molecules, between methane and hydrogen and between methane and the surface hydroxyl groups of catalyst has been studied on various oxide catalysts by several investigators Cl-31.
While we were studying a conversion reaction of methane, we felt it necessary to study further the exchange reaction of methane over some oxides which are used for the conversion reaction as catalysts by themselves or as supports.
In this paper we report the results of the hydrogen exchange between CD, and CH, and between CD,,and the surface OH groups on alumina, titanium oxide, silica, magnesia and alumina modified with acid and base.
Particular attention was paid to the active sites on alumina since Larson and Hall Cl 1 reported that a small number of hydroxyl groups 174 of alumina were involved in the exchange reaction, while Flockhart et al. [4] claimed no involvement of hydroxyl groups in the D2-propane exchange.
In the rest of the present paper the isotopic equilibration reaction between CD, and CH, will be called simply the equilibration reaction and the term "exchange reaction" will be used for the hydrogen exchange reaction between CD, and the surface OH groups.
EXPERIMENTAL
METHODS
Materials Alumina (Alon) and silica (Cab-0-Sil H-5) were both supplied by Cabot Corp., Boston, Mass.They were mixed with water, dried overnight at 1lO'C and finally calcined for 3 hr at 600C.Titanium oxide was P25 of Degussa Inc., Teterboro,
N.J., and was prepared in a similar way.
Final calcination was for 2 hr at 5OO'C.Magnesia was prepared from magnesium carbonate (J.T. Baker, analyzed reagent) which was first calcined for 3 hr at 600C, mixed with water, dried at 110C and finally recalcined for 3 hr at 600C.The Alon alumina was modified with acid by impregnating it with sulfuric acid (J.T. Baker, Ultrex).
After calcination at 5OO"C, it contained 4.5 wt% SO,,. A base-modified alumina, 9 wt% K,CO,/Al,O,, was prepared by mixing the Alon alumina with a K,CO, solution and calcined at 6OO'C.This catalyst was reported in more detail previously [5].All deuterated methanes were purchased from MSD Isotopes, Montreal, Canada, and the minimum atom% of D was 98%.UHP methane (99.97%) and research purity carbon dioxide (99.995%) were both purchased from Matheson of Canada.Apparatus and Procedure The apparatus used for the equilibration reaction was a closed recirculation system with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Dataquad, Spectrum Scientific Ltd., England) connected through a variable leak valve.The details of the apparatus were described elsewhere [6].The apparatus was greaseless and the total volume of the reaction system including the reactor was 590 ml.The equilibration reaction was carried out by circulating a 1:l mixture of CD, and CH, at a pressure of 6 Torr through the reactor containing about 0.2 g of catalyst while the isotopic composition of methane was monitored by the mass spectrometer.Since the least error was expected for CD, in the mass spectrometric analysis, the first order rate constant, k, was calculated from the equation x-x k =$lnL 'omXe where w is the weight of catalyst used, t is the reaction time, and x, x0 and x e are the fraction of CD,,at time t and 0 and at equilibrium,respectively. xe was calculated ignoring the isotope effect. 175 For the mass spectrometric analysis of the mixture of methane isotopes, the fragmental patterns of the individual isotopes were first obtained.The relative sensitivity of parent mass ion was then determined with a mixture of each isotope and CH,,in a known ratio.The relative sensitivities (CH,:l.OO) thus obtained with the present mass spectrometer with a Faraday cup were 1.18 (d4), 1.29 (ds), 1.31 (d2) and 1.13 (dl).The exchange reaction was followed by the infrared spectroscopy of surface hydroxyl groups with another recirculation system incorporated with an infrared cell.The cell described previously [7] was an inverse T-shape cell made of quartz.The catalyst disk was raised by an outer magnet to the upper part of the cell where it was treated at high temperatures or reacted with CD,.All spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Perkin-Elmer 2816 spectrophotometer.Temperature-programmed desorption was carried out in the apparatus used for the equilibration reaction by using an ionization gauge as detector.

FIGURE 1
Time course of CD,-CH, equilibration reaction on alumina at 4OO'C.At any reaction temperature,the total pressure of the gas remained constant and no higher hydrocarbons were detected by the mass spectrometer.The curves in Fig. 1 indicate that the equilibration reaction takes place via the exchange of only one hydrogen atom (or none) per each adsorption-desorption cycle.The first order rate constant, k, is listed in Table 1 together with results obtained with other oxides.Since k was obtained with the same amount of gas (1.85 x 10zo molecules of CD,) in 176 the reaction system for all catalysts, the activity of catalysts can be compared directly by the value of k.Alumina did not show any activity until it was evacuated at temperatures higher than 400C.Once it was evacuated at 600C for 2 hr, the equilibration reaction readily occurred even at room temperature as reported by Larson and Hall Cl].The activation energy measured after the stabilization of the catalyst by a prolonged evacuation at 600C was 30.5 kJ/mol.

The lowest evacuation temperature required for the equilibration reaction on magnesia was about 45O'C.The activity of magnesia maximized when the catalyst was evacuated at 600C.This is about 100C lower than the evacuation temperature observed by Utiyama et al. [3] for the maximum activity for CH,-D, exchange reaction.
When evacuated at 6OO"C, magnesia catalyzed the equilibration reaction above 250C, but the activity was one order of magnitude lower than that of alumina at 4OO'C as seen in Table 1.When alumina was impregnated with sulfuric acid, the activity for the equilibration reaction was totally lost.The surface density of sulfate ions was

ions/cm2.
Even with a higher surface density of potassium ions (8 x 1014 ions/cmz),however, the 9 wt% K,CO,/Al,O,catalyst reserved some activity, about 20% of that of the unmodified alumina as seen in Table 1. 177 TPD of carbon dioxide Larson and Hall [1] used carbon dioxide as a poison for the equilibration reaction on alumina and estimated the number of active sites as 3-4 x 101*/cm*.
We also carried out similar experiments by preadsorbing various amounts of CO, on the present alumina at 1OO'C and obtained a poisoning curve shown in Fig. 2. The results were in general agreement with those found by the previous investigators,that is, the number of active sites estimated is 2 x 1012/cm2 but the poisoning curve is not linear.This sort of measurement,however, does not necessarily offer the real number of sites but gives an upper limit of the site density because the poison molecules could adsorb on other sites as well.FIGURE 2 Poisoning of alumina with carbon dioxide.CO, was preadsorbed at 100C and partially removed at 120C before CD,-CH, reaction at 100C. 1 loo 200 300 400 500 600 FIGURE 3 TPD of CO, on alumina.CO, was adsorbed at 1OO'C and the amount adsorbed (molecules/cm2) was:a) 3.1 x 1012; b) 9.6 x loll; c) 7.2 x 1011; d) 5.6 x 1011;e) 4.4 x 1011. 178 In order to obtain further information on the state of the adsorption of CO, on alumina, a temperature-programmed desorption was carried out as shown in Fig. 3.When the amount of CO, adsorbed was larger than 3 x 101* molecules/cm2,the gas desorbed in a single peak as represented by spectrum a in Fig. 3. As the surface concentration was reduced (spectra b-e), however, the TPD spectra revealed at least three different peaks with peak maxima at 115, 220 and 28O"C, respectively (spectrum e).
Based on the above information,we conducted another series of poisoning experiments.
Initially an amount of CO, similar to spectrum a in Fig. 3 was adsorbed on alumina at lOO'C, then the surface concentration of CO, was gradually reduced by a series of stepwise TPD.After each TPD the temperature of the Catalyst was brought to 1OO'C where the activity was measured for the CD,-CH,equilibration reaction.Results are listed in Table 2 which shows that the catalyst was still poisoned fully after TPD up to 240C.The activity started to

Comparing these results with Fig. 3,it is obvious that the carbon dioxide which poisons the equilibration reaction is that which adsorbs most strongly and gives the TPD peak at 28O'C.From the peak areas measured during the stepwise TPD, the number of active sites was calculated as 2.2 x 1011 sites/cm* which was one order of magnitude smaller than the density estimated from the conventional poisoning experiments.Similar TPD-poisoning experiments with CO, were carried out on magnesia.It was found that CO, which poisons the equilibration reaction was not that which adsorbed most strongly .This carbon dioxide corresponds to the portion of TPD which desorbs between 450 and 500C as indicated by the shaded area under a TPD spectrum shown in Fig. 4.Indeed, the activity of the magnesia was fully recovered after TPD made up to 5OO"C, and did not change after that, in spite of the fact that more CO, was desorbed by TPD at higher temperatures.
The site density was obtained as
7.3 x 101* sites/cm*.
Exchange of surface hydroxyl groups Since the involvement of surface hydroxyl groups in the methane exchange reactions on alumina is an unsettled issue as mentioned earlier, the exchange reaction between CD, and the surface OH groups was examined with alumina and magnesia.
The catalysts evacuated at various temperatures were contacted with 6 Torr of CD4 for 15 min at selected temperatures and the infrared spectra of the hydroxyl groups were subsequently recorded at room temperature. 3800 3400 3Goo 2600

Below 25O"C,however, no exchange of hydroxyl groups was observed in 15 min while quite a large number of H-D exchanges took place in the same period of time during the equilibration reaction, This suggests that the hydroxyl groups are not involved in the CD,-CH, reaction at these low temperatures.

DISCUSSION
The C-H bond has to be broken in order for methane to exchange its hydrogen.
As proposed by Larson and Hall [l], methane will dissociatively adsorb on a pair of sites consisting of exposed aluminum and @- ions (dual acid-base sites) to form Al-CH, and OH groups.
They preferred a group of sites where the nearest neighbors of an isolated OH group are all aluminum ions.
Such OH groups give the lowest frequency infrared band at 3700 cm-1 [IO].
When CO, adsorbs on those sites, CD, is attached to an aluminum ion together with 00 and OH groups implying that all exchange reactions involve the hydroxyl groups of alumina.
As described earlier, Larson and Hall [l] estimated from the poisoning experiments that there are about 3 x 1012/c$ of readily exchangeable hydroxyl groups.
On the other hand, Flockhart et al. [4] observed that the C,H,-D, exchange reaction took place readily at room temperature on alumina while the exchange between C,D, and the hydroxyl groups were negligible under the same conditions.
From these results, they concluded that the hydroxyl groups of alumina were not involved directly in the propane-D2 exchange reaction.
The appearance of activity after evacuation of alumina above 400C certainly indicates that the active sites are associated with exposed aluminum and oxygen ions.
If the hydroxyl groups are involved in the equilibration reaction, those which give the highest frequency ir bands (3800-3780 cm-l) might be a likely candidate since they were exchanged with CD, most easily as pointed out in the previous section.
However, the population of these hydroxyl groups is about 6 x 1012/cs estimated from the total number of OH groups of Alon alumina evacuated at 600C [5], almost 30 times larger than the number of active sites (2.2 x lOll/cm*) found in the present study.
Moreover, no exchange of hydroxyl groups was observed in 15 min below 25O'C while the CD,-CH, reaction readily proceeded at those low temperatures as already pointed out.The present results suggest that the equilibration reacticn of methane on alumina involves no hydroxyl groups of the catalyst or that the number of hydroxyl groups associated with the active sites is extremely small.In order to examine 182 the possibility of the latter case, a sample of alumina was contacted with a small amount of CD, at 1OO'C for 15 min.A careful analysis of the gas phase indicated that a maximum of 1.3 x 10 11 H atoms/cm* could have been picked up as CD,H from the catalyst.This amount is the same order of magnitude as the density of active sites measured by the TPD of CO,.Unfortunately,the present infrared spectroscopy cannot detect such a small amount of exchange so that direct proof from the study of the surface is not possible.The equilibration reaction without the participation of the catalyst hydroxyl groups is possible, for example by the exchange of hydrogen between two methane molecules dissociatively adsorbed on the neighboring Al-0 pairs.However, this mechanism is unlikely since it requires a second order reaction with respect to methane.In any case, it appears that the exchange of the hydroxyl groups takes place at high temperatures through the migration of protons on the surface rather than the direct exchange between CD, and
OH.
The hydroxyl groups of 3800-3780 cm ml bands would then be most mobile.
As shown in Table 1, 9 wt% bCO,/Al,O,catalyst retained about 20% of the activity of the alumina in spite of a high surface density of the potassium ions.
Most of the hydroxyl groups of this catalyst were replaced by OK groups [5].
In contrast with potassi urn,sulfate ions poisoned the active sites much more selectively.
The reason is not clear at this stage.
A similar argument may be made for magnesia.
The number of active sites on magnesia is also small, 7.3 x 1012 sites/es,and the rate of the exchange of hydroxyl groups seems too slow for the full involvement in the equilibration reaction as described earlier.
On magnesia, however, the temperature ranges for the equilibration and the exchange reactions are rather close so that the matter is not as clear as the case of alumina.
Apparently,silica and titanium oxide are not capable of breaking the C-H bond of methane even after they are evacuated at high temperatures.
