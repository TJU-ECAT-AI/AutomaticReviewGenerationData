[1] "The direct and selective conversion of alkanes into oxygenates by oxidation with molecular oxygen has been a great challenge for decades."
[2] "Note that high selectivities are usually achieved for very specific substrates, which yield very stable products, e.g. propane  acrylic acid, butane  maleic anhydride, xylene  phtalic anhydride...."
[3] "The most noteworthy example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process."
[4] "One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."
[5] "Butane oxidation into maleic anhydride corresponds to a 14-electron oxidation process and involves several key stages: formation of butenes, then butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is then subsequently converted into maleic anhydride."
[6] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane."
[7] "The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species."
[8] "Alternative mechanisms have been proposed, such as the H-abstraction of butane by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers, which leads to strongly adsorbed 2-butene or 2-butanone, which can then be converted into butadiene via Brnsted acid catalysis."

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the selective oxidation of alkanes. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, involving the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen, is commonly involved in these processes. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a specific example of industrial selective oxidation, where butane is oxidized in a 14-electron process to form butenes, then butadiene, and finally 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is subsequently converted into maleic anhydride. The rate-determining step is the CH bond activation of butane, which can occur via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species or by H-abstraction of butane by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers.

1.氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过提供活性位点促进异相催化中的C-H键活化，用于选择性氧化烷烃。这些过程通常涉及Mars van Krevelen机制，包括金属氧化物氧化烷烃和分子氧再氧化固体。丁烷转化为马来酸酐是工业选择性氧化的一个具体例子，其中丁烷在14电子过程中被氧化形成丁烯，然后是丁二烯，最后是1,4-二氢呋喃，随后转化为马来酸酐。丁烷的C-H键活化是速率决定步骤，可以通过在VIVO物种上协同抽提两个氢原子或通过激活的O2与VIV中心配位的H-抽提丁烷来发生。
