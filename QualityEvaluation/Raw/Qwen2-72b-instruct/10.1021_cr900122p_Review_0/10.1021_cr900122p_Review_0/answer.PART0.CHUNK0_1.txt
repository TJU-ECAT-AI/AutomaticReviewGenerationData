1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the formation of organometallic species and intermediates. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are involved in these processes. In the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the C-H bond activation is often the rate-limiting step. The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species, followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2. Alternative mechanisms propose the H-abstraction of butane by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers, leading to strongly adsorbed 2-butene or 2-butanone, which can then be converted into butadiene via Brnsted acid catalysis.

1.在异相催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过提供活性位点，促进C-H键活化，形成有机金属物种和中间体。Mars van Krevelen机制和H-抽象参与这些过程。在工业选择性氧化烷烃中，如丁烷转化为马来酸酐，C-H键活化通常是速率限制步骤。最普遍接受的机制涉及通过VIVO物种的协同氢原子抽象将丁烷转化为2-丁烯，随后由O2重新氧化活性相。替代机制提出，由与VIV中心配位的活化O2进行丁烷的H-抽象，导致强烈吸附的2-丁烯或2-丁酮，然后通过Brnsted酸催化转化为丁二烯。
