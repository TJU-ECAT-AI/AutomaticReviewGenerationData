[1] "The selective activation and transformation of alkanes or aromatics have been a research goal for several decades."
[2] "CH bond activation is in fact a ubiquitous process in heterogeneous catalysis."
[3] "It involves various types of mechanisms and intermediates."
[4] "The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species."
[5] "The rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane."
[6] "The direct and selective conversion of alkanes into oxygenates by oxidation with molecular oxygen has been a great challenge for decades."
[7] "Note that high selectivities are usually achieved for very specific substrates, which yield very stable products, e.g. propane  acrylic acid, butane  maleic anhydride, xylene  phtalic anhydride...."
[8] "The most noteworthy example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process."

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the selective activation and transformation of alkanes or aromatics. The mechanisms involved in these processes include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. In the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane, which is achieved via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species. This process is a commercial example of the direct and selective conversion of alkanes into oxygenates by oxidation with molecular oxygen, where high selectivities are achieved for specific substrates that yield very stable products.

1.氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过提供活性位点促进异构催化中C-H键的活化，用于选择性活化和转化烷烃或芳烃。这些过程涉及的机制包括Mars van Krevelen机制和H-抽象。在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，决定速率的步骤是丁烷的C-H键活化，这是通过在VIVO物种上协同抽提两个氢原子实现的。这个过程是直接和选择性地将烷烃通过分子氧氧化转化为氧酸的商业实例，其中对于产生非常稳定产品的特定底物，可以实现高选择性。
