How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

[1] "The direct and selective conversion of alkanes into oxygenates by oxidation with molecular oxygen has been a great challenge for decades."
[2] "Note that high selectivities are usually achieved for very specific substrates, which yield very stable products, e.g. propane  acrylic acid, butane  maleic anhydride, xylene  phtalic anhydride...."
[3] "The most noteworthy example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process."
[4] "One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."
[5] "Butane oxidation into maleic anhydride corresponds to a 14-electron oxidation process and involves several key stages: formation of butenes, then butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is then subsequently converted into maleic anhydride."
[6] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane."
[7] "The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species."
[8] "Alternative mechanisms have been proposed, such as the H-abstraction of butane by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers, which leads to strongly adsorbed 2-butene or 2-butanone, which can then be converted into butadiene via Brnsted acid catalysis."

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the selective oxidation of alkanes. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, involving the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen, is commonly involved in these processes. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a specific example of industrial selective oxidation, where the rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation of butane. The commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species. Alternative mechanisms propose H-abstraction of butane by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers, leading to strongly adsorbed 2-butene or 2-butanone, which can then be converted into butadiene via Brnsted acid catalysis.

1.氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过提供活性位点来促进异相催化中的C-H键活化，从而实现烷烃的有选择性氧化。Mars van Krevelen机制，涉及金属氧化物氧化烷烃和分子氧再氧化固体，通常参与这些过程。丁烷转化为马来酸酐是工业有选择性氧化的具体实例，其中决定速率的步骤是丁烷的C-H键活化。普遍接受的机制涉及通过VIVO物种上的两个氢原子的协同抽提将丁烷转化为2-丁烯。替代机制提出，通过与VIV中心配位的活化O2对丁烷的H抽提，导致强烈吸附的2-丁烯或2-丁酮，然后可通过Brnsted酸催化转化为丁二烯。

[1] "The selective activation and transformation of alkanes or aromatics have been a research goal for several decades."
[2] "CH bond activation is in fact a ubiquitous process in heterogeneous catalysis."
[3] "It involves various types of mechanisms and intermediates."
[4] "CH bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years."
[5] "Here, we will focus on processes involving CH bond activation of alkanes and aromatics on isolated metal centers of surfaces on oxide materials leading to organometallic species and/or intermediates."
[6] "The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species (Scheme 5b), (95, 96) which is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2 (the Mars van Krevelen mechanism)."
[7] "Alternative mechanisms have been proposed, such as the H-abstraction of butane by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers, which leads to strongly adsorbed 2-butene or 2-butanone, which can then be converted into butadiene via Brnsted acid catalysis."
