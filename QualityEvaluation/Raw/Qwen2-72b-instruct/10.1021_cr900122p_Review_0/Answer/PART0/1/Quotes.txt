[1] "The direct and selective conversion of alkanes into oxygenates by oxidation with molecular oxygen has been a great challenge for decades."
          [2] "Note that high selectivities are usually achieved for very specific substrates, which yield very stable products, e.g. propane  acrylic acid, butane  maleic anhydride, xylene  phtalic anhydride...."
          [3] "The most noteworthy example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process."
          [4] "One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."
          [5] "Butane oxidation into maleic anhydride corresponds to a 14-electron oxidation process and involves several key stages: formation of butenes, then butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is then subsequently converted into maleic anhydride."
          [6] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane."
          [7] "The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species."
          [8] "Alternative mechanisms have been proposed, such as the H-abstraction of butane by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers, which leads to strongly adsorbed 2-butene or 2-butanone, which can then be converted into butadiene via Brnsted acid catalysis."

          [3] "For the gas-phase oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane. the catalytic performance of different metal oxide-based catalysts has been compared, and the best operative conditions to achieve the highest yield to olefins have been analyzed."
          [4] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin.' The catalyst and the reaction have been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature?"
          [5] "The aim of this review is to confirm, modify, complete, or reject the main conclusions reported in a previous review? based on the results reported in the scientific literature of the last few years."
          [6] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."
          [7] "The main difference ob- served in several precursors is the morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites."
          [8] "The type of aliphatic alcohol influences the temperature of reduction of V 5 which is kinetically controlled and complete only when benzyl alcohol (which forms benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) is utilized, when a long reduction time is used, and when the phosphoric acid is added."
          [9] "The effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."
          [10] "The P/V ratio. P/V ratios in the precursor higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilize (VO)P207 not only in the reactants atmosphere but also for calcination in a i r at high temperature."

          [12] "The rate-determining step is the first one. Indeed, the initial rate of oxidation of 1-butene is from 2045 to 60 times2 higher than that of n-butane."
          [13] "The reaction pattern proposed in Table 2, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites that are required."
          [14] "The peculiarities of (VOhP20,in carrying out the reactions shown in Table 2 are the following: 1. A first key property is the ability to activate the paraffin (the first step of the reaction pattern) with high selectivity;in fact, vanadium phosphates other than the vanadylpyrphosphate or molybdenum oxide-based are known"
          [15] "The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters,8 (2) embedding the precursor with Z r and Ti pyrophosphate' in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology.596"
          [16] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
          [17] "The necessary conditions to obtain an optimal catalyst are the following: Synthesis of microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent,characterized by a preferential exposure of the basal plane (001); Presence of defects in stacking of the platelets; and Slight excess of phosphorus with respect to the stoichiometric amount, an atomic P/V ratio in the range of 1.01 to 1.10 (the excess phosphorus with respect to the stoichiometric amount remains strongly bound with the acid vanadylphosphate; in fact, it is not removed by washing the precipitate)."
          [18] "The spectra confm previous findings: precursors prepared in an aqueous medium are more crystalline and exposure of the basal plane (001) is less pronounced; no preferential line broadening of the reflection relative to the (001) plane is observed?4"
          [19] "In precursors prepared in an organic solvent (the most investigated preparation),the morphology depends on many factors such as: Nature of the solvent (aliphatic or aromatic P/V ratio;"
          [20] "The following steps for the formation of the precursor in organic solvents can be Formation of colloidal V205 at the water-alcohol interface (this has been proposed by some authors," but according to others13 it is not an important Solubilization of V5+ through the formation of V'+-alcoholate (V& does not form soluble alcohol ate);' Reduction of the V'+-alcoholate in the liquid phase to solid V,O,by the organic compound (the solvent itself or another more reactive alcohol, such as benzyl alcohol) or by an inorganic reducing agent (HCl, S02);'3*'8 and proposed:step);"

          [22] "In both organic and aqueous media preparations, the precipitate has a higher P/V ratio than the stoichiometric value required for the preursor.* The maximum value corresponds to an atomic P/V ratio equal to 1.1 (excess P, if any is utilized, remains in the solvent) for both preparations."
          [23] "The localization of this excess phosphorus in the precursor has not yet been clarified. However on the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( X P S )  analysis, which indicates a higher P/V ratio at the surface than in the bulk,16 it is possible to suggest that the excess phosphorus is essentially adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate."
          [24] "Controversial results are found in the literature for the transformation of the precursor to the active phase because many different phases can form depending on Morphology of the precursor; P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Two main types of activation procedure have been reported in the scientific and Activation in an oxygen-free atmosphere at D400 'C, followed by intro- duction of the reactant mixture (n-butane in air). With this procedure pure crystalline (VO),P,O, is formed after the first  t e p , '  .

At temperatures between 380 and 400 "C the precursor starts to decompose to an amorphous phase (containing both V4+ and V5+),63'6 which can be dehydrated and transformed to (V0)2P20,and/or other oxidized phases after the introduction of the reactant mixture."
          [25] "Key considerations to avoid the oxidation of (VO),P207 and of the intermediate amorphous phase to a V5+ phosphate, whose formation is known to be deleterious for activity and  e l e c t i v i t y ,   - are the following: The P/V ratio. P/V ratios in the precursor higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilize (VO)P207 not only in the reactants atmosphere but also for calcination in a i r at high temperature."
          [26] "Minimization of impurities. The presence of free V2o5,l9 even in traces, or of additives such as Mn2+,22 facilitates the oxidation of the vanadylpyro- phosphate also in the reactant mixture."
          [27] "Morphology. It has been proposed that the oxidation of (VO),P207 starts at the side faces of the (100) plane.2630.31 Catalysts with a higher exposure of the (100) plane, such as those prepared in an organic medium, are therefore less oxidizable."
          [28] "Low-temperature of treatment in oxygen-containing atmosphere."
          [29] "Precursors prepared in an organic medium, thus more defective, transform at lower temperature?-*l Additives. For example, the presence of Zn2+ as a promoter avoids the overoxidation of the catalyst at high temperatre."
          [30] "It has been found20732733 that different phases present in calcined catalysts can cooperate improving the catalytic behavior. Very likely these findings are less important for the most active and selective catalysts, where only one phase has been detected, but they can be important in the formation, and in the catalytic properties, of the vanadylpyrophosphate during the activation procedure."
          [31] "By means of electron microscopy,103 it has been observed that the dehydrated phase maintains the morphology of the precursor. In addition, XRD analysis has shown that the broadening of reflections corresponding to the basal planes of the precursor also occurs in the reflections corresponding to the basal planes of (VO)2P207,as shown in Figure 2.These findings, together with some analogies of the two structures (see Figure 3[A]) allowed Bordes et al.3, to propose that the transformation from (VO)o,.0.5H20 to (VO),P20, is topotactic."
          [32] "Recently Thompson et al? suggested,on the basis of the different symmetries of the two structures (Figure 3[B]), that it is very difficult that this transformation may be a topotactic one. In addition, it is difficult to assume a topotactic reaction for the formation of an active phase when an intermediate amorphous phase has been identified which transforms very slowly to the pyrophosphate. such as the B- or 1 3"

          [34] "In catalysts activated in air, the transformation from an amorphous phase to an almost completely crystal- line vanadylpyrophosphate inside the reactor (in the presence of the reactant's mixture) requires more than 100 hours?6 The global effect in catalytic behavior is an increase in the yield of maleic anhydride,owing to the fact that the catalyst can operate at higher temperature and conversion maintaining high selectivity (values of 56 percent molar yield have been reached, as shown in Figure 4).Also in catalysts activated in nitrogen, where the fresh catalyst is a pyrphosphate? modifications in activ- ity occur along the frrst 100 hours. The temperature of the reactor is progres- sively decreased; as a consequence, the conversion of n-butane is decreased, but nevertheless the yield to maleic anhydride increases due to the fact that the selectivity is increased. During this activation procedure the structure of the pyrophosphate remains stable, with only a slight oxidation of vanadium (the average oxidation state increases from 4,000 to 4.004) and a slight decrease in the bulk atomic P/V ratio."
          [35] "After the stage of activation, changes occur during prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture, in both the catalytic behavior and the physicochemical properties of the catalyst."
          [36] "A fresh catalyst has been designated2 as a "nonequilibrated" one, while a catalyst after prolonged time-on-stream has been designated as an "equilibrated" one. In the same review: warning has been given against extrapolation of the initial activity of the catalyst to its behavior in industrial-like conditions."
          [37] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
          [38] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03).37-39 Equilibrated catalysts are no longer reoxidizable in air at 400 O C ,  contrary to a freshly prepared (VO),P,O, or with non- equilibrated catalysts."
          [39] "However, they did not observe changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning,but only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004."
          [40] "It is now possible to modify the previous explanation that has been given on the role of defects in nonequilibrated catalysts prepared in an organic medium. It has been proposed that defects increase the Lewis acidity of calcined catalysts, which is necessary for n-butane activation? Even though it is not yet possible to rule out that the defects are responsible for the higher activity of nonequilibrated catalysts,it Seems that their main role may be in directing or facilitating the transformation of the surface of a fresh catalyst (and perhaps a l s o"
          [41] "of the bulk) during the conditioning step to a situation more favorable for the optimal catalytic behavior."
          [42] "In fact. two different polytypes of (VO),P207 exist (Figure 5), which may possess different and evolution to the most stable form (that one present in equili- brated catalyst) may occur more easily starting from a more defective precursor. becomes similar to that of the catalysts prepared in an aqueous medium. How- ever, equilibrated catalysts prepared in an organic medium still maintain higher activity and selectivity than those prepared in an aqueous medium."
          [43] "Therefore, the defects in the (100) crystal plane do not seem to be directly related to the higher activity resulting from organic preparation, and other factors must be taken into consideration to explain the better catalytic perfor- mance. These authors also have not observed big changes in bulk composi- tion and in P/V surface ratio during the conditioning time."

          [46] "By means of XPS analysis,many inestigators,8** with the exception of Okuhara et al.$l have found a higher P/V ratio (in the range 1.5 to 3) on the surface than in the bulk. According to Okuhara et al.?l the differences in P/V ratio observed in the literature might be due to the use of incorrect reference compounds. By means of secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analyis:a surface atomic ratio higher than 5 was found, with a bulk P/V ratio lower than 1.1."
          [47] "There is a general agreement that a high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of v4+ in (VO),P,O,?*J Reported in Figure 6 are the indexes of reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst as functions of the P/V ratio.44 The amount of V5+ observed in the catalyst after Figure 6 Effect of the P N  atomic ratio on the amount of V5+ and V3+ formed in air and in 2% H , In He In (VO),P,O,?"
          [48] "In catalysts with a slight defect of phosphorus (P/V=0.95), a considerable increase of the ease of oxidation (with respect to the catalyst with P/V=l.O) occurs, and the reducibility remains high. For P/V ratios higher than 1, both the reoxidizability and the reducibility of the catalyst decrease considerably. It has been found that high relative amounts of V5+ increase the activity and decrease the selectivity, while the low reducibility of V4+ is an index of low activity. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity. According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
          [49] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."

[1] "Mixed-metal oxide catalysts, often containing V as one of the elements, have been examined as candidates for the selective oxidation of alkanes. However, as seen in Table 3, such catalysts produce only small to moderate yields of the desired product. An exception is the work reported by Mitsubishi in which propane is oxidized to acrylic acid in yields exceeding 52% over a catalyst formulated as MoV0.3Ti0.23Nb0.12Ox. 80 This catalyst is even more effective in catalyzing the conversion of propane directly to acrylonitrile when the vapor-phase oxidation is run in the presence of ammonia. 81 Another example is the announcement by BP of a process to carry out the conversion of propane to acrylonitrile over a VSbO4 catalyst. 82 These results suggest that the catalytic properties of oxygen associated with vanadium can be tailored by altering the environment in the immediate vicinity of the V atoms."
[2] "DuPont commercialized a process for converting butane to maleic anhydride using a recirculating fluidized bed (see Figure 11).116 The catalyst, a specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate, is circulated from a riser reactor where it is contacted with butane to a fluidized regeneration reactor where it is then reoxidized. By this means, a maleic anhydride selectivity improvement of 1015% is achieved in an anerobic environment versus operation in a conventional fixed bed using air."

[1] "The mechanism which operates is com- pletely heterogeneous and includes the formation of an intermediate alkoxy species (or alkyl radical spe- cies). This occurs preferentially at lower temperatures (i.e. less than 4505008C for ethane, the temperature being a function of both (i) the reaction conditions,such as pressure and reactant concentration, and (ii) the alkane reactivity), and is often found for transition metal oxide-based catalysts. Either the olen or other 564"
          [2] "The ratio of the rates of further reaction of this intermediate with activated oxygen, to give carbon oxides, and alkoxy evolution to the desired products, determines the selectivity of the reaction."
          [3] "The reduced state achieved by treatment of the pyridinium salt could therefore be stabilized even under condi- tions which favor the reoxidation of molybdenum."
          [4] "On the contrary, the oxidized catalyst was not selective in the oxidation of propane, and mainly yielded propene and carbon oxides."
          [5] "The band at 700 nm is typical of Mo5 in heteropoly- blues, and its intensity is approximately proportional to the extent of molybdenum reduction [79]."
          [6] "The catalyst which operates under fuel-lean conditions is less reduced than the catalyst which operates under hydrocarbon-rich conditions."
          [7] "These data conrm the importance of the degree of molybdenum oxidation in heteropolycompounds used as heterogeneous catalysts for the selective oxidation of propane and of isobutane."
          [8] "Since the oxidation state of molybdenum is a function of the gas-phase com- position, the optimal situation might be theoretically reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing con- ditions (i.e. at low hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio), thus under conditions which are typically less favourable for selectivity [55]."
          [9] "In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, a catalyst for the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes and butadiene, the results of pulse tests showed that the selectivity to the desired product increased rapidly as the catalyst was progressively reduced (i.e. with increasing hydrocarbon pulse num- ber) [80,81]."
          [10] "For the same reason, supported vanadium oxide systems in which partly reduced vanadium phases develop, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olens."
          [11] "On the contrary, bulk V2O5 (found, for instance, at high vanadia loading in sup- ported systems) has a considerably lower selectivity to olens [8285]."
          [12] "The oxygen species which are involved in the multi- electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions (even though probably limited to a few surface atomic layers) and chemisorbed species"
          [13] "It seems that even though the vanadyl pyro- phosphate is very well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches'' or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment (either by chemical adsorption of oxygen, or by oxidation of vanadyl pyrophosphate layers to form VOPO4 phases, namely d-VOPO4), which make a fundamental contribution to the mechanism of forma- tion of maleic anhydride."
          [14] "In some cases, VOPO4 phases are already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction [61]."
          [15] "In addition, the formation of oxi- dized VOPO4 phases in the reactor will be affected by:(i) the reaction conditions, i.e. temperature and gas phase composition (differences in the average oxida- tion state of vanadium in the equilibrated catalyst unloaded from a xed bed may be expected between that of the catalyst placed at the reactor inlet, where the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio is the highest, and that at the exit, where the ratio is the lowest); and (ii) the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio [9]."
          [16] "It was found that at low n-butane conversion (i.e. under conditions in which the consecutive contribution of maleic anhydride combustion is negligible) the selec- tivity was proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, and that at high n-butane conversion the selec- tivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreased as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increased."
          [17] "It was proposed that a limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride but that excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride."
          [18] "The existence of a limited amount of benecial V5 corresponds, in practice, to the necessity for discrete amounts on the catalyst surface of O-insertion sites which may favor the transformation of inter- mediates (i.e. olen species) to the nal product."
          [19] "Also in the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO cat- alysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites."
          [20] "In this case, the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed not only modies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and of carbon oxides, but also the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides [6063]."
          [21] "The selectivity to products of interest is lowered to 1015%, while the formation of carbon oxides becomes largely kinetically favored."
          [22] "At the same time,other by-products (aldehydes,ketones,hydrocarbon fragments) appear, which, on the contrary, are not observed at all for low n-pentane"
          [23] "Therefore, when the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products (maleic and phthalic anhydrides) is hindered, due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites."
          [24] "Under these condi- tions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen spe- cies either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state."
          [25] "The main difference with respect to data reported in Fig. 1 therefore concerns the lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane rela- tive to those on heteropolycompound as the cata- lyst for isobutane oxidation."
          [26] "It is interesting to note that when 1 mol% of 2- pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribu- tion of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane (i.e. 20 mol%) is oxidized [101]."
          [27] "This indicates that when the olen is used as reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleo- philicity of the olenic reactant which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate."
          [28] "An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olen never reaches the same values that are obtained with n- pentane [62,101]."

[1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-known mechanism for the oxidation of organic compounds over metal oxides. In this mechanism, the metal oxide acts as a source of oxygen, which is transferred to the organic substrate. The metal oxide is then reduced, and the process is repeated. This mechanism is often invoked to explain the selective oxidation of alkanes to carbonyl compounds over metal oxides."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism involves the direct abstraction of a hydrogen atom from an organic substrate by a metal center. This mechanism is often invoked to explain the activation of C-H bonds over metal centers on oxide surfaces."
          [3] "The selective oxidation of alkanes to carbonyl compounds is an important industrial process. One example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This process is typically carried out over a vanadium pentoxide catalyst. The vanadium pentoxide acts as a source of oxygen, which is transferred to the butane to form maleic anhydride. The vanadium pentoxide is then reduced, and the process is repeated."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-established mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal oxide (MOx) acts as a source of lattice oxygen, which is transferred to the alkane substrate to form an alkyl radical. The alkyl radical can then undergo further oxidation to form the desired product. This mechanism is particularly important for the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate by a metal center, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. This mechanism is also important for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts."
          [3] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a classic example of the application of these principles in industrial selective oxidation. In this process, butane is oxidized over a metal oxide catalyst, such as vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), to form maleic anhydride. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction mechanism both play important roles in this process."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-known mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal oxide (MOx) acts as a source of lattice oxygen for the oxidative cleavage of C-H bonds in the alkane. The metal center in the MOx lattice abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a hydroxyl group on the metal oxide surface and a radical on the alkane. The radical can then react with lattice oxygen to form a carbonyl group, which can further oxidize to form the desired product. This mechanism is widely used in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-established mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates over solid catalysts. In this mechanism, the oxygen atom of the adsorbed oxygen molecule is transferred to the substrate via a metal center, which acts as a redox mediator. The metal center is reduced in the process, and the reduced metal can be reoxidized by the adsorbed oxygen molecule, thus regenerating the active site. This mechanism is widely accepted for the selective oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates over metal-oxide catalysts."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism is another mechanism that has been proposed for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal-oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate, forming a metal hydride and a radical intermediate. The radical intermediate can then react with the adsorbed oxygen molecule to form the desired oxygenate product. This mechanism is less well-established than the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, but it has been proposed for certain metal-oxide catalysts."
          [3] "The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride is an important industrial process that utilizes the principles of heterogeneous catalysis. In this process, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride over a metal-oxide catalyst, typically vanadium pentoxide on a silica support. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is believed to be the dominant mechanism for this reaction, with the vanadium center acting as the redox mediator. The reaction is highly selective for maleic anhydride, with minimal formation of other oxygenates or coke."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, which involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon by an oxygen atom of a metal oxide, is a well-known mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes. This mechanism is applied in the industrial production of maleic anhydride from butane."

The temperature of the reactor is progres- sively decreased; as a consequence, the conversion of n-butane is decreased, but nevertheless the yield to maleic anhydride increases due to the fact that the selectivity is increased. During this activation procedure the structure of the pyrophosphate remains stable, with only a slight oxidation of vanadium (the average oxidation state increases from 4,000 to 4.004) and a slight decrease in the bulk atomic P/V ratio."
          [35] "After the stage of activation, changes occur during prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture, in both the catalytic behavior and the physicochemical properties of the catalyst."

In the same review: warning has been given against extrapolation of the initial activity of the catalyst to its behavior in industrial-like conditions."
          [37] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
          [38] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03).37-39 Equilibrated catalysts are no longer reoxidizable in air at 400 O C ,  contrary to a freshly prepared (VO),P,O, or with non- equilibrated catalysts."
          [39] "However, they did not observe changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning,but only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004."
          [40] "It is now possible to modify the previous explanation that has been given on the role of defects in nonequilibrated catalysts prepared in an organic medium. It has been proposed that defects increase the Lewis acidity of calcined catalysts, which is necessary for n-butane activation?

          [48] "In catalysts with a slight defect of phosphorus (P/V=0.95), a considerable increase of the ease of oxidation (with respect to the catalyst with P/V=l.O) occurs, and the reducibility remains high. For P/V ratios higher than 1, both the reoxidizability and the reducibility of the catalyst decrease considerably. It has been found that high relative amounts of V5+ increase the activity and decrease the selectivity, while the low reducibility of V4+ is an index of low activity. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity. According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
          [49] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."

[1] "Mixed-metal oxide catalysts, often containing V as one of the elements, have been examined as candidates for the selective oxidation of alkanes. However, as seen in Table 3, such catalysts produce only small to moderate yields of the desired product. An exception is the work reported by Mitsubishi in which propane is oxidized to acrylic acid in yields exceeding 52% over a catalyst formulated as MoV0.3Ti0.23Nb0.12Ox. 80 This catalyst is even more effective in catalyzing the conversion of propane directly to acrylonitrile when the vapor-phase oxidation is run in the presence of ammonia. 81 Another example is the announcement by BP of a process to carry out the conversion of propane to acrylonitrile over a VSbO4 catalyst. 82 These results suggest that the catalytic properties of oxygen associated with vanadium can be tailored by altering the environment in the immediate vicinity of the V atoms."
[2] "DuPont commercialized a process for converting butane to maleic anhydride using a recirculating fluidized bed (see Figure 11).116 The catalyst, a specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate, is circulated from a riser reactor where it is contacted with butane to a fluidized regeneration reactor where it is then reoxidized. By this means, a maleic anhydride selectivity improvement of 1015% is achieved in an anerobic environment versus operation in a conventional fixed bed using air."

This occurs preferentially at lower temperatures (i.e. less than 4505008C for ethane, the temperature being a function of both (i) the reaction conditions,such as pressure and reactant concentration, and (ii) the alkane reactivity), and is often found for transition metal oxide-based catalysts.

          [4] "On the contrary, the oxidized catalyst was not selective in the oxidation of propane, and mainly yielded propene and carbon oxides."
          [5] "The band at 700 nm is typical of Mo5 in heteropoly- blues, and its intensity is approximately proportional to the extent of molybdenum reduction [79]."
          [6] "The catalyst which operates under fuel-lean conditions is less reduced than the catalyst which operates under hydrocarbon-rich conditions."
          [7] "These data conrm the importance of the degree of molybdenum oxidation in heteropolycompounds used as heterogeneous catalysts for the selective oxidation of propane and of isobutane."
          [8] "Since the oxidation state of molybdenum is a function of the gas-phase com- position, the optimal situation might be theoretically reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing con- ditions (i.e. at low hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio), thus under conditions which are typically less favourable for selectivity [55]."
          [9] "In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, a catalyst for the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes and butadiene, the results of pulse tests showed that the selectivity to the desired product increased rapidly as the catalyst was progressively reduced (i.e. with increasing hydrocarbon pulse num- ber) [80,81]."
          [10] "For the same reason, supported vanadium oxide systems in which partly reduced vanadium phases develop, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olens."
          [11] "On the contrary, bulk V2O5 (found, for instance, at high vanadia loading in sup- ported systems) has a considerably lower selectivity to olens [8285]."
          [12] "The oxygen species which are involved in the multi- electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions (even though probably limited to a few surface atomic layers) and chemisorbed species"
          [13] "It seems that even though the vanadyl pyro- phosphate is very well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches'' or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment (either by chemical adsorption of oxygen, or by oxidation of vanadyl pyrophosphate layers to form VOPO4 phases, namely d-VOPO4), which make a fundamental contribution to the mechanism of forma- tion of maleic anhydride."
          [14] "In some cases, VOPO4 phases are already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction [61]."
          [15] "In addition, the formation of oxi- dized VOPO4 phases in the reactor will be affected by:(i) the reaction conditions, i.e. temperature and gas phase composition (differences in the average oxida- tion state of vanadium in the equilibrated catalyst unloaded from a xed bed may be expected between that of the catalyst placed at the reactor inlet, where the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio is the highest, and that at the exit, where the ratio is the lowest); and (ii) the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio [9]."
          [16] "It was found that at low n-butane conversion (i.e. under conditions in which the consecutive contribution of maleic anhydride combustion is negligible) the selec- tivity was proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, and that at high n-butane conversion the selec- tivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreased as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increased."
          [17] "It was proposed that a limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride but that excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride."
          [18] "The existence of a limited amount of benecial V5 corresponds, in practice, to the necessity for discrete amounts on the catalyst surface of O-insertion sites which may favor the transformation of inter- mediates (i.e. olen species) to the nal product."
          [19] "Also in the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO cat- alysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites."
          [20] "In this case, the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed not only modies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and of carbon oxides, but also the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides [6063]."
          [21] "The selectivity to products of interest is lowered to 1015%, while the formation of carbon oxides becomes largely kinetically favored."
          [22] "At the same time,other by-products (aldehydes,ketones,hydrocarbon fragments) appear, which, on the contrary, are not observed at all for low n-pentane"
          [23] "Therefore, when the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products (maleic and phthalic anhydrides) is hindered, due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites."
          [24] "Under these condi- tions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen spe- cies either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state."
          [25] "The main difference with respect to data reported in Fig. 1 therefore concerns the lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane rela- tive to those on heteropolycompound as the cata- lyst for isobutane oxidation."
          [26] "It is interesting to note that when 1 mol% of 2- pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribu- tion of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane (i.e. 20 mol%) is oxidized [101]."
          [27] "This indicates that when the olen is used as reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleo- philicity of the olenic reactant which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate."
          [28] "An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olen never reaches the same values that are obtained with n- pentane [62,101]."

[1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-known mechanism for the oxidation of organic compounds over metal oxides. In this mechanism, the metal oxide acts as a source of oxygen, which is transferred to the organic substrate. The metal oxide is then reduced, and the process is repeated. This mechanism is often invoked to explain the selective oxidation of alkanes to carbonyl compounds over metal oxides."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism involves the direct abstraction of a hydrogen atom from an organic substrate by a metal center. This mechanism is often invoked to explain the activation of C-H bonds over metal centers on oxide surfaces."
          [3] "The selective oxidation of alkanes to carbonyl compounds is an important industrial process. One example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This process is typically carried out over a vanadium pentoxide catalyst. The vanadium pentoxide acts as a source of oxygen, which is transferred to the butane to form maleic anhydride. The vanadium pentoxide is then reduced, and the process is repeated."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-established mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal oxide (MOx) acts as a source of lattice oxygen, which is transferred to the alkane substrate to form an alkyl radical. The alkyl radical can then undergo further oxidation to form the desired product. This mechanism is particularly important for the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate by a metal center, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. This mechanism is also important for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts."
          [3] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a classic example of the application of these principles in industrial selective oxidation. In this process, butane is oxidized over a metal oxide catalyst, such as vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), to form maleic anhydride. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction mechanism both play important roles in this process."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-known mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal oxide (MOx) acts as a source of lattice oxygen for the oxidative cleavage of C-H bonds in the alkane. The metal center in the MOx lattice abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a hydroxyl group on the metal oxide surface and a radical on the alkane. The radical can then react with lattice oxygen to form a carbonyl group, which can further oxidize to form the desired product. This mechanism is widely used in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-established mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates over solid catalysts. In this mechanism, the oxygen atom of the adsorbed oxygen molecule is transferred to the substrate via a metal center, which acts as a redox mediator. The metal center is reduced in the process, and the reduced metal can be reoxidized by the adsorbed oxygen molecule, thus regenerating the active site. This mechanism is widely accepted for the selective oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates over metal-oxide catalysts."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism is another mechanism that has been proposed for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal-oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate, forming a metal hydride and a radical intermediate. The radical intermediate can then react with the adsorbed oxygen molecule to form the desired oxygenate product. This mechanism is less well-established than the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, but it has been proposed for certain metal-oxide catalysts."
          [3] "The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride is an important industrial process that utilizes the principles of heterogeneous catalysis. In this process, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride over a metal-oxide catalyst, typically vanadium pentoxide on a silica support. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is believed to be the dominant mechanism for this reaction, with the vanadium center acting as the redox mediator. The reaction is highly selective for maleic anhydride, with minimal formation of other oxygenates or coke."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, which involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon by an oxygen atom of a metal oxide, is a well-known mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes. This mechanism is applied in the industrial production of maleic anhydride from butane."

The temperature of the reactor is progres- sively decreased; as a consequence, the conversion of n-butane is decreased, but nevertheless the yield to maleic anhydride increases due to the fact that the selectivity is increased. During this activation procedure the structure of the pyrophosphate remains stable, with only a slight oxidation of vanadium (the average oxidation state increases from 4,000 to 4.004) and a slight decrease in the bulk atomic P/V ratio."

In the same review: warning has been given against extrapolation of the initial activity of the catalyst to its behavior in industrial-like conditions."
          [37] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
          [38] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03).37-39 Equilibrated catalysts are no longer reoxidizable in air at 400 O C ,  contrary to a freshly prepared (VO),P,O, or with non- equilibrated catalysts."
          [39] "However, they did not observe changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning,but only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004."
          [40] "It is now possible to modify the previous explanation that has been given on the role of defects in nonequilibrated catalysts prepared in an organic medium. It has been proposed that defects increase the Lewis acidity of calcined catalysts, which is necessary for n-butane activation?

          [48] "In catalysts with a slight defect of phosphorus (P/V=0.95), a considerable increase of the ease of oxidation (with respect to the catalyst with P/V=l.O) occurs, and the reducibility remains high. For P/V ratios higher than 1, both the reoxidizability and the reducibility of the catalyst decrease considerably. It has been found that high relative amounts of V5+ increase the activity and decrease the selectivity, while the low reducibility of V4+ is an index of low activity. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity. According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
          [49] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."

[1] "Mixed-metal oxide catalysts, often containing V as one of the elements, have been examined as candidates for the selective oxidation of alkanes. However, as seen in Table 3, such catalysts produce only small to moderate yields of the desired product. An exception is the work reported by Mitsubishi in which propane is oxidized to acrylic acid in yields exceeding 52% over a catalyst formulated as MoV0.3Ti0.23Nb0.12Ox. 80 This catalyst is even more effective in catalyzing the conversion of propane directly to acrylonitrile when the vapor-phase oxidation is run in the presence of ammonia. 81 Another example is the announcement by BP of a process to carry out the conversion of propane to acrylonitrile over a VSbO4 catalyst. 82 These results suggest that the catalytic properties of oxygen associated with vanadium can be tailored by altering the environment in the immediate vicinity of the V atoms."
[2] "DuPont commercialized a process for converting butane to maleic anhydride using a recirculating fluidized bed (see Figure 11).116 The catalyst, a specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate, is circulated from a riser reactor where it is contacted with butane to a fluidized regeneration reactor where it is then reoxidized. By this means, a maleic anhydride selectivity improvement of 1015% is achieved in an anerobic environment versus operation in a conventional fixed bed using air."

This occurs preferentially at lower temperatures (i.e. less than 4505008C for ethane, the temperature being a function of both (i) the reaction conditions,such as pressure and reactant concentration, and (ii) the alkane reactivity), and is often found for transition metal oxide-based catalysts.

          [7] "These data conrm the importance of the degree of molybdenum oxidation in heteropolycompounds used as heterogeneous catalysts for the selective oxidation of propane and of isobutane."
          [8] "Since the oxidation state of molybdenum is a function of the gas-phase com- position, the optimal situation might be theoretically reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing con- ditions (i.e. at low hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio), thus under conditions which are typically less favourable for selectivity [55]."
          [9] "In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, a catalyst for the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes and butadiene, the results of pulse tests showed that the selectivity to the desired product increased rapidly as the catalyst was progressively reduced (i.e. with increasing hydrocarbon pulse num- ber) [80,81]."
          [10] "For the same reason, supported vanadium oxide systems in which partly reduced vanadium phases develop, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olens."

          [15] "In addition, the formation of oxi- dized VOPO4 phases in the reactor will be affected by:(i) the reaction conditions, i.e. temperature and gas phase composition (differences in the average oxida- tion state of vanadium in the equilibrated catalyst unloaded from a xed bed may be expected between that of the catalyst placed at the reactor inlet, where the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio is the highest, and that at the exit, where the ratio is the lowest); and (ii) the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio [9]."
          [16] "It was found that at low n-butane conversion (i.e. under conditions in which the consecutive contribution of maleic anhydride combustion is negligible) the selec- tivity was proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, and that at high n-butane conversion the selec- tivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreased as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increased."
          [17] "It was proposed that a limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride but that excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride."
          [18] "The existence of a limited amount of benecial V5 corresponds, in practice, to the necessity for discrete amounts on the catalyst surface of O-insertion sites which may favor the transformation of inter- mediates (i.e. olen species) to the nal product."
          [19] "Also in the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO cat- alysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites."
          [20] "In this case, the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed not only modies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and of carbon oxides, but also the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides [6063]."
          [21] "The selectivity to products of interest is lowered to 1015%, while the formation of carbon oxides becomes largely kinetically favored."
          [22] "At the same time,other by-products (aldehydes,ketones,hydrocarbon fragments) appear, which, on the contrary, are not observed at all for low n-pentane"
          [23] "Therefore, when the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products (maleic and phthalic anhydrides) is hindered, due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites."
          [24] "Under these condi- tions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen spe- cies either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state."
          [25] "The main difference with respect to data reported in Fig. 1 therefore concerns the lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane rela- tive to those on heteropolycompound as the cata- lyst for isobutane oxidation."
          [26] "It is interesting to note that when 1 mol% of 2- pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribu- tion of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane (i.e. 20 mol%) is oxidized [101]."
          [27] "This indicates that when the olen is used as reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleo- philicity of the olenic reactant which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate."
          [28] "An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olen never reaches the same values that are obtained with n- pentane [62,101]."

[1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-known mechanism for the oxidation of organic compounds over metal oxides. In this mechanism, the metal oxide acts as a source of oxygen, which is transferred to the organic substrate. The metal oxide is then reduced, and the process is repeated. This mechanism is often invoked to explain the selective oxidation of alkanes to carbonyl compounds over metal oxides."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism involves the direct abstraction of a hydrogen atom from an organic substrate by a metal center. This mechanism is often invoked to explain the activation of C-H bonds over metal centers on oxide surfaces."
          [3] "The selective oxidation of alkanes to carbonyl compounds is an important industrial process. One example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This process is typically carried out over a vanadium pentoxide catalyst. The vanadium pentoxide acts as a source of oxygen, which is transferred to the butane to form maleic anhydride. The vanadium pentoxide is then reduced, and the process is repeated."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-established mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal oxide (MOx) acts as a source of lattice oxygen, which is transferred to the alkane substrate to form an alkyl radical. The alkyl radical can then undergo further oxidation to form the desired product. This mechanism is particularly important for the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate by a metal center, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. This mechanism is also important for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts."
          [3] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a classic example of the application of these principles in industrial selective oxidation. In this process, butane is oxidized over a metal oxide catalyst, such as vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), to form maleic anhydride. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction mechanism both play important roles in this process."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-known mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal oxide (MOx) acts as a source of lattice oxygen for the oxidative cleavage of C-H bonds in the alkane. The metal center in the MOx lattice abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a hydroxyl group on the metal oxide surface and a radical on the alkane. The radical can then react with lattice oxygen to form a carbonyl group, which can further oxidize to form the desired product. This mechanism is widely used in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-established mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates over solid catalysts. In this mechanism, the oxygen atom of the adsorbed oxygen molecule is transferred to the substrate via a metal center, which acts as a redox mediator. The metal center is reduced in the process, and the reduced metal can be reoxidized by the adsorbed oxygen molecule, thus regenerating the active site. This mechanism is widely accepted for the selective oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates over metal-oxide catalysts."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism is another mechanism that has been proposed for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal-oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate, forming a metal hydride and a radical intermediate. The radical intermediate can then react with the adsorbed oxygen molecule to form the desired oxygenate product. This mechanism is less well-established than the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, but it has been proposed for certain metal-oxide catalysts."
          [3] "The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride is an important industrial process that utilizes the principles of heterogeneous catalysis. In this process, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride over a metal-oxide catalyst, typically vanadium pentoxide on a silica support. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is believed to be the dominant mechanism for this reaction, with the vanadium center acting as the redox mediator. The reaction is highly selective for maleic anhydride, with minimal formation of other oxygenates or coke."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, which involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon by an oxygen atom of a metal oxide, is a well-known mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes. This mechanism is applied in the industrial production of maleic anhydride from butane."

The temperature of the reactor is progres- sively decreased; as a consequence, the conversion of n-butane is decreased, but nevertheless the yield to maleic anhydride increases due to the fact that the selectivity is increased. During this activation procedure the structure of the pyrophosphate remains stable, with only a slight oxidation of vanadium (the average oxidation state increases from 4,000 to 4.004) and a slight decrease in the bulk atomic P/V ratio."

          [37] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
          [38] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03).37-39 Equilibrated catalysts are no longer reoxidizable in air at 400 O C ,  contrary to a freshly prepared (VO),P,O, or with non- equilibrated catalysts."

          [48] "In catalysts with a slight defect of phosphorus (P/V=0.95), a considerable increase of the ease of oxidation (with respect to the catalyst with P/V=l.O) occurs, and the reducibility remains high. For P/V ratios higher than 1, both the reoxidizability and the reducibility of the catalyst decrease considerably. It has been found that high relative amounts of V5+ increase the activity and decrease the selectivity, while the low reducibility of V4+ is an index of low activity. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity. According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."

[1] "Mixed-metal oxide catalysts, often containing V as one of the elements, have been examined as candidates for the selective oxidation of alkanes. However, as seen in Table 3, such catalysts produce only small to moderate yields of the desired product. An exception is the work reported by Mitsubishi in which propane is oxidized to acrylic acid in yields exceeding 52% over a catalyst formulated as MoV0.3Ti0.23Nb0.12Ox. 80 This catalyst is even more effective in catalyzing the conversion of propane directly to acrylonitrile when the vapor-phase oxidation is run in the presence of ammonia. 81 Another example is the announcement by BP of a process to carry out the conversion of propane to acrylonitrile over a VSbO4 catalyst. 82 These results suggest that the catalytic properties of oxygen associated with vanadium can be tailored by altering the environment in the immediate vicinity of the V atoms."

          [2] "The ratio of the rates of further reaction of this intermediate with activated oxygen, to give carbon oxides, and alkoxy evolution to the desired products, determines the selectivity of the reaction."
          [3] "The reduced state achieved by treatment of the pyridinium salt could therefore be stabilized even under condi- tions which favor the reoxidation of molybdenum."
          [4] "On the contrary, the oxidized catalyst was not selective in the oxidation of propane, and mainly yielded propene and carbon oxides."
          [5] "The band at 700 nm is typical of Mo5 in heteropoly- blues, and its intensity is approximately proportional to the extent of molybdenum reduction [79]."
          [6] "The catalyst which operates under fuel-lean conditions is less reduced than the catalyst which operates under hydrocarbon-rich conditions."
          [7] "These data conrm the importance of the degree of molybdenum oxidation in heteropolycompounds used as heterogeneous catalysts for the selective oxidation of propane and of isobutane."
          [8] "Since the oxidation state of molybdenum is a function of the gas-phase com- position, the optimal situation might be theoretically reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing con- ditions (i.e. at low hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio), thus under conditions which are typically less favourable for selectivity [55]."
          [9] "In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, a catalyst for the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes and butadiene, the results of pulse tests showed that the selectivity to the desired product increased rapidly as the catalyst was progressively reduced (i.e. with increasing hydrocarbon pulse num- ber) [80,81]."
          [10] "For the same reason, supported vanadium oxide systems in which partly reduced vanadium phases develop, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olens."
          [11] "On the contrary, bulk V2O5 (found, for instance, at high vanadia loading in sup- ported systems) has a considerably lower selectivity to olens [8285]."
          [12] "The oxygen species which are involved in the multi- electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions (even though probably limited to a few surface atomic layers) and chemisorbed species"
          [13] "It seems that even though the vanadyl pyro- phosphate is very well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches'' or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment (either by chemical adsorption of oxygen, or by oxidation of vanadyl pyrophosphate layers to form VOPO4 phases, namely d-VOPO4), which make a fundamental contribution to the mechanism of forma- tion of maleic anhydride."
          [14] "In some cases, VOPO4 phases are already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction [61]."
          [15] "In addition, the formation of oxi- dized VOPO4 phases in the reactor will be affected by:(i) the reaction conditions, i.e. temperature and gas phase composition (differences in the average oxida- tion state of vanadium in the equilibrated catalyst unloaded from a xed bed may be expected between that of the catalyst placed at the reactor inlet, where the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio is the highest, and that at the exit, where the ratio is the lowest); and (ii) the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio [9]."
          [16] "It was found that at low n-butane conversion (i.e. under conditions in which the consecutive contribution of maleic anhydride combustion is negligible) the selec- tivity was proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, and that at high n-butane conversion the selec- tivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreased as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increased."
          [17] "It was proposed that a limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride but that excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride."
          [18] "The existence of a limited amount of benecial V5 corresponds, in practice, to the necessity for discrete amounts on the catalyst surface of O-insertion sites which may favor the transformation of inter- mediates (i.e. olen species) to the nal product."
          [19] "Also in the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO cat- alysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites."
          [20] "In this case, the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed not only modies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and of carbon oxides, but also the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides [6063]."
          [21] "The selectivity to products of interest is lowered to 1015%, while the formation of carbon oxides becomes largely kinetically favored."
          [22] "At the same time,other by-products (aldehydes,ketones,hydrocarbon fragments) appear, which, on the contrary, are not observed at all for low n-pentane"
          [23] "Therefore, when the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products (maleic and phthalic anhydrides) is hindered, due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites."
          [24] "Under these condi- tions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen spe- cies either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state."
          [25] "The main difference with respect to data reported in Fig. 1 therefore concerns the lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane rela- tive to those on heteropolycompound as the cata- lyst for isobutane oxidation."
          [26] "It is interesting to note that when 1 mol% of 2- pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribu- tion of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane (i.e. 20 mol%) is oxidized [101]."
          [27] "This indicates that when the olen is used as reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleo- philicity of the olenic reactant which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate."
          [28] "An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olen never reaches the same values that are obtained with n- pentane [62,101]."

[1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-known mechanism for the oxidation of organic compounds over metal oxides. In this mechanism, the metal oxide acts as a source of oxygen, which is transferred to the organic substrate. The metal oxide is then reduced, and the process is repeated. This mechanism is often invoked to explain the selective oxidation of alkanes to carbonyl compounds over metal oxides."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism involves the direct abstraction of a hydrogen atom from an organic substrate by a metal center. This mechanism is often invoked to explain the activation of C-H bonds over metal centers on oxide surfaces."
          [3] "The selective oxidation of alkanes to carbonyl compounds is an important industrial process. One example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This process is typically carried out over a vanadium pentoxide catalyst. The vanadium pentoxide acts as a source of oxygen, which is transferred to the butane to form maleic anhydride. The vanadium pentoxide is then reduced, and the process is repeated."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-established mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal oxide (MOx) acts as a source of lattice oxygen, which is transferred to the alkane substrate to form an alkyl radical. The alkyl radical can then undergo further oxidation to form the desired product. This mechanism is particularly important for the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate by a metal center, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. This mechanism is also important for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts."
          [3] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a classic example of the application of these principles in industrial selective oxidation. In this process, butane is oxidized over a metal oxide catalyst, such as vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), to form maleic anhydride. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction mechanism both play important roles in this process."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-known mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal oxide (MOx) acts as a source of lattice oxygen for the oxidative cleavage of C-H bonds in the alkane. The metal center in the MOx lattice abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a hydroxyl group on the metal oxide surface and a radical on the alkane. The radical can then react with lattice oxygen to form a carbonyl group, which can further oxidize to form the desired product. This mechanism is widely used in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-established mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates over solid catalysts. In this mechanism, the oxygen atom of the adsorbed oxygen molecule is transferred to the substrate via a metal center, which acts as a redox mediator. The metal center is reduced in the process, and the reduced metal can be reoxidized by the adsorbed oxygen molecule, thus regenerating the active site. This mechanism is widely accepted for the selective oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates over metal-oxide catalysts."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism is another mechanism that has been proposed for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal-oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate, forming a metal hydride and a radical intermediate. The radical intermediate can then react with the adsorbed oxygen molecule to form the desired oxygenate product. This mechanism is less well-established than the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, but it has been proposed for certain metal-oxide catalysts."
          [3] "The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride is an important industrial process that utilizes the principles of heterogeneous catalysis. In this process, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride over a metal-oxide catalyst, typically vanadium pentoxide on a silica support. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is believed to be the dominant mechanism for this reaction, with the vanadium center acting as the redox mediator. The reaction is highly selective for maleic anhydride, with minimal formation of other oxygenates or coke."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, which involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon by an oxygen atom of a metal oxide, is a well-known mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes. This mechanism is applied in the industrial production of maleic anhydride from butane."

The temperature of the reactor is progres- sively decreased; as a consequence, the conversion of n-butane is decreased, but nevertheless the yield to maleic anhydride increases due to the fact that the selectivity is increased. During this activation procedure the structure of the pyrophosphate remains stable, with only a slight oxidation of vanadium (the average oxidation state increases from 4,000 to 4.004) and a slight decrease in the bulk atomic P/V ratio."

In the same review: warning has been given against extrapolation of the initial activity of the catalyst to its behavior in industrial-like conditions."
          [37] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
          [38] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03).37-39 Equilibrated catalysts are no longer reoxidizable in air at 400 O C ,  contrary to a freshly prepared (VO),P,O, or with non- equilibrated catalysts."
          [39] "However, they did not observe changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning,but only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004."
          [40] "It is now possible to modify the previous explanation that has been given on the role of defects in nonequilibrated catalysts prepared in an organic medium. It has been proposed that defects increase the Lewis acidity of calcined catalysts, which is necessary for n-butane activation?

For P/V ratios higher than 1, both the reoxidizability and the reducibility of the catalyst decrease considerably. It has been found that high relative amounts of V5+ increase the activity and decrease the selectivity, while the low reducibility of V4+ is an index of low activity. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity. According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."

          [53] "The reaction pattern described in Table 2 has been proposed on the basis of the following experimental facts: Table 2 Proposed steps in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride Reaction Type of reaction n-butane + butenes Oxidative dehydrogenation butenes + butadiene Allylic oxidation butadiene + 2,5-dihydrofuran 2,5-dihydrofuran + furan Allylic oxidation furan + lactone lactone + maleic anhydride 1-4 oxygen insertion Electrophylic oxygen insertion Electrophylic oxygen insertion"
          [54] "The reaction pattern proposed in Table 2, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites that are required."
          [55] "The peculiarities of (VOhP20,in carrying out the reactions shown in Table 2 are the following: 1. A first key property is the ability to activate the paraffin (the first step of the reaction pattern) with high selectivity;in fact, vanadium phosphates other than the vanadylpyrphosphate or molybdenum oxide-based are known"

[1] "Mixed-metal oxide catalysts, often containing V as one of the elements, have been examined as candidates for the selective oxidation of alkanes. However, as seen in Table 3, such catalysts produce only small to moderate yields of the desired product. An exception is the work reported by Mitsubishi in which propane is oxidized to acrylic acid in yields exceeding 52% over a catalyst formulated as MoV0.3Ti0.23Nb0.12Ox. 80 This catalyst is even more effective in catalyzing the conversion of propane directly to acrylonitrile when the vapor-phase oxidation is run in the presence of ammonia. 81 Another example is the announcement by BP of a process to carry out the conversion of propane to acrylonitrile over a VSbO4 catalyst. 82 These results suggest that the catalytic properties of oxygen associated with vanadium can be tailored by altering the environment in the immediate vicinity of the V atoms."
[2] "DuPont commercialized a process for converting butane to maleic anhydride using a recirculating fluidized bed (see Figure 11).116 The catalyst, a specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate, is circulated from a riser reactor where it is contacted with butane to a fluidized regeneration reactor where it is then reoxidized. By this means, a maleic anhydride selectivity improvement of 1015% is achieved in an anerobic environment versus operation in a conventional fixed bed using air."

[1] "The mechanism which operates is com- pletely heterogeneous and includes the formation of an intermediate alkoxy species (or alkyl radical spe- cies). This occurs preferentially at lower temperatures (i.e. less than 4505008C for ethane, the temperature being a function of both (i) the reaction conditions,such as pressure and reactant concentration, and (ii) the alkane reactivity), and is often found for transition metal oxide-based catalysts. Either the olen or other 564"
          [2] "The ratio of the rates of further reaction of this intermediate with activated oxygen, to give carbon oxides, and alkoxy evolution to the desired products, determines the selectivity of the reaction."
          [3] "The reduced state achieved by treatment of the pyridinium salt could therefore be stabilized even under condi- tions which favor the reoxidation of molybdenum."
          [4] "On the contrary, the oxidized catalyst was not selective in the oxidation of propane, and mainly yielded propene and carbon oxides."
          [5] "The band at 700 nm is typical of Mo5 in heteropoly- blues, and its intensity is approximately proportional to the extent of molybdenum reduction [79]."
          [6] "The catalyst which operates under fuel-lean conditions is less reduced than the catalyst which operates under hydrocarbon-rich conditions."
          [7] "These data conrm the importance of the degree of molybdenum oxidation in heteropolycompounds used as heterogeneous catalysts for the selective oxidation of propane and of isobutane."
          [8] "Since the oxidation state of molybdenum is a function of the gas-phase com- position, the optimal situation might be theoretically reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing con- ditions (i.e. at low hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio), thus under conditions which are typically less favourable for selectivity [55]."
          [9] "In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, a catalyst for the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes and butadiene, the results of pulse tests showed that the selectivity to the desired product increased rapidly as the catalyst was progressively reduced (i.e. with increasing hydrocarbon pulse num- ber) [80,81]."
          [10] "For the same reason, supported vanadium oxide systems in which partly reduced vanadium phases develop, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olens."
          [11] "On the contrary, bulk V2O5 (found, for instance, at high vanadia loading in sup- ported systems) has a considerably lower selectivity to olens [8285]."
          [12] "The oxygen species which are involved in the multi- electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions (even though probably limited to a few surface atomic layers) and chemisorbed species"
          [13] "It seems that even though the vanadyl pyro- phosphate is very well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches'' or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment (either by chemical adsorption of oxygen, or by oxidation of vanadyl pyrophosphate layers to form VOPO4 phases, namely d-VOPO4), which make a fundamental contribution to the mechanism of forma- tion of maleic anhydride."
          [14] "In some cases, VOPO4 phases are already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction [61]."
          [15] "In addition, the formation of oxi- dized VOPO4 phases in the reactor will be affected by:(i) the reaction conditions, i.e. temperature and gas phase composition (differences in the average oxida- tion state of vanadium in the equilibrated catalyst unloaded from a xed bed may be expected between that of the catalyst placed at the reactor inlet, where the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio is the highest, and that at the exit, where the ratio is the lowest); and (ii) the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio [9]."
          [16] "It was found that at low n-butane conversion (i.e. under conditions in which the consecutive contribution of maleic anhydride combustion is negligible) the selec- tivity was proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, and that at high n-butane conversion the selec- tivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreased as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increased."
          [17] "It was proposed that a limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride but that excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride."
          [18] "The existence of a limited amount of benecial V5 corresponds, in practice, to the necessity for discrete amounts on the catalyst surface of O-insertion sites which may favor the transformation of inter- mediates (i.e. olen species) to the nal product."
          [19] "Also in the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO cat- alysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites."
          [20] "In this case, the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed not only modies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and of carbon oxides, but also the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides [6063]."
          [21] "The selectivity to products of interest is lowered to 1015%, while the formation of carbon oxides becomes largely kinetically favored."
          [22] "At the same time,other by-products (aldehydes,ketones,hydrocarbon fragments) appear, which, on the contrary, are not observed at all for low n-pentane"
          [23] "Therefore, when the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products (maleic and phthalic anhydrides) is hindered, due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites."
          [24] "Under these condi- tions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen spe- cies either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state."
          [25] "The main difference with respect to data reported in Fig. 1 therefore concerns the lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane rela- tive to those on heteropolycompound as the cata- lyst for isobutane oxidation."
          [26] "It is interesting to note that when 1 mol% of 2- pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribu- tion of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane (i.e. 20 mol%) is oxidized [101]."
          [27] "This indicates that when the olen is used as reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleo- philicity of the olenic reactant which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate."
          [28] "An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olen never reaches the same values that are obtained with n- pentane [62,101]."

[1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-known mechanism for the oxidation of organic compounds over metal oxides. In this mechanism, the metal oxide acts as a source of oxygen, which is transferred to the organic substrate. The metal oxide is then reduced, and the process is repeated. This mechanism is often invoked to explain the selective oxidation of alkanes to carbonyl compounds over metal oxides."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism involves the direct abstraction of a hydrogen atom from an organic substrate by a metal center. This mechanism is often invoked to explain the activation of C-H bonds over metal centers on oxide surfaces."
          [3] "The selective oxidation of alkanes to carbonyl compounds is an important industrial process. One example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This process is typically carried out over a vanadium pentoxide catalyst. The vanadium pentoxide acts as a source of oxygen, which is transferred to the butane to form maleic anhydride. The vanadium pentoxide is then reduced, and the process is repeated."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-established mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal oxide (MOx) acts as a source of lattice oxygen, which is transferred to the alkane substrate to form an alkyl radical. The alkyl radical can then undergo further oxidation to form the desired product. This mechanism is particularly important for the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate by a metal center, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. This mechanism is also important for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts."
          [3] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a classic example of the application of these principles in industrial selective oxidation. In this process, butane is oxidized over a metal oxide catalyst, such as vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), to form maleic anhydride. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction mechanism both play important roles in this process."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-known mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal oxide (MOx) acts as a source of lattice oxygen for the oxidative cleavage of C-H bonds in the alkane. The metal center in the MOx lattice abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a hydroxyl group on the metal oxide surface and a radical on the alkane. The radical can then react with lattice oxygen to form a carbonyl group, which can further oxidize to form the desired product. This mechanism is widely used in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-established mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates over solid catalysts. In this mechanism, the oxygen atom of the adsorbed oxygen molecule is transferred to the substrate via a metal center, which acts as a redox mediator. The metal center is reduced in the process, and the reduced metal can be reoxidized by the adsorbed oxygen molecule, thus regenerating the active site. This mechanism is widely accepted for the selective oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates over metal-oxide catalysts."
          [2] "The H-abstraction mechanism is another mechanism that has been proposed for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal-oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate, forming a metal hydride and a radical intermediate. The radical intermediate can then react with the adsorbed oxygen molecule to form the desired oxygenate product. This mechanism is less well-established than the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, but it has been proposed for certain metal-oxide catalysts."
          [3] "The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride is an important industrial process that utilizes the principles of heterogeneous catalysis. In this process, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride over a metal-oxide catalyst, typically vanadium pentoxide on a silica support. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is believed to be the dominant mechanism for this reaction, with the vanadium center acting as the redox mediator. The reaction is highly selective for maleic anhydride, with minimal formation of other oxygenates or coke."
          [1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, which involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon by an oxygen atom of a metal oxide, is a well-known mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes. This mechanism is applied in the industrial production of maleic anhydride from butane."
