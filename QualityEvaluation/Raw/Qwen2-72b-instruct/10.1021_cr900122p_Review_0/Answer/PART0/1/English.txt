Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the selective oxidation of alkanes. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, involving the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen, is commonly involved in these processes. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a specific example of industrial selective oxidation, where butane is oxidized in a 14-electron process to form butenes, then butadiene, and finally 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is subsequently converted into maleic anhydride. The rate-determining step is the CH bond activation of butane, which can occur via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species or by H-abstraction of butane by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the selective oxidation of alkanes. The mechanisms involved include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. The principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, which is a well-studied process. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts, which are used in this process, depends on the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, influenced by the type of aliphatic alcohol used, the temperature of reduction of V5+, and other parameters, affects the exposure of the (001) plane, creates strain in the crystallite, and influences the extent of reduction of V5+. A P/V ratio higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilizes the catalyst not only in the reactants' atmosphere but also for calcination in air at high temperatures. The reaction pattern for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites required. The rate-determining step is the first one, the activation of the paraffin, which is facilitated by the vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst with high selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by factors such as the method of preparation, P/V ratio, presence of additives, and activation and conditioning procedures at high temperatures. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent, with a slight excess of phosphorus and defects in the stacking of platelets. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites varies depending on the preparation method, solvent, P/V ratio, and other factors. The excess phosphorus is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate. The transformation of the precursor to the active phase can result in different phases, and the P/V ratio, morphology, and presence of additives play key roles in avoiding the oxidation of (VO),P207 and the intermediate amorphous phase to a V5+ phosphate. The activation procedure involves either activation in an oxygen-free atmosphere followed by introduction of the reactant mixture or calcination in air until a temperature lower than 400°C is reached. The conditioning procedure involves changes in the catalytic behavior and physicochemical properties of the catalyst during prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture. The equilibrated catalyst has stable V4+ and is no longer reoxidizable in air at 400°C. The P/V ratio influences the reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst, with a slight excess of phosphorus providing the right compromise for high activity and selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has provided significant insights into the activation of paraffins. The catalyst used, (VO)2P2O7, has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature, and its properties and the mechanism of activation that allow high selectivity have been elucidated. The catalyst's ability to activate n-butane selectively is attributed to its unique properties, which include the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the P/V ratio, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation of the catalyst involves a complex chemistry that can influence the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and affect the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio is crucial, as a slight excess of phosphorus stabilizes the catalyst and prevents its oxidation. The morphology of the catalyst, particularly the exposure of the (100) plane, affects its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also influence the catalyst's behavior. The mechanism of the reaction involves several steps, including oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, which are facilitated by the polyfunctional nature of the V-P catalysts.

Isolated metal centers, such as vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix, play a crucial role in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanisms involved include Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The type of C-H bond activation and the acidity and basicity of the catalyst are also important factors in the process.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the adsorption and activation of hydrocarbons. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are two mechanisms involved in these processes. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the metal oxide catalyst is reduced by the hydrocarbon, forming a metal-carbon bond and releasing a water molecule. In H-abstraction, the metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the hydrocarbon, forming a metal-hydrogen bond and leaving a carbon-centered radical. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. DuPont commercialized a process using a recirculating fluidized bed with a specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst. The catalyst is circulated between a riser reactor where it contacts butane and a fluidized regeneration reactor where it is reoxidized. This process achieves a maleic anhydride selectivity improvement of 10-15% in an anerobic environment compared to operation in a conventional fixed bed using air.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by forming intermediate alkoxy species or alkyl radical species at lower temperatures, typically less than 450-500°C for ethane. This process is influenced by factors such as pressure, reactant concentration, and the reactivity of the alkane. The selectivity of the reaction is determined by the ratio of the further reaction of this intermediate with activated oxygen to give carbon oxides versus alkoxy evolution to the desired products. The reduced state of the catalyst, achieved through specific treatments, can be stabilized even under conditions that favor the reoxidation of the metal. In contrast, an oxidized catalyst is not selective in the oxidation of propane, mainly yielding propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation in the catalyst is crucial for the selective oxidation of propane and isobutane. The optimal situation might be reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing conditions. In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, the selectivity to the desired product increases rapidly as the catalyst is progressively reduced. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced vanadium phases, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olefins. Bulk V2O5 has a considerably lower selectivity to olefins. The oxygen species involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions and chemisorbed species. Even though the vanadyl pyrophosphate is well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment, contributing to the formation of maleic anhydride. VOPO4 phases are sometimes already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction. The formation of oxidized VOPO4 phases in the reactor is affected by the reaction conditions, such as temperature and gas phase composition, and the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio. At low n-butane conversion, the selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, while at high n-butane conversion, the selectivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreases as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increases. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride, but excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride. The existence of a limited amount of beneficial V5 corresponds to the necessity for discrete amounts of O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface, which favor the transformation of intermediates to the final product. In the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO catalysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites. The hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed modifies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and carbon oxides, as well as the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides. When the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products is hindered due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites. Under these conditions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen species either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state. The lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane relative to those on heteropolycompound as the catalyst for isobutane oxidation is a main difference. When 1 mol% of 2-pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribution of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane is oxidized. This indicates that when the olefin is used as a reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleophilicity of the olefinic reactant, which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate. An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olefin never reaches the same values obtained with n-pentane.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the metal oxide acts as a source of lattice oxygen for the oxidative cleavage of C-H bonds in the alkane. The metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a hydroxyl group on the metal oxide surface and a radical on the alkane. The radical can then react with lattice oxygen to form a carbonyl group, which can further oxidize to form the desired product. This mechanism is widely used in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The H-abstraction mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate by a metal center, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. This mechanism is also important for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. The principles of these mechanisms are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this process, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride over a metal-oxide catalyst, typically vanadium pentoxide on a silica support. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is believed to be the dominant mechanism for this reaction, with the vanadium center acting as the redox mediator. The reaction is highly selective for maleic anhydride, with minimal formation of other oxygenates or coke.

The radical can then react with lattice oxygen to form a carbonyl group, which can further oxidize to form the desired product. This mechanism is widely used in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The H-abstraction mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate by a metal center, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. This mechanism is also important for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. The principles of these mechanisms are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this process, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride over a metal-oxide catalyst, typically vanadium pentoxide on a silica support. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is believed to be the dominant mechanism for this reaction, with the vanadium center acting as the redox mediator. The reaction is highly selective for maleic anhydride, with minimal formation of other oxygenates or coke.

The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a specific example of industrial selective oxidation, where butane is oxidized in a 14-electron process to form butenes, then butadiene, and finally 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is subsequently converted into maleic anhydride. The rate-determining step is the CH bond activation of butane, which can occur via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species or by H-abstraction of butane by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the selective oxidation of alkanes. The mechanisms involved include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. The principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, which is a well-studied process. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts, which are used in this process, depends on the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, influenced by the type of aliphatic alcohol used, the temperature of reduction of V5+, and other parameters, affects the exposure of the (001) plane, creates strain in the crystallite, and influences the extent of reduction of V5+. A P/V ratio higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilizes the catalyst not only in the reactants' atmosphere but also for calcination in air at high temperatures. The reaction pattern for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites required. The rate-determining step is the first one, the activation of the paraffin, which is facilitated by the vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst with high selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by factors such as the method of preparation, P/V ratio, presence of additives, and activation and conditioning procedures at high temperatures. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent, with a slight excess of phosphorus and defects in the stacking of platelets. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites varies depending on the preparation method, solvent, P/V ratio, and other factors. The excess phosphorus is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate. The transformation of the precursor to the active phase can result in different phases, and the P/V ratio, morphology, and presence of additives play key roles in avoiding the oxidation of (VO),P207 and the intermediate amorphous phase to a V5+ phosphate. The activation procedure involves either activation in an oxygen-free atmosphere followed by introduction of the reactant mixture or calcination in air until a temperature lower than 400°C is reached. The conditioning procedure involves changes in the catalytic behavior and physicochemical properties of the catalyst during prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture. The equilibrated catalyst has stable V4+ and is no longer reoxidizable in air at 400°C. The P/V ratio influences the reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst, with a slight excess of phosphorus providing the right compromise for high activity and selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has provided significant insights into the activation of paraffins. The catalyst used, (VO)2P2O7, has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature, and its properties and the mechanism of activation that allow high selectivity have been elucidated. The catalyst's ability to activate n-butane selectively is attributed to its unique properties, which include the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the P/V ratio, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation of the catalyst involves a complex chemistry that can influence the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and affect the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio is crucial, as a slight excess of phosphorus stabilizes the catalyst and prevents its oxidation. The morphology of the catalyst, particularly the exposure of the (100) plane, affects its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also influence the catalyst's behavior. The mechanism of the reaction involves several steps, including oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, which are facilitated by the polyfunctional nature of the V-P catalysts.

Isolated metal centers, such as vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix, play a crucial role in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanisms involved include Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The type of C-H bond activation and the acidity and basicity of the catalyst are also important factors in the process.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the adsorption and activation of hydrocarbons. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are two mechanisms involved in these processes. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the metal oxide catalyst is reduced by the hydrocarbon, forming a metal-carbon bond and releasing a water molecule. In H-abstraction, the metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the hydrocarbon, forming a metal-hydrogen bond and leaving a carbon-centered radical. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. DuPont commercialized a process using a recirculating fluidized bed with a specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst. The catalyst is circulated between a riser reactor where it contacts butane and a fluidized regeneration reactor where it is reoxidized. This process achieves a maleic anhydride selectivity improvement of 10-15% in an anerobic environment compared to operation in a conventional fixed bed using air.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by forming intermediate alkoxy species or alkyl radical species at lower temperatures, typically less than 450-500°C for ethane. This process is influenced by factors such as pressure, reactant concentration, and the reactivity of the alkane. The selectivity of the reaction is determined by the ratio of the further reaction of this intermediate with activated oxygen to give carbon oxides versus alkoxy evolution to the desired products. The reduced state of the catalyst, achieved through specific treatments, can be stabilized even under conditions that favor the reoxidation of the metal. In contrast, an oxidized catalyst is not selective in the oxidation of propane, mainly yielding propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation in the catalyst is crucial for the selective oxidation of propane and isobutane. The optimal situation might be reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing conditions. In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, the selectivity to the desired product increases rapidly as the catalyst is progressively reduced. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced vanadium phases, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olefins. Bulk V2O5 has a considerably lower selectivity to olefins. The oxygen species involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions and chemisorbed species. Even though the vanadyl pyrophosphate is well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment, contributing to the formation of maleic anhydride. VOPO4 phases are sometimes already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction. The formation of oxidized VOPO4 phases in the reactor is affected by the reaction conditions, such as temperature and gas phase composition, and the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio. At low n-butane conversion, the selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, while at high n-butane conversion, the selectivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreases as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increases. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride, but excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride. The existence of a limited amount of beneficial V5 corresponds to the necessity for discrete amounts of O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface, which favor the transformation of intermediates to the final product. In the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO catalysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites. The hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed modifies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and carbon oxides, as well as the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides. When the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products is hindered due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites. Under these conditions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen species either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state. The lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane relative to those on heteropolycompound as the catalyst for isobutane oxidation is a main difference. When 1 mol% of 2-pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribution of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane is oxidized. This indicates that when the olefin is used as a reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleophilicity of the olefinic reactant, which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate. An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olefin never reaches the same values obtained with n-pentane.

The lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane relative to those on heteropolycompound as the catalyst for isobutane oxidation is a main difference. When 1 mol% of 2-pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribution of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane is oxidized. This indicates that when the olefin is used as a reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleophilicity of the olefinic reactant, which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate. An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olefin never reaches the same values obtained with n-pentane.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the metal oxide acts as a source of lattice oxygen for the oxidative cleavage of C-H bonds in the alkane. The metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a hydroxyl group on the metal oxide surface and a radical on the alkane. The radical can then react with lattice oxygen to form a carbonyl group, which can further oxidize to form the desired product. This mechanism is widely used in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The H-abstraction mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate by a metal center, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. This mechanism is also important for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. The principles of these mechanisms are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this process, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride over a metal-oxide catalyst, typically vanadium pentoxide on a silica support. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is believed to be the dominant mechanism for this reaction, with the vanadium center acting as the redox mediator. The reaction is highly selective for maleic anhydride, with minimal formation of other oxygenates or coke.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the selective oxidation of alkanes. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, involving the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen, is commonly involved in these processes. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a specific example of industrial selective oxidation, where butane is oxidized in a 14-electron process to form butenes, then butadiene, and finally 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is subsequently converted into maleic anhydride. The rate-determining step is the CH bond activation of butane, which can occur via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species or by H-abstraction of butane by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the selective oxidation of alkanes. The mechanisms involved include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. The principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, which is a well-studied process. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts, which are used in this process, depends on the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, influenced by the type of aliphatic alcohol used, the temperature of reduction of V5+, and other parameters, affects the exposure of the (001) plane, creates strain in the crystallite, and influences the extent of reduction of V5+. A P/V ratio higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilizes the catalyst not only in the reactants' atmosphere but also for calcination in air at high temperatures. The reaction pattern for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites required. The rate-determining step is the first one, the activation of the paraffin, which is facilitated by the vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst with high selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by factors such as the method of preparation, P/V ratio, presence of additives, and activation and conditioning procedures at high temperatures. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent, with a slight excess of phosphorus and defects in the stacking of platelets. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites varies depending on the preparation method, solvent, P/V ratio, and other factors. The excess phosphorus is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate. The transformation of the precursor to the active phase can result in different phases, and the P/V ratio, morphology, and presence of additives play key roles in avoiding the oxidation of (VO),P207 and the intermediate amorphous phase to a V5+ phosphate. The activation procedure involves either activation in an oxygen-free atmosphere followed by introduction of the reactant mixture or calcination in air until a temperature lower than 400°C is reached. The conditioning procedure involves changes in the catalytic behavior and physicochemical properties of the catalyst during prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture. The equilibrated catalyst has stable V4+ and is no longer reoxidizable in air at 400°C. The P/V ratio influences the reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst, with a slight excess of phosphorus providing the right compromise for high activity and selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has provided significant insights into the activation of paraffins. The catalyst used, (VO)2P2O7, has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature, and its properties and the mechanism of activation that allow high selectivity have been elucidated. The catalyst's ability to activate n-butane selectively is attributed to its unique properties, which include the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the P/V ratio, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation of the catalyst involves a complex chemistry that can influence the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and affect the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio is crucial, as a slight excess of phosphorus stabilizes the catalyst and prevents its oxidation. The morphology of the catalyst, particularly the exposure of the (100) plane, affects its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also influence the catalyst's behavior. The mechanism of the reaction involves several steps, including oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, which are facilitated by the polyfunctional nature of the V-P catalysts.

Isolated metal centers, such as vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix, play a crucial role in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanisms involved include Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The type of C-H bond activation and the acidity and basicity of the catalyst are also important factors in the process.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for the adsorption and activation of hydrocarbons. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are two mechanisms involved in these processes. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the metal oxide catalyst is reduced by the hydrocarbon, forming a metal-carbon bond and releasing a water molecule. In H-abstraction, the metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the hydrocarbon, forming a metal-hydrogen bond and leaving a carbon-centered radical. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. DuPont commercialized a process using a recirculating fluidized bed with a specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst. The catalyst is circulated between a riser reactor where it contacts butane and a fluidized regeneration reactor where it is reoxidized. This process achieves a maleic anhydride selectivity improvement of 10-15% in an anerobic environment compared to operation in a conventional fixed bed using air.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by forming intermediate alkoxy species or alkyl radical species at lower temperatures, typically less than 450-500°C for ethane. This process is influenced by factors such as pressure, reactant concentration, and the reactivity of the alkane. The selectivity of the reaction is determined by the ratio of the further reaction of this intermediate with activated oxygen to give carbon oxides versus alkoxy evolution to the desired products. The reduced state of the catalyst, achieved through specific treatments, can be stabilized even under conditions that favor the reoxidation of the metal. In contrast, an oxidized catalyst is not selective in the oxidation of propane, mainly yielding propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation in the catalyst is crucial for the selective oxidation of propane and isobutane. The optimal situation might be reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing conditions. In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, the selectivity to the desired product increases rapidly as the catalyst is progressively reduced. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced vanadium phases, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olefins. Bulk V2O5 has a considerably lower selectivity to olefins. The oxygen species involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions and chemisorbed species. Even though the vanadyl pyrophosphate is well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment, contributing to the formation of maleic anhydride. VOPO4 phases are sometimes already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction. The formation of oxidized VOPO4 phases in the reactor is affected by the reaction conditions, such as temperature and gas phase composition, and the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio. At low n-butane conversion, the selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, while at high n-butane conversion, the selectivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreases as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increases. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride, but excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride. The existence of a limited amount of beneficial V5 corresponds to the necessity for discrete amounts of O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface, which favor the transformation of intermediates to the final product. In the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO catalysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites. The hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed modifies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and carbon oxides, as well as the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides. When the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products is hindered due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites. Under these conditions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen species either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state. The lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane relative to those on heteropolycompound as the catalyst for isobutane oxidation is a main difference. When 1 mol% of 2-pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribution of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane is oxidized. This indicates that when the olefin is used as a reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleophilicity of the olefinic reactant, which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate. An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olefin never reaches the same values obtained with n-pentane.
