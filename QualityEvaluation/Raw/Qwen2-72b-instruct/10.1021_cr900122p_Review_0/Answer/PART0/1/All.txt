The mechanisms involved include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. The principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, which is a well-studied process. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts, which are used in this process, depends on the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, influenced by the type of aliphatic alcohol used, the temperature of reduction of V5+, and other parameters, affects the exposure of the (001) plane, creates strain in the crystallite, and influences the extent of reduction of V5+. A P/V ratio higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilizes the catalyst not only in the reactants' atmosphere but also for calcination in air at high temperatures. The reaction pattern for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites required. The rate-determining step is the first one, the activation of the paraffin, which is facilitated by the vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst with high selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by factors such as the method of preparation, P/V ratio, presence of additives, and activation and conditioning procedures at high temperatures. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent, with a slight excess of phosphorus and defects in the stacking of platelets. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites varies depending on the preparation method, solvent, P/V ratio, and other factors. The excess phosphorus is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate. The transformation of the precursor to the active phase can result in different phases, and the P/V ratio, morphology, and presence of additives play key roles in avoiding the oxidation of (VO),P207 and the intermediate amorphous phase to a V5+ phosphate. The activation procedure involves either activation in an oxygen-free atmosphere followed by introduction of the reactant mixture or calcination in air until a temperature lower than 400°C is reached. The conditioning procedure involves changes in the catalytic behavior and physicochemical properties of the catalyst during prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture. The equilibrated catalyst has stable V4+ and is no longer reoxidizable in air at 400°C. The P/V ratio influences the reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst, with a slight excess of phosphorus providing the right compromise for high activity and selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has provided significant insights into the activation of paraffins. The catalyst used, (VO)2P2O7, has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature, and its properties and the mechanism of activation that allow high selectivity have been elucidated. The catalyst's ability to activate n-butane selectively is attributed to its unique properties, which include the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the P/V ratio, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation of the catalyst involves a complex chemistry that can influence the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and affect the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio is crucial, as a slight excess of phosphorus stabilizes the catalyst and prevents its oxidation. The morphology of the catalyst, particularly the exposure of the (100) plane, affects its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also influence the catalyst's behavior. The mechanism of the reaction involves several steps, including oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, which are facilitated by the polyfunctional nature of the V-P catalysts.", "Chinese": "氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过提供活性位点促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。涉及的机制包括Mars van Krevelen机制和H-抽象。这些原理应用于工业选择性氧化烷烃，例如丁烷转化为马来酸酐，这是一个研究得很好的过程。V-P基催化剂的催化行为，用于此过程，取决于前驱体的制备方法、P/V比、添加剂的存在以及高温下的激活和调节方法。(VO)HP04.0.5H20晶体的形态，受所用脂肪醇类型、V5+还原温度和其他参数的影响，影响(001)平面的暴露，造成晶体中的应变，并影响V5+还原的程度。P/V比高于化学计量量不仅在反应物气氛中稳定催化剂，而且在高温下在空气中煅烧。丁烷氧化为马来酸酐的反应模式，这是机制的第一近似，显示了获得马来酸酐所需的初级步骤和所需的活性位点类型。决定速率的步骤是第一步，即烷烃的活化，这由具有高选择性的钒酸盐催化剂促进。选择性氧化n-丁烷至马来酸酐是一个研究得很好的工业过程，V-P基催化剂的催化行为受到制备方法、P/V比、添加剂的存在以及在高温下激活和调理前体的影响。最优催化剂的特征是有机溶剂中制备的微晶(V0)HPO4.O.5H20，具有轻微的磷过剩和板状堆叠中的缺陷。(VO)HP04.0.5H20结晶体的形态根据制备方法、溶剂、P/V比和其他因素而变化。过量的磷吸附在钒磷酸盐的表面。前体转化为活性相可能导致不同的相，P/V比、形态和添加剂的存在在避免(VO),P207和中间无定形相氧化为V5+磷酸盐中起关键作用。激活程序包括在无氧气氛中激活，然后引入反应混合物，或在空气中的温度低于400°C时煅烧。调理程序涉及在n-丁烷/空气混合物中长时间在线时催化剂的催化行为和物理化学性质的变化。平衡催化剂具有稳定的V4+，在400°C的空气中不再被氧化。P/V比影响催化剂的可还原性和可氧化性，轻微的磷过剩为高活性和选择性提供了正确的折衷。选择性氧化n-丁烷制马来酸酐是一个研究得很好的工业过程，它为理解烷烃的活化提供了重要的见解。所使用的催化剂(VO)2P2O7在科学文献中得到了彻底的研究，其性质和允许高选择性的活化机制已经被阐明。催化剂选择性活化n-丁烷的能力归因于其独特的性质，包括(VO)HP04.0.5H20结晶体的形态、P/V比以及在高温下激活和调节前体的方法。催化剂的制备涉及复杂的化学，可以影响(001)平面的暴露，造成晶粒的应变，并影响V5+还原的程度。P/V比是关键的，因为磷的轻微过量可以稳定催化剂，防止其氧化。催化剂的形态，特别是(100)平面的暴露，影响其氧化性。在含氧气氛中低温处理和某些添加剂的存在也可以影响催化剂的行为。反应机制涉及几个步骤，包括氧化脱氢、烯丙基氧化和亲电氧插入，这些步骤由V-P催化剂的多官能性性质促进。", "Doi": "10.1039/9781847553232-00246"},

This process is influenced by factors such as pressure, reactant concentration, and the reactivity of the alkane. The selectivity of the reaction is determined by the ratio of the further reaction of this intermediate with activated oxygen to give carbon oxides versus alkoxy evolution to the desired products. The reduced state of the catalyst, achieved through specific treatments, can be stabilized even under conditions that favor the reoxidation of the metal. In contrast, an oxidized catalyst is not selective in the oxidation of propane, mainly yielding propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation in the catalyst is crucial for the selective oxidation of propane and isobutane. The optimal situation might be reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing conditions. In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, the selectivity to the desired product increases rapidly as the catalyst is progressively reduced. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced vanadium phases, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olefins. Bulk V2O5 has a considerably lower selectivity to olefins. The oxygen species involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions and chemisorbed species. Even though the vanadyl pyrophosphate is well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment, contributing to the formation of maleic anhydride. VOPO4 phases are sometimes already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction. The formation of oxidized VOPO4 phases in the reactor is affected by the reaction conditions, such as temperature and gas phase composition, and the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio. At low n-butane conversion, the selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, while at high n-butane conversion, the selectivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreases as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increases. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride, but excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride. The existence of a limited amount of beneficial V5 corresponds to the necessity for discrete amounts of O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface, which favor the transformation of intermediates to the final product. In the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO catalysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites. The hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed modifies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and carbon oxides, as well as the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides. When the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products is hindered due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites. Under these conditions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen species either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state. The lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane relative to those on heteropolycompound as the catalyst for isobutane oxidation is a main difference. When 1 mol% of 2-pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribution of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane is oxidized. This indicates that when the olefin is used as a reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleophilicity of the olefinic reactant, which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate. An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olefin never reaches the same values obtained with n-pentane.", "Chinese": "在异质催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过在较低温度下（通常小于450-500°C，对于乙烷）形成中间醇氧物种或烷基自由基物种来促进C-H键的活化。该过程受压力、反应物浓度和烷烃反应性等因素的影响。反应的选择性由该中间体与活化氧的进一步反应生成二氧化碳与醇氧物种向所需产物的演变之间的比率决定。通过特定处理实现的催化剂还原状态，即使在有利于金属再氧化的条件下也能稳定。相比之下，氧化催化剂在丙烷氧化中不具备选择性，主要产生丙烯和二氧化碳。催化剂中金属氧化程度对丙烷和异丁烷的有选择性氧化至关重要。如果在氧化条件下，即使在氧化条件下，也能保持还原、更具选择性的催化剂氧化状态，那么可能达到最佳情况。在氧化铝支持的钒氧化物的情况下，随着催化剂逐渐还原，对所需产物的选择性迅速增加。通过与底层支持物的相互作用稳定的部分还原钒相的支撑钒氧化物系统在形成烯烃方面更具选择性。V2O5的块体具有明显较低的烯烃选择性。参与n-丁烷多电子转化的氧物种既有体相氧离子也有化学吸附物种。尽管钒氧磷酸盐高度结晶且正式不含V5物种，但反应环境中会形成斑点或分散的V5物种，对马来酸酐的形成做出贡献。VOPO4相有时已经存在于催化剂中，特别是在化合物在反应前在空气中煅烧的情况下。反应器中氧化VOPO4相的形成受反应条件（如温度和气相组成）和钒氧磷酸盐的体相特征（如结晶度和P/V比）的影响。在低n-丁烷转化率下，选择性与烃氧比成正比，而在高n-丁烷转化率下，随着钒平均氧化度的增加，马来酸酐的选择性迅速下降。获得最高马来酸酐选择性需要有限量的表面V5，但过量的钒氧化会增强马来酸酐的连续燃烧。存在有限量的有益V5实际上对应于催化剂表面需要离散量的氧插入位点，这有利于中间体（即烯烃物种）向最终产物的转化。在VPO催化剂上的n-戊烷氧化中，产物分布受氧插入位点的可用性影响显著。烃氧比在进料中不仅改变选择性氧化产物与二氧化碳之间的相对比率，还改变马来酸与邻苯二甲酸酐之间的比率。当表面被吸附物种饱和时，由于氧插入位点的缺乏，最终稳定产物（马来酸和邻苯二甲酸酐）的形成受阻。在这些条件下，反应变得非选择性，因为中间烯烃物种在气相中解吸或被气相或直接在吸附状态下非选择性氧物种攻击。与异丁烷氧化催化剂杂多化合物相比，钒氧磷酸盐上n-戊烷氧化的活性位点的可用性较低是主要区别。当1 mol％的2-戊烯在空气中送入反应器时，观察到的产物分布与高浓度n-戊烷（即20 mol％）氧化时相同。这表明当烯烃用作反应物时，表面饱和发生在比n-戊烷低得多的烃分压下，这是由于烯烃反应物的高亲核性，使其与钒氧磷酸盐的路易斯酸中心的相互作用更容易。氧分压的增加有利于对酸酐的选择性，尽管与烯烃的选择性永远不会达到与n-戊烷相同。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},

The mechanisms involved include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. The principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, which is a well-studied process. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts, which are used in this process, depends on the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, influenced by the type of aliphatic alcohol used, the temperature of reduction of V5+, and other parameters, affects the exposure of the (001) plane, creates strain in the crystallite, and influences the extent of reduction of V5+. A P/V ratio higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilizes the catalyst not only in the reactants' atmosphere but also for calcination in air at high temperatures. The reaction pattern for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites required. The rate-determining step is the first one, the activation of the paraffin, which is facilitated by the vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst with high selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by factors such as the method of preparation, P/V ratio, presence of additives, and activation and conditioning procedures at high temperatures. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent, with a slight excess of phosphorus and defects in the stacking of platelets. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites varies depending on the preparation method, solvent, P/V ratio, and other factors. The excess phosphorus is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate. The transformation of the precursor to the active phase can result in different phases, and the P/V ratio, morphology, and presence of additives play key roles in avoiding the oxidation of (VO),P207 and the intermediate amorphous phase to a V5+ phosphate. The activation procedure involves either activation in an oxygen-free atmosphere followed by introduction of the reactant mixture or calcination in air until a temperature lower than 400°C is reached. The conditioning procedure involves changes in the catalytic behavior and physicochemical properties of the catalyst during prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture. The equilibrated catalyst has stable V4+ and is no longer reoxidizable in air at 400°C. The P/V ratio influences the reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst, with a slight excess of phosphorus providing the right compromise for high activity and selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has provided significant insights into the activation of paraffins. The catalyst used, (VO)2P2O7, has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature, and its properties and the mechanism of activation that allow high selectivity have been elucidated. The catalyst's ability to activate n-butane selectively is attributed to its unique properties, which include the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the P/V ratio, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation of the catalyst involves a complex chemistry that can influence the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and affect the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio is crucial, as a slight excess of phosphorus stabilizes the catalyst and prevents its oxidation. The morphology of the catalyst, particularly the exposure of the (100) plane, affects its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also influence the catalyst's behavior.

This process is influenced by factors such as pressure, reactant concentration, and the reactivity of the alkane. The selectivity of the reaction is determined by the ratio of the further reaction of this intermediate with activated oxygen to give carbon oxides versus alkoxy evolution to the desired products. The reduced state of the catalyst, achieved through specific treatments, can be stabilized even under conditions that favor the reoxidation of the metal. In contrast, an oxidized catalyst is not selective in the oxidation of propane, mainly yielding propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation in the catalyst is crucial for the selective oxidation of propane and isobutane. The optimal situation might be reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing conditions. In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, the selectivity to the desired product increases rapidly as the catalyst is progressively reduced. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced vanadium phases, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olefins. Bulk V2O5 has a considerably lower selectivity to olefins. The oxygen species involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions and chemisorbed species. Even though the vanadyl pyrophosphate is well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment, contributing to the formation of maleic anhydride. VOPO4 phases are sometimes already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction. The formation of oxidized VOPO4 phases in the reactor is affected by the reaction conditions, such as temperature and gas phase composition, and the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio. At low n-butane conversion, the selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, while at high n-butane conversion, the selectivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreases as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increases. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride, but excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride. The existence of a limited amount of beneficial V5 corresponds to the necessity for discrete amounts of O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface, which favor the transformation of intermediates to the final product. In the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO catalysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites. The hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed modifies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and carbon oxides, as well as the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides. When the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products is hindered due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites. Under these conditions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen species either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state. The lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane relative to those on heteropolycompound as the catalyst for isobutane oxidation is a main difference. When 1 mol% of 2-pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribution of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane is oxidized. This indicates that when the olefin is used as a reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleophilicity of the olefinic reactant, which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate. An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olefin never reaches the same values obtained with n-pentane.", "Chinese": "在异质催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过在较低温度下（通常小于450-500°C，对于乙烷）形成中间醇氧物种或烷基自由基物种来促进C-H键的活化。该过程受压力、反应物浓度和烷烃反应性等因素的影响。反应的选择性由该中间体与活化氧的进一步反应生成二氧化碳与醇氧物种向所需产物的演变之间的比率决定。通过特定处理实现的催化剂还原状态，即使在有利于金属再氧化的条件下也能稳定。相比之下，氧化催化剂在丙烷氧化中不具备选择性，主要产生丙烯和二氧化碳。催化剂中金属氧化程度对丙烷和异丁烷的有选择性氧化至关重要。如果在氧化条件下，即使在氧化条件下，也能保持还原、更具选择性的催化剂氧化状态，那么可能达到最佳情况。在氧化铝支持的钒氧化物的情况下，随着催化剂逐渐还原，对所需产物的选择性迅速增加。通过与底层支持物的相互作用稳定的部分还原钒相的支撑钒氧化物系统在形成烯烃方面更具选择性。V2O5的块体具有明显较低的烯烃选择性。参与n-丁烷多电子转化的氧物种既有体相氧离子也有化学吸附物种。尽管钒氧磷酸盐高度结晶且正式不含V5物种，但反应环境中会形成斑点或分散的V5物种，对马来酸酐的形成做出贡献。VOPO4相有时已经存在于催化剂中，特别是在化合物在反应前在空气中煅烧的情况下。反应器中氧化VOPO4相的形成受反应条件（如温度和气相组成）和钒氧磷酸盐的体相特征（如结晶度和P/V比）的影响。在低n-丁烷转化率下，选择性与烃氧比成正比，而在高n-丁烷转化率下，随着钒平均氧化度的增加，马来酸酐的选择性迅速下降。获得最高马来酸酐选择性需要有限量的表面V5，但过量的钒氧化会增强马来酸酐的连续燃烧。存在有限量的有益V5实际上对应于催化剂表面需要离散量的氧插入位点，这有利于中间体（即烯烃物种）向最终产物的转化。在VPO催化剂上的n-戊烷氧化中，产物分布受氧插入位点的可用性影响显著。烃氧比在进料中不仅改变选择性氧化产物与二氧化碳之间的相对比率，还改变马来酸与邻苯二甲酸酐之间的比率。当表面被吸附物种饱和时，由于氧插入位点的缺乏，最终稳定产物（马来酸和邻苯二甲酸酐）的形成受阻。在这些条件下，反应变得非选择性，因为中间烯烃物种在气相中解吸或被气相或直接在吸附状态下非选择性氧物种攻击。与异丁烷氧化催化剂杂多化合物相比，钒氧磷酸盐上n-戊烷氧化的活性位点的可用性较低是主要区别。当1 mol％的2-戊烯在空气中送入反应器时，观察到的产物分布与高浓度n-戊烷（即20 mol％）氧化时相同。这表明当烯烃用作反应物时，表面饱和发生在比n-戊烷低得多的烃分压下，这是由于烯烃反应物的高亲核性，使其与钒氧磷酸盐的路易斯酸中心的相互作用更容易。氧分压的增加有利于对酸酐的选择性，尽管与烯烃的选择性永远不会达到与n-戊烷相同。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},

The mechanisms involved include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. The principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, which is a well-studied process. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts, which are used in this process, depends on the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, influenced by the type of aliphatic alcohol used, the temperature of reduction of V5+, and other parameters, affects the exposure of the (001) plane, creates strain in the crystallite, and influences the extent of reduction of V5+. A P/V ratio higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilizes the catalyst not only in the reactants' atmosphere but also for calcination in air at high temperatures. The reaction pattern for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites required. The rate-determining step is the first one, the activation of the paraffin, which is facilitated by the vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst with high selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by factors such as the method of preparation, P/V ratio, presence of additives, and activation and conditioning procedures at high temperatures. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent, with a slight excess of phosphorus and defects in the stacking of platelets. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites varies depending on the preparation method, solvent, P/V ratio, and other factors. The excess phosphorus is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate. The transformation of the precursor to the active phase can result in different phases, and the P/V ratio, morphology, and presence of additives play key roles in avoiding the oxidation of (VO),P207 and the intermediate amorphous phase to a V5+ phosphate. The activation procedure involves either activation in an oxygen-free atmosphere followed by introduction of the reactant mixture or calcination in air until a temperature lower than 400°C is reached. The conditioning procedure involves changes in the catalytic behavior and physicochemical properties of the catalyst during prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture. The equilibrated catalyst has stable V4+ and is no longer reoxidizable in air at 400°C. The P/V ratio influences the reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst, with a slight excess of phosphorus providing the right compromise for high activity and selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has provided significant insights into the activation of paraffins. The catalyst used, (VO)2P2O7, has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature, and its properties and the mechanism of activation that allow high selectivity have been elucidated. The catalyst's ability to activate n-butane selectively is attributed to its unique properties, which include the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the P/V ratio, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation of the catalyst involves a complex chemistry that can influence the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and affect the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio is crucial, as a slight excess of phosphorus stabilizes the catalyst and prevents its oxidation. The morphology of the catalyst, particularly the exposure of the (100) plane, affects its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also influence the catalyst's behavior.

This process is influenced by factors such as pressure, reactant concentration, and the reactivity of the alkane. The selectivity of the reaction is determined by the ratio of the further reaction of this intermediate with activated oxygen to give carbon oxides versus alkoxy evolution to the desired products. The reduced state of the catalyst, achieved through specific treatments, can be stabilized even under conditions that favor the reoxidation of the metal. In contrast, an oxidized catalyst is not selective in the oxidation of propane, mainly yielding propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation in the catalyst is crucial for the selective oxidation of propane and isobutane. The optimal situation might be reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing conditions. In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, the selectivity to the desired product increases rapidly as the catalyst is progressively reduced. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced vanadium phases, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olefins. Bulk V2O5 has a considerably lower selectivity to olefins. The oxygen species involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions and chemisorbed species. Even though the vanadyl pyrophosphate is well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment, contributing to the formation of maleic anhydride. VOPO4 phases are sometimes already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction. The formation of oxidized VOPO4 phases in the reactor is affected by the reaction conditions, such as temperature and gas phase composition, and the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio. At low n-butane conversion, the selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, while at high n-butane conversion, the selectivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreases as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increases. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride, but excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride. The existence of a limited amount of beneficial V5 corresponds to the necessity for discrete amounts of O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface, which favor the transformation of intermediates to the final product. In the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO catalysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites. The hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed modifies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and carbon oxides, as well as the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides. When the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products is hindered due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites. Under these conditions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen species either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state. The lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane relative to those on heteropolycompound as the catalyst for isobutane oxidation is a main difference. When 1 mol% of 2-pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribution of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane is oxidized. This indicates that when the olefin is used as a reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleophilicity of the olefinic reactant, which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate. An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olefin never reaches the same values obtained with n-pentane.", "Chinese": "在异质催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过在较低温度下（通常小于450-500°C，对于乙烷）形成中间醇氧物种或烷基自由基物种来促进C-H键的活化。该过程受压力、反应物浓度和烷烃反应性等因素的影响。反应的选择性由该中间体与活化氧的进一步反应生成二氧化碳与醇氧物种向所需产物的演变之间的比率决定。通过特定处理实现的催化剂还原状态，即使在有利于金属再氧化的条件下也能稳定。相比之下，氧化催化剂在丙烷氧化中不具备选择性，主要产生丙烯和二氧化碳。催化剂中金属氧化程度对丙烷和异丁烷的有选择性氧化至关重要。如果在氧化条件下，即使在氧化条件下，也能保持还原、更具选择性的催化剂氧化状态，那么可能达到最佳情况。在氧化铝支持的钒氧化物的情况下，随着催化剂逐渐还原，对所需产物的选择性迅速增加。通过与底层支持物的相互作用稳定的部分还原钒相的支撑钒氧化物系统在形成烯烃方面更具选择性。V2O5的块体具有明显较低的烯烃选择性。参与n-丁烷多电子转化的氧物种既有体相氧离子也有化学吸附物种。尽管钒氧磷酸盐高度结晶且正式不含V5物种，但反应环境中会形成斑点或分散的V5物种，对马来酸酐的形成做出贡献。VOPO4相有时已经存在于催化剂中，特别是在化合物在反应前在空气中煅烧的情况下。反应器中氧化VOPO4相的形成受反应条件（如温度和气相组成）和钒氧磷酸盐的体相特征（如结晶度和P/V比）的影响。在低n-丁烷转化率下，选择性与烃氧比成正比，而在高n-丁烷转化率下，随着钒平均氧化度的增加，马来酸酐的选择性迅速下降。获得最高马来酸酐选择性需要有限量的表面V5，但过量的钒氧化会增强马来酸酐的连续燃烧。存在有限量的有益V5实际上对应于催化剂表面需要离散量的氧插入位点，这有利于中间体（即烯烃物种）向最终产物的转化。在VPO催化剂上的n-戊烷氧化中，产物分布受氧插入位点的可用性影响显著。烃氧比在进料中不仅改变选择性氧化产物与二氧化碳之间的相对比率，还改变马来酸与邻苯二甲酸酐之间的比率。当表面被吸附物种饱和时，由于氧插入位点的缺乏，最终稳定产物（马来酸和邻苯二甲酸酐）的形成受阻。在这些条件下，反应变得非选择性，因为中间烯烃物种在气相中解吸或被气相或直接在吸附状态下非选择性氧物种攻击。与异丁烷氧化催化剂杂多化合物相比，钒氧磷酸盐上n-戊烷氧化的活性位点的可用性较低是主要区别。当1 mol％的2-戊烯在空气中送入反应器时，观察到的产物分布与高浓度n-戊烷（即20 mol％）氧化时相同。这表明当烯烃用作反应物时，表面饱和发生在比n-戊烷低得多的烃分压下，这是由于烯烃反应物的高亲核性，使其与钒氧磷酸盐的路易斯酸中心的相互作用更容易。氧分压的增加有利于对酸酐的选择性，尽管与烯烃的选择性永远不会达到与n-戊烷相同。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},

The mechanisms involved include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. The principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, which is a well-studied process. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts, which are used in this process, depends on the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, influenced by the type of aliphatic alcohol used, the temperature of reduction of V5+, and other parameters, affects the exposure of the (001) plane, creates strain in the crystallite, and influences the extent of reduction of V5+. A P/V ratio higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilizes the catalyst not only in the reactants' atmosphere but also for calcination in air at high temperatures. The reaction pattern for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites required. The rate-determining step is the first one, the activation of the paraffin, which is facilitated by the vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst with high selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by factors such as the method of preparation, P/V ratio, presence of additives, and activation and conditioning procedures at high temperatures. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent, with a slight excess of phosphorus and defects in the stacking of platelets. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites varies depending on the preparation method, solvent, P/V ratio, and other factors. The excess phosphorus is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate. The transformation of the precursor to the active phase can result in different phases, and the P/V ratio, morphology, and presence of additives play key roles in avoiding the oxidation of (VO),P207 and the intermediate amorphous phase to a V5+ phosphate. The activation procedure involves either activation in an oxygen-free atmosphere followed by introduction of the reactant mixture or calcination in air until a temperature lower than 400°C is reached. The conditioning procedure involves changes in the catalytic behavior and physicochemical properties of the catalyst during prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture. The equilibrated catalyst has stable V4+ and is no longer reoxidizable in air at 400°C. The P/V ratio influences the reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst, with a slight excess of phosphorus providing the right compromise for high activity and selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has provided significant insights into the activation of paraffins. The catalyst used, (VO)2P2O7, has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature, and its properties and the mechanism of activation that allow high selectivity have been elucidated. The catalyst's ability to activate n-butane selectively is attributed to its unique properties, which include the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the P/V ratio, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures.

This process is influenced by factors such as pressure, reactant concentration, and the reactivity of the alkane. The selectivity of the reaction is determined by the ratio of the further reaction of this intermediate with activated oxygen to give carbon oxides versus alkoxy evolution to the desired products. The reduced state of the catalyst, achieved through specific treatments, can be stabilized even under conditions that favor the reoxidation of the metal. In contrast, an oxidized catalyst is not selective in the oxidation of propane, mainly yielding propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation in the catalyst is crucial for the selective oxidation of propane and isobutane. The optimal situation might be reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing conditions. In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, the selectivity to the desired product increases rapidly as the catalyst is progressively reduced. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced vanadium phases, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olefins. Bulk V2O5 has a considerably lower selectivity to olefins. The oxygen species involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions and chemisorbed species. Even though the vanadyl pyrophosphate is well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment, contributing to the formation of maleic anhydride. VOPO4 phases are sometimes already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction. The formation of oxidized VOPO4 phases in the reactor is affected by the reaction conditions, such as temperature and gas phase composition, and the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio. At low n-butane conversion, the selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, while at high n-butane conversion, the selectivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreases as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increases. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride, but excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride. The existence of a limited amount of beneficial V5 corresponds to the necessity for discrete amounts of O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface, which favor the transformation of intermediates to the final product. In the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO catalysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites. The hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed modifies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and carbon oxides, as well as the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides. When the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products is hindered due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites. Under these conditions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen species either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state. The lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane relative to those on heteropolycompound as the catalyst for isobutane oxidation is a main difference. When 1 mol% of 2-pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribution of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane is oxidized. This indicates that when the olefin is used as a reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleophilicity of the olefinic reactant, which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate. An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olefin never reaches the same values obtained with n-pentane.", "Chinese": "在异质催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过在较低温度下（通常小于450-500°C，对于乙烷）形成中间醇氧物种或烷基自由基物种来促进C-H键的活化。该过程受压力、反应物浓度和烷烃反应性等因素的影响。反应的选择性由该中间体与活化氧的进一步反应生成二氧化碳与醇氧物种向所需产物的演变之间的比率决定。通过特定处理实现的催化剂还原状态，即使在有利于金属再氧化的条件下也能稳定。相比之下，氧化催化剂在丙烷氧化中不具备选择性，主要产生丙烯和二氧化碳。催化剂中金属氧化程度对丙烷和异丁烷的有选择性氧化至关重要。如果在氧化条件下，即使在氧化条件下，也能保持还原、更具选择性的催化剂氧化状态，那么可能达到最佳情况。在氧化铝支持的钒氧化物的情况下，随着催化剂逐渐还原，对所需产物的选择性迅速增加。通过与底层支持物的相互作用稳定的部分还原钒相的支撑钒氧化物系统在形成烯烃方面更具选择性。V2O5的块体具有明显较低的烯烃选择性。参与n-丁烷多电子转化的氧物种既有体相氧离子也有化学吸附物种。尽管钒氧磷酸盐高度结晶且正式不含V5物种，但反应环境中会形成斑点或分散的V5物种，对马来酸酐的形成做出贡献。VOPO4相有时已经存在于催化剂中，特别是在化合物在反应前在空气中煅烧的情况下。反应器中氧化VOPO4相的形成受反应条件（如温度和气相组成）和钒氧磷酸盐的体相特征（如结晶度和P/V比）的影响。在低n-丁烷转化率下，选择性与烃氧比成正比，而在高n-丁烷转化率下，随着钒平均氧化度的增加，马来酸酐的选择性迅速下降。获得最高马来酸酐选择性需要有限量的表面V5，但过量的钒氧化会增强马来酸酐的连续燃烧。存在有限量的有益V5实际上对应于催化剂表面需要离散量的氧插入位点，这有利于中间体（即烯烃物种）向最终产物的转化。在VPO催化剂上的n-戊烷氧化中，产物分布受氧插入位点的可用性影响显著。烃氧比在进料中不仅改变选择性氧化产物与二氧化碳之间的相对比率，还改变马来酸与邻苯二甲酸酐之间的比率。当表面被吸附物种饱和时，由于氧插入位点的缺乏，最终稳定产物（马来酸和邻苯二甲酸酐）的形成受阻。在这些条件下，反应变得非选择性，因为中间烯烃物种在气相中解吸或被气相或直接在吸附状态下非选择性氧物种攻击。与异丁烷氧化催化剂杂多化合物相比，钒氧磷酸盐上n-戊烷氧化的活性位点的可用性较低是主要区别。当1 mol％的2-戊烯在空气中送入反应器时，观察到的产物分布与高浓度n-戊烷（即20 mol％）氧化时相同。这表明当烯烃用作反应物时，表面饱和发生在比n-戊烷低得多的烃分压下，这是由于烯烃反应物的高亲核性，使其与钒氧磷酸盐的路易斯酸中心的相互作用更容易。氧分压的增加有利于对酸酐的选择性，尽管与烯烃的选择性永远不会达到与n-戊烷相同。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},

The mechanisms involved include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. The principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, which is a well-studied process. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts, which are used in this process, depends on the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, influenced by the type of aliphatic alcohol used, the temperature of reduction of V5+, and other parameters, affects the exposure of the (001) plane, creates strain in the crystallite, and influences the extent of reduction of V5+. A P/V ratio higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilizes the catalyst not only in the reactants' atmosphere but also for calcination in air at high temperatures. The reaction pattern for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites required. The rate-determining step is the first one, the activation of the paraffin, which is facilitated by the vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst with high selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by factors such as the method of preparation, P/V ratio, presence of additives, and activation and conditioning procedures at high temperatures. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent, with a slight excess of phosphorus and defects in the stacking of platelets. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites varies depending on the preparation method, solvent, P/V ratio, and other factors. The excess phosphorus is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate. The transformation of the precursor to the active phase can result in different phases, and the P/V ratio, morphology, and presence of additives play key roles in avoiding the oxidation of (VO),P207 and the intermediate amorphous phase to a V5+ phosphate. The activation procedure involves either activation in an oxygen-free atmosphere followed by introduction of the reactant mixture or calcination in air until a temperature lower than 400°C is reached. The conditioning procedure involves changes in the catalytic behavior and physicochemical properties of the catalyst during prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture. The equilibrated catalyst has stable V4+ and is no longer reoxidizable in air at 400°C. The P/V ratio influences the reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst, with a slight excess of phosphorus providing the right compromise for high activity and selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that has provided significant insights into the activation of paraffins. The catalyst used, (VO)2P2O7, has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature, and its properties and the mechanism of activation that allow high selectivity have been elucidated. The catalyst's ability to activate n-butane selectively is attributed to its unique properties, which include the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the P/V ratio, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation of the catalyst involves a complex chemistry that can influence the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and affect the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio is crucial, as a slight excess of phosphorus stabilizes the catalyst and prevents its oxidation. The morphology of the catalyst, particularly the exposure of the (100) plane, affects its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also influence the catalyst's behavior. The mechanism of the reaction involves several steps, including oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, which are facilitated by the polyfunctional nature of the V-P catalysts.", "Chinese": "氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过提供活性位点促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。涉及的机制包括Mars van Krevelen机制和H-抽象。这些原理应用于工业选择性氧化烷烃，例如丁烷转化为马来酸酐，这是一个研究得很好的过程。V-P基催化剂的催化行为，用于此过程，取决于前驱体的制备方法、P/V比、添加剂的存在以及高温下的激活和调节方法。(VO)HP04.0.5H20晶体的形态，受所用脂肪醇类型、V5+还原温度和其他参数的影响，影响(001)平面的暴露，造成晶体中的应变，并影响V5+还原的程度。P/V比高于化学计量量不仅在反应物气氛中稳定催化剂，而且在高温下在空气中煅烧。丁烷氧化为马来酸酐的反应模式，这是机制的第一近似，显示了获得马来酸酐所需的初级步骤和所需的活性位点类型。决定速率的步骤是第一步，即烷烃的活化，这由具有高选择性的钒酸盐催化剂促进。选择性氧化n-丁烷至马来酸酐是一个研究得很好的工业过程，V-P基催化剂的催化行为受到制备方法、P/V比、添加剂的存在以及在高温下激活和调理前体的影响。最优催化剂的特征是有机溶剂中制备的微晶(V0)HPO4.O.5H20，具有轻微的磷过剩和板状堆叠中的缺陷。(VO)HP04.0.5H20结晶体的形态根据制备方法、溶剂、P/V比和其他因素而变化。过量的磷吸附在钒磷酸盐的表面。前体转化为活性相可能导致不同的相，P/V比、形态和添加剂的存在在避免(VO),P207和中间无定形相氧化为V5+磷酸盐中起关键作用。激活程序包括在无氧气氛中激活，然后引入反应混合物，或在空气中的温度低于400°C时煅烧。调理程序涉及在n-丁烷/空气混合物中长时间在线时催化剂的催化行为和物理化学性质的变化。平衡催化剂具有稳定的V4+，在400°C的空气中不再被氧化。P/V比影响催化剂的可还原性和可氧化性，轻微的磷过剩为高活性和选择性提供了正确的折衷。选择性氧化n-丁烷制马来酸酐是一个研究得很好的工业过程，它为理解烷烃的活化提供了重要的见解。所使用的催化剂(VO)2P2O7在科学文献中得到了彻底的研究，其性质和允许高选择性的活化机制已经被阐明。催化剂选择性活化n-丁烷的能力归因于其独特的性质，包括(VO)HP04.0.5H20结晶体的形态、P/V比以及在高温下激活和调节前体的方法。催化剂的制备涉及复杂的化学，可以影响(001)平面的暴露，造成晶粒的应变，并影响V5+还原的程度。P/V比是关键的，因为磷的轻微过量可以稳定催化剂，防止其氧化。催化剂的形态，特别是(100)平面的暴露，影响其氧化性。在含氧气氛中低温处理和某些添加剂的存在也可以影响催化剂的行为。反应机制涉及几个步骤，包括氧化脱氢、烯丙基氧化和亲电氧插入，这些步骤由V-P催化剂的多官能性性质促进。", "Doi": "10.1039/9781847553232-00246"},

This process is influenced by factors such as pressure, reactant concentration, and the reactivity of the alkane. The selectivity of the reaction is determined by the ratio of the further reaction of this intermediate with activated oxygen to give carbon oxides versus alkoxy evolution to the desired products. The reduced state of the catalyst, achieved through specific treatments, can be stabilized even under conditions that favor the reoxidation of the metal. In contrast, an oxidized catalyst is not selective in the oxidation of propane, mainly yielding propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation in the catalyst is crucial for the selective oxidation of propane and isobutane. The optimal situation might be reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation state could be maintained even under oxidizing conditions. In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, the selectivity to the desired product increases rapidly as the catalyst is progressively reduced. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced vanadium phases, stabilized by the interaction with the underlying support, are more selective in the formation of olefins. Bulk V2O5 has a considerably lower selectivity to olefins. The oxygen species involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions and chemisorbed species. Even though the vanadyl pyrophosphate is well crystallized and formally contains no V5 species, patches or dispersed V5 species develop in the reaction environment, contributing to the formation of maleic anhydride. VOPO4 phases are sometimes already present in the catalyst, especially when the compound has been calcined in air prior to the reaction. The formation of oxidized VOPO4 phases in the reactor is affected by the reaction conditions, such as temperature and gas phase composition, and the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such as its crystallinity and P/V ratio. At low n-butane conversion, the selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, while at high n-butane conversion, the selectivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreases as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increases. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic anhydride, but excessive vanadium oxidation leads to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of maleic anhydride. The existence of a limited amount of beneficial V5 corresponds to the necessity for discrete amounts of O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface, which favor the transformation of intermediates to the final product. In the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO catalysts, the distribution of the products is affected considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites. The hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed modifies the relative ratio between the products of selective oxidation and carbon oxides, as well as the ratio between maleic and phthalic anhydrides. When the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the formation of the final stable products is hindered due to the scarcity of O-insertion sites. Under these conditions, the reaction becomes nonselective because intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen species either in the gas phase or directly in the adsorbed state. The lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane relative to those on heteropolycompound as the catalyst for isobutane oxidation is a main difference. When 1 mol% of 2-pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribution of products is observed as in the case when a high concentration of n-pentane is oxidized. This indicates that when the olefin is used as a reactant, surface saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleophilicity of the olefinic reactant, which makes easier interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl pyrophosphate. An increase in the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olefin never reaches the same values obtained with n-pentane.", "Chinese": "在异质催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过在较低温度下（通常小于450-500°C，对于乙烷）形成中间醇氧物种或烷基自由基物种来促进C-H键的活化。该过程受压力、反应物浓度和烷烃反应性等因素的影响。反应的选择性由该中间体与活化氧的进一步反应生成二氧化碳与醇氧物种向所需产物的演变之间的比率决定。通过特定处理实现的催化剂还原状态，即使在有利于金属再氧化的条件下也能稳定。相比之下，氧化催化剂在丙烷氧化中不具备选择性，主要产生丙烯和二氧化碳。催化剂中金属氧化程度对丙烷和异丁烷的有选择性氧化至关重要。如果在氧化条件下，即使在氧化条件下，也能保持还原、更具选择性的催化剂氧化状态，那么可能达到最佳情况。在氧化铝支持的钒氧化物的情况下，随着催化剂逐渐还原，对所需产物的选择性迅速增加。通过与底层支持物的相互作用稳定的部分还原钒相的支撑钒氧化物系统在形成烯烃方面更具选择性。V2O5的块体具有明显较低的烯烃选择性。参与n-丁烷多电子转化的氧物种既有体相氧离子也有化学吸附物种。尽管钒氧磷酸盐高度结晶且正式不含V5物种，但反应环境中会形成斑点或分散的V5物种，对马来酸酐的形成做出贡献。VOPO4相有时已经存在于催化剂中，特别是在化合物在反应前在空气中煅烧的情况下。反应器中氧化VOPO4相的形成受反应条件（如温度和气相组成）和钒氧磷酸盐的体相特征（如结晶度和P/V比）的影响。在低n-丁烷转化率下，选择性与烃氧比成正比，而在高n-丁烷转化率下，随着钒平均氧化度的增加，马来酸酐的选择性迅速下降。获得最高马来酸酐选择性需要有限量的表面V5，但过量的钒氧化会增强马来酸酐的连续燃烧。存在有限量的有益V5实际上对应于催化剂表面需要离散量的氧插入位点，这有利于中间体（即烯烃物种）向最终产物的转化。在VPO催化剂上的n-戊烷氧化中，产物分布受氧插入位点的可用性影响显著。烃氧比在进料中不仅改变选择性氧化产物与二氧化碳之间的相对比率，还改变马来酸与邻苯二甲酸酐之间的比率。当表面被吸附物种饱和时，由于氧插入位点的缺乏，最终稳定产物（马来酸和邻苯二甲酸酐）的形成受阻。在这些条件下，反应变得非选择性，因为中间烯烃物种在气相中解吸或被气相或直接在吸附状态下非选择性氧物种攻击。与异丁烷氧化催化剂杂多化合物相比，钒氧磷酸盐上n-戊烷氧化的活性位点的可用性较低是主要区别。当1 mol％的2-戊烯在空气中送入反应器时，观察到的产物分布与高浓度n-戊烷（即20 mol％）氧化时相同。这表明当烯烃用作反应物时，表面饱和发生在比n-戊烷低得多的烃分压下，这是由于烯烃反应物的高亲核性，使其与钒氧磷酸盐的路易斯酸中心的相互作用更容易。氧分压的增加有利于对酸酐的选择性，尽管与烯烃的选择性永远不会达到与n-戊烷相同。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},

This mechanism is applied in the industrial production of maleic anhydride from butane.\"", "English": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the metal oxide acts as a source of lattice oxygen for the oxidative cleavage of C-H bonds in the alkane. The metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a hydroxyl group on the metal oxide surface and a radical on the alkane. The radical can then react with lattice oxygen to form a carbonyl group, which can further oxidize to form the desired product. This mechanism is widely used in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The H-abstraction mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate by a metal center, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. This mechanism is also important for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. The principles of these mechanisms are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this process, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride over a metal-oxide catalyst, typically vanadium pentoxide on a silica support.
