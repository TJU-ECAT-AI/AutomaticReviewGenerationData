{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials act as Lewis acid sites, stabilizing the transition state for C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves redox cycling and hydrogen abstraction by lattice oxygen, forming a metal-oxo intermediate, while the H-abstraction mechanism involves direct hydrogen atom transfer from the C-H bond to the metal center, creating a carbon-centered radical or cation. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as converting butane to maleic anhydride, by using supported metal oxide catalysts with isolated metal centers that selectively activate C-H bonds and promote desired oxidation reactions without over-oxidation to CO2.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr010333u"},

The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, involving alkane oxidation by metal oxides and subsequent reoxidation by molecular oxygen, is pivotal. Converting butane to maleic anhydride exemplifies this industrial process, involving a 14-electron oxidation to sequentially form butenes, butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which then becomes maleic anhydride. The rate-limiting step, butane's C-H bond activation, occurs via hydrogen abstraction on VIVO species or by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers, leading to 2-butenes or 2-butanone. This process, despite its complexity, is commercially viable, achieving high selectivities up to 97% at 65% conversion.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr900122p_0"},

The mechanisms involved, including the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction, are crucial in the industrial process of converting butane to maleic anhydride. This process is well-studied and has been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by the method of preparation, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the activation and conditioning procedures at high temperatures. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent, with a slight excess of phosphorus and defects in the stacking of platelets. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, influenced by various factors, affects the exposure of the (001) plane, creates strain in the crystallite, and influences the extent of reduction of V5+. The reaction pattern for the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride involves several steps, including oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, facilitated by the polyfunctional nature of the V-P catalysts. The rate-determining step is the activation of the paraffin, which is facilitated by the vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst with high selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1039/9781847553232-00246"},

{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds by forming intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species, crucial for heterogeneous catalysis. Selectivity in reactions, like the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, is determined by the ratio of intermediate reactions with oxygen to form carbon oxides versus desired products. Reduced catalyst states, stabilized under certain conditions, enhance selectivity, unlike oxidized catalysts which favor propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is key for selective oxidation of alkanes. In butane conversion, selectivity increases as the catalyst reduces, with supported vanadium oxide systems being more selective in olefin formation than bulk V2O5. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed oxygen. V5 species, despite not being formally present in vanadyl pyrophosphate, develop in the reaction environment, contributing to maleic anhydride formation. VOPO4 phases, sometimes pre-existing, affect the reaction under varying conditions. Selectivity to maleic anhydride is optimal with a limited amount of surface V5, as excessive oxidation diminishes selectivity. The availability of O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface is essential for the transformation of intermediates to final products. In n-pentane oxidation, the distribution of products is influenced by O-insertion sites, with hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratios affecting selectivity. Surface saturation with adsorbed species hinders the formation of stable products due to a lack of O-insertion sites, making the reaction nonselective. Olefins as reactants saturate the surface at lower pressures due to their high nucleophilicity, affecting product distribution. Increased oxygen partial pressure enhances selectivity to anhydrides.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},

This mechanism is pivotal in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride over vanadium pentoxide. H-abstraction, where a metal center removes a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate, also plays a role in selective oxidation.

DuPont's process uses a recirculating fluidized bed with a vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst, achieving 10-15% higher maleic anhydride selectivity in an anerobic environment compared to conventional fixed bed methods. This highlights the tailored catalytic properties of oxygen associated with vanadium, as demonstrated by high yields of acrylic acid from propane over MoV0.3Ti0.23Nb0.12Ox and acrylonitrile from propane over VSbO4 catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr000018s"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds by forming intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species at lower temperatures, affecting selectivity in the reaction of activated oxygen to carbon oxides versus desired products. Reduced catalyst states, stabilized under reoxidation conditions, enhance selectivity, unlike oxidized catalysts which yield propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is key for selective propane and isobutane oxidation. Reduced vanadium oxide catalysts on alumina increase selectivity to desired products as they are reduced further. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced phases are more selective for olefin formation than bulk V2O5. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed oxygen. Maleic anhydride formation benefits from dispersed V5 species, which are crucial for selectivity. Selectivity to maleic anhydride is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio at low n-butane conversion, decreasing with higher vanadium oxidation. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary for optimal selectivity, while excessive oxidation enhances maleic anhydride combustion. O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface favor the transformation of intermediates to final products. In n-pentane oxidation, product distribution is influenced by O-insertion site availability. Higher oxygen partial pressure favors anhydride selectivity, though not as effectively with olefins as with n-pentane.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds via the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction, crucial for selective alkane oxidation. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, metal oxides supply lattice oxygen for C-H bond cleavage, forming radicals that oxidize to desired products, exemplified in butane's conversion to maleic anhydride over vanadium pentoxide. H-abstraction involves hydrogen removal by metal centers, forming alkyl radicals. Both mechanisms are pivotal in industrial selective oxidation processes, achieving high selectivity for maleic anhydride with minimal byproducts.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr9411637"}
