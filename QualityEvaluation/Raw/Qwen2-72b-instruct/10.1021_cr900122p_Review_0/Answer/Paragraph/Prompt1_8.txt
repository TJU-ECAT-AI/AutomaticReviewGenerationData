Selectivity to maleic anhydride is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio at low n-butane conversion, decreasing with higher vanadium oxidation. A limited amount of V5 is necessary for high selectivity to maleic anhydride, but excessive oxidation enhances its combustion. O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface favor intermediate transformation to the final product. In n-pentane oxidation, product distribution is affected by O-insertion site availability. Surface saturation with adsorbed species hinders final product formation. Increased oxygen partial pressure favors anhydride selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds via the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms, crucial for selective alkane oxidation. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, metal oxides provide lattice oxygen for C-H bond cleavage, forming radicals that oxidize to desired products, widely applied in industrial processes like converting butane to maleic anhydride. H-abstraction involves metal centers removing hydrogen atoms, forming alkyl radicals. These principles are used in selective oxidation, exemplified by butane's conversion to maleic anhydride over vanadium pentoxide catalysts, where the Mars van Krevelen mechanism is dominant, ensuring high selectivity for maleic anhydride with minimal byproducts.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr9411637"}
