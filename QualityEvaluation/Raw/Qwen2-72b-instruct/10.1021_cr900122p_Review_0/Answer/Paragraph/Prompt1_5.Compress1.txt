{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, enabling selective oxidation of alkanes. Mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction are involved. This principle is applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the well-studied conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts, crucial for this process, is influenced by the method of preparation, P/V ratio, presence of additives, and activation at high temperatures. The morphology of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, affected by the type of alcohol, temperature, and other parameters, influences the exposure of the (001) plane, creating strain and affecting V5+ reduction. A P/V ratio higher than stoichiometric stabilizes the catalyst in reactants' atmosphere and during calcination. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, a well-documented industrial process, involves a reaction pattern starting with paraffin activation, facilitated by vanadylpyrophosphate with high selectivity. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20, a slight excess of phosphorus, and defects in platelets. The excess phosphorus adsorbs on the surface of the vanadylphosphate. The transformation to the active phase can result in different phases, influenced by the P/V ratio, morphology, and additives, which prevent oxidation to a V5+ phosphate. Activation involves either oxygen-free atmosphere followed by reactant introduction or calcination in air until temperatures below 400°C. Conditioning changes the catalytic behavior and properties during prolonged time-on-stream. The equilibrated catalyst has stable V4+ and is resistant to reoxidation in air at 400°C. The P/V ratio influences the catalyst's reducibility and reoxidizability, with a slight excess of phosphorus providing high activity and selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied process, elucidating the activation of paraffins. The catalyst's unique properties, including morphology, P/V ratio, and activation methodology, enable selective n-butane activation. The complex chemistry of catalyst preparation affects the exposure of the (001) plane, strain in the crystallite, and V5+ reduction extent. The P/V ratio is critical, stabilizing the catalyst and preventing oxidation. The morphology, particularly the (100) plane exposure, affects oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in oxygen and certain additives influence catalyst behavior.

Reduced catalyst states, like those in vanadium oxide, enhance selectivity, especially when partly reduced phases are stabilized by the support. Bulk V2O5 shows lower selectivity. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed ions. Patches of V5 species in vanadyl pyrophosphate contribute to maleic anhydride formation. Selectivity to maleic anhydride is optimal with a limited amount of surface V5, as excessive oxidation leads to its combustion.

The rate-determining step is the activation of paraffins, which the vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst performs with high selectivity. The equilibrated catalyst, characterized by stable V4+, is no longer reoxidizable in air at 400°C. A slight excess of phosphorus provides the right balance for high activity and selectivity. The process has provided insights into paraffin activation, with the catalyst's morphology, P/V ratio, and activation conditions playing key roles.", "Doi": "10.1039/9781847553232-00246"},

DuPont's commercial process converts butane to maleic anhydride using a recirculating fluidized bed with a vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst. The catalyst circulates between a reactor for butane contact and a regeneration reactor for reoxidation, achieving a 10-15% selectivity improvement in an anerobic environment over conventional fixed-bed methods.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr000018s"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation by forming intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species at lower temperatures, influenced by pressure, reactant concentration, and alkane reactivity. Selectivity is determined by the ratio of intermediate reactions with activated oxygen versus alkoxy evolution to desired products. Reduced catalyst states, stabilized under reoxidation conditions, are selective, unlike oxidized catalysts which yield propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is crucial for selective propane and isobutane oxidation. Maintaining a reduced catalyst state under oxidizing conditions optimizes selectivity. Alumina-supported vanadium oxide shows increased selectivity as it reduces, and supported systems with partly reduced vanadium phases are more selective for olefin formation than bulk V2O5. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed species. Vanadyl pyrophosphate develops V5 species contributing to maleic anhydride formation. VOPO4 phases, present after calcination, affect selectivity. At low n-butane conversion, selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, decreasing at high conversion due to vanadium oxidation. A limited amount of V5 is necessary for high selectivity to maleic anhydride, but excessive oxidation enhances maleic anhydride combustion. O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface favor intermediate transformation to final products. In n-pentane oxidation, product distribution is affected by O-insertion sites availability. Hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio modifies selective oxidation and carbon oxides ratio, as well as maleic and phthalic anhydrides ratio. Surface saturation with adsorbed species hinders final product formation due to scarce O-insertion sites, making the reaction nonselective. Vanadyl pyrophosphate has fewer active sites for n-pentane oxidation than heteropolycompound for isobutane. Olefin reactants saturate surfaces at lower pressures due to high nucleophilicity, affecting selectivity. Increased oxygen partial pressure favors anhydride selectivity, albeit lower than with n-pentane.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds in heterogeneous catalysis via the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves lattice oxygen transfer for C-H bond cleavage, forming a hydroxyl group and a radical that oxidizes to the desired product. H-abstraction directly removes hydrogen, forming an alkyl radical. These mechanisms are pivotal in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride over a vanadium pentoxide catalyst, where the Mars van Krevelen mechanism is dominant, ensuring high selectivity for maleic anhydride with minimal byproduct formation.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr9411637"}
