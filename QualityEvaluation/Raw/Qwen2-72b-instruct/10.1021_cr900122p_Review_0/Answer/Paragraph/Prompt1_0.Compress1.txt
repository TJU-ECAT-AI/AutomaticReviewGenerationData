Selectivity is determined by the ratio of intermediate reactions with activated oxygen versus alkoxy evolution to desired products. Reduced catalyst states, stabilized under certain conditions, enhance selectivity, unlike oxidized catalysts which yield propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is crucial for selective oxidation of alkanes. In alumina-supported vanadium oxide, selectivity increases with catalyst reduction. Partially reduced vanadium phases in supported systems, stabilized by the support, are more selective for olefin formation than bulk V2O5. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed species. Dispersed V5 species contribute to maleic anhydride formation. VOPO4 phases, present in some catalysts, affect product distribution. Selectivity to maleic anhydride is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio at low conversion, decreasing with higher vanadium oxidation. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary for optimal selectivity, but excessive oxidation enhances maleic anhydride combustion.

The type of C-H bond activation and the acidity/basicity of the catalyst significantly influence the process.", "Doi": "10.1080/01614949608006463"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, like vanadium in mixed-metal oxides, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the metal oxide is reduced by the hydrocarbon, forming a metal-carbon bond. H-abstraction involves the metal center removing a hydrogen atom, leaving a carbon-centered radical. These principles are applied in selective alkane oxidation, as seen in DuPont's commercial process converting butane to maleic anhydride using a recirculating fluidized bed with a vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst. The catalyst circulates between a reactor where it contacts butane and a regeneration reactor where it is reoxidized, achieving a 10-15% selectivity improvement in an anerobic environment compared to conventional fixed bed methods.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr000018s"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds in heterogeneous catalysis, forming intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species at lower temperatures, influenced by pressure, reactant concentration, and alkane reactivity. Selectivity is determined by the ratio of intermediate reactions with activated oxygen versus alkoxy evolution to desired products. Reduced catalyst states, like those in vanadium oxide, enhance selectivity, while oxidized states favor propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is critical for selective propane and isobutane oxidation. Maintaining a reduced catalyst state under oxidizing conditions optimizes selectivity. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced phases are more selective for olefin formation than bulk V2O5. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed oxygen. Dispersed V5 species in vanadyl pyrophosphate contribute to maleic anhydride formation. VOPO4 phases, present in calcined catalysts, affect selectivity. At low n-butane conversion, selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, decreasing with higher vanadium oxidation. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary for high selectivity to maleic anhydride, preventing its excessive oxidation. O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface favor the transformation of intermediates to final products. In n-pentane oxidation, product distribution is influenced by O-insertion sites. Surface saturation with adsorbed species hinders final product formation. Increased oxygen partial pressure favors anhydride selectivity, though not as effectively with olefins as with n-pentane.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds via the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms, crucial for selective alkane oxidation. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, metal oxides provide lattice oxygen for C-H bond cleavage, forming hydroxyl groups and alkyl radicals that oxidize to desired products. This mechanism is pivotal in industrial processes like converting butane to maleic anhydride over vanadium pentoxide catalysts. H-abstraction involves metal centers removing hydrogen atoms from alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that react with oxygen to produce oxygenates. Both mechanisms are essential in the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, a process highly selective for the desired product with minimal byproduct formation.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr9411637"}
