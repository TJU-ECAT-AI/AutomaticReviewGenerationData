Selectivity is determined by the ratio of further reactions with activated oxygen versus alkoxy evolution to desired products. Reduced catalyst states, stabilized under reoxidation conditions, enhance selectivity, unlike oxidized catalysts which yield propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is crucial for selective oxidation of propane and isobutane. Maintaining a reduced catalyst state under oxidizing conditions optimizes selectivity. Alumina-supported vanadium oxide shows increased selectivity as it reduces, and supported systems with partly reduced vanadium phases are more selective in olefin formation. Bulk V2O5 has lower olefin selectivity. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed species. Vanadyl pyrophosphate develops V5 species contributing to maleic anhydride formation. VOPO4 phases present in catalysts affect selectivity.

The catalyst's ability to selectively activate paraffins is a key property, as evidenced by the stable V4+ in equilibrated catalysts, which are not reoxidizable in air at 400°C. The P/V ratio affects the catalyst's reducibility and reoxidizability, with a slight excess of phosphorus providing optimal activity and selectivity. The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride is a well-documented process, offering insights into paraffin activation and the role of catalyst morphology, P/V ratio, and activation conditions.", "Doi": "10.1039/9781847553232-00246"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers, like vanadium ions in a stable matrix (p.419), are pivotal for C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, involving Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms (p.432). These principles are crucial for selective alkane oxidation, exemplified by butane's conversion to maleic anhydride, where acidity and basicity of the catalyst (p.433) are key factors.", "Doi": "10.1080/01614949608006463"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, like vanadium in mixed-metal oxides, facilitate C-H bond activation via mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, metal oxide catalysts reduce hydrocarbons, forming metal-carbon bonds. H-abstraction involves metal centers removing hydrogen atoms, leaving carbon-centered radicals. These principles are applied in selective alkane oxidation, exemplified by DuPont's process converting butane to maleic anhydride using vanadium pyrophosphate in a recirculating fluidized bed. The catalyst's circulation between a reactor for butane contact and a regeneration reactor for reoxidation improves maleic anhydride selectivity by 10-15% in an anerobic environment compared to conventional fixed-bed methods.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr000018s"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds by forming intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species at lower temperatures, influenced by pressure, reactant concentration, and alkane reactivity. Selectivity is determined by the ratio of intermediate reactions with oxygen to form carbon oxides versus desired products. Reduced catalyst states, stabilized under reoxidation conditions, enhance selectivity, unlike oxidized catalysts which yield propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is crucial for selective propane and isobutane oxidation. Maintaining a reduced catalyst state under oxidizing conditions optimizes selectivity. Alumina-supported vanadium oxide shows increased selectivity as it reduces, and supported systems with partly reduced vanadium phases are more selective for olefin formation. Bulk V2O5 has lower olefin selectivity. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed species. Dispersed V5 species contribute to maleic anhydride formation. VOPO4 phases present in catalysts affect selectivity. At low n-butane conversion, selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, decreasing at high conversion due to vanadium oxidation. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary for high maleic anhydride selectivity, but excessive oxidation enhances maleic anhydride combustion. O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface favor intermediate transformations to final products. In n-pentane oxidation, product distribution is influenced by O-insertion site availability. Higher oxygen partial pressure favors anhydride selectivity, but not as much with olefins as with n-pentane.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds via the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction, facilitating selective alkane oxidation. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the metal oxide acts as a lattice oxygen source, abstracting hydrogen from alkanes to form radicals that react with lattice oxygen, producing carbonyl groups. This mechanism is pivotal in industrial processes like converting butane to maleic anhydride over vanadium pentoxide catalysts. H-abstraction involves metal centers directly removing hydrogen atoms from alkanes, forming alkyl radicals. Both mechanisms are crucial for selective oxidation, with the Mars van Krevelen mechanism being dominant in butane's conversion to maleic anhydride, ensuring high selectivity and minimal byproduct formation.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr9411637"}
