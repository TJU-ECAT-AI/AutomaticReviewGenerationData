{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, like vanadium phosphates, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, enabling selective oxidation of alkanes. Mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction are involved. The principles are applied industrially, notably in the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, a well-studied process. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts, used in this process, is influenced by the preparation method, P/V ratio, additives, and high-temperature activation. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, affected by the type of alcohol and temperature, influences the exposure of the (001) plane and the reduction of V5+. A P/V ratio higher than stoichiometric stabilizes the catalyst. The reaction pattern for butane to maleic anhydride involves oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, with the first step being rate-determining. The catalyst's ability to selectively activate paraffins is a key property. The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride is a well-documented industrial process, providing insights into paraffin activation. The catalyst (VO)2P2O7, with its unique properties and activation mechanism, allows for high selectivity. Preparation involves complex chemistry affecting the exposure of the (001) plane and V5+ reduction. The P/V ratio is crucial, as a slight excess of phosphorus prevents catalyst oxidation. The morphology, especially the (100) plane exposure, affects oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment and additives also influence catalyst behavior.

H-abstraction involves metal centers removing hydrogen atoms, leaving carbon-centered radicals. These principles are applied in selective alkane oxidation, as seen in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. DuPont's process uses a vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst in a recirculating fluidized bed, achieving 10-15% higher selectivity for maleic anhydride in an anerobic environment compared to conventional fixed beds.

{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds in heterogeneous catalysis by forming intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species, influenced by pressure, reactant concentration, and alkane reactivity. Selectivity is determined by the ratio of intermediate reactions with activated oxygen versus alkoxy evolution to desired products. Reduced catalyst states, stabilized under reoxidation conditions, enhance selectivity, unlike oxidized catalysts which yield propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is critical for selective propane and isobutane oxidation. Maintaining a reduced catalyst state under oxidizing conditions optimizes selectivity. Alumina-supported vanadium oxide's selectivity increases with progressive reduction, and partly reduced vanadium phases in supported systems enhance olefin formation. Bulk V2O5 has lower olefin selectivity. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed oxygen. Vanadyl pyrophosphate develops V5 species, contributing to maleic anhydride formation. VOPO4 phases, present after calcination, affect selectivity. Reaction conditions and vanadyl pyrophosphate features influence VOPO4 phase formation. Selectivity to maleic anhydride is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio at low n-butane conversion, decreasing with higher vanadium oxidation. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary for high selectivity to maleic anhydride, preventing its excessive oxidation. O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface favor the transformation of intermediates to final products. In n-pentane oxidation, product distribution is affected by O-insertion site availability. Hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio modifies the ratio of selective oxidation products to carbon oxides and the ratio of maleic to phthalic anhydrides. Surface saturation with adsorbed species hinders final product formation due to scarce O-insertion sites, making the reaction nonselective. Olefinic species desorb or are attacked by unselective oxygen species under these conditions. Vanadyl pyrophosphate has fewer active sites for n-pentane oxidation than for isobutane. Olefins cause surface saturation at lower hydrocarbon partial pressures due to their high nucleophilicity. Increased oxygen partial pressure favors anhydride selectivity, though not as high as with n-pentane.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},

The excess phosphorus adsorbed on the catalyst surface helps prevent oxidation. Low-temperature treatment and certain additives influence catalyst behavior. The mechanism includes several steps facilitated by the polyfunctional nature of V-P catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1039/9781847553232-00246"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers, like vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix, are pivotal for C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, involving mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. The type of C-H bond activation and the acidity/basicity of the catalyst are critical. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.", "Doi": "10.1080/01614949608006463"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, like vanadium in mixed-metal oxides, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis via mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These processes are crucial for selective alkane oxidation, as seen in the DuPont process converting butane to maleic anhydride. Using a recirculating fluidized bed with a vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst, the process achieves a 10-15% selectivity improvement in an anerobic environment compared to conventional fixed-bed methods. This highlights the tailored catalytic properties of oxygen associated with vanadium, which can be optimized for specific reactions.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr000018s"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds in heterogeneous catalysis, forming intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species at lower temperatures, influenced by pressure, reactant concentration, and alkane reactivity. Selectivity is determined by the ratio of intermediate reactions with activated oxygen versus alkoxy evolution to desired products. Reduced catalyst states, stabilized under reoxidation conditions, enhance selectivity, unlike oxidized catalysts which yield propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is critical for selective propane and isobutane oxidation. Maintaining a reduced catalyst state under oxidizing conditions optimizes selectivity. Alumina-supported vanadium oxide shows increased selectivity as it reduces, and supported systems with partly reduced vanadium phases are more selective for olefin formation. Bulk V2O5 has lower olefin selectivity. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed species. Vanadyl pyrophosphate develops V5 species, contributing to maleic anhydride formation. VOPO4 phases present in calcined catalysts affect selectivity. At low n-butane conversion, selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, decreasing at high conversion due to vanadium oxidation. A limited amount of V5 is necessary for high selectivity to maleic anhydride, but excessive oxidation enhances its combustion. O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface favor intermediate transformation to final products. In n-pentane oxidation, product distribution is influenced by O-insertion sites. Higher oxygen partial pressure favors anhydride selectivity, albeit lower with olefins compared to n-pentane.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds via the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction, crucial for selective alkane oxidation. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, metal oxides provide lattice oxygen for C-H bond cleavage, forming hydroxyl groups and alkyl radicals that oxidize to desired products. This mechanism is pivotal in industrial processes like converting butane to maleic anhydride over vanadium pentoxide catalysts. H-abstraction, involving hydrogen atom removal by metal centers, also plays a role in alkane oxidation. Both mechanisms ensure high selectivity for maleic anhydride with minimal byproduct formation.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr9411637"}
