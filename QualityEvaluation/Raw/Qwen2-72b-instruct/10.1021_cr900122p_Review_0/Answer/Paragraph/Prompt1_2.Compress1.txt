Mars van Krevelen involves redox cycling and hydrogen abstraction by lattice oxygen, while H-abstraction involves direct hydrogen atom transfer from C-H bonds to the metal center. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, using metal-oxide catalysts with isolated metal centers that selectively activate C-H bonds, promoting desired oxidation reactions and minimizing over-oxidation to CO2.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr010333u"},

The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride exemplifies this, involving a 14-electron oxidation process with high selectivity (up to 97% at 65% conversion). This commercial process starts with butane oxidation to butenes, then butadiene, and finally 1,4-dihydrofuran, which becomes maleic anhydride. The rate-determining step is butane's CH bond activation, typically via hydrogen abstraction on VIVO species or by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers, leading to 2-butenes or 2-butanone. These mechanisms are central to the Mars van Krevelen process and alternative H-abstraction pathways, facilitating the selective oxidation of alkanes.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr900122p_0"},

Mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction are involved. This principle is applied industrially, notably in the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, a well-studied process. The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts, used in this process, is influenced by the preparation method, P/V ratio, additives, and high-temperature activation. The morphology of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, affected by preparation conditions, influences the exposure of the (001) plane, strain in the crystallite, and reduction of V5+. A P/V ratio higher than stoichiometric stabilizes (VO)P207 in reactants' atmosphere and during high-temperature calcination. The reaction pattern for n-butane to maleic anhydride, involving oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, is facilitated by the catalyst with high selectivity. The rate-determining step is the activation of n-butane, which is selectively achieved by vanadylpyrophosphate. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-documented industrial process, thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20, a slight excess of phosphorus, and defects in the stacking of platelets. The excess phosphorus is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate, stabilizing the catalyst and preventing oxidation. The morphology of the catalyst, particularly the exposure of the (100) plane, affects its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can influence the catalyst's behavior. The mechanism of the reaction involves several steps, including oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, facilitated by the polyfunctional nature of the V-P catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1039/9781847553232-00246"},

{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds in heterogeneous catalysis, forming intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species at lower temperatures, influenced by pressure, reactant concentration, and alkane reactivity. Selectivity is determined by the ratio of intermediate reactions with activated oxygen versus alkoxy evolution to desired products. Reduced catalyst states, stabilized under reoxidation conditions, enhance selectivity, whereas oxidized catalysts yield propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is critical for selective propane and isobutane oxidation. Maintaining a reduced catalyst state under oxidizing conditions optimizes selectivity. In alumina-supported vanadium oxide, selectivity increases with catalyst reduction. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced phases are more selective for olefin formation than bulk V2O5. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed species. Dispersed V5 species contribute to maleic anhydride formation. VOPO4 phases, present in calcined catalysts, affect selectivity. At low n-butane conversion, selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio; at high conversion, it decreases with increased vanadium oxidation. A limited amount of surface V5 is essential for high selectivity to maleic anhydride, preventing its excessive oxidation. O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface favor the transformation of intermediates to final products. In n-pentane oxidation, product distribution is influenced by O-insertion sites. The hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio modifies the ratio of selective oxidation products to carbon oxides and the ratio of maleic to phthalic anhydrides. Surface saturation with adsorbed species hinders the formation of stable products due to a scarcity of O-insertion sites, leading to nonselective reactions. Olefins interact more easily with the catalyst, causing surface saturation at lower pressures.

The H-abstraction mechanism directly abstracts hydrogen, forming a metal-hydrogen bond and a carbon-centered radical. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, using metal-oxide catalysts with isolated metal centers to selectively activate C-H bonds and promote desired oxidation reactions while minimizing over-oxidation to CO2.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr010333u"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, like vanadium phosphate, enable selective C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, crucial for converting alkanes into oxygenates. The direct conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, a commercial process, exemplifies this challenge. Butane undergoes a 14-electron oxidation, forming butenes, butadiene, 1,4-dihydrofuran, and finally maleic anhydride. The rate-determining step, CH bond activation, involves either a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species or H-abstraction by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers, leading to 2-butenes or 2-butanone, which can be converted into butadiene via Brnsted acid catalysis.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr900122p_0"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, like V-P-based catalysts, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, enabling selective alkane oxidation. Mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction are involved. The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process, where the catalyst's behavior is influenced by the method of preparation, P/V ratio, additives, and activation procedures. The morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites and the excess phosphorus stabilize the catalyst, preventing oxidation. The reaction pattern for butane to maleic anhydride involves oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, with the first step being rate-determining. The catalyst's unique properties, including the P/V ratio and morphology, enable selective activation of n-butane with high selectivity. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent, with a slight excess of phosphorus and defects in the stacking of platelets. The excess phosphorus is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate, and the transformation of the precursor to the active phase is influenced by the P/V ratio, morphology, and additives. The activation procedure involves either activation in an oxygen-free atmosphere followed by introduction of the reactant mixture or calcination in air until a temperature lower than 400°C is reached. The conditioning procedure involves changes in the catalytic behavior and physicochemical properties of the catalyst during prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture. The equilibrated catalyst has stable V4+ and is no longer reoxidizable in air at 400°C. The P/V ratio influences the reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst, with a slight excess of phosphorus providing the right compromise for high activity and selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1039/9781847553232-00246"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers, like vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix, are pivotal for C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, employing mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. The type of C-H bond activation and the acidity/basicity of the catalyst are critical. These principles are applied in the selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.", "Doi": "10.1080/01614949608006463"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, like vanadium in mixed-metal oxides, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis via mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, metal oxide catalysts reduce hydrocarbons, forming metal-carbon bonds and releasing water. H-abstraction involves metal centers removing hydrogen atoms from hydrocarbons, creating metal-hydrogen bonds and carbon-centered radicals. These principles are applied in selective alkane oxidation, exemplified by DuPont's commercial process converting butane to maleic anhydride using a recirculating fluidized bed with a vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst. The catalyst circulates between a reactor where it contacts butane and a regeneration reactor where it is reoxidized, achieving a 10-15% selectivity improvement in an anerobic environment over conventional fixed bed methods.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr000018s"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds in heterogeneous catalysis, forming intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species at lower temperatures. Selectivity is determined by the ratio of intermediate reactions with activated oxygen versus alkoxy evolution to desired products. Reduced catalyst states, stabilized under reoxidation conditions, enhance selectivity. Oxidized catalysts yield propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is crucial for selective propane and isobutane oxidation. Maintaining a reduced catalyst state under oxidizing conditions optimizes selectivity. Alumina-supported vanadium oxide shows increased selectivity as it reduces. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced phases are more selective in olefin formation than bulk V2O5. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed species. Vanadyl pyrophosphate develops V5 species, contributing to maleic anhydride formation. VOPO4 phases present in calcined catalysts affect selectivity. Reaction conditions and vanadyl pyrophosphate features influence VOPO4 phase formation. Selectivity to maleic anhydride is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio at low n-butane conversion. Excessive vanadium oxidation enhances maleic anhydride combustion. A limited amount of V5 is necessary for high selectivity to maleic anhydride. O-insertion sites favor the transformation of intermediates to final products. In n-pentane oxidation, O-insertion site availability affects product distribution. Hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio modifies the ratio of selective oxidation products to carbon oxides and the ratio of maleic to phthalic anhydrides. Surface saturation with adsorbed species hinders final product formation. Nonselective reactions occur when intermediate olefinic species desorb or are attacked by unselective oxygen species. Vanadyl pyrophosphate has fewer active sites for n-pentane oxidation than heteropolycompound for isobutane. 2-pentene as a reactant leads to surface saturation at lower hydrocarbon partial pressure. Increased oxygen partial pressure favors anhydride selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},

The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves lattice oxygen transfer and hydrogen abstraction, leading to alkane oxidation. The H-abstraction mechanism directly removes hydrogen atoms by a metal center. In the industrial conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, vanadium pentoxide acts as a catalyst, with the Mars van Krevelen mechanism being dominant. Vanadium serves as a redox mediator, ensuring high selectivity for maleic anhydride with minimal byproduct formation.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr9411637"}
