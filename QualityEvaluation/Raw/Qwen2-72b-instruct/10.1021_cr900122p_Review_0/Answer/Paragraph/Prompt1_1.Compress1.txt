Mars van Krevelen involves redox cycling and hydrogen abstraction by lattice oxygen, forming metal-oxo intermediates. H-abstraction involves direct hydrogen atom transfer from C-H bonds to the metal center.

Butane's conversion to maleic anhydride, a commercial process achieving up to 97% selectivity, exemplifies this. Butane undergoes a 14-electron oxidation, forming butenes, then butadiene, and finally 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is converted to maleic anhydride.

The morphology of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, affected by preparation conditions, impacts the exposure of the (001) plane and V5+ reduction. A P/V ratio above stoichiometric stabilizes (VO)P207 in reactants' atmosphere and high-temperature calcination. The reaction pattern for n-butane to maleic anhydride involves oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, with the first step being rate-determining. The vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst selectively activates paraffins. The equilibrated catalyst has stable V4+ and is resistant to reoxidation. A slight excess of phosphorus provides a balance between reducibility and reoxidizability for high activity and selectivity. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-documented process, providing insights into paraffin activation.", "Doi": "10.1039/9781847553232-00246"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers, like vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix (p.419), are pivotal in C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, employing Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms (p.432). This facilitates selective alkane oxidation, exemplified by butane's conversion to maleic anhydride. The process's efficiency is influenced by the type of C-H bond activation and the catalyst's acidity and basicity (p.433).", "Doi": "10.1080/01614949608006463"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, particularly vanadium, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis via mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In selective alkane oxidation, vanadium's catalytic properties can be tailored for enhanced performance. DuPont's commercial process converts butane to maleic anhydride using a recirculating fluidized bed with a vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst, achieving a 10-15% selectivity improvement in an anerobic environment compared to conventional methods. This exemplifies the application of C-H bond activation principles in industrial catalysis.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr000018s"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation by forming intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species at lower temperatures, influenced by pressure, reactant concentration, and alkane reactivity. Selectivity is determined by the ratio of further reactions with activated oxygen versus alkoxy evolution to desired products. Reduced catalyst states, stabilized under conditions favoring reoxidation, enhance selectivity, unlike oxidized catalysts which yield propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is critical for selective oxidation of propane and isobutane. Maintaining a reduced catalyst state under oxidizing conditions optimizes selectivity. Alumina-supported vanadium oxide shows increased selectivity as it reduces, and supported systems with partly reduced vanadium phases are more selective for olefin formation. Bulk V2O5 has lower olefin selectivity. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed species. Dispersed V5 species contribute to maleic anhydride formation. VOPO4 phases, present in some catalysts, affect selectivity. At low n-butane conversion, selectivity is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, decreasing at high conversion due to vanadium oxidation. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary for high selectivity to maleic anhydride, but excessive oxidation enhances its combustion. O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface favor the transformation of intermediates to final products. In n-pentane oxidation, product distribution is influenced by O-insertion sites. Oxygen partial pressure favors anhydride selectivity, but not as much with olefins as with n-pentane.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds via the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction, crucial for selective alkane oxidation. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves metal oxide as a lattice oxygen source, abstracting hydrogen from alkanes to form radicals that oxidize to desired products. This mechanism is pivotal in industrial processes like converting butane to maleic anhydride over vanadium pentoxide. H-abstraction, where a metal center removes a hydrogen atom, also plays a role. The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride exemplifies these principles, with vanadium acting as a redox mediator, ensuring high selectivity for maleic anhydride with minimal byproduct formation.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr9411637"}
