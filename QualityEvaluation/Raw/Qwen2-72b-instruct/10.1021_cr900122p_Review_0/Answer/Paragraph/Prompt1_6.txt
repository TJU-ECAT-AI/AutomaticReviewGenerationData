{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials act as Lewis acid sites, stabilizing the transition state for C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves redox cycling and hydrogen abstraction by lattice oxygen, forming a metal-oxo intermediate. The H-abstraction mechanism directly removes hydrogen atoms, forming a metal-hydrogen bond and a carbon-centered radical or cation. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as converting butane to maleic anhydride, by using metal-oxide catalysts with isolated metal centers that selectively activate C-H bonds, promoting desired oxidation reactions while minimizing over-oxidation to CO2 and undesired byproducts.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr010333u"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, like vanadium phosphate (VPO), enable selective C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, crucial for alkane oxidation. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, involving alkane oxidation by the metal oxide and solid reoxidation by molecular oxygen, is pivotal. Butane's conversion to maleic anhydride, a commercial process achieving up to 97% selectivity, exemplifies this. Butane undergoes a 14-electron oxidation, forming butenes, butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which converts to maleic anhydride. The rate-determining step is butane's C-H bond activation, typically via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species or H-abstraction by activated O2 on VIV centers, leading to 2-butene or 2-butanone, which can then be converted to butadiene.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr900122p_0"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, like vanadyl phosphates, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, enabling selective oxidation of alkanes. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process that employs V-P-based catalysts. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is influenced by the method of preparation, P/V ratio, presence of additives, and activation procedures. The morphology of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, affected by preparation conditions, impacts the exposure of the (001) plane and the reduction of V5+. A P/V ratio higher than stoichiometric stabilizes the catalyst under various conditions. The reaction pattern for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride involves oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and electrophilic oxygen insertion, with the first step being rate-determining. The vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst selectively activates paraffins, a key property for high selectivity. The optimal catalyst is characterized by microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20, a slight excess of phosphorus, and defects in the stacking of platelets. The excess phosphorus adsorbs on the surface, aiding in avoiding catalyst oxidation. The activation procedure can involve oxygen-free atmosphere activation or calcination in air below 400°C. Conditioning changes the catalytic behavior over time, with equilibrated catalysts having stable V4+ and being less reoxidizable. The P/V ratio influences the catalyst's reducibility and reoxidizability, with a slight excess providing a balance for high activity and selectivity. The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied process, providing insights into paraffin activation.

Selectivity is determined by the ratio of intermediate reactions with activated oxygen versus alkoxy evolution to desired products. Reduced catalyst states, stabilized under conditions favoring reoxidation, enhance selectivity. Oxidized catalysts yield propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is critical for selective propane and isobutane oxidation. Maintaining a reduced catalyst state under oxidizing conditions optimizes selectivity. Alumina-supported vanadium oxide's selectivity increases with progressive reduction. Supported vanadium oxide systems with partly reduced phases are more selective for olefin formation than bulk V2O5. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed species. Patches of V5 species in vanadyl pyrophosphate contribute to maleic anhydride formation. VOPO4 phases, present in calcined catalysts, affect selectivity. The hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio impacts selectivity, with a limited amount of surface V5 necessary for optimal maleic anhydride selectivity. Excessive vanadium oxidation enhances maleic anhydride combustion. O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface favor intermediate transformations to final products.

{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers, e.g., vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix, are pivotal for C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, employing Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms. This facilitates selective alkane oxidation, demonstrated by butane's conversion to maleic anhydride, where the type of C-H bond activation and catalyst acidity/basicity are critical.", "Doi": "10.1080/01614949608006463"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, like vanadium in mixed-metal oxides, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, metal oxide catalysts reduce hydrocarbons, forming metal-carbon bonds and releasing water. H-abstraction involves metal centers abstracting hydrogen atoms, leaving carbon-centered radicals. These principles are applied in selective alkane oxidation, as seen in DuPont's commercial process converting butane to maleic anhydride using a vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst in a recirculating fluidized bed, achieving 10-15% selectivity improvement in an anerobic environment over conventional fixed bed methods. This highlights the tailored catalytic properties of oxygen associated with vanadium for enhanced alkane conversion.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr000018s"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds by forming intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species at lower temperatures, influenced by pressure, reactant concentration, and alkane reactivity. Selectivity is determined by the ratio of intermediate reactions with activated oxygen versus alkoxy evolution to desired products. Reduced catalyst states, stabilized under reoxidation conditions, enhance selectivity, unlike oxidized catalysts which yield propene and carbon oxides. The degree of metal oxidation is crucial for selective propane and isobutane oxidation. Reduced vanadium oxide catalysts on alumina increase selectivity as they are progressively reduced, with supported systems showing enhanced olefin selectivity compared to bulk V2O5. Oxygen species in n-butane transformation include bulk and chemisorbed ions. Patches of V5 species develop in the reaction environment, contributing to maleic anhydride formation. VOPO4 phases present in catalysts affect selectivity under varying reaction conditions. Selectivity to maleic anhydride is proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio at low n-butane conversion, decreasing with higher vanadium oxidation. A limited amount of surface V5 is necessary for high selectivity to maleic anhydride, with excessive oxidation leading to its combustion. O-insertion sites on the catalyst surface favor the transformation of intermediates to final products. In n-pentane oxidation, product distribution is influenced by O-insertion site availability. Higher oxygen partial pressure favors anhydride selectivity, though not as high as with n-pentane.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},
{"DOC": "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials activate C-H bonds via the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction, crucial for selective alkane oxidation. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, metal oxides provide lattice oxygen for C-H bond cleavage, forming hydroxyl groups and alkyl radicals that oxidize to desired products. This mechanism is pivotal in industrial processes like converting butane to maleic anhydride over vanadium pentoxide. H-abstraction, involving hydrogen atom removal by metal centers, also plays a role. The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride exemplifies these principles, with vanadium acting as a redox mediator in the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, achieving high selectivity for maleic anhydride with minimal byproducts.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr9411637"}
