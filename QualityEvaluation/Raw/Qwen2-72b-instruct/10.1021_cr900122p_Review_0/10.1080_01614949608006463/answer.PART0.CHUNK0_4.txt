1.Isolated metal centers, such as vanadium ions, in a quasi-inert matrix facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The specific mechanisms involved include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The role of acidity and basicity is also crucial in these processes.
