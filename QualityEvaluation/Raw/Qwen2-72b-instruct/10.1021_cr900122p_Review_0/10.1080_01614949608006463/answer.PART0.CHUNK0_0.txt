1.Isolated metal centers, such as vanadium ions, in a quasi-inert matrix facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanisms involved in these processes include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The type of C-H bond activation and the role of acidity and basicity are also crucial factors in the catalytic process.

1.在惰性基质中,孤立的金属中心(如钒离子)促进了异相催化中C-H键的活化。这些过程涉及的机制包括Mars van Krevelen机制和H-抽提。这些原理应用于工业选择性氧化烷烃,例如丁烷转化为马来酸酐。C-H键活化的类型和酸碱性的作用也是催化过程中的关键因素。
