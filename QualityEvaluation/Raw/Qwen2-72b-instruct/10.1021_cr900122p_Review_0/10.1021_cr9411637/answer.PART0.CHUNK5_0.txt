[1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-known mechanism for the oxidation of organic compounds over metal oxides. In this mechanism, the metal oxide acts as a source of oxygen, which is transferred to the organic substrate. The metal oxide is then reduced, and the process is repeated. This mechanism is often invoked to explain the selective oxidation of alkanes to carbonyl compounds over metal oxides."
[2] "The H-abstraction mechanism involves the direct abstraction of a hydrogen atom from an organic substrate by a metal center. This mechanism is often invoked to explain the activation of C-H bonds over metal centers on oxide surfaces."
[3] "The selective oxidation of alkanes to carbonyl compounds is an important industrial process. One example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This process is typically carried out over a vanadium pentoxide catalyst. The vanadium pentoxide acts as a source of oxygen, which is transferred to the butane to form maleic anhydride. The vanadium pentoxide is then reduced, and the process is repeated."

1.火星-范克雷维尔机制是一种众所周知的机制，用于在金属氧化物上氧化有机化合物。在这种机制中，金属氧化物充当氧气的来源，氧气被转移到有机底物。然后金属氧化物被还原，过程重复。这种机制经常被用来解释在金属氧化物上选择性氧化烷烃为羰基化合物。
2.H-抽象机制涉及金属中心直接从有机底物中提取氢原子。这种机制经常被用来解释在氧化物表面上金属中心上C-H键的活化。
3.选择性氧化烷烃为羰基化合物是一个重要的工业过程。一个例子是丁烷转化为马来酸酐。这个过程通常在五氧化二钒催化剂上进行。五氧化二钒充当氧气的来源，氧气被转移到丁烷以形成马来酸酐。然后五氧化二钒被还原，过程重复。
