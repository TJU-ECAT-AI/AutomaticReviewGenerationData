[1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-known mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal oxide (MOx) acts as a source of lattice oxygen for the oxidative cleavage of C-H bonds in the alkane. The metal center in the MOx lattice abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a hydroxyl group on the metal oxide surface and a radical on the alkane. The radical can then react with lattice oxygen to form a carbonyl group, which can further oxidize to form the desired product. This mechanism is widely used in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the metal oxide acts as a source of lattice oxygen for the oxidative cleavage of C-H bonds in the alkane. The metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a hydroxyl group on the metal oxide surface and a radical on the alkane.

1.在多相催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen机制和H-抽提等机制促进C-H键的活化。在Mars van Krevelen机制中，金属氧化物充当烷烃中C-H键氧化裂解的晶格氧源。金属中心从烷烃中抽提一个氢原子，在金属氧化物表面形成羟基，而在烷烃上形成自由基。然后，自由基可以与晶格氧反应形成羰基，进一步氧化形成所需产物。这种机制广泛用于工业中选择性氧化烷烃，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。
