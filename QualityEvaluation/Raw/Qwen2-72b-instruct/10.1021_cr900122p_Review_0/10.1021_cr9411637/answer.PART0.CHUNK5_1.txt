[1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-established mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal oxide (MOx) acts as a source of lattice oxygen, which is transferred to the alkane substrate to form an alkyl radical. The alkyl radical can then undergo further oxidation to form the desired product. This mechanism is particularly important for the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."

[2] "The H-abstraction mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate by a metal center, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. This mechanism is also important for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal oxide catalysts."

[3] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a classic example of the application of these principles in industrial selective oxidation. In this process, butane is oxidized over a metal oxide catalyst, such as vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), to form maleic anhydride. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction mechanism both play important roles in this process."

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the transfer of lattice oxygen from the metal oxide to the alkane substrate, forming an alkyl radical. The H-abstraction mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate by a metal center, also leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. These mechanisms are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where butane is oxidized over a metal oxide catalyst like vanadium pentoxide to form the desired product.

1.在多相催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen机制和H-抽吸机制等促进C-H键的活化。Mars van Krevelen机制涉及金属氧化物向烷烃底物转移晶格氧，形成烷基自由基。H-抽吸机制涉及金属中心从烷烃底物中抽吸氢原子，同样导致烷基自由基的形成。这些机制应用于工业中选择性氧化烷烃，例如丁烷转化为马来酸酐，其中丁烷在金属氧化物催化剂（如五氧化二钒）上氧化，形成所需的产物。
