[1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, which involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon by an oxygen atom of a metal oxide, is a well-known mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes. This mechanism is applied in the industrial production of maleic anhydride from butane."

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, for example, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.
