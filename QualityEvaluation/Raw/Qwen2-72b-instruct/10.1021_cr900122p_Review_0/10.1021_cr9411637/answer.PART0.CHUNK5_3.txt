[1] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a well-established mechanism for the selective oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates over solid catalysts. In this mechanism, the oxygen atom of the adsorbed oxygen molecule is transferred to the substrate via a metal center, which acts as a redox mediator. The metal center is reduced in the process, and the reduced metal can be reoxidized by the adsorbed oxygen molecule, thus regenerating the active site. This mechanism is widely accepted for the selective oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates over metal-oxide catalysts."

[2] "The H-abstraction mechanism is another mechanism that has been proposed for the selective oxidation of alkanes over metal-oxide catalysts. In this mechanism, the metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate, forming a metal hydride and a radical intermediate. The radical intermediate can then react with the adsorbed oxygen molecule to form the desired oxygenate product. This mechanism is less well-established than the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, but it has been proposed for certain metal-oxide catalysts."

[3] "The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride is an important industrial process that utilizes the principles of heterogeneous catalysis. In this process, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride over a metal-oxide catalyst, typically vanadium pentoxide on a silica support. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is believed to be the dominant mechanism for this reaction, with the vanadium center acting as the redox mediator. The reaction is highly selective for maleic anhydride, with minimal formation of other oxygenates or coke."

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the transfer of an oxygen atom from an adsorbed oxygen molecule to the substrate via a metal center, which acts as a redox mediator. The metal center is reduced in the process, and the reduced metal can be reoxidized by the adsorbed oxygen molecule, thus regenerating the active site. The H-abstraction mechanism involves the metal center abstracting a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate, forming a metal hydride and a radical intermediate. The radical intermediate can then react with the adsorbed oxygen molecule to form the desired oxygenate product.

2.The principles of these mechanisms are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this process, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride over a metal-oxide catalyst, typically vanadium pentoxide on a silica support. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is believed to be the dominant mechanism for this reaction, with the vanadium center acting as the redox mediator. The reaction is highly selective for maleic anhydride, with minimal formation of other oxygenates or coke.

1.在异质催化中，氧化材料上的孤立金属中心通过火星-范克雷维尔机制和H-抽象等机制促进C-H键的活化。火星-范克雷维尔机制涉及通过金属中心从吸附的氧分子向底物转移氧原子，金属中心充当氧化还原介质。在这一过程中，金属中心被还原，还原的金属可以通过吸附的氧分子重新氧化，从而再生活性位点。H-抽象机制涉及金属中心从烷基底物中抽象出一个氢原子，形成金属氢化物和自由基中间体。自由基中间体然后可以与吸附的氧分子反应，形成所需的氧酸产物。

2.这些机制的原则被应用于工业选择性氧化烷基，例如丁烷转化为马来酸酐。在这个过程中，丁烷在金属氧化物催化剂上被氧化为马来酸酐，通常是硅胶支持的五氧化二钒。火星-范克雷维尔机制被认为是该反应的主要机制，其中钒中心充当氧化还原介质。该反应对马来酸酐具有高度选择性，几乎不形成其他氧酸或焦炭。
