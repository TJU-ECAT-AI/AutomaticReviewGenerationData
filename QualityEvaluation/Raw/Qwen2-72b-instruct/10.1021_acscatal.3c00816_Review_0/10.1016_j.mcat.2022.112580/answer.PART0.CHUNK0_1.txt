1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its high propylene selectivity, which addresses the challenges of conventional production methods that suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity, and the inability to meet the increasing demand for propylene. With the development of shale gas and natural gas hydrate extraction technology, raw material propane becomes more abundant and cheaper, making PDH a cost-effective and efficient route to obtain propylene.
