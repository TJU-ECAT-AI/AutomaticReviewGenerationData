1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an available complement to produce propylene, which suggests it may offer benefits in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha. PDH can potentially utilize shale gas resources more efficiently and selectively activate CH bonds of light alkanes, which could lead to higher propylene yields and selectivity.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是，它确实提到PDH是生产丙烯的可行补充方法，这表明与流体催化裂化和石脑油蒸汽裂解等传统方法相比，PDH可能在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面提供优势。PDH可能更有效地利用页岩气资源，并选择性地激活轻烷烃的CH键，这可能导致更高的丙烯产量和选择性。
