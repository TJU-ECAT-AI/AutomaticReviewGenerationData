1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an available complement to produce propylene, which suggests it may offer benefits in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha. The mass exploitation of shale gas resources has made PDH a promising method for propylene production.

However, it does mention that PDH is an available complement to produce propylene, which suggests it may offer benefits in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha. PDH can potentially utilize propane, a byproduct of natural gas processing and crude oil refining, as a feedstock, which may be more abundant and stable in supply than naphtha. The literature also highlights the development of catalytic PDH processes, which could improve process efficiency and product selectivity by selectively converting propane to propylene with minimal byproducts.

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an available complement to produce propylene, which suggests it may offer benefits in terms of feedstock flexibility, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha. PDH can potentially utilize propane from various sources, including shale gas, which has seen mass exploitation, making it a more sustainable and cost-effective feedstock option. The literature also highlights the need for efficient production processes to meet the steadily increasing demand for propylene, indicating that PDH may offer higher yields and selectivity for propylene compared to conventional methods.
