1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an available complement to produce propylene, which suggests it may offer benefits in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha. PDH can potentially utilize propane, a byproduct of natural gas processing and crude oil refining, as a feedstock, which may be more abundant and stable in supply than naphtha. The literature also highlights the development of catalytic PDH processes, which could improve process efficiency and product selectivity by selectively converting propane to propylene with minimal byproducts.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是，它确实提到PDH是生产丙烯的可用补充方法，这表明与传统的流体催化裂化和石脑油蒸汽裂解方法相比，它可能在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面提供优势。PDH可能利用丙烷作为原料，丙烷是天然气加工和原油精炼的副产品，与石脑油相比，其供应可能更加丰富和稳定。文献还强调了催化PDH工艺的发展，这可能通过选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时最小化副产品的生成，从而提高过程效率和产品选择性。
