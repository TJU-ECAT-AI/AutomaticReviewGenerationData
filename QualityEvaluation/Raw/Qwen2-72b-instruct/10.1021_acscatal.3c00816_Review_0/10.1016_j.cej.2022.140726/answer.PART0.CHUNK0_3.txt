1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an available complement to produce propylene, which suggests it may offer benefits in terms of feedstock flexibility, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha. PDH can potentially utilize propane from various sources, including shale gas, which has seen mass exploitation, making it a more sustainable and cost-effective feedstock option. The literature also highlights the need for efficient production processes to meet the steadily increasing demand for propylene, indicating that PDH may offer higher yields and selectivity for propylene compared to conventional methods.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在解决传统生产方法挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是,它确实提到PDH是生产丙烯的可用补充方法,这表明它可能在原料灵活性、过程效率和产品选择性方面与传统方法(如流体催化裂化和石脑油蒸汽裂解)相比具有优势。PDH可能利用来自各种来源的丙烷,包括大量开采的页岩气,这使其成为更可持续和成本效益更高的原料选择。文献还强调了为了满足丙烯需求稳步增长,需要高效生产过程,这表明PDH可能比传统方法提供更高的丙烯产量和选择性。
