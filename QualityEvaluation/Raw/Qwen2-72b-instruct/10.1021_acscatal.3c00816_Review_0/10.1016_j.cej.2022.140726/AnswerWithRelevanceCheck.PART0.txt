          The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an available complement to produce propylene, suggesting it may offer benefits in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha. PDH can potentially utilize propane, a byproduct of natural gas processing and crude oil refining, as a feedstock, which may be more abundant and stable in supply than naphtha. The development of catalytic PDH processes could improve process efficiency and product selectivity by selectively converting propane to propylene with minimal byproducts. PDH can potentially utilize propane from various sources, including shale gas, making it a more sustainable and cost-effective feedstock option. The need for efficient production processes to meet the steadily increasing demand for propylene indicates that PDH may offer higher yields and selectivity for propylene compared to conventional methods. PDH can potentially utilize shale gas resources more efficiently and selectively activate CH bonds of light alkanes, which could lead to higher propylene yields and selectivity.

          文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是，它确实提到PDH是生产丙烯的可行补充方法，这表明与流体催化裂化和石脑油蒸汽裂化等传统方法相比，PDH可能在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面提供优势。PDH可能利用丙烷作为原料，丙烷是天然气加工和原油精炼的副产品，与石脑油相比，其供应可能更加丰富和稳定。催化PDH工艺的发展可能通过选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时最小化副产品的生成，从而提高过程效率和产品选择性。PDH可能利用来自各种来源的丙烷，包括大量开采的页岩气，这使其成为更可持续和成本效益更高的原料选择。为了满足丙烯需求稳步增长，需要高效生产过程，这表明PDH可能比传统方法提供更高的丙烯产量和选择性。PDH可能更有效地利用页岩气资源，并选择性地激活轻烷烃的CH键，这可能导致更高的丙烯产量和选择性。
