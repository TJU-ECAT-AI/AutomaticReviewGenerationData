1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has gained widespread attention and development in recent decades, especially in the field of research and commercial application. The supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry have satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity under suitable conditions. However, the high cost of Pt and the potential environmental problems of CrOx have driven researchers to improve the coking and sintering resistance of Pt catalysts and to find new non-noble metal and environment-friendly catalysts. The research direction of reactor improvement is towards reducing the pressure drop. This review aims to introduce the characteristics of the dehydrogenation reaction, the progress made in the development of catalysts and reactors, and a new understanding of the reaction mechanism, as well as its guiding role in the development of catalyst and reactor.
