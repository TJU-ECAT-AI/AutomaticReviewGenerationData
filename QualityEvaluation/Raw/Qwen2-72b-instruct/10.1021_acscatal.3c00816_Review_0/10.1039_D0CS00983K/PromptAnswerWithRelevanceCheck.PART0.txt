<quotes>

[1] "In the past several decades, light alkane dehydrogenation to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application."
[2] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."
[3] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."
[4] "Although it is impossible to achieve the ideal state in practice, the actual results can approach this state very closely via the application of both an appropriate catalyst and the optimized reaction conditions."
[5] "PDH is a high energy-consuming process."
[6] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."
[7] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has gained widespread attention and development in recent decades. It is an atom-economic reaction, where one mole of propane generates one mole of propylene and one mole of H2, both of which are high value-added products. PDH can approach the ideal state closely through the application of appropriate catalysts and optimized reaction conditions. PDH is a high energy-consuming process, but increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass can effectively reduce equipment investment and operation costs. To achieve this, measures such as increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, and lowering the partial pressure of H2 can be taken. PDH specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is widely available, and by achieving high conversion and selectivity to propylene through optimized reaction conditions and catalysts.

1.直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术在近几十年来受到了广泛关注并得到了发展。这是一种原子经济反应，一摩尔丙烷通过脱氢生成一摩尔丙烯和一摩尔H2，这两种产品都是高附加值的。PDH可以通过应用适当的催化剂和优化的反应条件来接近理想状态。PDH是一个高能耗过程，但通过增加单程丙烷转化率可以有效降低设备投资和运营成本。为了实现这一点，可以采取增加反应温度、降低碳氢化合物的分压和降低H2分压等措施。PDH通过利用广泛可用的丙烷作为原料，以及通过优化的反应条件和催化剂实现高转化率和丙烯选择性，具体解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。

[9] "Suitable reaction conditions are important not only for a commercial unit, but also for the exploration of new catalysts, which means that it is not worth carrying out an in-depth study on a catalyst possessing good performance only under the reaction conditions detached from engineering practice."

PDH is an atom-economic reaction, where one mole of propane generates one mole of propylene and one mole of H2, both of which are high value-added products. The reaction is endothermic and limited by thermodynamic equilibrium, but with appropriate catalysts and optimized reaction conditions, the actual results can closely approach the ideal state. PDH is a high energy-consuming process, and increasing the single-pass conversion of propane is an effective way to reduce equipment investment and operation costs. To achieve this, measures such as increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, and lowering the partial pressure of H2 can be taken. The actual reaction conditions for dehydrogenation plants should be determined based on the equilibrium conversion trends with temperature and pressure, as well as the severity of unselective thermal reactions. Suitable reaction conditions are crucial for both commercial units and the development of new catalysts. In-depth studies on catalysts with good performance under conditions that are not detached from engineering practice are valuable.
