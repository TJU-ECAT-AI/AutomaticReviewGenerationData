[1] "In the past several decades, light alkane dehydrogenation to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application."
[2] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."
[3] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."
[4] "Although it is impossible to achieve the ideal state in practice, the actual results can approach this state very closely via the application of both an appropriate catalyst and the optimized reaction conditions."
[5] "PDH is a high energy-consuming process."
[6] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."
[7] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has gained widespread attention and much development in recent decades. PDH is an atom-economic reaction, where one mole of propane generates one mole of propylene and one mole of H2, both of which are high value-added products. The actual results can approach the ideal state very closely through the application of appropriate catalysts and optimized reaction conditions. PDH is a high energy-consuming process, and increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce equipment investment and operation costs. To achieve this, PDH technology can increase the reaction temperature, reduce the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, and lower the partial pressure of H2. Compared with conventional production methods, PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is widely available, and achieving high conversion and selectivity to propylene under optimized conditions.

1.直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术在近几十年来受到了广泛关注并取得了大量发展。PDH是一种原子经济反应，其中一摩尔丙烷通过脱氢生成一摩尔丙烯和一摩尔H2，这两种产品都是高附加值的。通过应用适当的催化剂和优化的反应条件，实际结果可以非常接近理想状态。PDH是一种高能耗过程，增加单程丙烷转化率是降低设备投资和运营成本的有效途径。为了实现这一点，PDH技术可以提高反应温度，降低碳氢化合物的分压，并降低H2的分压。与传统生产方法相比，PDH技术通过使用广泛可用的丙烷作为原料，以及在优化条件下实现高丙烯转化率和选择性，具体解决了原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性的挑战。
