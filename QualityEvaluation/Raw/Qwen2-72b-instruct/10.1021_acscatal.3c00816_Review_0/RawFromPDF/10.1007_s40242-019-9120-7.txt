novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This composite was used as catalyst support for loading Pt-SnOx in the propane dehydro-genation(PDH) reaction. Catalysts were characterized by means of N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, SEM, TEM XPS, UV-Vis, and Raman spectroscopy. The effect of different contents of TS-1 on PDH was investigated, and the optimal amount of TS-1 was determined to be 10%. The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones. The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species.
