Abstract
The effect of hydrothermal treatment (HTT) of γ-alumina on the state of its surface functional cover, anchoring of hexachloroplatinate, and properties of platinum sites was investigated. Hydrothermal treatment of γ-Al2O3 was found to increase the fraction of surface bridging OH groups and concentration of Lewis acid sites (LAS) and alter the metal complex–support interaction. Adsorption of hexachloroplatinate on the support surface is accompanied mainly by the formation of outer-sphere complexes, which are characterized by a lower reduction temperature. As a result, dispersion and electronic state of supported platinum are changed. Influence of γ-Al2O3 hydrothermal treatment on the catalytic properties of Pt/Al2O3 in n-hexane transformations and propane dehydrogenation was demonstrated. The revealed effect of γ-Al2O3 hydrothermal treatment on the formation of platinum sites in Pt/Al2O3 catalysts can be of fundamental importance for the steps of supported system synthesis where solid phase is contacting with water and aqueous solutions (impregnation and drying).

1. Introduction
A unique combination of the surface acid-base properties and pore structure makes γ-alumina a convenient support for metal catalysts, in particular Pt/γ-Al2O3

consider the regularities of active site formation at each synthesis step. The accumulated data provided substantial advances not only in understanding the main transformations of a precursor compound during the synthesis of supported catalysts, but also in the deliberate synthesis of this catalytic system with specified properties by introducing changes into a certain step.
The metal complex–support interaction at the deposition step can affect properties of the final catalyst; the interaction strongly depends not only on the chemical composition of precursor, but also on the nature of surface adsorption sites

. The adsorption sites of γ-Al2O3 are represented both by the hydroxyl groups and the Lewis acid sites (LAS). The relative content of certain functional groups on the oxide surface is determined to a great extent by phase homogeneity of the support. Changes in the phase composition of support may occur due to uncontrolled effect of water during the catalyst synthesis and storage. It was found that even at room temperature the action of water on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of aluminum trihydroxide phase

The most pronounced changes in the phase composition of alumina support are observed under hydrothermal conditions, which can take place both during pretreatment of the support and drying of the catalysts after contacting with aqueous solutions. The hydrothermal treatment (HTT) of γ-Al2O3 at temperatures up to 350 °C leads to boehmite

[26]
. Efficient control of the temperature and exposure time made HTT applicable to the synthesis of aluminum oxides with variable texture characteristics
[21]
,
[22]
. Thus, variation of the HTT temperature in the range of 100–350 °C led to alumina with specific surface area of 200 to 70 m2/g and effective pore diameter of 90 to 340 Å
[22]
.
However, data concerning the effect of HTT on the acid-base properties of γ-Al2O3 surface are quite scarce. Recently, IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine was used to demonstrate that HTT of γ-alumina at 200 °С for 6 h decreases the total concentration of LAS from 342 to 42 μmol/g
[25]
. Qualitative data indicating the effect of HTT on the state of hydroxyl cover of the γ-Al2O3 surface are reported
[23]
,
[24]
. An IR spectroscopy study
[24]
revealed that HTT of γ-Al2O3 at 140 °C followed by calcination at 550 °C increases the intensity of absorption bands at 3676 and 3731 cm−1 during the first 2 h of the treatment (these bands were assigned by the authors to the OH stretching vibrations of the bridging group bound to tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated aluminum atoms and the terminal group bound to octahedrally coordinated aluminum atom). A more prolonged treatment (6–24 h) decreases the intensity of these absorption bands. Meanwhile, a 24 h HTT produces nearly a twofold increase in the concentration of weak LAS, as shown by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine.
The goal of the present work was to acquire quantitative data about the effect of γ-Al2O3 interaction with water under hydrothermal conditions on the relative content of various functional groups on the alumina surface. Besides, it was great important to determine the extent to which changes in the composition of functional cover of the support surface could alter its adsorption properties toward H2[PtCl6] and the nature of nascent platinum sites in Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Sample preparation
The study was carried out using γ-Al2O3 purchased from Condea Chemie GmbH; its grain size was 0.1–0.25 mm. This aluminum oxide was a high-purity: according to the manufacturer specification sodium and iron content was equal to 0.003 and 0.021 wt%, respectively. HTT was performed in titanium autoclaves. The alumina samples were placed in the autoclaves and flooded with distilled water. The ratio of solid and liquid phases was maintained constant at 1:25 (wt) in all the experiments. The HTT temperature and time were varied from 50 to 200 °C and from 0.5 to 12 h, respectively. After the treatment, the support samples were separated from the liquid phase by filtration and dried in air and then in a drying oven at 120 °C. For further investigations, the alumina samples after HTT and drying were used with or without thermal treatment in a muffle furnace at 550 °C. Prehistory of the alumina samples is always clarified in the text.
In the synthesis of supported platinum-on-alumina catalysts, aqueous solutions of hexachloroplatinic acid with a specified concentration, which were prepared from crystalline hydrate H2[PtCl6]·6H2O (pure grade, Aurat), were used as precursors. The adsorption isotherms of H2[PtCl6] on alumina supports were obtained by the separate sample method with the weight ratio of support to H2[PtCl6] solution equal to 1:25 (20 ± 1 °C). The pH values of the solutions were controlled using an InLab Easy BNC combined electrode (Mettler Toledo) on a SevenMulti device (Mettler Toledo). Platinum concentration in the solutions was determined photometrically. The method is based on the formation of a stained complex with tin chloride in a hydrochloric solution
[27]
.
Samples of supported platinum catalysts were prepared by impregnation of support in an excess of H2[PtCl6] solution. The amount of platinum in the solution was less than or equal to the adsorption capacity of the support. Platinum adsorption was carried out for 20 min. In this case, virtually a complete adsorption of platinum from the solution was attained; dissolution of the support and passage of Al3+ into solution could be neglected due to a very low rate of the process
[28]
. After the impregnation, the samples were carefully washed with water to remove non-chemisorbed solution components from the pore space of the support and then dried in air at room temperature. These samples were denoted as H2[PtCl6]/Al2O3.
For platinum content determination samples were dried at 120 °C and then calcined at 550 °C. Platinum content was measured photometrically. Preliminarily, the weighted samples were dissolved with H2SO4 in the presence of HCl and H2O2.
2.2. Methods of sample investigation
2.2.1. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
Phase composition of the γ-Al2O3 samples subjected to HTT was determined by XRD on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (recording with the Bragg-Brentano focusing) using monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in an angle range 2θ = 5–80° and a step size of 0.1°. Identification was made using the ICDD PDF-2 database (2006) (no. 10-425 and no. 21-1307). The fraction of boehmite forming from γ-Al2O3 under hydrothermal conditions was estimated from the area of reflection (0 0 2), which is typical of this phase, using a calibration curve.
2.2.2. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
The effect of γ-Al2O3 HTT on the morphology of oxide surface was investigated by the SEM method with a JSM-6460 LV (JEOL) instrument, using Au-coated samples and acceleration voltage of 20 kV.
2.2.3. 27Al and 195Pt magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR)
27Al MAS NMR spectra were recorded at a Larmor frequency of 104 MHz on an Аvance-400 (9.4 T) NMR spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a SB4 multinuclear sensor (MAS). The tested samples were placed in 4 mm zirconia rotors and spun at the magic angle (54°44′) with a frequency of 104 Hz. Single-pulse experiments were carried out with the following parameters: pulse width 2.5 μs, pulse-delay time before quantization 6.5 μs, pulse repetition time 0.5 s, window width 20.8 kHz, number of data points 4000, total number of pulses 1024. Chemical shifts are referenced with respect to 1 M AlCl3 aqueous solution. The relative content of structural aluminum–oxygen polyhedra (aluminum in tetrahedral, pentahedral and octahedral environments) in the samples of support was found from the 27Al MAS NMR spectra. For quantitative analysis, the obtained NMR spectra were deconvoluted using the Pearson VII function
[29]
, and each band was integrated.
The 195Pt MAS NMR spectra of H2[PtCl6]/Al2O3 samples were taken at a Larmor frequency of 86 MHz using an aqueous solution of H2[PtCl6] with the concentration 0.03 M as external standard. The pulse time was 13 μs, pulse-delay time before quantization 16 μs, pulse repetition time 0.7 s, window width 70 kHz, number of data points 16,000, and total number of pulses 4096.
2.2.4. Low-temperature nitrogen adsorption
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms on the alumina samples were obtained at 77 K in a volumetric vacuum static unit ASAP-2020 (Micromeritics). Before measurements, the samples subjected to HTT at different temperatures were calcined at 550 °C for 3 h. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area SBET was measured from the adsorption isotherm in the range of equilibrium relative pressures of nitrogen P/P0 = 0.05–0.25. For SBET calculation, the molecular area of nitrogen in a filled monolayer was taken equal to 0.162 nm2. The adsorption pore volume (Vads) was determined from the nitrogen adsorption at P/P0 = 0.990, assuming the adsorbate density equal to that of normal liquid, 0.02887 mol/cm3. The differential characteristics – pore size distribution (PSD) curves – were found by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method.
2.2.5. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
FTIR spectra of the surface hydroxyl groups were recorded in a transmission mode on an IRPrestige-21 (Shimadzu) spectrometer over the range of 400–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. Density of the samples pressed into pellets without a binder was 20–30 mg/cm2. For adsorption measurements, they were placed in a quartz cell with CaF2 windows and outgassed in a vacuum adsorption setup (500 °C, 2 h, pressure below 3 × 10−4 mbar). Acidic properties of the samples were tested by sequential adsorption of CO at 77 K.
The concentration of active sites on the sample surface was calculated as N = AS/(pA0), where A0 is the integral absorption coefficient (integral intensity of absorption band for 1 μmol of the adsorbate per 1 cm2 cross-section of the light flux), р is the weight of a sample pellet (g), S is the surface area of a sample pellet (cm2), and A is the integral absorbance (cm−1) determined in accordance with the Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law
[30]
.
The concentration of surface OH groups was estimated from the integral intensities of absorption bands νОH in the region of 3650–3800 cm−1 using A0 = 5.3 cm/μmol
[31]
. In the estimation of the concentration of Lewis acid sites, А0 was taken to depend on the adsorption site type (strength) and the following А0 values (cm/μmol) were used: 1.25 (2225 cm−1), 1.0 (2205 cm−1), and 0.9 (2190 and 2180 cm−1)
[32]
. Absorbances (А) were determined after the deconvolution of the observed spectrum into its components using the Gauss function.
2.2.6. Point of zero charge (PZC) measurements
Surface acid–base properties of the alumina supports at the solid–liquid interface were estimated by determining the PZC according to a method developed by Park and Regalbuto
[33]
. The samples were placed in aqueous solutions with different initial values of pH. The pH values were measured until the equilibrium was established. Therewith, PZC corresponded to a plateau on the curve of final (equilibrium) pH versus the initial рН. Solutions with the initial pH value ranging from 1 to 13 were prepared with HCl and NaOH. All the measurements were performed using an InLab Easy BNC combined electrode (Mettler Toledo) on a SevenMulti device (Mettler Toledo).
2.2.7. UV–VIS diffuse reflectance (UV–VIS DR) spectroscopy
Electronic spectra of the H2[PtCl6]/Al2O3 samples dried in air at room temperature were recorded on a UV-2501 PC (Shimadzu) spectrometer with an ISR-240A diffuse reflectance attachment in the range of 11,000–54,000 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 nm (500 cm−1). BaSO4 was employed as a reflection standard. UV–VIS DR spectra were transformed into the Kubelka–Munk function calculated as F(R) = (1 − R)2/2R, where R is the experimentally measured reflectivity coefficient of the samples.
2.2.8. Temperature-programmed reduction by H2 (TPR). Method of Н2 and CO chemisorption
The processes of hydrogen consumption were investigated on an AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics) precision chemisorption analyzer with a heat conductivity detector. Before measurements, the H2[PtCl6]/Al2O3 samples were dried in air at room temperature. The TPR experiments were performed with a mixture of 10% H2 and argon (flow rate was equal to 25 mL/min) at 35–450 °С with the heating ramp of 10 °C/min. Chemisorption of hydrogen or carbon monoxide was carried out after TPR and cooling the catalyst in an inert gas to the temperature of experiment. A 10% H2–Ar or 9% СО–Не mixture was fed in pulses at equal time intervals into a flow of inert carrier gas, respectively, argon or helium. The batching was performed at room temperature until the detector signal became constant.
It is known that the adsorption stoichiometry H/Pt may be greater than unity due to multiple adsorption of hydrogen on certain Pt sites
[34]
,
[35]
. However, the use of stoichiometry H/Pt = 1 when calculating the metal dispersion is justified
[35]
. Carbon monoxide can be chemisorbed in various forms, and adsorption stoichiometry CO/Pt may differ from unity
[35]
,
[36]
. A CO/Pt stoichiometry of 1 has commonly been used, although bridged carbon monoxide coexists with the predominant linear form
[35]
. Thus, dispersions of the metal, DPt (H2) and DPt (CO), were calculated taking into account the sorption stoichiometry Н/Pt = 1 and СО/Pt = 1.
2.2.9. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
Photoelectronic spectra of the Pt/Al2O3 samples were obtained on a SPECS (Germany) photoelectron spectrometer as described in
[37]
. The spectrometer was equipped with two X-ray sources. One source with double Al/Mg anode works without monochromator, whereas another source with a double Al/Ag anode—with monochromator. Application of monochromator narrows essentially the energy width of the exciting irradiation and, hence, the width of the photoemission lines.
Before measurements, the samples were dried at 120 °C, calcined at 550 °C and reduced in flowing H2 at 450 °C. Powdery samples were fixed on a sample holder using a double-side conductive adhesive tape. Samples were introduced in the spectrometer via fast entry lock system. XPS measurements were carried out in a UHV analyzer chamber at a base pressure of 5 × 10−9 Torr. For each sample, spectra were recorded using non-monochromatic MgKα (hν = 1253.6 eV) and monochromatic AgLα (hν = 2984.3 eV) irradiations. Before the measurements, the binding energy (BE) scale was calibrated against the characteristic lines of metallic gold and copper—Au4f7/2 at 84.0 eV and Cu2p3/2 at 932.6 eV, respectively. To take into account the charging effect appeared for non-conducting substances as result of photoemission under MgKα irradiation, the C1s line was used as internal reference, with the BE of 284.8 eV. The calibration of the spectra excited with AgLα irradiation was performed using a set of XPS lines with lower BE, which were predominantly measured with MgKα irradiation.
2.2.10. Catalytic testing of Pt/Al2O3 samples
Propane dehydrogenation. Catalytic properties of the supported Pt/Al2O3 systems were investigated in a fixed-bed flow reactor. The feed stream was formed by mixing of gaseous hydrogen (>99.96 vol%, Novosibirsk Chemical Concentrates Plant) and propane (99.95%, PBM Gas Ltd.). Before testing, the samples were dried at 120 °C, calcined at 550 °C and reduced in flowing H2 in the reactor at 550 °C for 1 h. Testing of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts (1.000 g) was carried out at the following reaction conditions as reported elsewhere
[38]
,
[39]
: 550 °C for reaction temperature, atmospheric pressure, H2/C3H8 = 0.25 (molar ratio) and the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is 4.0 h−1. The reaction products were analyzed on line on an Khromos GKh-1000 chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and column Rt-Alumina Plot (50 m × 0.53 mm). The analysis was made in the isothermal mode at the temperature of 80 °C.
At the steady-state conditions with the values of propane conversion of 17–20% the catalytic reactor was considered as a differential one. The reaction rate normalized per 1 g of the catalyst and a turnover frequency for the formation of propylene (TOF) were calculated according to equations:
(3)
(4)
where x is the propane fraction dehydrogenated to propylene with participation of Pt sites, M is the the molecular weight of propane, CPt is the concentration of platinum active sites (mol/g). The last parameter was calculated from Pt loading in catalysts and the dispersions:
(5)
ωPt is the platinum content in the sample (wt%), APt is the atomic weight of platinum, DPt(H2) is the dispersions of platinum determined by the pulse chemisorption of H2.
n-Hexane transformation. A study of the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in the reactions of n-hexane transformation were carried out at atmospheric pressure on a microcatalytic setup in the pulse mode. The reaction mixture was obtained by saturation of hydrogen (>99.96 vol%, Novosibirsk Chemical Concentrates Plant) with n-hexane (>99 wt%, Reakhim) in a saturator at 35.0 °С. Before testing, the samples were dried at 120 °C and calcined at 550 °C. The samples were tested at a constant molar ratio H2/C6H14 = 2 and contact time 5 s. A 0.5 g catalyst sample was placed in a U-shaped glass reactor and reduced before measurement in flowing hydrogen at 450 °C for 2 h. The testing was performed at a temperature of 450 °C. The pulse volume was 30 μL/mg. The initial reactant and reaction products were analyzed on line by gas liquid chromatography. A chromatograph (Carlo Erba Instruments) was equipped with a flame ionization detector and capillary column (25 m × 0.2 mm) with the stationary liquid phase SE-54. To improve chromatographic separation efficiency, the analysis was made in the temperature-programmed mode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of HTT on the structural and texture characteristics of γ-Al2O3
HTT of γ-alumina leads to the hydroxide phase of boehmite γ-AlO(OH) according to Eq.
(2)
(
Fig. 1
a and b).
Fig. 1
b displays a powder diffraction pattern of the sample after HTT at 200 °C, which is a maximum temperature used in the study. Under such conditions, the phase transition γ-alumina → boehmite is brought to completion. However, the boehmite fraction in the composition of alumina can readily be controlled by varying the treatment temperature and time. Trends of increasing the content of boehmite phase with the temperature and time of HTT are presented in

A subsequent calcination (550 °C) of the samples subjected to HTT regenerates the oxide phase due to dehydration of boehmite (
Fig. 1
c). However, analysis of the structural data revealed some distinctions between the initial alumina and that subjected to HTT. The initial γ-Al2O3 has a cubic lattice with the parameter a = 7.900 Å, whereas structure of the oxide obtained by dehydration of boehmite has a tetragonal distortion, which is indicated by splitting of the reflection (4 0 0)
[40]
,
[41]
,
[42]
. In this case, with the lattice parameters a = b = 7.960 Å and c = 7.840 Å, the c/a ratio is equal to 0.985, which points to a considerable tetragonal distortion, according to
[42]
,
[43]
. Yanagida and Yamaguchi reported
[43]
that a growth of the degree of tetragonality, which is reflected by lowering the c/a ratio from 0.982 to 0.966, increases the amount of hydroxyl groups on the γ-Al2O3 surface.
As shown by XRD data, γ-alumina after HTT is well crystallized as compared to the initial γ-Al2O3: the average size of crystallites grows from 4.5 to 7.7 nm. According to Vidruk et al.
[44]
, an increased size of γ-Al2O3 crystallites can initiate a growth of the surface Lewis acidity.
The XRD data agree with the results obtained for alumina samples by 27Al MAS NMR. The spectra have up to three resonances with the chemical shifts at 10, 45 and 70 ppm, which correspond to aluminum atoms in octa-, penta- and tetrahedral oxygen environments, respectively. Deconvolution and integration of NMR spectra allowed the quantitative assessment of the relative content of different aluminum–oxygen polyhedra in the samples. The obtained data are listed in
Table 2
. After a severe HTT (180 or 200 °C, 3 h), structure of the samples is represented almost by aluminum-oxygen octahedra, which is typical of the hydroxide phase. However, a subsequent heat treatment at 550 °C restored the ratio of structural polyhedra AlO6 (76%), AlO4 (20%) and AlO5 (4%) typical of γ-Аl2O3
[45]
.

SEM was used to investigate the effect of HTT on the γ-Аl2O3 morphology. HTT at 180 °C for 3 h and subsequent heat treatment lead to the formation of plate-like particles 0.5–1 μm in length (
Fig. 2
) on the γ-Аl2O3 surface. Earlier, Jun-Cheng et al.
[24]
observed the formation of boehmite crystals of a similar shape during HTT of γ-Аl2O3. Retention of the particle shape after calcination of the formed boehmite (
Fig. 2
b) may be related to the topotactic nature of boehmite → γ-Аl2O3 transition

Fig. 2. SEM micrographs of initial γ-Аl2O3 (a) and γ-Аl2O3 subjected to HTT at 180 °C for 3 h and calcined at 550 °C for 3 h (b).
Low-temperature nitrogen adsorption isotherms were obtained to elucidate the effect of HTT on the texture parameters of alumina samples (the samples were calcined at 550 °C for 3 h after HTT at different temperatures). One can see from
Table 3
that specific surface area, total pore volume and effective pore diameter of alumina changed inappreciably after the introduction of HTT performed at 50–180 °C for 3 h. Moreover, some growth of the alumina surface area is observed at HTT temperatures up to 150 °C, which is in agreement with literature data
[22]
. Nearly a twofold decrease in the specific surface area occurred only when the HTT temperature was raised to 200 °C (at this temperature the initial alumina is completely transformed into boehmite,
Table 1
) and the γ-Аl2O3 structure was restored during the calcination. The adsorption pore volume did not change in the process because the fraction of large pores increased. Analysis of the PSD curves showed that a uniform distribution with the prevailing average pore diameter of ca. 75 Å is retained up to the HTT temperature of 150 °C. The fraction of pores with the diameter 80–110 Å increases at the treatment temperature of 180 °C, whereas pores with the diameter 300 Å prevail at 200 °C.
Table 3. Effect of HTT temperature on parameters of the γ-Al2O3 pore structure: specific surface area (SBET), adsorption pore volume (Vads) and effective pore diameter (Deff). Before measurements, the samples were calcined at 550 °C for 3 h.

180 °C, 3 h 216 0.51 95
200 °C, 3 h 124 0.55 176
Aluminum oxide is restored upon calcination; nevertheless, there are changes in the γ-Al2O3 pore structure that are caused by the formation of boehmite crystallites via the dissolution-precipitation route under hydrothermal conditions
[21]
. The conversion of γ-Al2O3 to boehmite at HTT essentially involves rehydration of γ-Al2O3 according to Eq.
(2)
. A supposed mechanism of rehydration includes the dissociative adsorption of water on the anion vacancies of γ-Al2O3 followed by the diffusion of hydroxyl groups
[26]
. These processes lead to the formation and recrystallization of boehmite with larger crystallites, which is confirmed by the XRD data shown above. Thus, the formation of large boehmite crystallites may be responsible for the observed enlargement of pores in the hydrothermally treated and calcined alumina samples.
3.2. Effect of HTT on the state of γ-Al2O3 surface functional cover
The effect of HTT step on the concentration and ratio of the γ-Аl2O3 surface functional groups was studied by FTIR spectroscopy (prior to spectroscopic examination, the samples were subjected to HTT at different temperatures and then calcined at 550 °C). In the region of O–H stretching vibrations, the spectra of initial γ-Аl2O3 and Аl2O3 samples after HTT (
Fig. 3
) have seven absorption bands that characterize the isolated OH groups: 3790, 3770, 3760, 3745–3730, 3710, 3690 and 3670 cm−1. A broad absorption band in the region of 3600 cm−1 is assigned to the hydrogen-bonded OH groups. The assignment of absorption bands of the isolated surface OH groups

The quantitative analysis of spectroscopic data revealed certain changes in the relative content of different surface OH groups on γ-Al2O3 with elevation of HTT temperature, the trend being most pronounced at 200 °C (
Table 4
). The fraction of low-frequency bridging hydroxyl groups (νОH = 3710–3670 cm−1) increased from 50 to 70% of the total amount of OH groups with a simultaneous decrease in the content of terminal OH groups (absorption bands in the region of 3790–3760 cm−1) and especially in the content of bridging AlO(OH)AlO group (νОH = 3730 cm−1). According to Refs.
[9]
,
[51]
, the high-frequency hydroxyl groups, which have more pronounced base properties, are likely to participate in coordination binding of platinum(IV) chloride complexes; so, the observed decrease in their amount should alter the interaction of the modified support with a metal complex precursor during the synthesis of supported catalysts.
As follows from the analysis of FTIR spectra of adsorbed CO (
Table 5
), HTT increases the concentration of all LAS types on the γ-Al2O3 surface: weak (2180 and 2190 cm−1), medium strength (2205 cm−1), and strong (2225 cm−1). Most distinct is an increase in the concentration of weak LAS, which are characterized by the absorption band νCО = 2180 cm−1. The LAS strength differentiation was similar to that reported in literature

,

Thus, as follows from FTIR spectroscopy data, the introduction of the HTT step before calcination of alumina can change the relative content of different types of functional groups on the γ-Al2O3 surface: the fraction of low-frequency bridging OH groups increases, and Lewis acidity of the oxide surface grows. The observed changes may be related to structural transformations occurring at HTT and calcination of alumina. In particular, the appearance of structural tetragonality indicated by XRD data is probably the reason for surface phenomena as reported in
[43]
. On the other hand, the surface of boehmite crystallites is enriched with OH groups
[41]
,
[53]
and the calcination causes the dehydration and the formation of coordinatively unsaturated aluminum cations on the surface of the formed alumina. Thus, an increase of Lewis acidity may occur. In addition, the formation of LAS may be due to a change in the nanocrystalline contact interface as a result of densification of nanocrystal assemblies at high-temperature treatment
[44]
. This densification leads to a growth in the size of γ-Al2O3 crystallites, a decrease in specific surface area and an increase in the concentration of LAS.
PZC (the pH value at which surface charge is equal to zero at a total absence of positive and negative charges) is convenient for estimating the state of the surface at the interface with an aqueous solution. This parameter makes it possible not only to assess acid-base features of the surface, but also to predict its adsorption properties toward components of the solution. In this work, PZC was measured by the Park-Regalbuto method
[33]
for a sample of initial γ-Al2O3 and for alumina samples subjected to HTT and subsequent heat treatment. As follows from the measurements (
Fig. 4
), HTT decreased the PZC value and buffer capacity (reflected by extension of a plateau) with respect to initial support. This points to an increased deprotonation activity of the surface OH groups and confirms the spectroscopic data according to which the repeated calcination restores the phase composition, but cannot completely restore the surface properties (the fraction of low-frequency bridging OH groups increased).

3.3. Effect of γ-Al2O3 HTT on the formation of platinum sites in Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts
3.3.1. Effect of γ-Al2O3 HTT on the adsorption and composition of adsorbed Pt(IV) complexes
To estimate the effect of HTT on the adsorption properties of alumina with respect to anionic chloride complexes of platinum(IV), the [PtCl6]2–adsorption isotherms were obtained for two groups of γ-Al2O3 samples: the samples subjected to HTT at different temperatures (
Fig. 5
a) and those subjected not only to HTT, but also to calcination at 550 °C (
Fig. 5
b). The obtained isotherms are satisfactorily described by the Langmuir equation; their analysis by the linear anamorphosis method allowed us to calculate the values of adsorption capacity am.

Fig. 5. The isotherms of H2[PtCl6] adsorption on alumina supports: (а) γ-Al2O3 (1) and Al2O3 samples subjected to HTT for 3 h at a temperature of 100 (2), 120 (3), 150 (4), 180 (5) and 200 °C (6); (b) γ-Al2O3 (1) and Al2O3 samples subjected to HTT for 3 h at 150 (2), 180 (3) and 200 °C (4) with subsequent heat treatment at 550 °C for 3 h.
As follows from the results of adsorption experiments (
Fig. 5
a), elevation of the temperature of alumina HTT, which increases the amount of boehmite phase, is accompanied by a decrease in adsorption capacity of the support with respect to [PtCl6]2–. Even under mild HTT conditions (100–150 °C, 3 h), the maximum amount of adsorbed platinum diminishes appreciably, from 0.24 to 0.20–0.17 mmol Pt/g, which corresponds to a decrease in the platinum content of the sample from 4.7 to 3.9-3.3 wt%. The elevation of HTT temperature to 200 °C, which leads to the formation of hydroxide phase and, accordingly, to an increase in the relative content of bridging OH groups on the support surface, decreases nearly 10-fold the value of adsorption capacity am.
Calcination of alumina samples after the HTT step regenerates the oxide phase and increases the adsorption capacity of the support. However, restoration of the adsorption capacity to the value typical of initial γ-Al2O3 does not occur (
Fig. 5
b). Thus, HTT at 150 and 180 °C, which produces no changes in the texture parameters of the support (
Table 3
), can substantially affect the adsorption properties of alumina surface.

[9]
,
[12]
,
[13]

[14]
, the observed decrease in the adsorption capacity can be attributed to a diminishing effect of HTT on the content of OH groups, which are necessary for chemisorption anchoring of the platinum chloride complexes. The FTIR spectroscopy data allow a conclusion that such hydroxyl groups on the γ-Al2O3 surface are represented by the most basic terminal OH groups and by the bridging AlO(OH)AlO group, their amount on the alumina surface decreasing due to introduction of the hydrothermal step.
The effect of HTT on the chemical composition of metal complexes anchored on the oxide surface was investigated by UV–VIS DR spectroscopy. It is known
[4]
,
[8]
,
[9]
,
[54]
,
[55]
that the band at ca. 38,000 cm−1 in the electronic spectrum of [PtCl6]2–corresponds to the electron transition involving two π orbitals of chlorine and characterizes the charge transfer Cl → Pt (1t2u(π),2t1u(π) → 2eg(z2, x2 − y2)). The band at ca. 50,000 cm−1 is also assigned to a Cl → Pt transition, but one involving σ orbitals of the ligand (1t1u(σ) → 2eg(z2, x2 − y2)). The first band is used conventionally to identify the [PtCl6]2–complex. The platinum(IV) complexes with chloride ligands partially substituted by the oxygen-containing ones (H2O and ОН) have the bands in a range of higher wavenumbers, 39,000–43,000 cm−1. Analysis of the electronic spectra showed (
Fig. 6
) that platinum complexes adsorbed on the initial γ-Al2O3 are characterized by a broad absorption region (
Fig. 6
, spectrum 1), which is related to the presence of complexes with inhomogeneous chemical composition (a degree of hydrolysis). According to the earlier obtained EXAFS data
[56]
, their chemical composition corresponds to the averaged formula PtCl3O3. After HTT of the alumina support, the composition of platinum complexes anchored on its surface becomes more homogeneous. Thus, the band at 38,000 cm−1 is observed for the sample where γ-Al2O3 was preliminarily subjected to HTT at 180 °C, which indicates the preferential binding of non-hydrolyzed chloride complexes (
Fig. 6
, spectrum 2). In the case of alumina calcined at 550 °C after HTT, shape of the spectrum (
Fig. 6
, spectrum 3) differs from the two preceding ones. It means that high-temperature treatment did not restore the surface properties to the full extent, and a distinct band at 38,000 cm−1 in spectrum 3 testifies that its main difference from spectrum 1 is the presence of a greater fraction of non-hydrolyzed forms of the platinum complexes.

The effect of alumina HTT on the metal complex–support interaction was investigated by 195Pt MAS NMR. It is known that the interaction of metal complex with support can affect the type of signals in 195Pt NMR spectrum. Thus, the adsorption of chloroplatinate via electrostatic interaction with the surface (the formation of outer-sphere complexes) is not accompanied by a symmetry distortion of the metal complex polyhedra. In such case, the NMR spectrum contains a signal from adsorbed anions [PtCl6]2–with a chemical shift in the region of their absorption in a solution. Exchange interactions of the complexes with hydroxyl groups of the oxide surface (the formation of inner-sphere complexes) can result in a considerable broadening or vanishing of the signal from the nuclei of adsorbed ions

Fig. 7
shows the 195Pt NMR spectra characterizing platinum complexes adsorbed on the initial γ-Al2O3 and on the alumina subjected to HTT. In the first case, even with a maximum amount of adsorbed complexes (the platinum content of 4.5 wt%), there is a weak signal in the region of 40 ppm corresponding to adsorbed [PtCl6]2–, which virtually vanishes during the long-term drying of the sample at room temperature. Hydrolyzed forms of the complexes are more prone to coordination anchoring; there are no signals in the region of chemical shifts typical of the aqua or hydroxo complexes
[7]
,
[14]
. As a result of HTT of the support at 180 °C, even for a half amount of adsorbed complexes (the platinum content of 2.0 wt%) a resonance is observed with the same position of chemical shift at 40 ppm, which intensity is much higher and does not change for a long time (
Fig. 7
, spectrum 2). The obtained result agrees with the UV–VIS DR spectroscopy data indicating an increase in the fraction of chloride non-hydrolyzed (outer-sphere) platinum species on the support surface. Besides, according to the 195Pt NMR data, changes occur also in the anchoring mechanism of the complexes: there is an increase in the fraction of complexes adsorbed via electrostatic interaction (the formation of outer-sphere complexes):

Taking into account that HTT of γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of boehmite phase with the bridging OH groups on its surface
[41]
,
[53]
, it can be expected that such groups are involved in the anchoring of platinum(IV) chloride complexes according to Eq.

.
3.3.2. Effect of γ-Al2O3 HTT on the formation and properties of supported platinum
As follows from the analysis of adsorption and spectral data, HTT decreases the amount of adsorption sites on the alumina surface, primarily those that provide coordination anchoring of platinum complexes. This changes the strength of the interaction between metal complex and support, which may further affect the formation conditions and properties of supported platinum particles.
TPR is among the methods employed for estimating the strength of the metal complex–support interaction. The TPR profile of H2[PtCl6]/Al2O3 samples usually has two hydrogen consumption regions in the temperature ranges of 150–250 °C and 250–400 °C (
Fig. 8
). Therewith, hydrogen consumption in the high-temperature region is attributed to the reduction of the most strongly anchored hydrolyzed platinum complexes
[13]
,
[14]
. HTT of γ-alumina before deposition of the metal complex shifted the temperature maximum of main TPR peak by 40 °C toward low temperatures (
Fig. 8
, curve (2)). This effect is related to a significant increase in the fraction of outer-sphere platinum complexes, which are characterized by a lower strength of their interaction with the support. Calcination performed after HTT cannot provide a complete restoration of the adsorption properties of alumina surface with respect to platinum(IV) chloride complexes (
Fig. 5
b); as a result, the obtained TPR profile has an intermediate position (
Fig. 8
, curve (3)).

Fig. 8. TPR profiles of adsorbed platinum complexes: (1) H2[PtCl6]/Al2O3 containing 2.1 wt% of Pt; (2) H2[PtCl6]/Al2O3 containing 1.9 wt% of Pt (HTT of support at 180 °C for 3 h); (3) H2[PtCl6]/Al2O3 containing 1.9 wt% of Pt (HTT of support at 180 °C for 3 h followed by heat treatment at 550 °C for 3 h).
Dispersion of platinum particles after the reduction step was determined from H2 and CO chemisorption. The obtained values of dispersion for the samples containing 2 wt% of platinum (
Table 6
) agree with the TPR data: an increase in the fraction of platinum complexes that have a less strong binding to the surface and are reduced at a lower temperature led to the formation of low-dispersed platinum particles. Thus, HTT of alumina at 180 °C before anchoring of the metal complex precursor produced more than a 3.5-fold decrease in the dispersion of supported Pt in the reduced sample: from 81–86% to 19–24%. High-temperature treatment of the support after the HTT step is able to increase the dispersion of supported platinum. However, the initial level of dispersion is not attained. Furthermore, this trend was kept for the samples with lower platinum content (0.5 wt%). HTT of alumina at 200 °C and subsequent calcination at 550 °C before anchoring of the precursor produced decrease in the dispersion of supported Pt in the reduced sample: from 85–96% to 63–72%.

The formation of platinum particles with a low dispersion in the absence of coordination binding of metal complex to the support is attributed
[12]
to both the ability of weakly bound species to migrate over the support surface and the occurrence of the following reactions:
(7)
(8)
The formation of large particles of platinum(II) chloride as an intermediate is the reason underlying the low dispersion of metallic platinum
[12]
.
The most important result is that the introduction of HTT step leads to differences in the chemical composition of the adsorbed metal complex precursor, the mechanism of its anchoring and the conditions of platinum sites formation. It can be assumed that electronic state of supported Pt and catalytic properties of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts will also be changed.
XPS was used to estimate the oxidation state of supported platinum in reduced samples of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. It is well-known that analysis of Pt supported on alumina by XPS is complicated by overlapping Al2p and Pt4f lines if spectra are taken with the standard Al Kα or MgKα irradiations
[37]
,
[57]
. To decision of this problem, the methodology
[37]
consisting of application of a harder irradiation AgLα for excitation of Pt3d5/2 line was used.
The Pt3d5/2 core level spectrum of the reduced Pt/Al2O3 sample without HTT of the support (
Fig. 9
, spectrum 1) is characterized by a BE value 2123.5 eV. This result shows that complete reduction of supported platinum complexes is not occurred and substantial fraction of platinum metal presents in oxidation state closed to Pt2+ (BE = 2123.5 eV for Pt2+
[37]
). As a result of HTT and subsequent predominant formation of outer-sphere platinum complexes, the fraction of reduced metal forms with lower BE value (BE = 2121.8 eV for Pt0
[37]
) is increased in the catalyst (
Fig. 9
, spectrum 2).

The dashed line shows the deconvolution of spectrum 2 into its components. Before measurements, the samples were reduced in flowing hydrogen at 450 °C.
It should be noted that the distinction in a platinum state is not related to the differences in a chemical composition of the support surface, which can be varied by chloride ions content. With respect to XPS data obtained using AlKα irradiation, residual chlorine content in the Pt/Al2O3 samples is not affected by the support pretreatment: Cl/Al atomic ratio is equal to about 0.028 for both samples studied.
The changes of dispersion and electronic state of supported platinum give a hope that catalytic properties of Pt will also be affected by preliminary HTT of alumina. It is well known that reactions of hydrogenation–dehydrogenation proceed with participation of metal sites of catalysts. So, these reactions are conventionally used to estimate a metal state in supported catalysts. For example, it was found that the electron-deficient platinum sites have a low activity in hydrogenation
[58]
.
In the present research, to characterize the catalytic properties of Pt sites propane dehydrogenation was chosen. The catalyst samples containing 0.5 wt% of Pt and prepared by using of initial and HTT-modified aluminas were tested. Like 2% Pt/Al2O3, these catalysts differ in platinum dispersion (
Table 6
) and, apparently, electronic state. Results of the study are presented as conversion (
Fig. 10
a) and selectivities of propylene and cracking products (methane, ethane, ethylene) (
Fig. 10
b) versus time of the experiment. At the beginning, higher conversion of propane at low propylene selectivity is due to a significant contribution of side reactions. In particular, the cracking reactions are more pronounced if the catalysts without HTT of the support are used (
Fig. 10
b). At the stationary conditions (5 h of experiment), the sample with HTT-modified support had a higher propylene selectivity at similar conversion values. The calculation of catalytic activity (
Table 7
) showed that platinum in the sample with HTT-modified support has a higher specific activity in the reaction of propylene formation. At the same time, a lower specific activity of the catalyst with higher Pt dispersion (prepared from initial γ-Al2O3) could be due to the presence of a significant fraction of platinum in electron-deficient state (see XPS data,
Fig. 9
). Similar relation between the platinum dispersion and TOF of several catalytic reactions including reduction type reactions was observed earlier
[59]
. According to this work, the negative trend is due to the metallic character of platinum particle is being lost as it becomes a smaller particle.

Prior to Pt deposition, the support was subjected to HTT at a temperature of 200 °C for 3 h with subsequent calcination at 550 °C for 3 h.
The catalytic characteristics of Pt/Al2O3 samples synthesized with or without HTT of the support were also compared in a model reaction of n-hexane transformation. Pulse mode used in the experiment allowed us to diminish the effect of deactivation and secondary processes, and analyze the main routes of conversion. It was demonstrated that even under relatively mild conditions (150 °C, 3 h) HTT of the support affects not only the interaction between metal complex and support, but also the distribution of catalytic reaction products.
At identical platinum content in the samples, HTT of the support leads to changes in the ratio of isomerization and cyclization products. First of all, this shows up as an increase in the ‘arenes/isomerization products’ and ‘benzene/methylcyclopentane’ weight ratios (
Table 8
). The ratio of benzene and substituted aromatic hydrocarbons remains constant in the process. It is necessary to note that n-hexane conversion at the reaction conditions was equal to about 80% for both samples. The observed differences in the catalytic properties can be attributed to changes in the state of supported platinum and acid-base properties of the support surface due to HTT. In particular, a decrease in Pt dispersion and an increase in acidity of the support can raise the rate of aromatization, including the formation of benzene via the expansion of a cyclopentane ring
[60]
,
[61]
,
[62]
. As HTT changes the dispersion and electronic state of Pt and increases the LAS concentration, the observed catalytic effect may be caused by the joint action of metallic and acidic sites.

4. Conclusions
Results of the study suggest that the action of water on γ-Al2O3 under hydrothermal conditions (up to 200 °C) produces considerable changes in the texture characteristics and acid-base properties of the alumina surface, and subsequent high-temperature treatment at 550 °C does not provide a complete restoration of the properties of initial support.
According to FTIR spectroscopy data, hydrothermal modification consists in changing the relative content of different types of functional groups on the γ-Al2O3 surface: there occurs an increase in the fraction of low-frequency bridging OH groups (absorption bands at 3670–3710 cm−1) and in the concentration of LAS. Accordingly, the anchoring of platinum(IV) chloride complexes on the support surface is accompanied by an increase in the fraction of outer-sphere complexes that are characterized by a lower reduction temperature (below 200 °C). As a result, the dispersion of supported platinum particles decreases. Furthermore, due to preliminary HTT of the support, shift of the Pt3d5/2 spectrum to lower BE values is appeared that corresponds to a change of Pt oxidation state, i.e. increase the fraction of reduced Pt forms. Such effect of HTT confirms the assumption that the most basic high-frequency OH groups of the γ-Al2O3 surface (the amount of which decreases due to HTT of alumina) serve as the sites for coordination anchoring of platinum complexes. Hence, HTT of the support makes it possible to alter the adsorption mechanism of a precursor, selectively increasing the fraction of outer-sphere complexes anchored via electrostatic interaction.
It is essential that introduction of the HTT step (even under relatively mild conditions, for example, 150 °C and 3 h) affects not only the metal complex–support interaction and formation of supported platinum particles, but also the catalytic performance of the final Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. It was shown that in the model reaction of propane dehydrogenation there is increase in the propylene selectivity over 10 wt% at similar propane conversion. Besides, in the reaction of n-hexane conversion there are changes in the products distribution toward the increased weight ratios of ‘arenes/isomerization products’ and ‘benzene/methylcyclopentane’.
