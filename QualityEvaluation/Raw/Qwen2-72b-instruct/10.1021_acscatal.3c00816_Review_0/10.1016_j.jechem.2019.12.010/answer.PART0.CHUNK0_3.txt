1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH can utilize propane, which is widely available from shale gas production, as the feedstock. This reduces the dependency on naphtha, which is subject to price fluctuations and supply constraints. PDH also offers higher process efficiency and product selectivity compared to conventional methods, as it directly converts propane to propylene with minimal byproducts. This results in higher yields of propylene and lower energy consumption, making PDH a more sustainable and cost-effective option for propylene production.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。PDH可以利用从页岩气生产中广泛获得的丙烷作为原料。这减少了对受价格波动和供应限制影响的石脑油的依赖。与传统方法相比，PDH提供了更高的过程效率和产品选择性，因为它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，副产品最少。这导致丙烯产量更高，能耗更低，使PDH成为生产丙烯更可持续和成本效益更高的选择。
