1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH can utilize propane, which is widely available from shale gas production, as the feedstock. This reduces the dependence on naphtha, a more expensive and less abundant feedstock used in traditional steam cracking processes. PDH also offers higher process efficiency and product selectivity, as it directly converts propane to propylene in a single step, avoiding the formation of byproducts and reducing energy consumption compared to multi-step processes. Furthermore, PDH technology can be implemented in smaller, modular plants, allowing for more flexible and localized production, which can be advantageous in regions with limited infrastructure or high transportation costs.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。PDH可以利用从页岩气生产中广泛获得的丙烷作为原料。这减少了对石脑油的依赖，石脑油是一种在传统蒸汽裂解过程中使用的更昂贵、更稀缺的原料。PDH还提供了更高的过程效率和产品选择性，因为它直接将丙烷一步转化为丙烯，避免了副产品的形成，与多步过程相比，减少了能源消耗。此外，PDH技术可以在较小、模块化的工厂中实施，允许更灵活和本地化的生产，这在基础设施有限或运输成本高的地区可能具有优势。
