1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH can utilize propane, a byproduct of natural gas production, as a feedstock, which is more abundant and stable in supply compared to traditional feedstocks like naphtha. PDH processes are also more energy-efficient and have higher propylene yields compared to steam cracking, the conventional method for propylene production. This results in lower operating costs and higher product selectivity, making PDH a more economically and environmentally viable option for propylene production.
