1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH can utilize propane, which is abundant and readily available, as a feedstock. This technology also offers high process efficiency and selectivity, allowing for the production of propylene with minimal byproducts. Furthermore, PDH can be operated at a smaller scale, making it more flexible and adaptable to changing market conditions.
