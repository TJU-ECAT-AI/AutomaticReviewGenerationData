1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH can utilize propane, which is widely available from shale gas production, as the feedstock. This reduces the dependence on naphtha, a petroleum-derived feedstock that is subject to price fluctuations and supply uncertainties. PDH also offers higher process efficiency and product selectivity compared to conventional methods, such as steam cracking, which often produce a wide range of products and require additional separation steps to obtain propylene. PDH technology can achieve high propylene yields with minimal byproducts, making it a more economical and environmentally friendly option for propylene production.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。PDH可以利用从页岩气生产中广泛获得的丙烷作为原料。这减少了对石脑油的依赖，石脑油是一种受价格波动和供应不确定性影响的石油衍生原料。与传统的蒸汽裂解等方法相比，PDH还提供了更高的过程效率和产品选择性，传统方法通常会产生一系列产品，并需要额外的分离步骤来获得丙烯。PDH技术可以实现高丙烯产量，副产品最少，使其成为生产丙烯更经济、更环保的选择。
