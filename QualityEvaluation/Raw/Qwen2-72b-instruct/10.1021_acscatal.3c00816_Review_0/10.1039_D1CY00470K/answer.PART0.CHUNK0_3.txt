1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional propylene production methods. However, it does highlight the growing demand for propylene and the potential of PDH as a method to directly produce propylene from propane, which could be advantageous given the ample shale gas reserves providing cheap and abundant alkanes, including propane. This suggests that PDH may offer benefits in terms of feedstock availability, potentially lower costs due to the use of abundant shale gas, and a more direct process for producing propylene, which could enhance process efficiency and product selectivity compared to traditional methods that rely on naphtha or heavy oil.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是，它确实强调了丙烯需求的增加，以及PDH作为直接从丙烷生产丙烯的方法的潜力，这在考虑到丰富的页岩气储备提供廉价和丰富的烷烃（包括丙烷）的情况下，可能是有利的。这表明PDH可能在原料供应方面提供优势，由于使用丰富的页岩气，可能成本更低，与依赖石脑油或重油的传统方法相比，生产丙烯的过程更直接，这可能提高过程效率和产品选择性。
