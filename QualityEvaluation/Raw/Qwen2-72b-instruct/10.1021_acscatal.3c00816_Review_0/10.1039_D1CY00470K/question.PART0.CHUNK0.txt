Propane dehydrogenation over PtZn localized at Ti sites on TS-1 zeolite A PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst with very high activity, selectivity, and catalytic durability for propane dehydrogenation is reported in this paper. It was found that the excellent properties of the catalyst originate from the strong interaction of the Ti existing in the zeolite framework with Zn and Pt. The Ti not only remarkably increases the Pt dispersion and thereby enhances the initial activity of the catalyst, but also significantly modifies the electronic density of Pt together with the Zn and therefore increases the durability of the catalyst. The crucial functions of the Ti in constructing the structure and for modifying the reaction were evidenced by the CO adsorption capacity, CO adsorption IR spectroscopy and C3H6-TPD of the related catalysts. Thanks to the interaction of the Ti with Zn and Pt, the PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst exhibited a very high initial specific rate of 58.09 molC3H6 gPt1 h1 and a quite low deactivation constant of 0.0158 h1 in the 96.8 h time on stream at 600 C. 1 Introduction Propylene is not only the most important raw material for polymers but is also used as a feedstock for producing a great number of chemicals. Its market demand has greatly increased in the past few years globally.1 Steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the traditional methods of propylene production, but their productivity cannot satisfy the increasing market demand. On the other hand, ample shale gas reserves are being continuously explored around the globe, which provides cheap and abundant alkanes, including propane. Consequently, dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), which could directly produce propylene from propane, has attracted great interest in the chemical industry.2 However, fast deactivation of the catalyst due to sintering of the active metal and coke deposition is the main problem in this process, and it is challenging for researchers because the DHP has to be carried out at high temperature (>520 C) and the catalyst must be worked in a reductive and carbonaceous gas flow.13 Pt has been found to be a vital component of catalysts for the DHP reaction owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and low activity toward CC bond cleavage. As is widely known, the dispersion of Pt and stability of Pt particles on the support are the key factors affecting the catalytic performance.1,4 A high dispersion of Pt in the catalyst, and in particular over the catalyst surface, may enable more Pt atoms to be accessible to the reactant molecules and thereby endow the catalyst with high activity. Higher stability of the Pt particles in the catalyst, that is, prevention of Pt particle sintering under the harsh reaction conditions, would give the catalyst a longer catalytic lifetime.
Many metals have been used as additives to improve the dispersion of Pt on the support or modify the properties of the Pt. It was reported that using Sn as an additive could modify the electronic density of Pt and thereby suppress coke deposition and change the geometric state of the Pt so as to inhibit propane hydrogenolysis.58 The use of Cu as an additive was also reported to have a similar effect by Sun et al.9 In the PtCu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, Pt was even dispersed as single atoms on Cu nanoparticles. The dilution of Pt with the Cu atoms led to a much higher C3H6 selectivity (90%) of the catalyst compared with that of a single Pt-supported catalyst. Recently, a GaPt/SiO2 catalyst having a very high activity, selectivity, and stability in the DHP was reported by Searles et al.10 Most recently, a PtZn4/SiO2 catalyst with an intermetallic PtZn4 alloy structure11 has drawn great interest due to its outstanding catalytic durability for the DHP compared to all the catalysts reported to date.
High dispersion of Pt is not only the basis of high catalyst activity, but also brings about a better sintering resistance of the catalyst, as it must be the result of strong interactions between the metal and the support (SMSI). Shi et al.3 reported that pentacoordinate Al3+ ions have strong interactions with Pt, and that an Al2O3 nanosheet rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions endowed the catalyst with an extremely high Pt dispersion and a strong sintering resistance when it was used as the Pt support. Jiang et al.12 achieved similar SMSI between the Pt and the support by modifying the Al2O3 surface with 10 wt% TiO2, and hence significantly increased the durability of the catalyst. A highly effective SMSI effect was observed by Li et al. when they loaded Pt on TS-1 zeolite instead of on ZSM-5 zeolite.2 Similarly, Zhang et al.13 reported that an effective SMSI effect was realized when Pt was supported on Zn-substituted ZSM-5 zeolite.
Inspired by the literature, we considered the fact that the PtZn4 alloy structure is both catalytically active and durable for the DHP,11 whereas its dispersion over the support could possibly be increased if it were loaded on a support that has SMSI with both Pt and Zn instead of on SiO2. Thus, the TS-1 zeolite would be a better candidate for loading with the PtZn4 alloy, as the framework Ti exhibits SMSI with at least Pt, as reported in the literature.2 Additionally, as reported by Han et al., titanium oxide is beneficial for dispersing active zinc on ZrO2 for the DHP.14 Therefore, the catalyst would be expected to show high activity and durability if the framework Ti atoms could anchor the Pt and Zn atoms to them via possible chemical forces and localize them together. This paper gives the results of the corresponding investigation. 2 Experimental
2.1 Catalyst preparation
The titanium silicon zeolite TS-1 required for the catalyst preparation was hydrothermally synthesized using tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) and fumed silica as the titanium and silicon source, respectively. The appropriate amounts of fumed silica, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and TBOT were ground until a clear gel was obtained. The mixture was crystalized in an autoclave at the desired temperature for a definite time (95 C for 48 h or 170 C for 24 h) to achieve complete crystallization. The TS-1 zeolites were designated as xTS-y, according to the crystallization conditions, where x indicates the Ti/Si atomic ratio of the mixture and y represents the temperature applied for the crystallization. For example, 0.02TS-95 denotes the zeolite produced using a mixture with a Ti/Si ratio of 0.02 and crystallization at 95 C.
For comparison, two silicalite-1 zeolites were prepared using the following synthesis methods. One of them (named S-95) was synthesized in the same way as 0.02TS-95, but without adding TBOT to the mixture, and the other (named S-170) was synthesized at 170 C using TEOS as the silicon source according to the literature.15 The typical catalysts PtZn/xTS-y and PtZn/S-y containing 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.67 wt% Zn were prepared by impregnating xTS-y and S-y, respectively, with a solution containing the desired amount of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2. After impregnation at room temperature for 12 h, the mixture was dried at 80 C for 12 h and calcined in air at 500 C for 2 h.
To study the possible effect of the chemical state of titanium on the catalyst properties, a PtZnTi0.02/S-170 catalyst, which also contains 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.67 wt% Zn and titanium in an atomic Ti/Si ratio of 0.02, with its Ti component existing in oxide species on the catalyst surface, was prepared by impregnating S-170 support first with TBOT and then with Pt and Zn.
2.2 Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalyst samples were measured using a Rigaku Smartlab 9 X-ray diffractometer with scan steps of 0.02 and 8 min1, which employed Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) and operated at 40 kV and 100 mA.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using a NOVA NanoSEM 450 electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were observed using a Tecnai F30 electron microscope (FEI Company) with an acceleration voltage of 300 kV.
The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherm of each sample was measured using a Micromeritics 3Flex at 196 C. Before the measurement, the sample was degassed at 300 C under vacuum for 6 h.
The skeletal FT-IR spectrum of the sample was recorded using a cell equipped with CaF2 windows on a Bruker TENSOR 27 FT-IR spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm1 for 16 scans (1 s per scan). For this, the sample (20  1 mg) was pressed into a self-supporting disk and pretreated in situ with a N2 flow at 300 C for 30 min. To measure the CO adsorption FTIR spectrum of the sample, the disk was pre-reduced in flowing 49 vol% H2/N2 at 300 C for 30 min and purged with N2 at that temperature. After cooling to 30 C, the disk was exposed to a 11.3 vol% CO/N2 gas mixture for 30 min. After the sample was purged again with N2 for 30 min, the CO adsorption FTIR spectrum was recorded by subtracting the skeletal absorption.
UV-vis diffuse reflectance (DRS) spectra were obtained on a HITACHI U-3900 spectrometer with an integral sphere, where BaSO4 was set as the reference.
The dispersion degree of Pt in the catalyst was measured using pulse CO adsorption over the catalyst at 25 C. Before the CO uptake, the sample was reduced in situ using pure H2 at 250 C for 1 h and purged with He until the temperature was naturally cooled to 25 C. The equation D (%) = nmFsM × 102/L was used for calculating the Pt dispersion, as described in the literature,16 where nm represents the number of moles of CO adsorbed per gram of the sample, Fs denotes the adsorption stoichiometry (1), and M and L indicate the molecular weight of Pt and the percentage of Pt in the catalyst, respectively.
Temperature-programmed desorption of C3H6 (C3H6-TPD) was performed using a custom-built made apparatus employing an H-ionization flame detector (FID). Briefly, the sample was reduced on-line in H2 at 350 C for 1 h and purged with Ar until the temperature was cooled to 150 C, and then saturated with 16 vol% C3H6/Ar for C3H6 adsorption, purged with an Ar flow at this temperature to eliminate physically absorbed species, and finally heated with a linear heating rate of 10 C min1.
2.3 Catalytic activity test
The DHP reaction was carried out in a quartz tubular microreactor with a fixed bed by loading a mixture composed of 25 (or 50) mg of the catalyst (4060 mesh) and 575 mg of quartz sand under atmospheric pressure at 600 C and a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 24 (or 12 or 48) h1. Before the reaction, the catalyst was reduced on-line with H2/N2 (1:2) at 500 C for 4 h, and then the gas mixture (C3H8:H2:N2 = 1:1:4) was fed in. The effluent was analyzed using GC equipped with a FID. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated from the following equations, respectively: The deactivation constant, kd, was calculated from the following equation:wherein, the Conv.Final and Conv.Initial are the final and initial conversions over the catalyst, respectively, and t is the duration of the reaction in hours. 3 Results and discussion
3.1 Activity of the catalyst associated with Ti
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns and SEM images of the two zeolites used as the catalyst supports, 0.02TS-95 and S-95. Flat baselines without bulges in the 2θ range of 1535 degrees associated with silica could be observed in the XRD patterns, indicating that complete crystallinity was achieved for both zeolites. Moreover, the XRD patterns confirm that the two zeolites have the same typical MFI topology structure, and the SEM images indicate that their crystallite diameter is quite similar. The above similar physical properties of the two zeolites indicate that they should have the same level of internal mass transfer in their crystallites when used as the catalyst supports. Fig. 2 shows the N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms and textural properties of the different supports. Clearly, 0.02TS-95 has a micropore area close to that of S-95, again indicating that the two zeolites have the same level of degree of crystallinity. However, 0.02TS-95 exhibited a slightly larger external surface area than that of S-95, which agrees well with their relative average sizes as observed using SEM (Fig. 1). The catalytic performances of the PtZn/0.02TS-95 and the PtZn/S-95 are compared in Fig. 3. Interestingly, as expected, although the two samples contain the same amount of Pt and Zn, the PtZn/0.02TS-95 gave a much higher C3H8 conversion (42%) than that (25%) given by the PtZn/S-95. The very large difference in activity between the two catalyst samples must result primarily from the Ti in the zeolite framework. Note that although the initial activity increase (1.7 times) caused by the Ti in our case is quite similar to that (1.1 times) obtained by Li et al.,2 who observed that when the support on which PtSn was loaded was changed to TS-1 from ZSM-5, the initial C3H8 conversion at 590 C (and WHSV 3 h1) increased to 53.6% from 48.8%, the catalytic durability of the PtZn/0.02TS-95 is much higher than that of PtSn/TS-1 reported in the literature. For instance, the deactivation constant kd for the PtSn/TS-1 was about 0.0332 h1 with a highest mean catalyst life of 7.0 hours (ref. 2) whereas it decreased to 0.0199 h1 in the case of PtZn/0.02TS-95 even after 75 hours on stream. Clearly, the much higher catalytic durability of the PtZn/0.02TS-95 should originate from a possible cooperation effect of Ti with Zn on the Pt dispersion and/or on the electronic modification of Pt.

C3H8 = 5 mL min1, WHSV = 24 h1, 600 C.Fig. 4 shows the CO adsorption FTIR spectrum on the PtZn/0.02TS-95 compared with that on the PtZn/S-95. Two weak absorption bands at 2060 to 2089 cm1 appeared on the PtZn/S-95, which can be assigned to the linear adsorption of a CO molecule over Pt0 atoms on single-crystal or nanoparticle surfaces in an a-top geometry, respectively.17 In the case of PtZn/0.02TS-95, the peaks due to the CO adsorption, particularly that at 2060 cm1, became very strong. The results indicate that the PtZn/0.02TS-95 has a much greater Pt surface area available for CO adsorption than the PtZn/S-95; that is, the dispersion degree of Pt in the catalyst is greatly enhanced by the incorporation of Ti into the zeolite framework. This was strongly supported by the TEM images of PtZn/0.02TS-95 and PtZn/S-95. As shown in Fig. S1, the average particle size of Pt is about 2 nm in the PtZn/0.02TS-95, whereas that in the PtZn/S-95 is about 4 nm. The results explain why the PtZn/0.02TS-95 possesses much higher activity compared with the PtZn/S-95 for the DHP.Fig. 4 FTIR spectra of CO adsorption over different catalysts.
3.2 Chemical properties of the catalyst surface modulated by Ti
It has been reported that silanol groups have strong impact on catalyst durability, leading to faster catalyst deactivation.18,19 The silanol groups on the PtZn/S-95 and PtZn/0.02TS-95 were measured using FTIR. As shown in Fig. 5, the band in the range of 36503400 cm1 associated with H-bonded silanol groups20 has almost the same intensity for the two catalyst samples, indicating that this kind of silanol groups is retained at the same level on the two catalysts. However, the band at 3726 cm1 due to isolated silanol groups19 on the PtZn/0.02TS-95 is much lower in intensity compared with that of PtZn/S-95, indicating that the isolated silanol groups on the catalyst surface are significantly suppressed by the incorporation of Ti into the zeolite framework. This means that the significant decrease in the population of the isolated silanol groups cannot be excluded as a factor contributing to the greatly prolonged catalytic durability of the PtZn/0.02TS-95.
Fig. 5 FTIR spectra of the catalysts.
To decrease the silanol groups of the catalysts produced from the zeolites, zeolite crystallized at 170 C was studied as the catalyst support. As shown in Fig. 5, the band at 3726 cm1 associated with the isolated silanol groups markedly decreased in intensity for the PtZn/0.02TS-170 in comparison with that of the PtZn/0.02TS-95. From the catalytic performance of the PtZn/0.02TS-170 (Fig. 6) and PtZn/0.02TS-95 (Fig. 3), it can be concluded that, although the expected catalytic durability increase for the former compared to the latter cannot be identified for the reaction from the 12.5 hour time on stream, the activity is obviously increased. Additionally, the Pt/S-170 catalyst sample, which has significantly more isolated silanol groups and H-bonded silanol groups (Fig. 5), displayed much lower catalytic durability (Fig. 6), again indicating that the residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface negatively influence the intrinsic catalytic properties of the catalyst.

Fig. 7 shows the XRD patterns and SEM images of the S-170 and 0.02TS-170 used as supports for preparing the PtZn/S-170 and PtZn/0.02TS-170. They indicate that both zeolites have complete crystallinity, whereas the latter has a much larger crystalline size (1.01.1 μm) than the former (0.40.5 μm). Nevertheless, a much stronger CO absorption band appeared on the PtZn/0.02TS-170 than the PtZn/S-170, as shown in Fig. 8. Clearly, this should result from the possible role of the Ti in benefiting the metal dispersion, as the textural properties of the support 0.02TS-170 are not so much larger than those of S-170 (insert in Fig. 2), and the Pt loading amount is far lower than that of the monolayer coverage. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 8, the IR band due to the linear adsorption of CO on Pt0 atoms shifted regularly from 2070 to 2054 cm1 for the catalyst samples in the order Pt/S-170, PtZn/S-170 and PtZn/0.02TS-170. The red shift of the CO stretching frequency is widely accepted by researchers as being caused by increasing electron density on Pt12,21,22 That is, a higher Pt electron density causes the electron back-donation to the 2π* antibond of CO to increase, and hence weakens the CO bond, leading the CO stretching frequency to shift to lower wavenumber.12 Red-shifting of the band due to the presence of zinc in the catalyst is also observed in the case of γ-Al2O3,23 SiO2,24 and silicalite-1 zeolite25 loaded with Pt. All the authors ascribed the phenomenon to PtZn alloy formation. Thus, from the greater red-shift of the band observed on the PtZn/0.02TS-170 compared to that on the PtZn/S-170, the following deduction could be established: the Ti atoms assisted PtZn alloy formation when the two metals were loaded on the TS-1 support. How could titanium play this role? The only answer is that the Ti existing in the zeolite framework has strong interactions with Pt and Zn and these interactions cause the two metals to localize together, therefore boosting the alloy formation and enhancing the metal dispersion over the support. To further strengthen the effect of the Ti on the dispersion of the metals in the catalyst, 0.03TS-170 was synthesized from a synthesis gel containing more titanium. However, as shown in the figure, the CO absorption band instead showed a blue-shift, and the band intensity was also decreased. To study the reason for this, the CO adsorption IR spectrum on a PtZnTi0.02/S-170 sample, which was prepared by loading Ti, Pt and Zn in the same amounts as for PtZn/0.02TS-170, was measured. As shown in Fig. 8, a further blue-shift and the intensity decrease for the CO absorption were observed. This indicates that only the framework Ti is favorable for the metal dispersion, whereas non-framework titanium species negatively influence the metal dispersion.

Fig. 8 FTIR spectra of CO adsorption over different catalysts.
Table 1 gives the degrees of dispersion of Pt on the PtZn/S-170, the PtZn/0.02TS-170 and the PtZn/0.03TS-170, which were measured from CO adsorption at 25 C by assuming that CO was linearly adsorbed on surface Pt atoms in a 1:1 ratio.2628 The Pt dispersion degree for the PtZn/S-170 is 4.68%, while it is 21.42% for PtZn/0.02TS-170, which is about 4.6 times higher than the former. However, in the case of PtZn/0.03TS-170, the Pt dispersion degree instead decreased to 18.25%. Clearly, these results are highly consistent with those from the CO adsorption IR spectroscopy described above.
Table 1 Degree of dispersion of Pt as detected by CO adsorption Sample CO adsorption amount/106 mol gcat1 Dispersion degree of Pt/% PtZn/S-170 1.2 4.68 PtZn/0.02TS-170 5.49 21.42 PtZn/0.03TS-170 4.68 18.25 In the DHP reaction, the PtZn/0.03TS-170 again displayed inferior catalytic activity compared to that of the PtZn/0.02TS-170, as shown in Fig. 9, which is in good accordance with the Pt dispersion degree results and those given by CO adsorption IR spectroscopy. To confirm that the additional Ti in the PtZn/0.03TS-170 compared to that in the PtZn/0.02TS-170 does exist as non-framework titanium species, the chemical state of Ti in the 0.03TS-170 was studied using UV spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 10, although the peak at around 210 nm due to the charge transfer from O2 to Ti4+ in the MFI framework29 seems to be enhanced for the 0.03TS-170 compared that of 0.02TS-170, the UV absorption peaks at around 275 and 315 nm showed much greater increases in intensity. The absorption of the 0.03TS-170 at these high wavelengths indicates that there were more partially condensed hexacoordinate titanium species and crystalline anatase TiO2 species30 in the sample. This is strongly supported by the Ti0.02/S-170 sample, which is prepared by simply loading titanium via impregnation and showed stronger absorption around 275 and 315 nm in its UV spectrum. On the other hand, greatly inferior activity was exhibited by the PtZnTi0.02/S-170 using the Ti0.02/S-170 as a support. Thus, the inferior activity of the PtZn/0.03TS-170 could be understood, and the following conclusion could be drawn: only the zeolite framework Ti could play the desired roles for the reaction, while titanium oxide species negatively influence the catalyst activity.

Fig. 10 UV-vis spectra of different samples.
Fig. 11 shows the C3H6-TPD patterns over the PtZn/0.02TS-170, PtZn/S-170 and some related supports. The highest C3H6 desorption peaks at 470 and 523 C appeared on the S-170. Clearly, these should be associated with the adsorption of C3H6 on the surface silanol groups of the silicalite-1 zeolite. This implies that decreasing the silanol groups on the catalyst surface in highly meaningful for suppressing coke deposition over the catalyst. For the 0.02TS-170, the peak at 523 C remarkably decreased in intensity, and the peak that appeared at 470 C on the S-170 shifted to lower temperature (457 C) due to the incorporation of titanium. A similar peak shift (from 465 to 451 C) was also observed for the PtZn/0.02TS-170 compared with the PtZn/S-170. Clearly, these results are in line with those measured using IR spectroscopy, indicating that the framework Ti could significantly decrease the undesired residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface. In the C3H6-TPD, three additional peaks at around 409, 340 and 240 C appeared on the PtZn/S-170 compared to the corresponding support, which should be due to the adsorption of C3H6 on the metal surface. Interestingly, in the case of PtZn/0.02TS-170, the peaks that appeared at around 409 and 240 C for PtZn/S-170 shifted to 380 and 230 C, respectively. The results indicate that the framework Ti also has the function of making the release of C3H6 from the metal surface easier.

3.3 Catalytic performance comparison
For the DHP, the various research groups around the world have investigated the catalysts under quite different reaction conditions. To evaluate the catalytic performance of PtZn/0.02TS-170 with respect to other catalysts reported in the literature, the reaction was performed over the PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst at different WHSV values. Fig. 12 shows the C3H8 conversion and the C3H6 selectivity as a function of the time on stream over the PtZn/0.02TS-170 at 600 C and a WHSV of 12 h1. Over the total reaction period of 96.8 hours, the selectivity towards C3H6 was maintained at about 96%, and substantial deactivation of the catalyst began after the reaction had been conducted for a time on stream of about 25 hours.
Fig. 12 Long-term stability test of PtZn/0.02TS-170. Reaction conditions: C3H8 = 5 mL min1, WHSV = 12 h1, 600 C. The inset illustrates the catalytic performance of the spent PtZn/0.02TS-170 after regeneration.
The catalytic parameters of the PtZn/0.02TS-170 under different reaction conditions are listed in Table 2. At 600 C, the initial C3H8 conversion over the PtZn/0.02TS-170 at a WHSV of 48 h1 is 47.3%, which is considerably higher than those reported in the literature, such as 30.2% over PtGaPb/SiO2 at 30.7 h1 (ref. 31) and 38.7% over KPtSn@S-1 at 29.5 h1.32 The initial catalytic activity of the PtZn/0.02TS-170 is also much higher than that of Pt/TiO2Al2O3 (ref. 12) and the PtSn/Al2O3-sheet catalyst,3 irrespective of the WHSV applied for the test (24 h1vs. 10 h1 or 9.4 h1) or the C3H8 conversion (54.5% vs. 47.3% or 48.7%) obtained. Correspondingly, the PtZn/0.02TS-170 gave a much higher initial specific rate of 58.09 molC3H6 gPt1 h1vs. the 8.33 and 29.16 molC3H6 gPt1 h1 for the two latter catalysts.

These values are clearly lower than the 0.0166 h1 obtained after 58.3 hours on stream over the PtZn4@S-1-H.25 The results indicate that the PtZn/0.02TS-170 has better catalytic durability as well.
The activity of the spent catalyst that had been subjected to a time on stream of 96.8 h (Fig. 12) was retested after regeneration (in 5% O2/N2 at 400 C for 1 h, at 600 C for 1 h, and then in 33% H2/N2 at 500 C for 2 h on-line). As shown in Fig. 12 (inset), the initial activity was not completely recovered by the regeneration. Furthermore, although the initial C3H8 conversion increased from 20.5% for the spent catalyst to 45.0% after regeneration, the activity decrease for the spent catalyst after regeneration was far faster than that of the fresh catalyst, indicating that in addition to carbon deposition, the change in the catalytic structure during the reaction period (96.8 h) also significantly contributes to the deactivation for the PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst.
Conclusions Based on the above discussion, the following conclusions could be drawn. The use of the titanium silicon zeolite TS-1 as the PtZn support for preparing the DHP catalyst can significantly improve Pt dispersion, modify Pt and decrease undesired residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface. As a result, it greatly enhanced the activity and the catalytic durability of the catalyst.
The important roles of TS-1 as the support could be ascribed to the framework titanium, which localizes Pt and Zn together, increasing the dispersion degree of Pt and improving its modification by Zn, as indicated by CO adsorption IR spectra as well as C3H6-TPD. On the other hand, non-framework titanium species have a negative effect on the activity of the catalyst.
The PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst is not only very highly active, selective, and catalytically durable, but also economically applicable for industrial DHP applications, as the catalyst could be obtained via a simple impregnation process and TS-1 zeolite synthesis is easy and low-cost.
