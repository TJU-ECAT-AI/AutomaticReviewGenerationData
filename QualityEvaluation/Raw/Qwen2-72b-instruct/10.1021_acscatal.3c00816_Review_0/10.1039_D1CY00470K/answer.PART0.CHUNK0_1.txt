1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional propylene production methods. However, it does highlight the growing demand for propylene and the potential of PDH as an alternative production route using abundant propane feedstock from shale gas reserves. PDH could directly produce propylene from propane, which is attractive given the increasing market demand for propylene and the availability of cheap and abundant alkanes from shale gas reserves. The key advantages of PDH likely include better feedstock availability, potentially higher process efficiency, and improved product selectivity compared to traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法挑战方面的具体优势。但是，它确实强调了丙烯需求的增加以及PDH作为利用页岩气储备中丰富的丙烷原料的替代生产路线的潜力。PDH可以直接从丙烷生产丙烯，这在丙烯市场需求增加和页岩气储备中廉价且丰富的烷烃可用性的情况下具有吸引力。PDH的关键优势可能包括更好的原料可用性，潜在的更高过程效率，以及与传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解和重油流化催化裂化方法相比，产品选择性得到改善。
