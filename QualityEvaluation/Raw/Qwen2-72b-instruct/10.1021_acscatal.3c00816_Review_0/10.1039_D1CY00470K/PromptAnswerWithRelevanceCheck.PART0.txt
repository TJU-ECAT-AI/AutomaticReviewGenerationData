1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional propylene production methods. However, it does highlight the growing demand for propylene and the potential of PDH as an alternative production route using abundant propane feedstock from shale gas reserves. The literature focuses on the development of a highly active, selective, and durable catalyst for PDH, which could contribute to process efficiency and product selectivity.

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional propylene production methods. However, it does highlight the growing demand for propylene and the potential of PDH as an alternative production route using abundant propane feedstock from shale gas reserves. PDH could directly produce propylene from propane, which is attractive given the increasing market demand for propylene and the availability of cheap and abundant alkanes from shale gas reserves. The key advantages of PDH likely include better feedstock availability, potentially higher process efficiency, and improved product selectivity compared to traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil.
