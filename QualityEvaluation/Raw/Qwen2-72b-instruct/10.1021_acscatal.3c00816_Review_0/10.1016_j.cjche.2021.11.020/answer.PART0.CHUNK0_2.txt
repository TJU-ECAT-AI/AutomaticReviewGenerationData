1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH technology has received great attention as an alternative way for the production of propylene, due to the increasing market demand for propylene in recent years. The literature focuses on the development of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, which shows high efficiency and selectivity under high temperature conditions.
