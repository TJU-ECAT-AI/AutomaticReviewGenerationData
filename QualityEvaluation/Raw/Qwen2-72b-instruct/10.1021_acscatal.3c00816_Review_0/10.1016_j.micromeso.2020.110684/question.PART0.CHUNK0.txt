I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Abstract To better understand influences of surface properties of supports on distributed Cr active sites of Cr-based catalysts with high Cr loading, foamed alumina modified by Sn was prepared to support CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. N2 adsorption-desorption, TEM, XRD, FTIR, UVvis, Raman, XPS, NH3-TPD, Py-IR and H2-TPR were carried out to elucidate catalyst structures. The foamable alumina is formed by using soft template, and tin added in preparing process changes micro-micelle formation to generate more complex cavity structure. The Sn doped into alumina framework and dispersed on support surface changes the surface properties, such as surface hydroxyl group and isoelectric point, promoting the formation of more active polymeric chromate on the surface, thus the CrOx supported on modified alumina presents high activity of propane dehydrogenation and good catalyst stability, comparing with unmodified CrOx/alumina catalyst. The added Sn obviously inhibits the formation of coke deposition due to decreased strong acid sites, Cr sites density and Cr3+ content on the surface of the catalysts.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


In light of the growing global demand for propylene, what are the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production, and how does it specifically address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
