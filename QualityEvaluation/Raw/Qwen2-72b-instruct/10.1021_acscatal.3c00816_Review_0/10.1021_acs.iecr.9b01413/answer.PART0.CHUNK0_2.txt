[1] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively. The Catofin process is operated at slightly positive atmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar, and the Oleflex process is usually operated at 13 bar, while the STAR process needs a higher pressure of 56 bar. Besides the catalytic system and the operation conditions especially the pressure, the other features like the type of reactor could also differ among the three processes."
[2] "It has been proved that PtSn based catalysts could efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane, while the catalyst deactivation and the long-term stability issues are still the big challenges even for the aforementioned commercial catalysts."
[3] "The recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."
[4] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."
[5] "The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its simpler reactant and product distribution, less investment, and easier integration with present technology. It addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing the abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes from natural gas production, including the exploitation of shale gas. The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene can be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants, and PtSn based catalysts have been proven to efficiently catalyze this process. However, catalyst deactivation and long-term stability issues remain challenges even for commercial PDH processes such as Catofin, Oleflex, and STAR.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它具有更简单的反应物和产物分布、更少的投资和更容易与现有技术集成。它通过利用天然气生产中丰富的、经济的和稳定的轻烷烃来源（包括页岩气的开采）来解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。丙烷催化脱氢为丙烯可以在有或无氧化剂的情况下进行，而基于PtSn的催化剂已被证明能有效地催化这一过程。然而，催化剂失活和长期稳定性问题仍然是Catofin、Oleflex和STAR等商业PDH过程面临的挑战。
