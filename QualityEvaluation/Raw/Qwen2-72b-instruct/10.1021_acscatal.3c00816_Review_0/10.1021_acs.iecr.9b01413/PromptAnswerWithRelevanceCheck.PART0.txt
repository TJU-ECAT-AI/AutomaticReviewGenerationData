[1] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively. The Catofin process is operated at slightly positive atmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar, and the Oleflex process is usually operated at 13 bar, while the STAR process needs a higher pressure of 56 bar. Besides the catalytic system and the operation conditions especially the pressure, the other features like the type of reactor could also differ among the three processes."
[2] "It has been proved that PtSn based catalysts could efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane, while the catalyst deactivation and the long-term stability issues are still the big challenges even for the aforementioned commercial catalysts."
[3] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."
[4] "The recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."
[5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."
[6] "The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods. The recent boom in natural gas production, including the exploitation of shale gas, has provided abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like propane. PDH technology can efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, offering simpler reactant and product distribution, less investment, and easier integration with present technology. This is in contrast to conventional processes such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, which are more complex and require higher investment. The PDH process operates under atmospheric pressure, making it more energy-efficient and cost-effective compared to processes that require higher pressures. However, catalyst deactivation and long-term stability issues remain challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of PDH technology.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面具有优势。最近，天然气生产的繁荣，包括页岩气的开采，为轻烷烃如丙烷提供了丰富、经济和稳定的来源。PDH技术可以有效地催化丙烷直接脱氢为丙烯，提供更简单的反应物和产物分布，更少的投资，以及与现有技术更容易的集成。这与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化(FCC)石脑油过程形成对比，后者更复杂，需要更高的投资。PDH过程在大气压下运行，与需要更高压力的过程相比，它更节能、更经济。然而，催化剂失活和长期稳定性问题仍然是需要解决的挑战，以充分实现PDH技术的潜力。

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx. (7,8) The soft oxidant CO2 seems to be a good choice to overcome the problem, while it brings another challenge concerning the activation of CO2 to have it efficiently participate the reaction. (911) Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage. In such a background, the propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology.
