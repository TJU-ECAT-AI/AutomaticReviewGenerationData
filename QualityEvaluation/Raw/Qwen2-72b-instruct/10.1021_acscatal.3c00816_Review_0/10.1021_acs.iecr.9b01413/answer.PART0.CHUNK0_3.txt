[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx. (7,8) The soft oxidant CO2 seems to be a good choice to overcome the problem, while it brings another challenge concerning the activation of CO2 to have it efficiently participate the reaction. (911) Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage. In such a background, the propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology.
