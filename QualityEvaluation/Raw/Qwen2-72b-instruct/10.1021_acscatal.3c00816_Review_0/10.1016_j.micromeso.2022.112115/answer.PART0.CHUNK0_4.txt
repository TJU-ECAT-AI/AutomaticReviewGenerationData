1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to conventional production methods. However, it does mention that Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit high C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in recycling PDH reactions, which suggests that PDH technology may offer improved product selectivity and process efficiency.
