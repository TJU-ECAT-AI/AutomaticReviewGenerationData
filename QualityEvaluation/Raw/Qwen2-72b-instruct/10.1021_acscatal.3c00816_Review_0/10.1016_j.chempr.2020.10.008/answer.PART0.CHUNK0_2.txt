[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
[2] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
[3] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,4 ,5 ,6 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has gained increasing attention due to the shift in feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, driven by the emergence of shale gas and the growing availability of natural gas. This technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing light alkanes as feedstock, which are more abundant and can be processed more efficiently. However, PDH is an energy-intensive process due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions, requiring high reaction temperatures. This presents significant challenges for achieving high alkene selectivity and maintaining catalyst stability, as high temperatures can lead to cracking and coking reactions.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种商业化的丙烯生产技术，由于页岩气的出现和天然气供应的增加，导致从石脑油转向轻烷烃作为原料，PDH技术因此受到越来越多的关注。该技术通过使用更丰富且处理效率更高的轻烷烃作为原料，解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。然而，PDH是一种能源密集型过程，由于反应的高正焓（ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1），需要高温反应，这为实现高烯烃选择性和保持催化剂稳定性带来了重大挑战，因为高温会导致裂解和焦化反应。
