[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
[2] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
[3] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,4 ,5 ,6 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has gained increasing attention due to the shift in feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, driven by the emergence of shale gas and the growing availability of natural gas. However, PDH is an energy-intensive process, requiring high reaction temperatures due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions. This presents significant challenges for achieving high alkene selectivity and maintaining catalyst stability, as high temperatures can lead to cracking and coking reactions.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种商业化的丙烯生产技术，由于页岩气的出现和天然气供应的增加，原料从石脑油转向轻质烷烃，PDH技术受到了越来越多的关注。然而，PDH是一个极其耗能的过程，由于反应的高正焓（ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1），需要高温反应，这给烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性带来了巨大挑战，因为高温会导致裂解和焦化反应。
