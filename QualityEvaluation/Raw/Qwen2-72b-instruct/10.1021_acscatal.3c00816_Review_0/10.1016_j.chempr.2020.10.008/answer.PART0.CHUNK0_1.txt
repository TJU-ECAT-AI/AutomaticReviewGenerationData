[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,4 ,5 ,6 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
[3] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to the shift in feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, driven by the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas. PDH is an energy-intensive process due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions, which necessitates high reaction temperatures. This presents significant challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability, as larger ensembles of active sites can catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke. To address these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proven to be effective.

1.由于页岩气的出现和天然气供应的增加，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其从石脑油向轻烷烃的原料转变，成为生产丙烯最有前景的方法。PDH是一种能源密集型过程，由于反应的高正焓（ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1），需要高温反应，这给烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性带来了重大挑战。特别是，较大的活性位点集合会催化结构敏感的副反应，包括裂解和深度脱氢，导致C1和C2分子以及焦炭的产生。为了应对这些挑战，活性位点隔离策略已被证明是有效的。
