[1] "The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."

1.催化选择性烷烃直接脱氢(DH)可以作为满足全球对烯烃日益增长需求的有效补充，特别是在大规模开发页岩气的背景下。与甲醇制烯烃(MTO)、费托合成制烯烃(FTO)和使用O2、CO2和N2O作为氧化剂的烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)等其他途径相比，DH过程具有对烯烃的独家选择性这一独特属性。
