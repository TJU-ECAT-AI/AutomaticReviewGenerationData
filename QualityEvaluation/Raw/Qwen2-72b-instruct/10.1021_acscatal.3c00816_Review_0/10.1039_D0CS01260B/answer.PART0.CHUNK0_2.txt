[1] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
[2] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."
[3] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties"
[4] "The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its exclusive selectivity to olefins, which is a unique property compared to other pathways like methanol-to-olefins (MTO), Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). This technology can effectively supplement the growing global demand for propylene, especially in light of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. PDH reactions, such as non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH), are thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, offering a process efficiency advantage over conventional production methods that rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. These conventional methods face challenges in terms of feedstock availability and process efficiency, while PDH specifically addresses these issues by utilizing alkanes as feedstocks, which are abundant in shale gas.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为与甲醇制烯烃（MTO）、费托合成制烯烃（FTO）和使用氧气、二氧化碳和一氧化二氮作为氧化剂的烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）等其他途径相比，它具有对烯烃的独家选择性，这是一个独特的特性。这种技术可以有效地补充全球对丙烯的日益增长的需求，特别是在大规模开采页岩气的背景下。PDH反应，如非氧化性乙烷脱氢（EDH）和丙烷脱氢（PDH），在热力学上是有限的，高度吸热，与依赖于裂解石脑油和重油的蒸汽裂解（SC）和流化催化裂化（FCC）的常规生产方法相比，提供了过程效率的优势。这些常规方法在原料供应和过程效率方面面临挑战，而PDH通过使用页岩气中丰富的烷烃作为原料，特别解决了这些问题。
