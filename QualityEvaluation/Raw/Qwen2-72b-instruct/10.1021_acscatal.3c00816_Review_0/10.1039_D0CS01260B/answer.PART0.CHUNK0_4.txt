[1] "The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."

1.The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its exclusive selectivity to olefins, which addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH can serve as an effective supplement to the commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene, which rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. In comparison with other pathways such as methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, PDH has exclusive selectivity to olefins.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术作为最有可能的丙烯生产方法，其关键优势在于其对烯烃的独家选择性，这解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。PDH可以作为有效的补充，用于生产乙烯和丙烯的商业过程，这些过程依赖于石脑油和重油的蒸汽裂解(SC)和流化催化裂化(FCC)。与甲醇制烯烃(MTO)、费托合成制烯烃(FTO)和使用O2、CO2和N2O作为氧化剂的烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)等其他途径相比，PDH具有对烯烃的独家选择性。
