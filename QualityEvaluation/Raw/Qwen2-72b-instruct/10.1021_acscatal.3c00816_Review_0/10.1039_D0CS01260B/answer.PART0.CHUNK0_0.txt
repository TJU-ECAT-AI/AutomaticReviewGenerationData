[1] "The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."

1.The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its ability to serve as an effective supplement to traditional production methods in light of the growing global demand for olefins. PDH can utilize the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, offering exclusive selectivity to olefins compared to other pathways like methanol-to-olefins (MTO), Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2, and N2O as oxidants. This exclusive selectivity to olefins addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术作为最有可能的丙烯生产方法，其关键优势在于，面对全球对烯烃日益增长的需求，它能够作为传统生产方法的有效补充。PDH可以利用大规模开采的页岩气，与甲醇制烯烃（MTO）、费托合成制烯烃（FTO）以及使用O2、CO2和N2O作为氧化剂的烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）等其他途径相比，PDH具有对烯烃的专一选择性。这种对烯烃的专一选择性解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。
