[1] "In this review, we outline the progress of these dehydrogenation catalysts that have been mainly developed in the past five years. For different classes of the most-promising catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene, their syntheses, structural information, catalytic properties and mechanisms are comparatively summarized."

[2] "Light olefins, namely, ethylene, propylene and butylene are important chemical building blocks for the mass manufacture of a variety of high-value chemicals and intermediates such as polymers and oxygenates. The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."

[3] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties, as shown below: Considering the high chemical stability of the CH bonds in these two molecules, the direct dehydrogenation reactions require a high temperature to gain a satisfactory yield of olefins."

[4] "A temperature range of 550 to 700 C results in reaching the equilibrium conversions of the atmospheric EDH reaction from ca. 10% to 40%, while the equilibrium conversion at 600 C corresponds to ca. 50% for the atmospheric PDH reaction."

[5] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."

[6] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."

[7] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."

[8] "Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene."

[9] "Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes."

[10] "Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology has made significant progress in the past five years, with the development of various catalysts for selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene. The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil, which are limited by the availability of these feedstocks. PDH technology can serve as an effective supplement to meet the growing global demand for olefins, especially in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. PDH reactions are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties, requiring a high temperature to gain a satisfactory yield of olefins. The equilibrium conversions of the atmospheric EDH reaction range from 10% to 40% at a temperature range of 550 to 700 C, while the equilibrium conversion at 600 C corresponds to 50% for the atmospheric PDH reaction. Ethane and propane are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated than olefin molecules, due to their high chemical stability of the CH bonds. Efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts. The binding energies of the CC and CH bonds in ethane and propane are 347 and 414 kJ mol1, respectively, while the binding energy of the CC double bond in ethylene is 720 kJ mol1, and the CC single bond in propylene is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。PDH技术在过去五年中取得了显著进展，开发了各种催化剂用于选择性脱氢反应，将乙烷转化为乙烯，将丙烷转化为丙烯。生产乙烯和丙烯的商业过程依赖于蒸汽裂解(SC)和流化催化裂化(FCC)的石脑油和重油，这些原料的供应有限。PDH技术可以作为有效补充，以满足全球对烯烃日益增长的需求，特别是在大规模开发页岩气的背景下。PDH反应是热力学受限的反应，具有高度吸热性，需要高温才能获得满意的烯烃产量。大气EDH反应的平衡转化率在550至700°C的温度范围内从10%变化到40%，而600°C时大气PDH反应的平衡转化率对应于50%。与烯烃分子相比，乙烷和丙烷更难吸附在催化剂表面并被激活，因为它们的CH键具有较高的化学稳定性。高效和选择性地激活CH键，同时抑制CC断裂，是决定EDH和PDH催化剂性能的最重要因素。乙烷和丙烷中CC和CH键的结合能分别为347和414 kJ mol1，而乙烯中CC双键的结合能为720 kJ mol1，丙烯中CC单键的结合能为414 kJ mol1，是最弱的。此外，除了作为目标产物容易解吸外，烯烃还可以作为中间体参与进一步的转化反应，形成焦炭或低碳副产品，因为烯烃的吸附性比烷烃强。考虑到丙烯相对于乙烯的稳定性较低，为了实现对烯烃的高选择性，对于两种DH反应，特别是PDH反应，使用适当的催化剂是必要的，需要考虑到吸附-解吸性质的差异。
