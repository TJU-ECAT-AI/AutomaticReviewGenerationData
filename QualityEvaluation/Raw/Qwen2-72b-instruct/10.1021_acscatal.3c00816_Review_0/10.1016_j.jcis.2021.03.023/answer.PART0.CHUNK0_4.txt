1.The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent. Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility.

1.丙烯需求的不断增长和页岩气藏中丙烷储量的增加，使人们越来越关注丙烷脱氢（PDH）。商业PDH工艺在500°C以上的温度下运行，通常基于Cr/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的Oleflex工艺。然而，Cr的严重毒性以及Pt的高昂价格极大地限制了PDH工业的进一步发展，对新型催化剂的需求日益迫切。基于钴的催化剂已被证明对PDH很有前景，而元素Co在地球上的丰富性预示着其长期的实用性。
