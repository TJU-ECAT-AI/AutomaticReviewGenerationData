[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
[3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
[5] "Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic and process efficiency advantages. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing alternative substrates, such as propane, which is abundant and can be sourced from natural gas. PDH offers a shorter and more direct route to propylene production compared to other technologies, making it commercially viable. However, the process is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited, requiring high temperatures that can lead to side reactions such as thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, which decrease propylene selectivity and cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Despite these challenges, PDH remains the most economical method for propylene production, especially in light of the growing global demand for propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它在经济性和工艺效率方面具有优势。它通过利用丙烷等替代原料来应对传统生产方法的挑战，丙烷丰富，可从天然气中获取。与其它技术相比，PDH提供了一条更短、更直接的丙烯生产途径，使其在商业上可行。然而，该过程高度吸热且受平衡限制，需要高温，这可能导致热/催化裂解和焦炭形成等副反应，降低丙烯的选择性并导致催化剂迅速失活。尽管存在这些挑战，但鉴于全球对丙烯需求的不断增长和石油资源的枯竭，PDH仍然是最经济的丙烯生产方法。

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic and process efficiency advantages. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing alternative substrates, such as propane, which is abundant and not subject to the same depletion issues as petroleum resources. PDH offers a shorter and more direct route to propylene production compared to other technologies, making it commercially viable and attractive for industrial scale-up. However, the high temperature required for the PDH reaction can lead to side reactions, such as thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, which can reduce propylene selectivity and cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Despite these challenges, PDH remains a key technology for propylene production due to its ability to produce propylene from a readily available feedstock at high yields and selectivity under optimized conditions.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因其在经济性和工艺效率方面具有优势。它通过利用如丙烷等替代原料，解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战，丙烷资源丰富，不像石油资源那样面临枯竭问题。与其它技术相比，PDH提供了一条更短、更直接的丙烯生产途径，使其在商业上可行且对工业规模生产具有吸引力。然而，PDH反应所需的高温可能会导致副反应，如热/催化裂解和焦炭形成，这会降低丙烯的选择性并导致催化剂迅速失活。尽管存在这些挑战，PDH仍然是丙烯生产的关键技术，因为它能够在优化条件下从易得的原料中以高产率和选择性生产丙烯。

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic and process efficiency advantages. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by providing an alternative route that is not dependent on petroleum resources, which are becoming increasingly scarce. PDH is a commercially available technology that can directly convert propane into propylene, making it the most economical and shortest route for propylene production. However, the PDH process is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited, requiring high temperatures to promote catalytic activity. This high-temperature operation facilitates side reactions such as thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, leading to low propylene selectivity and rapid catalyst deactivation. Therefore, the development of PDH technology, especially in terms of improving the efficiency of catalysts with high selectivity and stability under severe operating conditions, is a significant challenge for the industrial production of propylene.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它在经济性和工艺效率方面具有优势。它通过提供一条不依赖于日益稀缺的石油资源的替代路线，解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。PDH是一种可商业获得的技术，可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，使其成为生产丙烯最经济、最短的途径。然而，PDH过程是高度吸热和平衡限制的，需要高温来促进催化活性。这种高温操作促进了热/催化裂解和焦炭形成等副反应，导致丙烯选择性低和催化剂快速失活。因此，PDH技术的发展，特别是在提高催化剂在恶劣操作条件下具有高选择性和稳定性的效率方面，是工业生产丙烯的重大挑战。
