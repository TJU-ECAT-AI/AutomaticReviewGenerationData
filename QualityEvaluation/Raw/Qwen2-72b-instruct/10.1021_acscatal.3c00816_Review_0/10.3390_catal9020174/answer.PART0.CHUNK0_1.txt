[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
[3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
[5] "Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic and process efficiency advantages. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing alternative substrates, such as propane, which is abundant and not subject to the same depletion issues as petroleum resources. PDH offers a shorter and more direct route to propylene production compared to other technologies, making it commercially viable and attractive for industrial scale-up. However, the high temperature required for the PDH reaction can lead to side reactions, such as thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, which can reduce propylene selectivity and cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Despite these challenges, PDH remains a key technology for propylene production due to its ability to produce propylene from a readily available feedstock at high yields and selectivity under optimized conditions.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因其在经济性和工艺效率方面具有优势。它通过利用如丙烷等替代原料，解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战，丙烷资源丰富，不像石油资源那样面临枯竭问题。与其它技术相比，PDH提供了一条更短、更直接的丙烯生产途径，使其在商业上可行且对工业规模生产具有吸引力。然而，PDH反应所需的高温可能会导致副反应，如热/催化裂解和焦炭形成，这会降低丙烯的选择性并导致催化剂迅速失活。尽管存在这些挑战，PDH仍然是丙烯生产的关键技术，因为它能够在优化条件下从易得的原料中以高产率和选择性生产丙烯。
