[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
[2] "In the present technology, the majority of propylene production is obtained as a byproduct from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons [1,2]."
[3] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
[4] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[5] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
[6] "Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic and process efficiency advantages. Conventional propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons, are faced with challenges in terms of feedstock availability and process efficiency. The depletion of petroleum resources and the increasing demand for propylene have led to the development of alternative propylene production technologies, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), metathesis of ethylene and butylene, and propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Among these technologies, PDH is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production. However, PDH is a highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring relatively high temperatures to promote catalytic activity. This behavior facilitates several side-reactions, such as thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation of catalysts.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它在经济和工艺效率方面具有优势。传统的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化烃类，面临着原料供应和工艺效率的挑战。石油资源的枯竭和丙烯需求的增加导致了替代的丙烯生产技术的发展，如甲醇制烯烃(MTO)、乙烯和丁烯的复分解以及丙烷脱氢(PDH)。在这些技术中，PDH是生产丙烯最经济、最短的途径。然而，PDH是一种高度吸热和平衡受限的反应，需要相对较高的温度来促进催化活性。这种行为促进了热/催化裂解和焦炭形成等多种副反应，导致丙烯选择性低，催化剂失活速度快。
