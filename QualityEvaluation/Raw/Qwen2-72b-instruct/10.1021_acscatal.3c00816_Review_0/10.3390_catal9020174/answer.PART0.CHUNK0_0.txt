[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
[3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
[5] "Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic and process efficiency advantages. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing alternative substrates, such as propane, which is abundant and can be sourced from natural gas. PDH offers a shorter and more direct route to propylene production compared to other technologies, making it commercially viable. However, the process is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited, requiring high temperatures that can lead to side reactions such as thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, which decrease propylene selectivity and cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Despite these challenges, PDH remains the most economical method for propylene production, especially in light of the growing global demand for propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它在经济性和工艺效率方面具有优势。它通过利用丙烷等替代原料来应对传统生产方法的挑战，丙烷丰富，可从天然气中获取。与其它技术相比，PDH提供了一条更短、更直接的丙烯生产途径，使其在商业上可行。然而，该过程高度吸热且受平衡限制，需要高温，这可能导致热/催化裂解和焦炭形成等副反应，降低丙烯的选择性并导致催化剂迅速失活。尽管存在这些挑战，但鉴于全球对丙烯需求的不断增长和石油资源的枯竭，PDH仍然是最经济的丙烯生产方法。
