[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
[2] "In the present technology, the majority of propylene production is obtained as a byproduct from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons [1,2]."
[3] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
[4] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[5] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
[6] "Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."
[7] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic and process efficiency advantages. Conventional propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons, face challenges in feedstock availability and process efficiency. PDH technology, on the other hand, offers a shorter and more economical route for propylene production, making it commercially viable. However, the PDH process is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited, requiring high temperatures that can lead to side reactions like thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, which reduce propylene selectivity and cause rapid catalyst deactivation. The development of PDH technology, therefore, focuses on improving catalyst efficiency, selectivity, and stability under severe operating conditions to meet the growing global demand for propylene.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它在经济和工艺效率方面具有优势。传统的丙烯生产方法，如烃类蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化，面临着原料供应和工艺效率的挑战。相比之下，PDH技术提供了一条更短、更经济的丙烯生产途径，使其具有商业可行性。然而，PDH过程是高度吸热和平衡受限的，需要高温，这会导致热/催化裂解和焦炭形成等副反应，从而降低丙烯的选择性并导致催化剂迅速失活。因此，PDH技术的发展重点是提高催化剂在恶劣操作条件下的效率、选择性和稳定性，以满足全球对丙烯日益增长的需求。
