1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, it does mention that propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products, and the increasing global demand for propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene. The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process. Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts remains as an important catalytic challenge.

1.文献没有提供关于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法的原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性挑战方面的具体优势的信息。但是，它确实提到丙烯是制造各种产品的关键商品化学品，全球对丙烯的需求日益增长，以及页岩气藏中大量的丙烷储备，正吸引人们采用催化丙烷脱氢（PDH）生产丙烯。商业PDH工艺基于两种主要技术，一种是使用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的Oleflex工艺，另一种是使用Cr/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺。然而，Pt金属的高价格和Cr催化剂的严重毒性问题极大地限制了PDH工艺的进一步发展。开发成本效益高、环境友好的催化剂仍然是一个重要的催化挑战。
