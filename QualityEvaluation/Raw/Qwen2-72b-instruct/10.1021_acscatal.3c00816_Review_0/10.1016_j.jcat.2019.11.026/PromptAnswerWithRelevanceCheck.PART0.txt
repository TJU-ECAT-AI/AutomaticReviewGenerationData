Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does mention that the increasing global demand for propylene and the large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene. The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. The development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts remains an important catalytic challenge.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体优势。但是，它确实提到全球对丙烯的需求日益增长，以及页岩气藏中大量的丙烷储备，这使得人们越来越关注利用催化丙烷脱氢（PDH）生产丙烯。商业PDH工艺主要基于两种技术，一种是使用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的Oleflex工艺，另一种是使用Cr/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺。开发成本效益高且环保的催化剂仍然是一个重要的催化挑战。
