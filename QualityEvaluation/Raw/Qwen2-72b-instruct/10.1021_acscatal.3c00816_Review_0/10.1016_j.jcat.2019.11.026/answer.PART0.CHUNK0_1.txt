1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does mention that the increasing global demand for propylene and the large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene. The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. The high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process. Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts remains as an important catalytic challenge.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体优势。但是,它确实提到全球对丙烯的需求日益增长,以及页岩气藏中大量的丙烷储备,正在吸引人们利用催化丙烷脱氢(PDH)生产丙烯的兴趣。商业PDH工艺基于两种主要技术,一种是使用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的Oleflex工艺,另一种是使用Cr/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺。铂金属的高价格和Cr催化剂的严重毒性问题极大地限制了PDH工艺的进一步发展。开发成本效益高、环境友好的催化剂仍然是一个重要的催化挑战。
