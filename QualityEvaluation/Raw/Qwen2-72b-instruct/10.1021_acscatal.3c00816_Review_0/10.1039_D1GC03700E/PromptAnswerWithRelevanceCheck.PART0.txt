<quotes>

[1] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane."
[2] "The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."
[3] "Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field and to date there are several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH) (Sattler,2 2013), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2) (Atanga,3 2018) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2) (Carrero,4 2014 and Shi,5 2018)."
[4] "The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 to identify over-arching themes and common rules for catalyst design."
[5] "We do not try to capture aspects of reaction design and engineering, which itself is a vibrant field of research."
[6] "We attempt to compare the performance of catalysts in the different sub-reactions by calculating a space time yield (STY), (measured in molC3H6 kgcat1 h1), which is based on the initial activity of the catalysts."
[7] "Additionally, we emphasise the environmental and industrial perspectives of each reaction and the prospects for industrial application."
[8] "Propene is a major platform chemical with a myriad of uses in the manufacturing and chemical industry."
[9] "The majority of propene is used to manufacture polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer which is second only to polyethene in the scale of production."
[10] "Polypropene has favourable physical properties such as high chemical resistance and good elasticity, which makes it useful in a broad range of applications, including packaging, manufacturing and in construction materials."
[11] "Propene is also the precursor to many other polymer-related chemicals, including propene oxide (used to make polyurethane), acrylic acid (used to make acrylic polymers) and acrylonitrile (used to make polypropenonitrile)."
[12] "Additionally, large scale chemicals such as isopropanol and cumene (used to manufacture phenol and acetone) are made from propene."
[13] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030."
[14] "Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
[15] "Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."
[16] "The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."
[17] "The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation."
[18] "Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant."
[19] "This is summarised in Table 1, which compares steam cracking, MTO (from coal and natural gas) and dehydrogenation."
[20] "Atom economy is a measurement of the percentage of atomic mass in the starting reagents that ends up in the final product."
[21] "It serves as a useful indicator of how chemically efficient a process could be."
[22] "It is important to remember that in practice, the real atom economy is determined by the selectivity of the catalyst, and the prevalence of side-reactions."
[23] "Although it is not possible to precisely calculate the atom economy of SC or MTO due to the complexity of the process and uncertainty in the composition of the feedstock, it is apparent that both of these technologies are inferior to dehydrogenation."
[24] "In the case of SC a wide range of chemicals are made, and while these are ultimately utilised in the production of other chemicals, the % of propene formed from such a process is low."
[25] "Equally, in the MTO process from coal or natural gas, the atom economy is limited by the generation of H2O as a by-product."
[26] "In contrast, in the case of dehydrogenation only H2 is generated as a by-product, meaning an atom economy of 95% is possible."
[27] "With respect to the toxicity of the chemicals, SC forms various carcinogenic compounds, and the toxicity of methanol is well-established."
[28] "In contrast, propane is non-hazardous."
[29] "At present each of the feedstocks used in the main methods of propene production tend to be non-renewable."
[30] "In the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock."
[31] "However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass."
[32] "In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels."
[33] "Rodrguez-Vallejo et al. carried out life cycle analyses of naphtha cracking, propane dehydrogenation and MTO (using coal or natural gas as feedstocks)."
[34] "In this analysis, the global warming potential (GWP), resource scarcity, impact on human health and the impact on the ecosystem was considered and quantified as a cost per kg of C3H6 produced."
[35] "These data are shown in Table 1."
[36] "In terms of the global warming potential of each process, the MTO based reactions are clearly worse than the naphtha cracking or direct dehydrogenation reactions, but the CO2 emissions of the coal-based feedstock is almost an order of magnitude higher than naphtha cracking."
[37] "A similar trend was observed in the ecosystem category."
[38] "This was measured in terms of local species lost integrated over time and underlines the gross negative impact of utilising coal as a feedstock in this chemistry."
[39] "Resource scarcity was calculated based on the monetary burden of future mineral and fossil fuel extraction and shows that natural gas has around double the cost of that associated with propane, coal and naphtha."
[40] "Finally, the cost to human health was estimated in terms of disability-adjusted life years, and naphtha cracking and propane dehydrogenation came out favourably compared to the MTO processes."
[41] "Based on these metrics, it is clear that MTO from coal or natural gas has a larger environmental burden than SC or dehydrogenation."
[42] "Opportunities for improving the sustainability of the dehydrogenation process were recently highlighted by Agarwal et al. who investigated various intensification and integration strategies."
[43] "It was shown that such strategies, which involved additional waste heat recovery and off-gas recycling, up to 70% reductions in CO2 emissions were possible."
[44] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
[45] "Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane."
[46] "Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum and the propane production industry has responded accordingly."
[47] "The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale."
[48] "TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year."
[49] "Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year."
[50] "The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation."
[51] "While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity."
[52] "Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel16 as well as glycerol17 and other substrates.18"
[53] "With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this."
[54] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
[55] "However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield."
[56] "These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review."
[57] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."

1.Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its high atom economy, non-toxic reactants, and the potential to utilize renewable feedstocks. PDH specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), which produce a wide range of chemicals and have low propene selectivity, PDH generates propene with an atom economy of 95%, meaning that almost all the atomic mass of the starting reagents ends up in the final product. This high efficiency is due to the minimal by-products generated in the PDH process, with hydrogen being the only by-product. In contrast, SC and MTO processes from coal or natural gas generate water as a by-product, limiting their atom economy. PDH also has environmental advantages over SC and MTO, as it does not form carcinogenic compounds or use toxic reactants. Moreover, PDH can utilize renewable feedstocks such as propane produced from biomass, making it a more sustainable process compared to using fossil fuels. The development of active, selective, and stable catalysts is essential for PDH to be considered a viable process in the near- and long-term future.
