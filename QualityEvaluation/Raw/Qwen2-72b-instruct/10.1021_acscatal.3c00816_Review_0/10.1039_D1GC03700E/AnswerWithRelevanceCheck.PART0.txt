          [1] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane."
          [2] "The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."
          [3] "Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field and to date there are several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH) (Sattler,2 2013), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2) (Atanga,3 2018) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2) (Carrero,4 2014 and Shi,5 2018)."
          [4] "The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 to identify over-arching themes and common rules for catalyst design."
          [5] "We do not try to capture aspects of reaction design and engineering, which itself is a vibrant field of research."
          [6] "We attempt to compare the performance of catalysts in the different sub-reactions by calculating a space time yield (STY), (measured in molC3H6 kgcat1 h1), which is based on the initial activity of the catalysts."
          [7] "Additionally, we emphasise the environmental and industrial perspectives of each reaction and the prospects for industrial application."
          [8] "Propene is a major platform chemical with a myriad of uses in the manufacturing and chemical industry."
          [9] "The majority of propene is used to manufacture polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer which is second only to polyethene in the scale of production."
          [10] "Polypropene has favourable physical properties such as high chemical resistance and good elasticity, which makes it useful in a broad range of applications, including packaging, manufacturing and in construction materials."
          [11] "Propene is also the precursor to many other polymer-related chemicals, including propene oxide (used to make polyurethane), acrylic acid (used to make acrylic polymers) and acrylonitrile (used to make polypropenonitrile)."
          [12] "Additionally, large scale chemicals such as isopropanol and cumene (used to manufacture phenol and acetone) are made from propene."
          [13] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030."
          [14] "Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
          [15] "Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."
          [16] "The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."
          [17] "The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation."
          [18] "Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant."
          [19] "This is summarised in Table 1, which compares steam cracking, MTO (from coal and natural gas) and dehydrogenation."
          [20] "Atom economy is a measurement of the percentage of atomic mass in the starting reagents that ends up in the final product."
          [21] "It serves as a useful indicator of how chemically efficient a process could be."
          [22] "It is important to remember that in practice, the real atom economy is determined by the selectivity of the catalyst, and the prevalence of side-reactions."
          [23] "Although it is not possible to precisely calculate the atom economy of SC or MTO due to the complexity of the process and uncertainty in the composition of the feedstock, it is apparent that both of these technologies are inferior to dehydrogenation."
          [24] "In the case of SC a wide range of chemicals are made, and while these are ultimately utilised in the production of other chemicals, the % of propene formed from such a process is low."
          [25] "Equally, in the MTO process from coal or natural gas, the atom economy is limited by the generation of H2O as a by-product."
          [26] "In contrast, in the case of dehydrogenation only H2 is generated as a by-product, meaning an atom economy of 95% is possible."
          [27] "With respect to the toxicity of the chemicals, SC forms various carcinogenic compounds, and the toxicity of methanol is well-established."
          [28] "In contrast, propane is non-hazardous."
          [29] "At present each of the feedstocks used in the main methods of propene production tend to be non-renewable."
          [30] "In the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock."
          [31] "However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass."
          [32] "In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels."
          [33] "Rodrguez-Vallejo et al. carried out life cycle analyses of naphtha cracking, propane dehydrogenation and MTO (using coal or natural gas as feedstocks)."
          [34] "In this analysis, the global warming potential (GWP), resource scarcity, impact on human health and the impact on the ecosystem was considered and quantified as a cost per kg of C3H6 produced."
          [35] "These data are shown in Table 1."
          [36] "In terms of the global warming potential of each process, the MTO based reactions are clearly worse than the naphtha cracking or direct dehydrogenation reactions, but the CO2 emissions of the coal-based feedstock is almost an order of magnitude higher than naphtha cracking."
          [37] "A similar trend was observed in the ecosystem category."
          [38] "This was measured in terms of local species lost integrated over time and underlines the gross negative impact of utilising coal as a feedstock in this chemistry."
          [39] "Resource scarcity was calculated based on the monetary burden of future mineral and fossil fuel extraction and shows that natural gas has around double the cost of that associated with propane, coal and naphtha."
          [40] "Finally, the cost to human health was estimated in terms of disability-adjusted life years, and naphtha cracking and propane dehydrogenation came out favourably compared to the MTO processes."
          [41] "Based on these metrics, it is clear that MTO from coal or natural gas has a larger environmental burden than SC or dehydrogenation."
          [42] "Opportunities for improving the sustainability of the dehydrogenation process were recently highlighted by Agarwal et al. who investigated various intensification and integration strategies."
          [43] "It was shown that such strategies, which involved additional waste heat recovery and off-gas recycling, up to 70% reductions in CO2 emissions were possible."
          [44] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
          [45] "Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane."
          [46] "Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum and the propane production industry has responded accordingly."
          [47] "The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale."
          [48] "TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year."
          [49] "Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year."
          [50] "The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation."
          [51] "While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity."
          [52] "Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel16 as well as glycerol17 and other substrates.18"
          [53] "With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this."
          [54] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
          [55] "However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield."
          [56] "These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review."
          [57] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
          [1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades."
          [2] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."
          [3] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based."
          [4] "However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene."
          [6] "While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component."
          [7] "These catalysts are amongst the most active and selective reported to date for this reaction."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2."
          [9] "Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."
          [10] "Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application."
          [11] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
          [12] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."
          [13] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
          [14] "Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority."
          [15] "With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate."

          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its high spacetime yield, which is commonly reported over the most active catalysts that are typically Pt or Cr based. This technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH can use renewable green propane as a feedstock, which is gaining traction as a sustainable alternative to non-renewable sources. The technology also avoids the formation of coke, which necessitates multi-reactor cycling for regeneration in non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene. A promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years, which use boron as the active component and are among the most active and selective reported to date for this reaction. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilizing CO2. However, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts. Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2. The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements. Future research should prioritize the low temperature activation of CO2. With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate.
