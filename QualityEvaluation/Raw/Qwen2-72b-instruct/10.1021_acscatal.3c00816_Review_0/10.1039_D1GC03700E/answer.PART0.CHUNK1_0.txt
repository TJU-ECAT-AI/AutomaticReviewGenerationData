1.The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology can utilize propane, a widely available feedstock, as the primary source for propylene production. This reduces the dependency on naphtha and other heavier feedstocks, which are subject to price volatility and supply constraints. PDH processes are also more energy-efficient and have a lower carbon footprint compared to traditional steam cracking methods. Additionally, PDH technology offers higher selectivity to propylene, minimizing the formation of by-products and improving overall process economics.
