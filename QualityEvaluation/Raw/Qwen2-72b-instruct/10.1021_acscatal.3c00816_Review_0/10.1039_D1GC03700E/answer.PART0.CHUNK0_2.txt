1.Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its high spacetime yield, which is commonly reported over the most active catalysts, typically Pt or Cr based. This technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Currently, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane is gaining traction. Coupled with new catalytic processes, this will provide a platform to produce green propene. PDH technology can utilize renewable feedstocks, making it more sustainable than conventional methods. In terms of process efficiency, PDH is an endothermic reaction that is equilibrium-limited at higher partial pressures of propane and lower reaction temperatures, allowing for high propene yields. However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration. Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene. A promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years, which use boron as the active component. These catalysts are among the most active and selective reported to date for this reaction. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilizing CO2. However, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts. Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application. The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed, and it is identified that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.

1.直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为最活跃的催化剂（通常是Pt或Cr基）通常报告的高时空产率。这项技术解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。目前，丙烷的来源主要是不可再生的，但生产可再生绿色丙烷的技术正在获得关注。与新的催化过程相结合，这将为生产绿色丙烯提供一个平台。PDH技术可以利用可再生原料，使其比传统方法更可持续。在过程效率方面，PDH是一个吸热反应，在较高丙烷分压和较低反应温度下达到平衡限制，允许高丙烯产量。然而，即使是最具选择性的催化剂也会形成焦炭，这需要多反应器循环来促进再生。使用O2的氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）不会遭受焦炭形成，但会导致过度氧化，限制丙烯的产量。近年来，一种使用硼作为活性成分的有希望的新型ODH-O2催化剂已经出现。这些催化剂是迄今为止报道的此类反应中最活跃和最具选择性的。使用CO2作为软氧化剂（ODH-CO2）也引起了人们的兴趣，因为利用CO2具有环境优势。然而，这些催化剂报告的丙烯产量比最活跃的DDH和ODH-O2催化剂低一个数量级。尽管在过去十年中取得了重大进展，但目前的ODH-CO2催化剂远未达到商业应用所需的活性水平。讨论了每种子反应的催化剂设计的具体要求，并确定了，无论脱氢方法如何，催化剂表面酸碱位点的平衡都是至关重要的。
