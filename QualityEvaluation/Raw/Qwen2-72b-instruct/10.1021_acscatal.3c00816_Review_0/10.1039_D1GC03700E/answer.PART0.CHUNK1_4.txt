1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically targets propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and can be sourced from various natural gas reserves. This reduces the dependency on crude oil, which is the primary feedstock for conventional production methods. PDH technology also offers higher process efficiency and product selectivity compared to conventional methods. The process is designed to directly convert propane to propylene in a single step, eliminating the need for intermediate steps and reducing energy consumption. Additionally, PDH technology can achieve high selectivity for propylene production, minimizing the formation of by-products and improving overall yield.
