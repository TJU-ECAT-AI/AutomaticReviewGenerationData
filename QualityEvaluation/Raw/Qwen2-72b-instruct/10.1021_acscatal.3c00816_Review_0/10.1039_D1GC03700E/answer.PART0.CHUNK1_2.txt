1.The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology can use propane, a widely available feedstock, as the primary source for propylene production, which reduces the dependency on naphtha and other oil-based feedstocks. This technology also offers higher process efficiency and product selectivity, as it can directly convert propane to propylene with minimal by-products, such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which are common in steam cracking processes. Additionally, PDH technology can operate at lower temperatures and pressures, which can lead to lower energy consumption and operating costs compared to traditional methods.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术作为最有望的丙烯生产方法，其关键优势在于能够解决传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。PDH技术可以使用丙烷作为主要的丙烯生产原料，这减少了对石脑油和其他石油基原料的依赖。这项技术还提供了更高的过程效率和产品选择性，因为它可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时最小化氢气和一氧化碳等副产品的产生，这些副产品在蒸汽裂解过程中很常见。此外，PDH技术可以在较低的温度和压力下运行，这与传统方法相比，可以导致较低的能源消耗和运营成本。
