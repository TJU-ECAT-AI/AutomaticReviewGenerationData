1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane, a widely available feedstock, as the primary source of propylene. This reduces the dependence on traditional feedstocks such as naphtha and heavy oil, which are subject to price fluctuations and supply constraints. PDH technology also offers higher process efficiency and product selectivity compared to conventional methods, resulting in lower energy consumption and higher yields of propylene. This makes PDH technology a more sustainable and economically viable option for propylene production.
