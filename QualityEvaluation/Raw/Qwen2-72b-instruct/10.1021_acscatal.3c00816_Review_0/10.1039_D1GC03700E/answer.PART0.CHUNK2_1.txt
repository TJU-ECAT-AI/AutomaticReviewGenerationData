1.The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its efficiency, selectivity, and ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability. PDH offers a more direct route to propylene, bypassing the need for heavy feedstocks and the complex processes associated with steam cracking. This results in higher yields of propylene per unit of propane, making it a more efficient process. Additionally, PDH technology can achieve high selectivity to propylene, minimizing the formation of byproducts such as coke and hydrogen. This selectivity is crucial for maintaining high product purity and reducing the need for additional purification steps. Furthermore, PDH can utilize a variety of feedstocks, including renewable propane sources, which enhances its sustainability and reduces dependency on non-renewable resources. Overall, PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional methods by offering a more efficient, selective, and sustainable approach to propylene production.
