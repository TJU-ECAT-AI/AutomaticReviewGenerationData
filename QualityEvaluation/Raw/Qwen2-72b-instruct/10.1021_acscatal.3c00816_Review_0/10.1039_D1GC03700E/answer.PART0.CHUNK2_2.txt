1.The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its efficiency, selectivity, and ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH technology can utilize a wide range of feedstocks, including renewable sources, which enhances its sustainability and reduces dependence on non-renewable resources. In terms of process efficiency, PDH can operate at lower temperatures and pressures compared to conventional methods, leading to lower energy consumption and reduced carbon emissions. Additionally, PDH catalysts have been developed to achieve high selectivity towards propylene, minimizing the formation of by-products and improving overall yield. This selectivity is crucial for meeting the growing demand for propylene while minimizing waste and maximizing resource utilization.
