[1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades."
[2] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."
[3] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based."
[4] "However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."
[5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene."
[6] "While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component."
[7] "These catalysts are amongst the most active and selective reported to date for this reaction."
[8] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2."
[9] "Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."
[10] "Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application."
[11] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
[12] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."
[13] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
[14] "Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority."
[15] "With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate."

1.Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its high spacetime yield, which is commonly reported over the most active catalysts, typically Pt or Cr based. This technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH can use renewable green propane as a feedstock, which is gaining traction as a sustainable alternative to non-renewable sources. The technology is also more efficient than conventional methods, as it does not suffer from coke formation, which necessitates multi-reactor cycling for regeneration in other processes. Additionally, PDH has the potential to produce propene with high selectivity, which is crucial for meeting the growing global demand for this chemical. However, oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) and the use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) are also being explored as alternative methods. ODH-O2 does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene. ODH-CO2 has the environmental advantage of utilizing CO2, but the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts. Future research should focus on improving the selectivity of DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2. The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also a concern, and future research should focus on using more abundant chemical elements. With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate.

1.直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为最活跃的催化剂（通常是Pt或Cr基）通常报告的高时空产率。这项技术解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。PDH可以使用可再生绿色丙烷作为原料，这作为一种可持续的替代非可再生资源正在获得关注。该技术也比传统方法更有效，因为它不会遭受焦炭形成的影响，焦炭形成在其他过程中需要多反应器循环进行再生。此外，PDH有可能以高选择性生产丙烯，这对于满足全球对这种化学品日益增长的需求至关重要。然而，正在探索使用O2的氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）和使用CO2作为软氧化剂（ODH-CO2）作为替代方法。ODH-O2不会遭受焦炭形成的影响，但会导致过度氧化，限制丙烯的产量。ODH-CO2具有利用CO2的环境优势，但这些催化剂报告的丙烯产量比最活跃的DDH和ODH-O2催化剂低一个数量级。未来的研究应集中在提高DDH和ODH-O2催化剂对丙烯的选择性，而ODH-CO2催化剂在CO2方面的固有活性较低。一些常见的催化元素的稀缺性也是一个问题，未来的研究应集中在使用更丰富的化学元素。通过进一步研究和开发基于绿色丙烷脱氢的丙烯的低能耗路线，应该有可能改变这种关键化学中间体的制造格局。
