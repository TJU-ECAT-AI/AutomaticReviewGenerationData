1.The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its efficiency, selectivity, and the ability to use a wide range of feedstocks. PDH specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more direct and selective route to propylene, reducing the need for complex separation processes and minimizing byproduct formation. This technology can operate at lower temperatures and pressures compared to steam cracking, leading to lower energy consumption and potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, PDH can utilize propane derived from various sources, including natural gas, refinery off-gases, and even renewable sources, enhancing feedstock flexibility and security of supply.
