1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its efficiency, selectivity, and the ability to use a wide range of feedstocks. PDH specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by reducing the reliance on oil-based feedstocks, improving the efficiency of the conversion process, and increasing the selectivity for propylene over other products. This makes PDH a more sustainable and economically viable option for meeting the increasing demand for propylene.
