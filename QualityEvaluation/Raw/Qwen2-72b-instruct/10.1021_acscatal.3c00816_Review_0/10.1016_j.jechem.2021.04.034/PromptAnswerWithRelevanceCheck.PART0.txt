1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, it does mention that PDH using Pt- or Cr-based catalysts represents an emerging industrial route for propylene production. The study focuses on developing alternative PDH catalysts due to the scarcity of platinum and the toxicity of chromium in current commercial PDH catalysts. The Zn@S-1 zeolite catalysts exhibit good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability, which could potentially make them suitable for industrial PDH processes.

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to non-petroleum based propylene with significant industrial relevance. PDH, employing Pt- or Cr-based catalysts, represents an emerging industrial route for propylene production. The as-prepared Zn@S-1 catalysts exhibit good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability in PDH reaction under employed conditions. The in-situ partial reduction of zinc species is observed and the partially reduced zinc cations are definitely identified as the active sites for PDH reaction.
