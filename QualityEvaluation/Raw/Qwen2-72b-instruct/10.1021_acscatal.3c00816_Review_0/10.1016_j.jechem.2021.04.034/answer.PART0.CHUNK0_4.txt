1.The literature does not provide information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, PDH using Pt- or Cr-based catalysts is noted as an emerging industrial route for propylene production. The scarcity of platinum and the toxicity of chromium are mentioned as drawbacks of current commercial PDH catalysts, which has led to interest in exploring alternative non-noble metal and environment-friendly active components for PDH catalysts.
