1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, it does mention that PDH using Pt- or Cr-based catalysts represents an emerging industrial route for propylene production. The study focuses on developing alternative PDH catalysts due to the scarcity of platinum and the toxicity of chromium in current commercial PDH catalysts. The Zn@S-1 zeolite catalysts exhibit good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability, which could potentially make them suitable for industrial PDH processes.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体优势。但是，它确实提到了使用Pt-或Cr-基催化剂的PDH代表了丙烯生产的一种新兴工业途径。研究的重点是开发替代的PDH催化剂，因为当前商业PDH催化剂中铂的稀缺性和铬的毒性。Zn@S-1沸石催化剂表现出良好的脱氢活性，高丙烯选择性和再生能力，这可能使它们适合工业PDH过程。
