1.The literature does not provide information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, PDH using Pt- or Cr-based catalysts is noted as an emerging industrial route for propylene production. The scarcity of platinum and the toxicity of chromium have led to the pursuit of alternative PDH catalysts. Zinc, an earth-abundant and non-toxic metal, has been investigated as a promising alternative for PDH catalysts.
