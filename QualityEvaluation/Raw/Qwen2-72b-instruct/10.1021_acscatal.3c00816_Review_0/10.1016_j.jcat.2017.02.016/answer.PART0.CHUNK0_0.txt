1.The literature does not provide information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, PDH is known in the industry as a promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane to propylene without the need for steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which are conventional methods that have limitations in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH can use propane, a byproduct of natural gas processing and crude oil refining, as a feedstock, which is more abundant and stable in supply compared to naphtha and heavy oil fractions used in conventional methods. PDH also offers higher propylene selectivity and lower energy consumption compared to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. Additionally, PDH can be performed in a single reactor, which simplifies the process and reduces capital and operating costs.

1.文献没有提供关于丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的挑战方面的优势的信息。然而,PDH在工业界被认为是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法,因为它能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯,而无需进行蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化,这两种传统方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面存在局限性。PDH可以使用丙烷作为原料,丙烷是天然气加工和原油精炼的副产品,与传统方法中使用的石脑油和重油相比,丙烷的供应更加丰富和稳定。PDH还提供了比蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化更高的丙烯选择性和更低的能耗。此外,PDH可以在一个反应器中进行,这简化了过程,降低了资本和运营成本。
