1.The literature does not provide information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, PDH is known in the industry as a promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane to propylene without the need for steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which are feedstock-intensive and less efficient. PDH offers higher product selectivity and process efficiency, making it a viable alternative to conventional methods, especially in regions with abundant propane supply.

1.文献没有提供有关丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的挑战方面的优势的信息。然而，在工业界，PDH被认为是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，因为它能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需进行蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解，这两种方法对原料的依赖性大，效率较低。PDH提供了更高的产品选择性和过程效率，使其成为传统方法的可行替代方案，特别是在丙烷供应丰富的地区。
