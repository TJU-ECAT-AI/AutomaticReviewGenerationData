1.The literature does not provide information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, PDH is known in the industry as a promising method for propylene production due to its ability to use propane as a feedstock, which is widely available. PDH processes are also designed to be more energy-efficient and have higher product selectivity compared to traditional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which rely on heavier hydrocarbon feedstocks and produce a wider range of products. PDH technology specifically targets the conversion of propane to propylene, which can lead to higher yields of the desired product and potentially lower operating costs.

1.文献没有提供关于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的挑战方面的优势信息。然而，在工业界，PDH被认为是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，因为它能够使用广泛可用的丙烷作为原料。PDH工艺设计上比传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解方法更节能，产品选择性更高，后者依赖于更重的烃类原料，产生更广泛的产品。PDH技术特别针对丙烷到丙烯的转化，这可能导致所需产品产量更高，潜在运营成本更低。
