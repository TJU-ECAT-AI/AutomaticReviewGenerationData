1.The literature does not provide information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, PDH is known in the industry as a promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane to propylene without the need for steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which are feedstock-intensive and less selective. PDH offers higher process efficiency and product selectivity, making it a more sustainable and cost-effective option for propylene production.

1.文献没有提供关于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的挑战方面的优势的信息。然而，在工业界，PDH被认为是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，因为它能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需进行蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解，这两种方法对原料的依赖性大，选择性较低。PDH提供了更高的过程效率和产品选择性，使其成为丙烯生产中更可持续和成本效益更高的选择。
