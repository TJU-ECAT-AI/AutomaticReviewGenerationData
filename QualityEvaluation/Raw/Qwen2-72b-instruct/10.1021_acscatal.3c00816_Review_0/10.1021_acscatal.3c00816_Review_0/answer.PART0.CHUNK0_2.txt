1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, the massive extraction of shale gas provides a cheap and abundant feedstock for PDH, addressing the issue of feedstock availability. Secondly, PDH effectively inhibits undesired overoxidation, which is a common problem in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. Lastly, PDH offers high propylene selectivity, distinguishing it from the mixed product profiles typical of methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO) processes. These advantages make PDH a highly efficient and selective method for propylene production, surpassing the limitations of conventional production methods.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它具有几个关键优势。首先，大规模开采页岩气为PDH提供了廉价且丰富的原料，解决了原料供应的问题。其次，PDH有效地抑制了氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中常见的不希望发生的过度氧化。最后，PDH具有高丙烯选择性，这与甲醇制烯烃（MTO）和费托合成制烯烃（FTO）过程中的混合产品特性不同。这些优势使PDH成为一种高效且选择性高的丙烯生产方法，超越了传统生产方法的局限性。
