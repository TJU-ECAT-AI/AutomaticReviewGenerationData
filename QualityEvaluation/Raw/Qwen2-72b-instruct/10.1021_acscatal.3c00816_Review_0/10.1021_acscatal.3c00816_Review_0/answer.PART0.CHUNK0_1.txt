1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, the large-scale extraction of shale gas provides an abundant and cost-effective propane feedstock for PDH processes. Secondly, PDH effectively avoids the overoxidation issues encountered in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), leading to higher process efficiency. Lastly, PDH offers high selectivity for propylene production, distinguishing it from the mixed product streams typical of methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO) processes. These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods, including feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它具有几个关键优势。首先，大规模开采页岩气为PDH工艺提供了丰富且成本低廉的丙烷原料。其次，PDH有效地避免了氧化脱氢（ODH）中遇到的过度氧化问题，从而提高了工艺效率。最后，PDH具有高丙烯选择性，这使其与甲醇制烯烃（MTO）和费托合成制烯烃（FTO）过程中典型的混合产品流区分开来。这些优势解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战，包括原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性。
