1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. Firstly, the massive extraction of shale gas provides an abundant and inexpensive propane feedstock for the PDH process. Secondly, PDH can effectively inhibit the undesired overoxidation that occurs in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), leading to higher efficiency. Lastly, PDH is a proprietary technology that offers high propylene selectivity, distinguishing it from the hybrid products produced by methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO) processes.

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, the large-scale extraction of shale gas provides an abundant and cost-effective propane feedstock for PDH processes. Secondly, PDH effectively avoids the overoxidation issues encountered in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), leading to higher process efficiency. Lastly, PDH offers high selectivity for propylene production, distinguishing it from the mixed product streams typical of methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO) processes. These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods, including feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.
