1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. Firstly, the massive extraction of shale gas provides an abundant and inexpensive propane feedstock for the PDH process. Secondly, PDH can effectively inhibit the undesired overoxidation that occurs in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), leading to higher efficiency. Lastly, PDH is a proprietary technology that offers high propylene selectivity, distinguishing it from the hybrid products produced by methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO) processes.
