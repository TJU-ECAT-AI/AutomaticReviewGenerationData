1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. Firstly, the massive extraction of shale gas provides a cheap and abundant feedstock for PDH. Secondly, PDH can inhibit the undesired overoxidation that occurs in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), leading to higher efficiency. Lastly, PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, distinguishing it from the hybrid products in methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO) processes.
