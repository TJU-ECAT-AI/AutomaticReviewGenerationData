          [1] "The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, the massive extraction of shale gas provides a cheap and abundant feedstock for PDH, addressing the issue of feedstock availability. Secondly, PDH effectively inhibits the undesired overoxidation that occurs in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), enhancing process efficiency. Lastly, PDH offers high propylene selectivity, distinguishing it from the hybrid products obtained from methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO) processes, thereby improving product selectivity.

          丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它具有几个关键优势。首先，大规模开采页岩气为PDH提供了廉价且丰富的原料，解决了原料供应问题。其次，PDH有效地抑制了氧化脱氢(ODH)中不希望发生的过度氧化，提高了过程效率。最后，PDH具有高丙烯选择性，与从甲醇制烯烃(MTO)和费托合成制烯烃(FTO)过程中获得的混合产品区分开来，从而提高了产品选择性。
