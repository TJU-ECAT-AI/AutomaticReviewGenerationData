1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH technologies, such as the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr. The literature focuses on the investigation of indium-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, highlighting their potential for high stability and selectivity.

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does mention that the increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in PDH technologies. PDH technologies, such as the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr. The literature focuses on the investigation of In-based catalysts for PDH, highlighting the stability and selectivity of In-CHA as a promising catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.
