1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH technologies, such as the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr. The literature also notes that many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, Fe-, V-, Zr-based materials, and nanocarbon catalysts, indicating ongoing efforts to improve PDH technology.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是，它确实提到PDH技术，如使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺和使用支持PtSn催化剂的Oleflex工艺，存在一些缺点，如Pt成本高、失活快以及Cr可能造成的环境影响。文献还指出，已经研究了许多其他PDH催化剂，包括镓、锌、钴、铁、钒、锆基材料和纳米碳催化剂，这表明了持续改进PDH技术的努力。
