1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does mention that the increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in PDH technologies. PDH technologies, such as the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr. The literature focuses on the investigation of In-based catalysts for PDH, highlighting the stability and selectivity of In-CHA as a promising catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是，它确实提到，全球对丙烯的需求不断增加，以及从页岩气中提取的丙烷成本目前较低，这重新激发了人们对PDH技术的兴趣。PDH技术，如使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺和使用支撑PtSn催化剂的Oleflex工艺，存在缺点，如Pt成本高、失活速度快以及Cr可能造成的环境影响。文献重点研究了In基催化剂用于PDH，强调了In-CHA作为丙烷脱氢有前景的催化剂的稳定性和选择性。
