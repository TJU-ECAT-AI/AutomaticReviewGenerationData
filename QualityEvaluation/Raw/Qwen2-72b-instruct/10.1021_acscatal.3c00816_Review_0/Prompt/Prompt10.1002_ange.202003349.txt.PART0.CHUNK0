Subnanometer Bimetallic PlatinumZinc Clusters in Zeolites for Propane Dehydrogenation Abstract Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has great potential to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, but the widely used Pt-based catalysts usually suffer from short-term stability and unsatisfactory propylene selectivity. Herein, we develop a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method for encapsulating subnanometer bimetallic PtZn clusters inside silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite. The introduction of Zn species significantly improved the stability of the Pt clusters and gave a superhigh propylene selectivity of 99.3% with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1 and specific activity of propylene formation of 65.5mol gPt1h1 (WHSV=108h1) at 550C. Moreover, no obvious deactivation was observed over PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1), affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.001h1, which is 200times lower than that of the PtZn4/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions. We also show that the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability of catalysts, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four continuous cycles.
Introduction Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks in the global economy and is crucial to the production of various valuable chemicals, commodities, and fuels. Giving the scarcity of fossil fuels and the discovery of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is becoming popular and is regarded as a promising way to meet the ever-increasing demand for propylene across the globe.1 Supported Pt-based catalysts are widely used in industrial PDH processes.2 Despite high initial propylene yields, Pt-based catalysts often encounter problems in the term of fast deactivation and poor propylene selectivity. The size of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) is a key factor affecting PDH conversion; a decreased size is favorable for exposing more accessible active sites on MNPs and thus improves the conversion of propane.2c, 3 Al2O3 is the most commonly used substrate for supporting Pt species, and state-of-the-art Al2O3-supported Pt-based catalysts have been applied in industrial processes.4 The PDH reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, so high reaction temperature (>500C) is essential to achieve a high propane conversion. However, the small Pt species are subjected to severe sintering during the process of PDH conversions at high temperatures due to the considerable increase in surface free energy at smaller sizes and the lack of the confinement effect of supports or/and strong metal-support interactions. Exploring better supports to stabilize Pt species is of great significance yet remains a nontrivial target for PDH industry.
Zeolites with ordered microporous structures and outstanding thermal stability are regarded as ideal supports for anchoring small MNPs.2c, 3, 5 However, supporting metal species on zeolites by using conventional impregnation methods usually generates large metal particles with poor dispersion. Iglesia and co-workers employed a ligand-stabilized method to confine various types of small MNPs (12nm) within aluminosilicate zeolites, and the resulting materials showed excellent resistance to sintering.5b, 6 However, for the PDH reaction, introducing Al into zeolites has a negative effect on the selectivity of propylene due to the resultant undesirable Brnsted acidity.7 Corma and co-workers prepared subnanometer Pt clusters within a purely siliceous MWW zeolite via the transformation of different-dimensional zeolites.2c Pt/MWW catalysts exhibited good shape-selective alkene hydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation performance but suffered from severe Pt leaching at high temperatures. Recently, we encapsulated ultra-small Pd and Pd-Ni(OH)2 clusters within pure silica zeolites under direct hydrothermal conditions followed by calcination and reduction processes, and demonstrated that the synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts can significantly enhance the hydrogen generation rates from formic acid decomposition. Moreover, the resultant catalysts exhibited excellent stabilities after calcination in various industrial oxidation-reduction conditions at 600 to 700C since the bimetallic hybrid clusters were well-confined within the zeolite channels.5g, 5h The design of supported bimetallic catalysts by alloying Pt with various metallic elements, such as Sn,8 Ga,2d, 4c, 9 Cu,2b Fe,2f and Zn,2g, 2h is also considered an effective strategy to enhance the stability of Pt species and propylene selectivity in PDH conversions, but the stability and catalytic efficiency of these catalysts remain to be improved. Recently, several silica-supported Pt-Zn alloy catalysts were investigated for the dehydrogenation of ethane and n-butane, showing enhanced catalytic activity and the selectivity of corresponding alkene as compared with monometallic Pt catalysts.10 However, these catalysts possessed larger sizes of MNPs and suffered from the sintering of MNPs during the reaction and/or regeneration process, which restricted their practical application. Until now, supported PtZn catalysts with excellent catalytic performance and stability have been rarely reported for PDH conversions.
Herein we develop a ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method for encaging subnanometer PtZn clusters into silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) subject to direct hydrothermal crystallization; such an approach could effectively prevent from sintering of metal nanoclusters during the conventional calcination-reduction process, thus producing subnanometer metal clusters. The resulting PtZn@S-1 catalysts are superefficient for PDH conversions. The introduction of Zn species could remarkably enhance the stability of the subnanometer Pt clusters, and the PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited extremely high propylene selectivity (99.3%) with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1 and specific activity of propylene formation (up to 65.5mol gPt1h1, WHSV=108h1) at 550C, and 40.4% propane conversion was retained even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1) without co-feeding H2. In contrast, the propane conversion over mono-metallic Pt@S-1-H and Pt@S-1-C (treated by conventional calcination/reduction process) sharply declined to 19.8% and 2% within 2900 and 340min on stream, respectively. Significantly, the deactivation constant of PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst was as low as 0.001h1, which was 200 times lower than that of Pt-Zn/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions. The PtZn@zeolite catalysts demonstrate the best performances for PDH conversion, which are superior to the state-of-the-art supported Pt-based catalysts.2b-2d, 2f, 3 Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability, and the catalytic activity of the catalyst kept unchanged after four continuous cycles.
Results and Discussion As shown in Figure1a, nanosized S-1 zeolites encapsulating PtZn species were prepared insitu in gel systems with molar compositions of TEOS (tetraethoxysilane):TPAOH:H2O: a[Pt(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2:b[Zn(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](OAc)2=1:0.4:35:a:b (a=2.25×103, a/b=1/0, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and 0/4) under hydrothermal conditions at 170C for 3days. Solid 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy measurements and thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis confirmed that the metal-ethylenediamine complexes maintained integrity inside the zeolites (FiguresS1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). Next, the as-synthesized nanosized samples were treated in two different ways: one was via calcination in air at 550C followed by reduction under H2 at 400C (these samples are identified as PtZnx@S-1-C, where x represents the molar ratio of Zn/Pt in the synthesis gel); another approach involved direct reduction in pure H2 at 400C (identified as PtZnx@S-1-H). For comparison, a Pt/S-1-im sample was prepared with the incipient wetness impregnation method. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements reveal that all obtained samples possess the MFI-type framework structure (FigureS3). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Cs-corrected scanning TEM-high-angle annular dark-field (STEM-HAADF) images of the samples are shown in Figure1bj, FigureS4. For the Pt@S-1-H and PtZnx@S-1-H samples, metal nanoclusters are uniformly observed inner part of S-1 crystals (ca. 200nm), but none is observed at outer-shell and all nanoclusters are located within the intersectional channels between the straight and sinusoidal 10-ring channels of MFI. In contrast, the sizes of metal species in the Pt@S-1-C samples are considerably larger, showing an average MNP size of 3.1nm, but are still much smaller than that of Pt/S-1-im (6.4nm). Cs-corrected STEM-annular bright-field (ABF) images of PtZn4@S-1-H confirm that the MFI-type framework structure is perfectly retained after metal loading (Figure1k). High-resolution Cs-corrected STEM-HAADF images of the PtZn4@S-1-H sample further confirm that the Pt nanoclusters are encaged around the 5- and 6-membered rings (MRs) of zeolites (Figures1lm). The Pt@S-1 catalyst was also calcinated at 300500C in air before the reduction in H2 at 400C. STEM images reveal that the particle sizes of Pt species increase successively from 1.4 to 2.7nm with the increase of calcination temperatures in air (FigureS5). This indicates that the low calcination process in air favored the formation of small Pt clusters. Compared with the conventional incipient wetness impregnation method and calcination-reduction process, apparently, the ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method can significantly lead to smaller metal species. Pt species are prone to sintering at high temperatures, especially in an oxidizing atmosphere;11 hence, avoiding the conventional calcination process and employing direct reduction method can effectively inhibit the aggregation of Pt species. In addition, during the direct H2 reduction process, the organic ligands and templates can act as metal protective agents that are gradually decomposed along with the reduction of metal species. Most significantly, the direct reduction method also makes reduction steps more convenient and energy-effective.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals some large Pt particles located outside of the zeolite crystals in Pt@S-1-C and Pt/S-1-im, but such large particles are indiscernible in the cases of Pt@S-1-H and PtZn4@S-1-H (FigureS6). The element distributions and chemical composition of a representative PtZn4@S-1-H sample were determined by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectral mapping. As shown in Figure1n, Pt and Zn are distributed homogeneously throughout the zeolite and located at almost the same position, indicating the establishment of a bimetallic system. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis reveals that all the Pt-containing samples possess a similar Pt loading of 0.770.72wt.%, and the mole ratios of Pt/Zn of PtZnx@S-1-H are 1/1.1, 1/1.9, 1/2.9, and 1/4.2 for x=1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, in accordance with the preset ratios and EDX analysis (TableS1 and FigureS7). Based on raw materials in the synthesis gels, the product yields of all zeolite samples are more than 95%, and almost all of Pt species are encapsulated inside the zeolites. N2 adsorption-desorption analyses show a slight decrease in microporous volume (ca. 0.015cm3g1) due to the partially occupied metal species in some void spaces of the zeolites, but sufficient microporous volumes (>0.09cm3g1) and areas (>229m2g1) are observed in metal-containing samples (FigureS8 and TableS1). 29Si and 1H-29Si CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy analyses reveal that the zeolite framework remains intact after the introduction of metal species and that the metal species replace the H atoms of Si-OH groups and are anchored on the defect sites of the zeolites (FigureS9). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses reveal peaks at 74.7eV and 71.3eV, attributed to Pt4f5/2 and Pt4f7/2 of Pt0, in the Pt/S-1-im sample,12 but no XPS signals of Pt and Zn species can be detected in Pt@S-1-H, PtZn2@S-1-H, and PtZn4@S-1-H, further indicating that metal clusters are confined within the zeolite crystals (FigureS10). To further demonstrate that all metal species are confined within the zeolite matrix rather than on the outer surface of crystals, shape-selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and 4-nitro-o-xylene reactions were performed by using the ammonia borane as a reductant at room temperature over Pt@S-1-H and commercial Pt/C catalysts. Both Pt@S-1-H and Pt/C catalyst exhibited 100% conversion for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline. However, different with the Pt/C catalyst showing a 100% conversion for the reduction of 4-nitro-o-xylene, the Pt@S-1-H catalyst exhibited no activity for the conversion of 4-nitro-o-xylene; this is because the molecular size of 4-nitro-o-xylene is larger than that of microporous channels of S-1 zeolites, and thus the molecules cannot enter into zeolite crystals and contact with Pt clusters (FigureS11). The above results further prove that the Pt clusters are completely encaged within the zeolite crystals rather than supported on the crystal surfaces of zeolites.
To obtain detailed structural information about the metal species in zeolites, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the as-prepared samples were measured (Figure2 and FigureS12, TableS2). The Pt L3-edge XANES spectrum of Pt@S-1-C is quite similar to that of Pt foil and the average coordination number (CN) of PtPt bonds is 10.90.8 based on EXAFS analysis, indicating the zero-valence metal state and larger size of Pt nanoparticles (NPs). In contrast, the Pt L3-edge XANES spectra of Pt@S-1-H, PtZn2@S-1-H, and PtZn4@S-1-H showed an increased oxidation state for these Pt atoms, and in the Pt L3-edge EXAFS, the average CN of Pt-O (peak at ca. 2.02Å) of PtZn4@S-1-H, PtZn2@S-1-H, and Pt@S-1-H are 3.93.3. The above results can be attributed to the fact that the small Pt clusters tend to be oxidized in air and/or be stabilized by bonding with oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework.5c, 13 Note that the average CNs of Pt-Pt bonds in Pt@S-1-H, PtZn2@S-1-H, and PtZn4@S-1-H are only 1.52.1, which reveals that the Pt species predominantly consist of atomically dispersed Pt along with a small number of ultrafine nanoclusters, with an average of only three Pt atoms in each nanocluster (regular triangle Pt3 structure, CN=2). The Zn K-edge XANES energies of PtZn2@S-1-H and PtZn4@S-1-H resemble that of reference ZnO, suggesting that the Zn species consist of Zn2+ ions. Only a significant peak at around 1.95Å, attributed to Zn-O with a CN of approximately 3.0 at the Zn K-edge, can be observed in PtZn2@S-1-H and PtZn4@S-1-H. No peaks at 2.66 and 3.32Å, corresponding to Zn-Zn bonds in Zn foil and ZnO, can be observed in PtZn2@S-1-H and PtZn4@S-1-H, respectively; above results reveal that the Zn species in the PtZnx@S-1-H are single-site Zn2+ ions connected with Pt and Si atoms in the zeolite frameworks via three bridging Oatoms. It should be pointed out that the XANES and EXAFS spectra of the as-prepared samples were measured under atmosphere conditions; the subnanometer metal species in the samples might be partially oxidized in air, which could not reflect the nature of the catalytic active sites of catalysts under PDH reaction conditions (550C under reduction atmosphere). To further identify the structure and electronic state of metal species in the samples under reduction atmosphere, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements were performed. The samples were first pre-reduced in H2 at 300C for 1h and then the temperature was decreased to room temperature. Finally, the CO gas was in situ pumped into the reaction cell and the DRIFTS spectra were recorded over the samples. As shown in Figure2e, the peak at 2086cm1 can be observed in Pt/S-1-im, which is attributed to the linear-adsorbed CO on terrace Pt sites.14 In contrast, the peak at 2071cm1 ascribed to linearly bonded CO on unsaturated Pt sites was observed in Pt@S-1-C and this peak further shifted to a lower wavenumber of 2064cm1 in Pt@S-1-H. It indicated that the particle sizes of Pt species decreased in the order of Pt/S-1-im, Pt@S-1-C, and Pt@S-1-H, in accordance with the observation of TEM images and EXAFS results.15 Moreover, compared with the Pt@S-1-H, all PtZnx@S-1-H samples exhibited obvious red-shifts to lower wavenumbers. Considering the similar Pt sizes of Pt@S-1 and PtZnx@S-1-H, the decrease of CO stretching frequency suggests the formation of Pt-Zn alloys resulting in a higher surface electron density of Pt clusters in PtZnx@S-1-H.2g In addition, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements can also provide evidence for the formation of Pt-Zn alloy structure in PtZn4@S-1-H. As shown in FigureS13, the hydrogen consumption profile of Zn4@S-1-H is almost the same as that of pure S-1, indicating the Zn2+ ions anchoring on zeolite frameworks keep stable during the reduction process until 750C. In contrast, although the PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst possessed relatively lower metal contents, a more obvious peak at 300450C attributed to the reduction of Zn species can be observed in PtZn4@S-1-H, which indicates that the Pt species are conducive to the reduction of Zn and some Pt-Zn alloy structure can be formed during the reduction process.16 Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a)Pt L3-edge XANES spectra of Pt@S-1-C, Pt@S-1-H, PtZn2@S-1-H, and PtZn4@S-1-H samples. b)Zn K-edge XANES spectra of PtZn2@S-1-H and PtZn4@S-1-H samples. c)The Fourier transform of k3-weighted EXAFS spectra of Pt@S-1-C, Pt@S-1-H, PtZn2@S-1-H, and PtZn4@S-1-H samples at Pt L3-edge. d)The Fourier transform of k3-weighted EXAFS spectra of PtZn2@S-1-H and PtZn4@S-1-H samples at Zn K-edge. e)Insitu CO-DRIFTS spectra of various samples.
The high-temperature stability of a representative sample PtZn4@S-1-H was also investigated. The sizes of bimetallic species remained unchanged after calcination at 700C under H2 and N2 atmosphere (FigureS14). After steam aging treatment under a water vapor flow of 3 and 18mLmin1 at 600C for 5h, the average metal sizes only increased to 1.8 and 2.8nm, respectively (FiguresS15,16). Moreover, even after five consecutive oxidation-reduction cycles at 550 and 650C, more than 60% of the metal particles remained less than 4nm in size (FiguresS17,S18). In contrast, the MNPs of Pt/S-1-im aggregated dramatically, reaching a size of 19.5nm, and the large Pt NPs were completely located outside of the zeolite crystals after only three oxidation-reduction cycles at 550C (FigureS19). Significantly, the crystallinity of the zeolites and the Pt loading amount remained unchanged after treatment at high temperatures (FigureS20).
The catalytic performances of various catalysts for PDH conversion were investigated at 550C with a WHSV of 3.6h1 without co-feeding H2. As shown in Figure3a,b, FigureS21, and Table1, a high initial propylene yield (42.7%) was achieved over Pt@S-1-H; this value was much higher than that of Pt@S-1-C (29.4%) and Pt/S-1-im (22.7%). After 1200min on stream, the propane conversion of Pt@S-1-H decreased to 34.2% with 95.4% of selectivity for propylene. In contrast, the propane conversion over Pt@S-1-C and Pt/S-1-im dropped rapidly to 2% within 340min and 160min on stream, respectively. Compared with Pt@S-1-C and Pt/S-1-im, the enhanced catalytic activity of Pt@S-1-H can be attributed to the remarkably reduced Pt size and greater numbers of available active sites for propane conversion. Significantly, the introduction of Zn species coupled with subnanometer Pt clusters remarkably improved the propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. The initial propylene selectivity was improved with increasing Zn content due to the formation of more bimetallic Pt-Zn alloys, and the initial propylene selectivity of PtZn4@S-1-H reached 93.2%, much higher than that of Pt@S-1-H (79.0%). The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst retained high propane conversion (44.8%) and high propylene selectivity (98.9%) after 1200min on stream. To further illustrate the influence of the Zn content in PtZn@S-1-H sample on catalytic performance, PtZn8@S-1-H with a Zn/Pt ratio of 7.56 (determined by ICP measurement) was prepared and the TEM images of PtZn8@S-1-H are shown in FigureS22. Catalytic test revealed that as compared PtZn4@S-1-H, the PtZn8@S-1-H possessed higher initial propylene selectivity up to 97.7% at 550C with a WHSV of 3.6h1 (FigureS23). After 1200min on stream, the propylene selectivity of PtZn8@S-1-H increased to 99.2%, but the propylene yield was 2% lower than that of PtZn4@S-1-H, which was attributed to the excessive Zn may partially cover the active Pt surface, resulting in a negative effect on the interaction between the propane and the active Pt sites and reduced the reactivity. Moreover, PDH conversion was also tested over PtZn4@S-1-H at 550C under different WHSVs (Figures3c and S24). With an increase in WHSV from 3.6 to 108h1, the initial propane conversions decreased from 47.4% to 21.2%, but the initial propylene selectivity increased from 93.2% to 98.3%. The specific activity of propylene formation under a high WHSV of 108h1 reached 65.5mol gPt1h1; such value represented the highest catalytic activity for propylene generation from PDH conversion and is much better than those of all reported state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts (see TableS3).2b-2d, 2f, 3 Strikingly, after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1), the propane conversion remained at 40.4% with 99.2% selectivity for propylene, affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.001h1 (Figures3d and S25). In contrast, the propane conversion over Pt@S-1-H sharply decreased to 19.8% after 2900min on stream. Moreover, under high WHSV of 27h1, a propane conversion of 21.8% with 99.3% selectivity for propylene over PtZn4@S-1-H was achieved after 6300min on stream (FiguresS26 and S27). Furthermore, PDH conversion was also performed at 600C (WHSV=3.6h1). The propane conversion of Pt@S-1-H sharply decreased from 80.3% to 9.0% within 400min on stream, while two-thirds of the initial propane conversion over PtZn4@S-1-H (up to 43.2%) with a propylene selectivity of 95.5% was retained even after 3500min on stream (FiguresS28S30). All of the above results demonstrate that bimetallic PtZn4@S-1-H possesses extremely high long-term stability, far superior to that of monometallic Pt@S-1-H. Industrially, the Al2O3 has been used to support Pt species for the PDH conversions. For comparison, the Pt/Al2O3 and PtZn4/Al2O3 catalysts with the same metal loadings as Pt@S-1-H and PtZn4@S-1-H, respectively, were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method and then reduce in H2 at 400C. High-resolution STEM measurements revealed that the Pt and PtZn NPs are dispersed onto the Al2O3 supports, giving average particle sizes of 2.8 and 2.6nm, respectively (FigureS31). The catalytic performances of Pt/Al2O3 and PtZn4/Al2O3 for PDH conversions were also investigated at 550C with a WHSV of 3.6h1 (FigureS3234). The initial propane conversion over Pt/Al2O3 was only 15.8%, and it decreased to 3.5% with a low propylene selectivity of 67.9% after 400min on stream. In contrast, PtZn4/Al2O3 exhibited enhanced catalytic performance and the highest propylene selectivity can reach up to 97.6%, but this value remained about 2% lower than that of PtZn4@S-1-H. Note that the propane conversion over PtZn4/Al2O3 decreased remarkably from 32.3% to 8.8% within 400min on stream, giving a deactivation constant of 0.2h1, which indicated that the deactivation rate of PtZn4/Al2O3 is 200times faster than that of PtZn4@S-1-H under the same condition. TG-DTA analyses demonstrated that after 400min on stream, the weight losses of coke deposition over spent Pt/Al2O3 and PtZn4/Al2O3 were 7.2% and 6.6%, respectively, which were much higher than those of Pt@S-1-H (2.5%) and PtZn4@S-1-H (1.5%) even after 1200min on stream (FigureS35). The above results indicate that encaging metal species inside the zeolites can significantly inhibit the generation of coke deposits and prolong the lifetime of catalysts.

Temperature-programmed desorption/mass spectrometry (TPD/MS) analysis of propane indicated that the introduction of Zn species can enhance the adsorption of propane (FigureS36), which may benefit the dehydrogenation reaction on Pt nanoclusters. Notably, the EXAFS and XANES results reveal that the average CN of PtPt bonds is 2.1 after 1200min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1), indicating no obvious aggregation of Pt nanoclusters (FiguresS37 and S38, TableS2). In contrast, the average CN of PtPt bonds in spent Pt@S-1-H (1200min, WHSV=3.6h1) increased to 6.6. Note that the Pt-Zn bond with a CN of 0.6 can be observed in spent PtZn4@S-1-H sample after 1200min on stream, indicating the formation of more Pt-Zn alloys during the reactions. Similar to previous works, the generation of PtZn alloys will lead to an electron-enrich Pt surfaces, which benefit for the desorption of olefin and suppress the formation and polymerization of unsaturated coke precursors on the metal and enhance the selectivity and stability of dehydrogenation.2g, 10a Significantly, the average CNs of PtPt bonds of spent PtZn4@S-1-H were only increased to 6.0 and 7.4 even after 6300min (WHSV=27h1) and 13000min (WHSV=3.6h1) on stream, respectively; these values are comparable with that of spent Pt@S-1-H after 1200min on stream (FiguresS3739). These results reveal that the introduction of Zn species can remarkably improve the stability of Pt nanoclusters and suppress their aggregation during PDH conversion. Moreover, the CNs of the Pt-Zn bond further increased to 1.0 after 13000min on stream, indicating that more PtZn alloys were generated gradually as the reaction proceeded. Notably, the ZnZn and Zn-O-Zn peaks could not be observed in EXAFS for the spent catalyst and the CN of PtZn bond is lower than that of PtPt bond, indicating that the Zn atoms are most likely located on the outer surface of on Pt core.
High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) measurements demonstrated that the sizes of the metal species of all spent PtZnx@S-1-H catalysts increased slightly compared with those of the fresh counterparts but were still less than 1.5nm during 120013000min on stream (FiguresS4043). Cs-corrected STEM measurements of PtZn4@S-1-H revealed that most of the Pt species remained in the form of subnanometer Pt clusters even after 13000min on stream, although a fraction of larger Pt clusters (ca. 1.5nm in size) due to the aggregation of smaller Pt nanoclusters were also observed (FigureS44). After PDH reactions, the crystallinity of the zeolite remained unchanged (FigureS45). The coke content of spent PtZn4@S-1-H reached 14.4% after 13000min on stream; however, a microporous volume decrease of less than 10% was observed for spent PtZn4@S-1-H (FigureS46 and TableS4). TEM images showed that most of the cokes were located on the outer surfaces of the zeolites (FiguresS42 and S43). Based on the above results, the gradual decrease in propane conversion during the reaction over PtZn4@S-1-H can be mainly attributed to the increased size of Pt nanoclusters and the formation of cokes that may partially block paths to the active sites.
The regeneration activity of PtZn4@S-1-H catalysts was also examined. The PtZn4@S-1-H was first treated with air flow (10mLmin1) at 550C for 1h followed by a reduction process under an H2 flow. After two regeneration cycles, approximately 72% of an initial propane conversion can be kept while maintaining high propylene selectivity (99.4%) (FiguresS47 and S48). The decline of catalytic activity after regeneration can be mainly attributed to the increase in metal particle sizes. After two regeneration cycles, the average metal particle size increased to 3.9nm and some metal species migrated to the outer surface of zeolites during the regeneration process (FigureS49). To meet the demand for practical application, it is necessary to further improve the regeneration stability of catalysts. Significantly, we for the first time found that the introduction of Cs+ ions can remarkably enhance the regeneration stability of PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst. The Cs+ ions (1.5wt.%) were introduced inside the PtZn4@S-1-H catalysts via the incipient wetness impregnation method. Elemental mapping measurements indicated that the Cs+ ions were successfully introduced into the catalysts and evenly distributed inside the entire zeolite crystals (FigureS50). Strikingly, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of PtZn4@S-1-H-Cs catalyst remained unchanged as compared with the initial run even after four successive regeneration cycles (Figure4a). Cs-corrected STEM measurement revealed that large metal NPs can be rarely observed on the outer surface of zeolite and almost all of the metal species are with a subnanometric scale and encapsulated inside zeolites after two successive regeneration cycles (Figures4be). Only a fraction of large metal NPs can be detected in spent PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst after four successive regeneration cycles, but most of the subnanometer metal clusters are still encaged around the 5- and 6-MRs of zeolites (Figures4fi). Elemental mapping measurement indicated that the Pt, Zn, and Cs elements were distributed homogeneously throughout the zeolite crystals in spent after PtZn4@S-1-H-Cs catalyst after four successive regeneration cycles (FigureS51). ICP measurements demonstrated that the loading amounts of Pt and Zn kept unchanged after four successive regeneration cycles. These results indicated that the introduction of Cs+ ions located inside the zeolite channels can effectively inhibit metal migrations to the outer surface of zeolite crystals, avoid the severe aggregation of metal species due to the loss of confinement effect of zeolites, and improve the regeneration stability of catalysts. In contrast, the metal NPs of Pt/Al2O3 and PtZn4/Al2O3 increased dramatically to 9.5 and 11.6nm after four regeneration cycles (FiguresS52 and 53), further indicating the excellent regeneration stability of PtZn4@S-1-H-Cs.

After the completion of the initial run, the catalyst was calcinated in air (10mLmin1) with linear heating to 550C over 1h and holding at that temperature for 1h, and then the temperature was decreased to 200C under N2 atmosphere. The catalyst was then reduced in H2 (10mLmin1) with linear heating to 550C over 1h and holding at that temperature for 1h then finally fed with propane to start the PDH conversion. b)e)Cs-corrected STEM images of spent PtZn4@S-1-H-Cs catalyst after two successive regeneration cycles. f)i)Cs-corrected STEM images of spent PtZn4@S-1-H-Cs catalyst after four successive regeneration cycles.
Conclusion In summary, we developed a facile ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method for encaging subnanometer and even atomically dispersed bimetallic PtZn species into silicalite-1 zeolites. Such an approach is energy efficient, which can significantly reduce the size of metal species confined within the zeolites. The introduction of Zn species can remarkably promote the catalytic activity and stability of Pt clusters through to the formation of ultrasmall PtZn alloy clusters. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited an extremely high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5mol gPt1h1) with a WHSV of 108h1 and propylene selectivity (99.3%, WHSV=3.654h1) at 550C. Significantly, no obvious deactivation was observed even after 13000 on stream without co-feeding H2 (WHSV=3.6h1), the highest stability to date among all state-of-the-art Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for the PDH reaction. We also found that the introduction of Cs+ ions can significantly improve the regeneration performance and the catalytic activity remained stable after four successive regeneration cycles. This work introduces a new strategy for the preparation of the high-performance catalysts for the PDH reaction by encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters inside purely siliceous zeolites. The superior catalytic performance and excellent long-term and regeneration stability of PtZn@zeolite catalysts for PDH conversion suggest their promise for future industrial applications.
