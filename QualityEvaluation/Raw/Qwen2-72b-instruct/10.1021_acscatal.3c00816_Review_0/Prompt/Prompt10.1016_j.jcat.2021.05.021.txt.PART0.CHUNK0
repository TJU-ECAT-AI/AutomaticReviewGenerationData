Coordinatively unsaturated aluminum anchored Ru cluster for catalytic hydrogenation of benzene Highlights • Amorphous alumina with 62% penta-coordinated Al3+ was prepared via solution combustion synthesis. • With Ru loading of 1 wt%, high dispersion was obtained (Particle size of 0.93 nm). • High TOF (5 times higher than commercial catalyst) of hydrogenation of benzene was achieved. • DFT calculation suggest Ru2/Al3+penta site is the most stable configuration over Ru/CUA. • Ru2/Al3+penta with high adsorption energy of benzene exhibits high catalytic activity. • This strategy is also applicable to the dispersion of Pd catalyst.
Abstract The design and synthesis of highly dispersed metal catalyst have attracted increasing attention, and it is still challenging to generate stable metal clusters with high metal loadings. Support plays a crucial role in determining particle morphology and dispersion. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy for synthesizing an amorphous alumina with 62% Al3+penta sites (penta-coordinated Al3+) via solution combustion synthesis. It provides sufficient oxygen defects to anchor Ru species. For benzene hydrogenation reaction, the catalyst displays the high TOF (18833 h1), which is about 2 times higher than that of catalysts supported on commercial alumina. The DFT calculations also confirm that the high catalytic performance is closely correlated with the special configuration of Ru active sites over coordinatively unsaturated alumina. The penta-coordinated Al3+ was also applied to prepare Pd catalyst with high dispersion. This work provides a superior support which possesses abundant Al3+penta sites and affords a possibility for the generation of high and stable dispersion for the preparation of supported metal catalysts.

1. Introduction
High dispersion of supported metal catalysts is one of the primary goals for catalyst design. Particularly, precious metals, such as Pd, Ru, and Pt, supported on oxide surfaces are the most widely used catalyst materials.
[1] ,[2] Due to the high cost of these metals, the dispersion, particle size and morphology of the precious metals on the oxide supports are especially of significance.
[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] However, in addition to the exposure of active sites, the smaller particle size also results in the lower Tammann temperatures and the higher surface energy.
[7] ,[8] As a result, the catalytically active metal nanoparticles are thermodynamically unstable and tend to sinter or aggregate into larger particles during reactions, especially at high reaction temperatures leading to rapid deactivation and thus limiting their practical applications in industry. Fortunately, the metalsupport interaction plays a major role in the dispersion of metals.
[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] Therefore, it is necessary to develop a suitable host support that can enhance the metal-support interaction stabilizing metal nanoparticles and providing good mechanical stability to maintain the structural integrity at elevated temperatures as well [14] ,[15] ,[16] .
The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) has been directly linked to the presence of electronic defects on the surfaces of oxides [17] such as oxygen vacancies.
[18] ,[19] γ-Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used catalyst supports because of its compact crystal structure, excellent mechanical strength, high thermal stability, and chemical inertness [20] ,[21] . Recently, it has been confirmed that the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate of Al3+ sites (Al3+penta site) presented in commercial γ-Al2O3 can act as binding sites for anchoring metals [22] ,[23] . In 2009, Kwak et al.
[24] reported that the Al3+penta site presented on the (1 0 0) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 serves as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt. This finding is very important as it provides a facile approach to prepare high dispersion and thermally stable metal nano-catalysts [25] ,[26] . Nevertheless, the amount of Al3+ pentacoordinate sites of common γ-Al2O3 is very rare. Hence, in recent years, many methods have been reported to generate more coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites. For instance, Cong et al.
[27] fabricated an amorphous alumina with 29% Al3+penta sites (named rp-Al2O3) by evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) method. With this method, the prepared rp-Al2O3 can anchor highly dispersed Ru species with 1 wt% loading and exhibited high activity (TOF = 5180 h1) for benzene hydrogenation reactions. Bao et al.
[28] reported an effective approach to stabilize Pd/SiO2 catalysts with porous Al2O3 overlayers coated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and the percentage of Al3+penta sites of SiO2-Al2O3 was 47%. The Al2O3/Pd/SiO2 shows high and stable catalytic performance with the methane combustion between 200 and 850 C. Zhang et al.
[29] developed an atomically dispersed Pt catalyst supported on mesoporous Al2O3 by self-assembly method and it exhibits excellent catalytic performance under both oxidative and reductive atmospheres at high temperatures. However, the synthesis methods are complicated and these samples are very difficult to acquire. Hence, developing a facile and readily scalable method for the synthesis of Al2O3 with high concentration of Al3+penta site is of great significance. The benzene hydrogenation to cyclohexane without side products is one of the most important hydrogenation reactions in industry [30] ,[31] . In order to improve the catalytic performance and the selectivity of cyclohexane, there are various reports which use the catalytic benzene hydrogenation reaction to evaluate the performance of the hydrogenation catalysts. As a liquid reaction, the dispersion and stability (leaching) remains as one of the key challenges during the production process [32] . Therefore, developing an appropriate catalyst which can achieve the higher level of conversions and stabilize the active metal species is of significance for the benzene hydrogenation [33] .
In the present work, we obtain an Al2O3 rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ centers (named CUA) by solution combustion synthesis method, which provides enough defect sites to anchor dispersed guest metal. Based on the CUA support, 1 wt%-4 wt% Ru/CUA catalysts were prepared and the catalytic performance with benzene hydrogenation to cyclohexane were evaluated. The relationship between the amount of Al3+penta sites and metal dispersion was investigated in detail. With 27Al MAS NMR, HRTEM and XRD techniques, we have been able to measure the amount of Al3+penta site and the Ru particle size over various catalysts. These catalysts were also characterized by SEM, BET and XPS method to address the morphological, textural changes and electronic structures, respectively. We also employed the FT-IR spectroscopy to investigate the formation of Al3+penta site in CUA. Furthermore, we performed DFT calculations to investigate the dispersion mechanism of Ru over CUA and the relationship between Ru particle size and activity of benzene hydrogenation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of CUA and Urea- Al2O3
The coordinatively unsaturated aluminum (CUA) was prepared by a simple solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method. Briefly, 37.51 g Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Shanghai Aladdin, AR 99%) and 25 g glycine (Shanghai Aladdin, AR 99%) were dissolved in 200 mL of distillated water, and then the solution was heated to 70 C with vigorous stirring in a water bath for 3 h. The gelatinous paste was obtained following evaporation of water. For the combustion synthesis, the paste was transferred to a porcelain dish and placed in a domestic microwave oven (Meidi Company, 800 W, 2.45 GHz, 23 L) with high heat (700 W). Following heating by microwave with 3 min, significant amounts of white smog was observed and erupted in the microwave oven. After combustion, foam like sample was obtained and the solid was crushed into powder. The powder was denoted as CUA. The preparation procedure of CUA samples were schematically illustrated in Scheme S1. For comparison, the Urea-Al2O3 was prepared in a similar manner, with 25 g glycine was replaced by 20 g urea.
2.2. Preparation of Ru/CUA-N2 catalysts
Supported ruthenium catalysts with ruthenium loading of 14 wt% were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with RuCl3·3H2O (Shanghai Aladdin, AR 99%) as the precursor. After impregnation, the samples were aged at room temperature for 12 h and then dried at 120 C for 24 h. Following drying, the heat treatment of sample was carried out with a fixed-bed plug flow reactor in N2 atmosphere at 400 C for 3 h with a ramp rate of 3 C min1 and then cooled to room temperature, followed by reduction under H2 atmosphere at 200 C for 2 h with a ramp rate of 2 C min1. The obtained catalyst was labeled as the X wt% Ru/CUA-N2, respectively. Sample of 1 wt% Pd/CUA-N2 was prepared with similar method as 1 wt% Ru/CUA-N2. For simplicity, 1 wt% Ru/CUA-N2 and 1 wt% Pd/CUA-N2 were especially denoted as Ru/CUA-N and Pd/CUA-N. As comparison, heat treatment of CUA without Ru loading was also carried out with a fixed-bed plug flow reactor in N2 atmosphere at 400 C for 3 h and then reduced under H2 atmosphere at 200 C for 2 h (named as CUA-CN). 1 wt% Ru/Comm-γ-Al2O3 (denoted as Ru/ Comm-γ-Al2O3) catalyst with commercial γ-Al2O3 (Shanghai Aladdin, AR 99%) (named as comm-γ-Al2O3) as support was prepared following the same procedure as Ru/CUA-N.
2.3. Preparation of 1 wt% Ru/CUA-air catalysts
To investigate the influence of calcination atmosphere on the performance of catalysts, 1 wt% Ru/CUA-air (denoted as Ru/CUA-A) was prepared with similar procedure as Ru/CUA-N, only changed the calcination atmosphere from N2 to air. The CUA without Ru loading was carried out with a fixed-bed plug flow reactor in air atmosphere at 400 C for 3 h and then reduced under H2 atmosphere at 200 C for 2 h (named as CUA-CA). The actual content of Ru in the prepared catalysts was determined by ICP-MS measurements. As displayed in Table S1 , the Ru loading of Ru/CUA-N and Ru/CUA-A were 0.87% and 0.84% respectively. It may be attributed to the incomplete dissolution of samples during ICP-MS measurements.
2.4. Characterization of catalysts
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of samples were recorded on a Thermo ARL X'TRA diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm) at room temperature, the range of 2θ was 1080 with the scanning rate of 2 min1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB210, VG Co., photoelectron spectroscopy with a monochromatized microfocused Mg Ka-ray source) was used to analyze the change of the coordination state of surface element. The binding energy values were corrected for charging effect by referring to the adventitious C1s line at 284.5 eV. Before measurement, the catalyst was pressed to thin sheet and fixed on the sample holder.The specific surface area, pore volume and the pore size distribution were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) desorption equation, measured by N2 physisorption at 196 C using Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Prior to the measurement, the samples were degassed at 180 C for 12 h under vacuum.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded on the FESEM HitachiS-4700 at high vacuum with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV equipped with an X-ray energy spectrometer (EDS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) were obtained on FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin of Philips-FEI Company at 300 kV.To investigate the coordination environment of aluminum, the solid-state NMR of 27Al MAS NMR spectra were obtained over a Bruker AVANCE III HD 500 spectrometer using 2.5 mm double-bearing magic angle spinning (MAS) probe (Bruker Biospin) and applying a spinning speed of 20 kHz. All the spectra are externally referenced to 1.0 M aqueous AlCl3 (-9 ppm).Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used to determine the surface group of catalysts by a Nicolet 6700 with the wave number from 4000 to 400 cm1.The catalysts were pressed together with KBr into a 13 mm self-supported wafer. Before the detection the sample was heated under an infrared lamp (70 C, 10 min) to remove water in the sample.The Ru loadings of catalysts were determined by an Agilent ICPMS 7700 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Samples were first dissolved in aqua regia, and the mixtures were further oxidized with 30% hydrogen peroxide in order to make Ru dissolved completely. The dispersion of Ru on various supports were determined with CO pulse chemisorption measurements. The CO pulse chemisorption measurements were performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 apparatus equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Typically, sample (0.1 g) was first pretreated in hydrogen (50 mL min1) at 200 C for 2 h and purged with helium (50 mL min1) for 1 h at the same temperature. Then the catalyst was cooled to room temperature in helium atmosphere. Then the 5% CO/He pulses were injected from a calibrated on-line sampling valve. CO adsorption was assumed to be completed after three successive peaks showed the same peak areas. A CO/Ru stoichiometry of 1 was used for calculations.
2.5. DFT calculations
For the dispersion mechanism of Ru over CUA and the adsorption of benzene on the catalysts, the DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [34] . The calculation of the electronic exchange correlation term is described by the PBE of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method. correction method. The interaction between the atomic nucleus and the valence electron is described by the conjugated projection wave pseudopotential (PAW-PP). The cutoff energy for the plane wave basis set was fixed at 450 eV. In order to achieve convergence, the Gaussian smearing method is used to use a bandwidth of 0.05 eV. The spin-polarization treatment of the open-shell electron system, the Brillouin zone integral according to the special K-point method of the Monkhorst-Pack form [35] , for the p2 × 2 supercell, the K-point takes the value 1 × 1 × 1. The convergence criterion of structure optimization and energy calculation is: energy convergence is 1.0 × 10-4 eV, and atomic force convergence is 0.05 eV/Å. The Bader charge analysis was used to study the electron transfer between the surface and the adsorbed atoms.
The (1 0 0) plane p2 × 2 supercell of non-spinel structure γ-Al2O3 which exposes pentahedral coordinated Al was employed as a model to simulate the amorphous Al2O3 catalyst exhibiting high amount of pentahedral coordinated Al [36] . As shown in Fig. S10 , the top two atoms were relaxed when the surface was calculated, and the vacuum layer was set to 15 Å. The calculation of the gas phase Ru cluster and the benzene molecule was carried out in a lattice of a = b = c = 20 Å.
The adsorption energy, Eads(Run), of a Ru cluster was defined by (1) Eads(Run) = E(Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)) - E(γ-Al2O3(1 0 0))  E(Run) (n = 14) E(Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)), E(γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)), E(Run) are the total energies of the γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) with Run cluster, the bare γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) substrate, and the energy minimized Run cluster in the gas phase. This energy can be decomposed into several components. The energy associated with deformation in the structure of the Ru cluster between the gas phase and the adsorbed state was characterized using (2) where E(Rung) is the energy of Run in the gas phase using the geometry of the adsorbed cluster on γ-Al2O3(1 0 0). The surface deformation energy associated with adsorbing a cluster, Edef(surface), was calculated in a similar way:(3) Edef(surface) = E(γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)g)  E(γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)) where E(γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)g) is the energy of the γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) in the geometry associated with the adsorbed cluster but with the cluster removed. We also calculated the interaction energy, Eint, associated with the cluster/surface interaction, using (4) Eint = E(Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)g)  E(Rung)  E(γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)) From Eqs.
(1) ,(2) ,(3) ,(4) , it can be seen that (5) Eads (Run) = Edef (Run) + Edef (surface) + Eint The adsorption energy, Eads (C6H6), of a benzene was defined by (6) Eads = E(C6H6-Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0))  E(Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0))  E(C6H6) (n = 14) E(C6H6-Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)), E(Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)), E(C6H6) are the total energies of the Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) with benzene, the bare Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) substrate, and the energy benzene in the gas phase.
2.6. Catalytic activity evaluation
Catalytic performance was tested in a stainless-steel autoclave with teflon inner vessel at 80 C. In a typical procedure, 20 mg catalyst, 2 g benzene and 15 mL n-hexane were placed in the reactor simultaneously and sealed quickly. Herein, n-hexane functions as the internal standard for the reaction. The reactor was firstly purged with N2 (2 MPa) three times. Then the residual N2 was replaced with H2 (2 MPa) twice. The pressure of the reactor is atmospheric before heating up. After the reactor was heated to 80 C, H2 was passed to reactor at 3 MPa, with the stirring rate of 600 rpm. In order to maintain the reaction pressure, H2 was continually introduced to the reactor. The reaction process was monitored by taking small amounts of reaction mixture (about 0.1 mL) at intervals. The amount of sampling is very little, and the effect on the reaction is ignored. The liquid products were analyzed using gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC 2014) equipped with a HP-5 50 m × 0.200 mm capillary column and a flame ionization detector (FID). Each reaction was tested for four times to obtain the error bars. The yield of cyclohexane and turnover frequency (TOF) value was calculated and used to evaluate the activity. n-Hexane was used as internal standard. TOFs of various catalysts were calculated on the basis of surface Ru atoms and using the following Eq.
(7) :(7) To evaluate the stability of the catalysts, 20 mg catalyst, 2 g benzene and 15 mL n-hexane were co-added into the autoclave. The autoclave was flushed with N2 for three times and then was pressurized with 3 MPa H2. After catalytic reaction proceeded at 80 C for 40 mins, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and the hydrogen was released, then the products were analyzed. The catalysts were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with n-hexane carefully, followed by re-adding to the Teflon inlet for the next round without any pre-treatment.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Formation mechanism of CUA
In the present work, coordinatively unsaturated aluminum (CUA) was fabricated via simple solution combustion (Scheme S1). Following gelation and evaporation of Al(NO3)3 and glycine solution, the combustion synthesis was accomplished in a domestic microwave oven within 3 min.
Fig. 1 illustrates the physical, chemical properties and formation mechanism of CUA. As shown in Fig. 1 a, three peaks are observed for the CUA in 27Al MAS NMR spectrum. The two characteristic peaks with chemical shift at 3.9 and 62.6 ppm represent Al3+ cations in octahedral (Al3+octa) and tetrahedral (Al3+tetra) coordination [37] ,[38] , and the peak at 32.8 ppm represents coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ cations with pentahedral coordination (Al3+penta) [39] . The percentage of Al3+penta sites are 62% in CUA, thus demonstrating the exceptionally high density of Al3+penta sites on Al2O3 prepared by the SCS method. It is worth noting that the percentage of Al3+penta site of CUA is also significantly higher than the results in literature [22] ,[24] ,[27] ,[28] ( Table S2 ). Besides the Al3+penta sites, the Al3+octa and the Al3+tetra sites account for about 15% and 23% respectively ( Fig. S2 a and Table S3 ). However, there only two peaks are detected in the spectrum of comm-γ-Al2O3 at around 9.0 and 67.9 ppm, which are attributed to the Al3+octa and Al3+tetra sites respectively. Clearly, the comm-γ-Al2O3 almost does not possess Al3+penta.

To investigate the formation mechanism of the Al3+penta in the CUA, the urea-Al2O3 was prepared via combustion synthesis for comparison. 27Al MAS NMR spectra in Fig. S1 a shows that urea-Al2O3 display two peaks at 8.7 and 67.9 ppm. These chemical shifts are also attributed to Al3+octa and Al3+tetra, respectively. However, it is unexpected that urea-Al2O3 prepared by solution combustion does not provide the Al3+penta. Thus, it is necessary to study on the difference between CUA and urea-Al2O3. Consequently, the gelatinous paste of glycine-Al(NO3)3 (named as Gly-Al) and urea- Al(NO3)3 (named as Urea-Al) were synthesized and analyzed with FT-IR. As illustrated in Fig. 1 b, for the spectra of pure glycine, typical vibrations of the surface NH3+ groups (3167 cm1) [40] were observed. For the spectra of Gly-Al, the NH3+ groups stretching vibration (3167 cm1) disappears. Indeed, several reported works has pointed out that amino acids in a solid state exist in a zwitter ionic form NH3+CH(R)COO-. If a nitrogen atom of amino group is coordinated to metal center, stretching vibrations characteristic for NH3+ group are absent in IR spectrum of complex [41] . Due to the urea was not has the COOH groups, and the NH3+ can not formed, and the urea-Al2O3 does not have the Al3+penta sites. Hence, there is no noticeable change detected between the urea and Urea-Al from Fig. S1 c. Based on the above discussion, we suggest that after mixing glycine and Al(NO3)3, the NH3+ of glycine coordinating with aluminum ions during hydrolysis and condensation. Then, the NH3+ groups coordinated with aluminum ions were removed during combustion and plenty of Al3+penta sites were formed. There is no COOH exists, so the urea-Al2O3 does not have the Al3+penta sites. This is consistent with the result of 27Al MASS NMR.
The XRD patterns of CUA and comm-γ-Al2O3 are presented in Fig. 1 c. For the comm-γ-Al2O3, all the typical diffraction peaks including (1 1 1), (3 1 1), (4 0 0) and (4 4 0) were identified respectively [42] ,[43] , which are sensitive to the Al3+distribution. However, these typical diffraction peaks were absent on the CUA, indicating a high degree of Al3+ disorder and amorphous phase of CUA. Meanwhile, the urea-Al2O3 possess classical α-Al2O3 structure [44] ( Fig. S1 b). The textural properties of CUA and comm-γ-Al2O3 were determined by N2-sorption analysis. As displayed in Fig. 1 d and Fig. S3 , both the CUA and comm-γ-Al2O3 show type V isotherms and H3 hysteresis which are usually indicative of the presence of mesopores. In addition, the surface area and pore volume of the CUA and comm-γ-Al2O3 were measured to be about 10.4 m2 g1, 122.1 m2 g1 and 0.02 cm3 g1, 0.57 cm3 g1, respectively ( Table S4 ). Clearly, the surface area of comm-γ-Al2O3 is much higher than that of CUA.
The morphology of CUA and comm-γ-Al2O3 were also investigated by SEM technique and the results are displayed in Fig. 1 e and Fig. 1 f. Due to the momentary high temperature and large amounts of gases released by glycine combustion, the CUA is in the form of thick large plates with macropores. Comm-γ-Al2O3 is composed of irregular and small particles.
3.2. Dispersion and chemical state of Ru/support
To better demonstrate the outstanding ability of CUA to anchor and evenly disperse loaded metals, CUA architecture was directly used to support Ru through conventional incipient wet impregnation method (Ru/CUA-N), as well as Ru/Comm-γ-Al2O3 acted as reference. The distribution of Ru nanoparticles on different supports was characterized by high resolution TEM, which is displayed in Fig. 2 a1 and b1.
As shown in Fig. 2 a1, highly dispersed Ru atomic clusters are uniformly distributed on CUA and no particle aggregation was observed for Ru/CUA-N. However, the particles of Ru/Comm-γ-Al2O3 are not as homogeneous as those of Ru/CUA-N, and clear particle aggregation was detected ( Fig. 2 b1). As shown in Fig. S6 a, the particle size distribution for Ru/CUA-N is relatively narrow. About 70% of the Ru atomic clusters for Ru/CUA-N are smaller than 1.0 nm. By contrast, for Ru/Comm-γ-Al2O3, the particle size is larger and the average size is 3.26 nm ( Fig. S6 b) although the surface area of CUA is much lower than that of comm-γ-Al2O3. This is consistent with the results of CO pulse chemisorption. As displayed in Table S1, the Ru/CUA-N sample exhibited a higher Ru dispersion (86.3%) than the Ru/Comm-γ-Al2O3 (29.6%). Whereas, the particle size of Ru nanoparticles has an obvious augment with the increase of Ru loading from 1 wt% to 4 wt% ( Fig. S8 ). However, the particles are still much smaller than that of Ru/Comm-γ-Al2O3 ( Fig. S6 b). As shown in Fig. S5 , after Ru species are loaded on CUA, no new diffraction assigned to Ru species appears in the XRD pattern, indicating the high dispersion of Ru species. This high dispersion of Ru species is suggested to result from that the Ru atoms are anchored preferentially on the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites.

In order to clarify the nature of the strong interaction between Ru species and CUA, 27Al solid-state MAS NMR spectra were recorded. As shown in Fig. 2 a2, after Ru species are loaded, the Al3+penta site of Ru/CUA-N decreases from 62 to 50%, and the Al3+octa site increases from 15 to 26% ( Table S3 and Fig. S2 b). It indicates that Ru is selectively anchored onto the coordinatively unsaturated Al3+penta site and also explains that the coordinative saturation of these Al3+penta sites are responsible for the strong interactions between Ru species and CUA. However, no difference between the 27Al solid-state MAS NMR spectra of Ru/Comm-γ-Al2O3 and Comm-γ-Al2O3 is identified ( Fig. 2 b2). As shown in the Fig. S4 a and Table S5 , the percentage of Al3+penta sites are 59% in CUA-CN, it is similar with the CUA (62%). Al3+octa sites increase from the 23% to 29%. Clearly, no significant change of Al3+penta sites was found between CUA and CUA-CN. Hence, Al3+penta sites are stable during the heat treatment in N2. It reinforces that Ru loading to Al3+penta sites is responsible for the decrease in Al3+penta sites rather than heat treatment. The electronic structures of active phases correlated with its coordination environment were further investigated by XPS. As the binding energy of the Ru 3d orbital overlaps with that of C 1s, the Ru 3p orbital was chosen for the analysis [45] ,[46] . As demonstrated in Fig. 2 a3, although with the reduction by H2, Run+ species at binding energy of 464.5 eV [47] over Ru/CUA-N are stilled detected which further prove the strong interaction between Ru species and CUA. In addition, Ru0 species (462.2 eV) are also observed in Ru/CUA-N [48] ,[49] . By contrast, only one Ru 3p3/2 peak assigned to Ru0 was detected in the spectra of Ru/Comm-γ-Al2O3 at around 462.2 eV ( Fig. 2 b3).
In addition, this interaction was found to be applicable for Pd catalyst. As shown in Fig. S9 , Pd atomic clusters with high dispersion are observed in the HRTEM images. Furthermore, the particle size distribution of Pd/CUA-N is relatively narrow, with dimensions < 0.8 nm ( Fig. S6 d). Thus, we conclude that the CUA with exceptionally high density of Al3+penta sites is an excellent host material and can be used to prepare highly-dispersed nano metal catalysts.
3.3. DFT calculation for the dispersion of Ru over CUA
Based on the above discussion, we suggest that the Al3+penta sites of CUA play a major role for the dispersion of Ru species. As illustrated in Scheme 1 , doping with Ru species to the CUA and calcined under N2 atmosphere at 400 C, the Al3+penta sites of CUA anchor the Ru species. Finally, the structures of Ru-Al and Ru-O were formed in the Ru/CUA-N.

To verify this hypothesis, DFT calculations were carried out for the specific information about the energetics of the interaction of Ru clusters with the Al3+penta site of CUA. The (1 0 0) plane p2 × 2 supercell of non-spinel structure γ-Al2O3 which exposes pentahedral coordinated Al was employed as a model to simulate the amorphous Al2O3 catalyst exhibiting high amount of pentahedral coordinated Al. We first briefly describe the geometries and energies of gas phase Run, which are essential to understand the growth behavior of Run on γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) surfaces. The 1D, 2D, and 3D structures geometries [50] of Run (n = 14) were considered and only the energetically preferred geometries are summarized in Table S6 and Fig. S11 . As shown in Fig. S10 , there are variety of Al atoms and O atoms in different coordination environments on the surface of γ-Al2O3(1 0 0). To determine the most stable adsorption structure of Run on γ-Al2O3 (1 0 0), all possible adsorption sites on γ-Al2O3 (1 0 0) have been explored. Taking Ru1 as an example, there are 11 adsorption configurations of Ru1 in γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) ( Fig. S12 ). As shown in Fig. 3 , the most stable structure is the one with Ru adsorbed on the bridge site formed by AlVa, OIII1 and OIII2. The adsorption of a Ru monomer induces a strong surface rearrangement in which the Ru atom inserts approximately into the surface plane, with an adjacent oxygen atom moving upward to accommodate the Ru atom.

Comparison of the adsorption configuration of Run on γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) surface indicates the most stable Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) configuration is obtained by added an additional Ru atom in various configurations to the most stable Run-1/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0). Therefore, to determine the amounts of Ru atoms which has the most stable adsorption structure on γ-Al2O3(1 0 0), we introduce a new definition of Es-growth to study the energy variation for Run growth supported on γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) surface, which is calculated by:(8) Es-growth = E(Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)) + E(γ-Al2O3(1 0 0))  E(Run-1/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0))  E(Ru1/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)) Where E(Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)), E(γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)), E(Run-1/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)) and E(Ru1/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0)) stand for total energy of γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) surface or Run adsorbed on γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) surface.
At the same time, as a comparison, it is necessary to calculate the growth ability of Run in gas phase, which is calculated by:(9) Ei-growth = E(Run)  E(Run-1)  E(Ru) The energetic parameters Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) (n = 14) complexes are presented in Fig. 4 a and Table S7. It reveals that there is a strong correlation between surface deformation and Ru-support interaction energies. This strong interrelated effect is due to the fact that surface opens a site for Ru insertion, through which double Al-O bonds cleavage, and at a deformation cost (1.94 eV) compensated by the additional Ru-surface interaction energy (-5.81 eV). Therefore, the stability of Run adsorption on the surface depends on the extent to which the surface can adapt itself to the incoming metal particle.

The growth energies of Run (n = 24) clusters are plotted in Fig. 4 b. The results of all growth energies are negative, indicating the growth of Run (n = 24) clusters is thermodynamically possible. The comparative growth energies of Run (n = 24) clusters adsorbed on γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) surface and isolated Run (n = 24) clusters imply that the support can serve strongly stabilize the metal clusters. The most important turning point is n = 3, which further confirms the strongest Ru2-support interaction energy (-9.80 eV), it is shown that it is relatively difficult for Run growth from Ru2 to Ru3 [51] . The results of the bader charge analysis in Table S8, further confirm this conclusion. When Ru metal clusters grow to Ru2, the number of electrons transferred from γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) to the metal cluster was the highest, indicating a strong interaction between Ru2 and γ-Al2O3(1 0 0), stabilizing the Ru2/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0). Hence, the Ru2/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) is the most stable configuration ( Fig. S13 ).
3.4. Catalytic activity
Benzene hydrogenation to cyclohexane was conducted in an autoclave at 80 C with n-hexane as the solvent under a H2 pressure of 3 MPa. On the Ru/CUA-N sample, the reaction proceeds much faster than other samples, and completed in only about 100 mins ( Fig. 5 a). By contrast, the Ru/Comm-γ-Al2O3 requires about 260 mins to complete the reaction. In addition, Ru/CUA-N sample exhibits the highest TOF as high as 18833 h1, which was about doubled compared with Ru/Comm-γ-Al2O3 (10902 h1), as shown in Fig. 5 b. Moreover, the remarkable activity achieved on Ru/CUA-N is much superior than other Ru based catalysts reported in literatures [27] ,[52] ,[53] ,[54] ,[55] ,[56] ,[57] ( Table S9 ). Stability of Ru/CUA-N was also evaluated. It was found that no significant decay in both selectivity and activity are observed even after the catalyst was recycled for five times without further calcination/reduction treatments ( Fig. 5 c), indicating the absence of any poisoning or coking. Based on the above discussion, we suggest that the activity of benzene hydrogenation to cyclohexane was closely related to the particle size of Ru cluster. Specifically, the Ru/CUA-N sample with a Ru particle size of 0.93 nm has the highest activity and the Ru particle size of Ru/Comm-γ-Al2O3 was 3.26 nm. Clearly, Ru size play a major role for benzene hydrogenation.

Inspired by recent report, the subnanometric Ru cluster or Ru single atom will anchored on the coordinative unsaturation Al3+penta site with air calcination atmosphere [24] . Therefore, the 1 wt% Ru/CUA-air (named as Ru/CUA-A) was prepared with similar procedure as Ru/CUA-N, only changed the calcination atmosphere from N2 to air. As demonstrated in Fig. S7 a, Ru clusters as well as single atoms are identified in the high resolution TEM images. Obviously, the particle sizes of Ru clusters for Ru/CUA-A are even smaller than Ru/CUA-N. The particle sizes of Ru clusters are smaller than 0.6 nm ( Fig. S6 c). This conclusion was further confirmed by CO pulse chemisorption. As displayed in Table S1 , the Ru/CUA-A sample exhibited the highest Ru dispersion of 109.7% than the Ru/CUA-N (86.3%) and Ru/Comm-γ-Al2O3 (29.6%). The Ru dispersion of Ru/CUA-A higher than 100% may be attributed to the twin adsorption of CO on Ru/CUA-A [58] . This phenomenon can be further proved by the result of 27Al solid-state MAS NMR. As shown in Fig. S7 b, for the Ru/CUA-A, following the loading of Ru onto CUA, Al3+penta site decreases from 62 to 33%, and Al3+octa site increases from 15 to 45% respectively ( Table S3 and Fig. S2 c). After Ru species were loaded, the amount of Al3+penta sites for Ru/CUA-N and Ru/CUA-A both decreased. However, the decline of Al3+penta sites for Ru/CUA-A are more significantly than Ru/CUA-N. The oxygen bridges were created between Ru atom and Al3+penta site on the CUA surface by calcination with air atmosphere. As a result, Ru atoms bind to the Al3+penta sites on the CUA surface through oxygen bridges, coordinatively saturating these sites. As shown in Fig. S4 b, for the CUA-CA, part of the Al3+penta sites (51% for the remaining) is transformed mainly to Al3+tetra sites (30%) and partially to Al3+octa sites (19%) ( Table S5 ). Obviously, the amounts of Al3+penta sites of CUA-CA was decreased with calcination in air atmosphere. However, the decline of Al3+penta sites is less than Ru/CUA-A. Hence, for Ru/CUA-A, the decline of Al3+penta sites was mainly attributed to the loading of Ru clusters. This result is also reinforced by the Ru 3p3/2 XPS spectra. The Ru 3p3/2 peak of Ru/CUA-A is deconvoluted to one peak at binding energy of 464.79 eV which is ascribed to Run+ species [59] ( Fig. S7 c). Therefore, Run+ peak for Ru/CUA-A shifted to a higher binding energy than Ru/CUA-N. For the catalytic test of benzene hydrogenation, the Ru/CUA-A needs 180 mins to complete the reaction under the same reaction conditions and the TOF (5938 h1) was only about one third of Ru/CUA-N. It is further confirmed that the activity of benzene hydrogenation to cyclohexane was closely related to the particle size of Ru cluster.In our previous discussion of DFT calculation, we found that the Ru2 cluster has the strongest interaction with Al3+penta site and has the most stable structure. And the length of Ru2 cluster was calculated to be about 0.958 nm, close to the 0.93 nm estimated from the HR-TEM image of Ru/CUA-N ( Fig. 2 a1). In order to clarify the nature between particle size of Ru cluster and activity of benzene hydrogenation, the DFT calculations of adsorption of benzene on Run/ Al3+penta sites were carried out.
3.5. DFT calculation of benzene hydrogenation
We first briefly describe the energies of gas phase benzene, which are essential to understand the adsorption behavior of benzene on Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) surfaces. The adsorption of benzene on the pure γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) surface was first explored. Both vertical adsorption and parallel adsorption of benzene are difficult to occur ( Fig. S14 ). It can be concluded the presence of Run on γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) is the only site to adsorb benzene.
As shown in Fig. S15 , the adsorption energy of benzene in parallel and vertical adsorption on Ru1/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) is calculated, with the parallel adsorption model much stronger than the vertical one (-2.17 eV vs 0.08 eV). Therefore, only the adsorption of benzene in the parallel adsorption form at the Ru site of Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) is considered.
Indeed, several reported works has pointed out that the determining step of benzene hydrogenation reaction does not stem from the adsorption process of benzene [60] ,[61] ,[62] . However, there also exists much evidence to confirm that the linear TS scaling and the BEP relations between reaction intermediates and transition states are bound up with the adsorption energy of central atoms in hydrogenation or dehydrogenation reaction [63] ,[64] ,[65] . Furthermore, according to the previous investigation conducted by G Zhou et al.
[66] , a stronger benzene adsorption ability of active sites usually leads to a higher TOF value. For our work, the calculated benzene adsorption energy over Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) exhibits the following rules ( Fig. 6 a and Fig. S16 ): Eads(C6H6-Ru2) > Eads(C6H6-Ru1) > Eads(C6H6-Ru4) > Eads(C6H6-Ru3). Evidently, the highest value appears on Ru2/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) and it indeed has the best catalytic performance, which is consistent with the conclusion from G Zhou et al. On this basis, we find that the benzene adsorption energy is closely related to the coordination number and environment of Ru atoms to which benzene molecules are attached. As shown in Fig. 6 b and c, the Ru sites in the diatomic configuration bear the higest bader charge, which exhibits the strong electronegativity and facilitates the adsorption of benzene ( Table S10 ). Further, as displayed in Fig. 6 d, the charge accumulation and deficiency between benzene molecules and Ru sites respectively reach the peak values in the configurations of C6H6-Ru2/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) and C6H6-Ru1/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0), which explains why benzene is most stable on Ru2/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) and the second stable on Ru1/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0).

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Under this premise, due to the the consistent size of Ru particle size between Ru/CUA-N and Ru2 cluster model, the Ru/CUA-N reasonably exhibits the highest activity among the tested catalysts with regard to benzene hydrogenation conversion and TOFs.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we obtained an amorphous alumina rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ centers (named CUA) via the solution combustion synthesis method with the percentage of Al3+penta site higher (about 62%) than other reported works. The large amounts of Al3+penta sites of CUA provides enough oxygen defects to anchor Ru species. From the results of DFT calculation, the adsorption of a Ru monomer induces a strong surface rearrangement in which the Ru atom inserts approximately into the surface plane, with an adjacent oxygen atom moving upward to accommodate the Ru atom. Loading Ru on the CUA support and calcining the catalyst material at 573 K with N2 atmosphere result in a substantial decrease in the number of Al3+penta sites. Furthermore, we also calculate the various amounts of Ru atoms adsorbed on Al3+penta site, the results displayed that the Ru2/ Al3+penta site is the most stable configuration. In addition, Ru2 cluster was calculated to be about 0.958 nm, in excellent agreement with the 0.93 nm estimated from the HRTEM images of Ru/CUA-N. As catalyst of benzene hydrogenation reaction, the catalyst displayed highest TOF of 15517 h1, which was about three and five times higher than Ru/CUA-A (5534 h1) and Ru/Comm-γ-Al2O3 (3186 h1), respectively. DFT calculation also confirmed that the Ru2/ Al3+penta site structure has the highest adsorption energy of benzene and exhibits the best catalytic activity for the benzene hydrogenation to cyclohexane. This conclusion is also applicable to the dispersion of Pd catalyst. Clearly, our work provides a superior catalytic support which possesses abundant Al3+penta sites and affords a possibility for the generation of atomically dispersed metal catalysts with practical applications.
