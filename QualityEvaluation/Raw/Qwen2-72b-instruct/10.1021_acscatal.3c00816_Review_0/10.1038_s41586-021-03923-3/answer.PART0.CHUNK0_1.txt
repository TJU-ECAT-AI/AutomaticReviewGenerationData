1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for the production of propene, an industrially important platform chemical. PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have issues with the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. A new method is introduced for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO.
