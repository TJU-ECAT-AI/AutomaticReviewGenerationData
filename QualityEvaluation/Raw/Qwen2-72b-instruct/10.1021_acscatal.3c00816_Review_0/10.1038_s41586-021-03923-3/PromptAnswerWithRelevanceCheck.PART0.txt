[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2."
[2] "The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9."
[3] "Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO."
[4] "The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing this industrially important platform chemical. PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have issues with the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. A new method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. The developed catalyst has about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity compared to an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3.

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for the production of propene, an industrially important platform chemical. PDH addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a more environmentally friendly approach, avoiding the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds and the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. The introduction of a method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO further enhances the advantages of PDH technology. The developed ZnO-based catalyst demonstrates about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity compared to a commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 analogue under industrially relevant conditions.
