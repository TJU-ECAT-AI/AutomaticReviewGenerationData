1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for the production of propene, an industrially important platform chemical. PDH addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a more environmentally friendly approach, avoiding the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds and the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. The introduction of a method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO further enhances the advantages of PDH technology. The developed ZnO-based catalyst demonstrates about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity compared to a commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 analogue under industrially relevant conditions.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是石油基裂解过程的重要替代方案，用于生产丙烯，这是一种工业上重要的平台化学品。PDH技术通过提供更环保的方法，避免了Cr（VI）化合物的毒性以及催化剂再生对生态有害的氯的需求，解决了传统生产方法的挑战。基于商业ZnO制备环境兼容的支撑催化剂的方法的引入进一步增强了PDH技术的优势。在工业相关条件下，与商业KCrOx/Al2O3类似物相比，开发的ZnO基催化剂在相似的丙烯选择性下显示出约三倍的丙烯生产力。
