1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing this industrially important platform chemical. The commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have problems with the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. Here, we introduce a method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）制丙烯是替代石油基裂解过程的重要途径，用于生产这种工业上重要的平台化学品。商业PDH技术使用含Cr或含Pt催化剂，存在Cr（VI）化合物的毒性问题，或需要使用对生态有害的氯进行催化剂再生。在这里，我们介绍了一种基于商用ZnO制备环境兼容的负载型催化剂的方法。
