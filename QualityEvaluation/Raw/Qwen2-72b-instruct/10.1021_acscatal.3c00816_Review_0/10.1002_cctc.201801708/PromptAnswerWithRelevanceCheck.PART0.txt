<quotes>

[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on.1,2,3,4 The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum. Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1.Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) is considered one of the most effective methods for propylene production due to the abundant supply of propane and the significant price difference between propane and propylene. This method specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by providing an alternative feedstock to petroleum, improving process efficiency, and increasing product selectivity.
