[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on.1,2,3,4 The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum. Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

1.The traditional methods of producing propylene, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), are unable to meet the market demand due to the depletion of petroleum resources. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, which utilizes abundant propane resources and takes advantage of the significant price difference between propane and propylene, is considered one of the most promising methods for propylene production. It specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.
