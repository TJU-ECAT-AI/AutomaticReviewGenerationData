[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on.1,2,3,4 The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum. Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

1.Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to the rich source of propane and the significant price gap between propane and propylene. This method specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing abundant propane as feedstock, potentially offering higher efficiency and selectivity for propylene production compared to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) methods, which are constrained by the depletion of petroleum resources.

1.丙烷直接脱氢制丙烯（PDH）技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为丙烷资源丰富，丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差距巨大。该方法通过利用丰富的丙烷作为原料，与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）方法相比，可能提供更高的效率和丙烯选择性，从而解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战，这些传统方法受到石油资源枯竭的限制。
