1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically uses propane, which is abundant and widely available, as the feedstock, making it less dependent on traditional oil-based feedstocks. The process is more energy-efficient and has a higher selectivity for propylene, reducing the production of unwanted byproducts and increasing overall efficiency. This makes PDH a more sustainable and economically viable option for propylene production.
