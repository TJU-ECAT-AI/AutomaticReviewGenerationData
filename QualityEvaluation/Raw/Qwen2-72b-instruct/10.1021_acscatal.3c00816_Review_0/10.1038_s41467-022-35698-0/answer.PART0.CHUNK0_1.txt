1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane, a widely available feedstock, and achieving high conversion rates and selectivity for propylene, while minimizing the formation of byproducts such as methane and ethane. This results in a more efficient and cost-effective process for propylene production.
