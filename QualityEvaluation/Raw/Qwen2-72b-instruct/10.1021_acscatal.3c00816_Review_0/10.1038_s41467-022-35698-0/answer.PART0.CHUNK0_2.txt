1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically uses propane, a widely available feedstock, as the raw material, which ensures a stable and reliable source of propylene production. Moreover, PDH processes are more energy-efficient and have higher propylene yields compared to traditional methods, such as steam cracking, which often require more complex separation processes and result in lower yields of propylene. The high selectivity of PDH processes towards propylene also minimizes the production of by-products, leading to a more streamlined and cost-effective production route.
