1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is advantageous for propylene production due to its ability to convert low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. Unlike conventional production methods that rely on steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha, PDH specifically addresses challenges in feedstock availability by utilizing propane, an important raw material for various chemicals. This method also improves process efficiency and product selectivity by directly converting propane to propene, which is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited, requiring high temperatures for satisfactory propene yield. However, PDH faces issues like hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation at higher temperatures, leading to decreased catalyst activity and stability.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在生产丙烯方面具有优势，因为它能够将低成本的饱和烃转化为高价值的烯烃，使其在经济上具有竞争力。与依赖于蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化石脑油的常规生产方法不同，PDH通过利用丙烷，一种对各种化学品至关重要的原材料，具体解决了原料供应的挑战。该方法通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，提高了过程效率和产品选择性，这是一个高度吸热且受平衡限制的反应，需要高温才能获得满意的丙烯产量。然而，PDH在较高温度下面临诸如烃类裂解和焦炭形成的问题，导致催化剂活性和稳定性的下降。
