1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is advantageous for propylene production due to its ability to convert low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. Unlike conventional methods which rely on steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha, PDH specifically addresses the challenges of decreasing fossil oil resources and increasing market demand for propene by directly converting propane, an abundant and cheaper feedstock, into propene with high selectivity. This process is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited, requiring high temperatures for satisfactory propene yield, but it avoids the issues of hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation that can lead to decreased catalyst activity and stability in other processes.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中具有优势，因为它能够将低成本的饱和烃转化为高价值的烯烃，使其在经济上具有竞争力。与依赖于蒸汽裂解和催化裂化石脑油的常规方法不同，PDH特别解决了化石油资源持续减少和丙烯市场需求增加的挑战，通过直接将丰富的、成本更低的丙烷转化为丙烯，具有高选择性。该过程是高度吸热和平衡受限的，需要高温才能获得满意的丙烯产量，但它避免了其他过程中可能出现的烃类裂解和焦炭形成问题，这些问题会导致催化剂活性和稳定性下降。
