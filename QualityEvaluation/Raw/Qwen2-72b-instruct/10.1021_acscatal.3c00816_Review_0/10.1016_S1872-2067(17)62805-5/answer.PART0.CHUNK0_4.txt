1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is advantageous for propylene production due to its ability to convert low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. Unlike conventional methods that rely on steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha, PDH specifically addresses challenges in feedstock availability by utilizing propane, an important raw material for various chemicals. It enhances process efficiency and product selectivity by directly converting propane to propene, bypassing the need for intermediate steps and reducing the likelihood of undesired side reactions.
