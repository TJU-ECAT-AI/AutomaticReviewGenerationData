1.The literature does not provide specific information on how propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, it does mention that PDH is considered a promising method to meet the increasing demand for propene production due to its efficient CH activation ability and eco-friendliness compared to CrOx-based catalysts. The literature focuses on the development of a stable and efficient catalyst for PDH, which is a significant challenge for the industry due to the high reaction temperatures and harsh conditions that can lead to sintering and coke formation on the catalysts.
