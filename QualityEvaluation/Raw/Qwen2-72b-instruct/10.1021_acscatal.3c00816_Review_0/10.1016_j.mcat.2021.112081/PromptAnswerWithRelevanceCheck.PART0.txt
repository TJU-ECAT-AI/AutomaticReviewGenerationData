<quotes>

[1] "Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal [2] , which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore."
[2] "On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources [3] ."
[3] "The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost [ 4 ,5 ]."

</quotes>

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. PDH uses a single feedstock, propane, and produces a single product, propylene, which simplifies the process and improves efficiency. The wide availability of raw materials, especially the abundant and cheap light alkanes from unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas, ensures a stable and cost-effective supply chain. Additionally, the low cost of PDH technology makes it more competitive compared to traditional methods that are struggling to meet the growing global demand for propylene.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它在解决传统生产方法的挑战方面具有优势。PDH使用单一原料，即丙烷，生产单一产品，即丙烯，这简化了工艺，提高了效率。原材料的广泛可用性，特别是来自页岩气等非常规天然气来源的丰富且廉价的轻烷烃，确保了稳定且成本效益高的供应链。此外，PDH技术的低成本使其与传统方法相比更具竞争力，传统方法正努力满足全球对丙烯日益增长的需求。

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods. Conventional methods, which rely on the cracking of naphtha and coal, are no longer able to meet the growing global demand for propylene. PDH technology, on the other hand, benefits from the exploitation of unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas, which provides abundant and inexpensive light alkane feedstocks. PDH offers several key advantages: it uses a single feedstock (propane), produces a single product (propylene), has a wide range of raw material sources, and is cost-effective.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面具有优势。传统方法依赖于石脑油和煤炭的裂解，但这些方法已无法满足全球对丙烯日益增长的需求。另一方面，PDH技术从非常规天然气（如页岩气）的开发中受益，这提供了丰富且廉价的轻烷烃原料。PDH具有几个关键优势：它使用单一原料（丙烷），生产单一产品（丙烯），有广泛的原料来源，并且成本效益高。
