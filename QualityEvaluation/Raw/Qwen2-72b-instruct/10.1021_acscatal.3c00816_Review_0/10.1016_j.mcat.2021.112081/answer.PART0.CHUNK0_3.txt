[1] "Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal [2] , which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore."
[2] "On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources [3] ."
[3] "The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost [ 4 ,5 ]."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. PDH uses a single feedstock, propane, and produces a single product, propylene, which simplifies the process and improves efficiency. The wide availability of raw materials, particularly light alkanes from unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas, ensures a steady and cost-effective supply. Additionally, PDH offers lower production costs compared to traditional methods, making it a competitive choice in the market.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它在解决传统生产方法的挑战方面具有优势。PDH使用单一原料，即丙烷，生产单一产品，即丙烯，这简化了过程，提高了效率。由于轻烷烃，特别是来自页岩气等非常规天然气来源的广泛可用性，确保了稳定和成本效益的供应。此外，PDH提供的生产成本低于传统方法，使其在市场上具有竞争力。
