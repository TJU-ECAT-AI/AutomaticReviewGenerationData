[1] "Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal [2] , which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore."
[2] "On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources [3] ."
[3] "The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost [ 4 ,5 ]."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH uses a single feedstock, propane, and produces a single product, propylene, which simplifies the process and improves efficiency. The wide availability of raw materials, particularly light alkanes from unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas, ensures a steady and cost-effective supply. This technology also offers low production costs, making it competitive in the market. In contrast, traditional methods of producing propylene as a by-product of naphtha and coal cracking are no longer sufficient to meet the growing global demand for propylene.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面具有优势。PDH使用单一原料，即丙烷，生产单一产品，即丙烯，这简化了工艺，提高了效率。原材料的广泛可用性，特别是来自页岩气等非常规天然气来源的轻烷烃，确保了稳定和成本效益的供应。这项技术还提供低成本的生产，使其在市场上具有竞争力。相比之下，传统的丙烯生产方法，即作为石脑油和煤炭裂解的副产品，已不再足以满足全球对丙烯日益增长的需求。
