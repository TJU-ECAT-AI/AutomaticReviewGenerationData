1.The literature does not provide specific information on how propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, it does mention that PDH or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising industrial alternative to produce propylene since it makes low-value propane into high-value propylene, which is now mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术如何解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战的具体信息。但是，它确实提到PDH或丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）是生产丙烯的有希望的工业替代方法，因为它将低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯，而丙烯现在主要通过蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）过程生产。
