1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to convert low-value propane into high-value propylene, which addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by providing an alternative route to produce propylene that does not rely on the traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes, which are more dependent on specific feedstocks and can have lower process efficiency and selectivity.

1.鉴于全球对丙烯的需求不断增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术作为生产丙烯最有前景的方法，其关键优势在于能够将低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯，这解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。PDH特别解决了这些挑战，为生产丙烯提供了一条不依赖于传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）工艺的替代途径，这些传统工艺更依赖于特定的原料，且可能具有较低的过程效率和选择性。
