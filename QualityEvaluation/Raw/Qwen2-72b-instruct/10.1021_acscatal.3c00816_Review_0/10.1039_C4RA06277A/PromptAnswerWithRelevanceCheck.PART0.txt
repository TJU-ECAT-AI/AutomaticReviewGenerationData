Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, it does mention that PDH or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising industrial alternative to produce propylene since it makes low-value propane into high-value propylene, which is now mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process.

1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to convert low-value propane into high-value propylene, which addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by providing an alternative route to produce propylene that does not rely on the traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes, which are more dependent on specific feedstocks and may have lower efficiency and selectivity.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>
