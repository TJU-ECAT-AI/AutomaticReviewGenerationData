1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, PDH is generally recognized as a promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane, a widely available feedstock, into propylene with high selectivity. This process bypasses the need for steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which are more energy-intensive and have lower propylene yields. PDH technology also offers the potential for more efficient and environmentally friendly production, as it can be designed to minimize by-products and reduce carbon emissions.

1.文献没有提供关于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法挑战方面的具体信息。然而，PDH通常被认为是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，因为它能够直接将丙烷，一种广泛可用的原料，以高选择性转化为丙烯。这一过程绕过了对蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解的需求，这两种方法更耗能，丙烯产量也更低。PDH技术还提供了更高效和环保生产的潜力，因为它可以设计成最小化副产品和减少碳排放。

1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature to directly answer the question about the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production and how it addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, the literature does discuss the importance of propylene as a petrochemical intermediate and the growing demand for propene and its derivatives. It also mentions that catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) is an attractive alternative to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) for propene production, especially in terms of avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition. The literature further highlights the potential of V-based catalysts, such as VOX-SiO2 solids, for commercial PDH processes due to their reasonable price, environmental friendliness, and superior catalytic properties, including high activity, stability, and selectivity for propene.
