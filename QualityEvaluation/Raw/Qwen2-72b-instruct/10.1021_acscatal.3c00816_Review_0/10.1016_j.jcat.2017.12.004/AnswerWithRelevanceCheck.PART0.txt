          PDH is generally recognized as a promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane, a widely available feedstock, into propylene with high selectivity. This process bypasses the need for steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which are more energy-intensive and have lower propylene yields. PDH technology also offers the potential for more efficient use of resources and reduced environmental impact compared to traditional methods.

          然而，PDH通常被认为是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，因为它能够直接将丙烷，一种广泛可用的原料，以高选择性转化为丙烯。这一过程绕过了对蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解的需求，这两种方法更耗能，丙烯产量也更低。与传统方法相比，PDH技术还提供了更有效利用资源和减少环境影响的潜力。
