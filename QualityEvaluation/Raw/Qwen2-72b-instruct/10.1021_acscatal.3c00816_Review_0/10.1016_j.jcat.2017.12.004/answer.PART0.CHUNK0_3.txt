1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature to directly answer the question about the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production and how it addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, the literature does discuss the importance of propylene as a petrochemical intermediate and the growing demand for propene and its derivatives. It also mentions that catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) is an attractive alternative to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) for propene production, especially in terms of avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition. The literature further highlights the potential of V-based catalysts, such as VOX-SiO2 solids, for commercial PDH processes due to their reasonable price, environmental friendliness, and superior catalytic properties, including high activity, stability, and selectivity for propene.

1.在文献中没有找到直接回答丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在丙烯生产中的优势以及它如何解决传统生产方法面临的挑战的相关引文。但是,文献确实讨论了丙烯作为石化中间体的重要性以及丙烯及其衍生物需求的不断增长。它还提到催化脱氢(DH)作为丙烯生产的一种有吸引力的替代方案,特别是因为它可以避免热力学平衡限制并减少碳沉积。文献进一步强调了V基催化剂,如VOX-SiO2固体,在商业PDH过程中的潜力,因为它们价格合理、环境友好,并且具有优越的催化性能,包括高活性、稳定性和丙烯选择性。
