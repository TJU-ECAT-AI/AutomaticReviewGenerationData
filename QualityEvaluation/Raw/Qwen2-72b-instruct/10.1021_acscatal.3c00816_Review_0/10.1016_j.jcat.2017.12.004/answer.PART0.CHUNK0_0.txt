1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, PDH is generally recognized as a promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane, a widely available feedstock, into propylene with high selectivity. This process bypasses the need for steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which are more energy-intensive and have lower propylene yields. PDH technology also offers the potential for more efficient and environmentally friendly production, as it can be designed to minimize by-products and reduce carbon emissions.

1.文献没有提供关于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法挑战方面的具体信息。然而，PDH通常被认为是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，因为它能够直接将丙烷，一种广泛可用的原料，以高选择性转化为丙烯。这一过程绕过了对蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解的需求，这两种方法更耗能，丙烯产量也更低。PDH技术还提供了更高效和环保生产的潜力，因为它可以设计成最小化副产品和减少碳排放。
