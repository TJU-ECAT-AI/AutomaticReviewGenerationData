1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an attractive strategy for propylene production, especially with the improvement in hydraulic fracturing technology allowing for the extraction of large volumes of shale gas containing propane. This suggests that PDH can utilize shale gas as a feedstock, potentially addressing issues of feedstock availability. The literature also highlights the development of efficient PDH catalysts, which could improve process efficiency and product selectivity.
