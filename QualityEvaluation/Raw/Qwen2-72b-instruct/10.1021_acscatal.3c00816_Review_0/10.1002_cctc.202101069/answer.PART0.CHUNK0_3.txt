1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an attractive strategy for propylene production due to its ability to produce propylene from propane, a component of shale gas, which is abundant due to improvements in hydraulic fracturing technology. This suggests that PDH can address feedstock availability issues. Additionally, the literature highlights the development of a ZnO-based catalyst supported on silicalite-1 for PDH, which exhibits high catalytic activity and stability, indicating potential improvements in process efficiency and product selectivity.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是，它确实提到PDH是生产丙烯的一种有吸引力的策略，因为它能够从丙烷中生产丙烯，丙烷是页岩气的成分，由于水力压裂技术的改进，页岩气的含量丰富。这表明PDH可以解决原料供应问题。此外，文献强调了开发了一种以硅酸锂为载体的ZnO基催化剂用于PDH，该催化剂表现出高催化活性和稳定性，这表明在过程效率和产品选择性方面可能有所改进。
