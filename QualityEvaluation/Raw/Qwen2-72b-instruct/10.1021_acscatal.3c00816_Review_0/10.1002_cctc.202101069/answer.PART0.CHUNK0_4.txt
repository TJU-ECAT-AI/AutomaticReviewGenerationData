1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an attractive strategy for propylene production due to its ability to produce propylene from propane, a component of shale gas, which is abundant due to improvements in hydraulic fracturing technology. This suggests that PDH can address feedstock availability issues. The literature also highlights the high propylene selectivity and yield achieved with the silicalite-1 supported ZnO catalyst, which may contribute to process efficiency and product selectivity.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是，它确实提到PDH是生产丙烯的吸引人策略，因为它能够从丙烷中生产丙烯，丙烷是页岩气的成分，由于水力压裂技术的改进，页岩气的含量丰富。这表明PDH可以解决原料供应问题。文献还强调了使用硅酸锂-1支持的ZnO催化剂获得的高丙烯选择性和产量，这可能有助于提高过程效率和产品选择性。
