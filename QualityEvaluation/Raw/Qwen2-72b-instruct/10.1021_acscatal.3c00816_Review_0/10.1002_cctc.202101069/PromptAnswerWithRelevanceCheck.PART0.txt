1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an attractive strategy for propylene production, especially with the improvement in hydraulic fracturing technology allowing for the extraction of large volumes of shale gas containing propane. This suggests that PDH can utilize shale gas as a feedstock, potentially addressing issues of feedstock availability. The literature also highlights the development of efficient PDH catalysts, which could improve process efficiency and product selectivity.

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an attractive strategy for propylene production due to its ability to produce propylene from propane, a component of shale gas, which is abundant due to improvements in hydraulic fracturing technology. This suggests that PDH can address feedstock availability issues. Additionally, the literature highlights the development of a ZnO-based catalyst supported on silicalite-1 for PDH, which exhibits high catalytic activity and stability, indicating potential improvements in process efficiency and product selectivity.
