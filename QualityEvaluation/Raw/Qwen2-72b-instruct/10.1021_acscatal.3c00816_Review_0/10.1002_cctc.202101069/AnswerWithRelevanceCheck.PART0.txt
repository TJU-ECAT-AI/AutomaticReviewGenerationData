          The literature highlights that PDH is an attractive strategy for propylene production due to its ability to utilize propane, a component of abundant shale gas thanks to advancements in hydraulic fracturing technology, potentially addressing feedstock availability issues. It also mentions the development of efficient PDH catalysts, such as a ZnO-based catalyst supported on silicalite-1, which exhibits high catalytic activity, stability, and high propylene selectivity and yield, suggesting improvements in process efficiency and product selectivity.

          文献强调PDH是丙烯生产的一种有吸引力的策略，因为它能够利用丙烷，丙烷是由于水力压裂技术的改进而丰富的页岩气的成分，这可能解决原料供应问题。它还提到了高效PDH催化剂的开发，如以硅酸锂-1为载体的ZnO基催化剂，该催化剂表现出高催化活性、稳定性和高丙烯选择性和产量，表明在过程效率和产品选择性方面可能有所改进。
