1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is a promising method for the industrial-scale production of propylene due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market. The literature focuses on the development of a stable PtCe bimetallic cluster catalyst for PDH, which improves catalytic stability and propylene selectivity.
