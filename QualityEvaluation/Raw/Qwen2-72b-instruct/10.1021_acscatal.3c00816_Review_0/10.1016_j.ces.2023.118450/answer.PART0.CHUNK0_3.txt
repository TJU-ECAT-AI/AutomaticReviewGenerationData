1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is a promising method for the industrial-scale production of propylene due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market. PDH has gained increasing attention in recent years as an on-purpose way to produce propylene from propane, which suggests it may offer advantages in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to traditional methods that rely on byproduct recovery from other processes.
