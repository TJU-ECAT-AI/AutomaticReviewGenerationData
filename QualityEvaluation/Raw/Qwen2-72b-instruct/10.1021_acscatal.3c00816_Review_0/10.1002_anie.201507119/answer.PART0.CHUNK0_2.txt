1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does highlight that PDH is an economical and environmentally friendly route for propylene production compared to traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions. PDH can potentially offer benefits in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, but the literature does not delve into these details.
