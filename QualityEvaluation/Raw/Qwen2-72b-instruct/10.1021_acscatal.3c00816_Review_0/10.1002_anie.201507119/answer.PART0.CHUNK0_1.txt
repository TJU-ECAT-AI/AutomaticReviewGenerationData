1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does highlight that PDH is an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions. PDH using an alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage. The addition of a Sn promoter to the Pt catalyst has proved necessary to obtain the optimum catalyst for PDH.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是，它确实强调PDH与传统的热裂解或催化裂解原油衍生石脑油相比，是一种经济且环保的途径，后者需要大量能源并产生大量CO2排放。使用氧化铝支撑的Pt催化剂的PDH是该过程的关键组成部分，因为它具有激活石蜡CH键的优越能力，且在CC键裂解中的活性较低。在Pt催化剂中添加Sn促进剂已被证明是获得PDH最佳催化剂的必要条件。
