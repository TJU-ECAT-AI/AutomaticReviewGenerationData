1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does highlight that PDH is an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions. PDH using an alumina-supported Pt catalyst with a Sn promoter can achieve high conversion of propane into propylene with excellent selectivity, while minimizing coke formation and sintering processes, which are major causes of catalyst deactivation in conventional methods.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体信息。但是，它确实强调PDH与传统的热裂解或催化裂解原油衍生石脑油相比，是一种经济且环保的途径，后者需要大量能源并产生大量CO2排放。使用含Sn助剂的氧化铝支撑的Pt催化剂的PDH可以实现丙烷向丙烯的高转化率，同时具有优异的选择性，同时最小化焦炭形成和烧结过程，这是传统方法中催化剂失活的主要原因。
