<quotes>

[1] "The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process."

[2] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas."

[3] "Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. The growing global demand for propylene has led to a significant gap between supply and demand, which PDH technology can help bridge by utilizing widely available and inexpensive propane as a feedstock. This is particularly advantageous in the current industrial context, where abundant shale gas provides a steady source of propane. Moreover, PDH technology offers high selectivity to propylene, with hydrogen (H2) as a valuable by-product, enhancing process efficiency and product selectivity.
