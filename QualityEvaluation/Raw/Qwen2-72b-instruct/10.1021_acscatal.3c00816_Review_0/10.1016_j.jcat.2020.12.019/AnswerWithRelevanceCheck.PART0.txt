          [1] "The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process."
          [2] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas."
          [3] "Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. The growing global demand for propylene has led to a significant gap between supply and demand, as downstream products derived from propylene are consumed in large quantities. PDH technology offers an important alternative for propylene production, attracting considerable attention for the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts. This technology is particularly advantageous in the current industrial context due to the availability of cheap propane from abundant shale gas, which can be converted into propylene with high selectivity and valuable hydrogen as a by-product. PDH offers several key advantages: it utilizes cheap propane, which is widely available from abundant shale gas, making it an attractive feedstock option. This technology also achieves high selectivity to propylene, with valuable hydrogen (H2) as a by-product. Moreover, PDH is eco-friendly and cost-efficient, making it a preferred choice in the current industrial context.
