1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, it does mention that PDH becomes a particularly important method to produce propylene using propane as feedstock due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. This suggests that PDH may offer advantages in terms of feedstock availability, especially in regions with abundant shale gas resources. Additionally, the literature highlights the competitive performance, low cost, and low toxicity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts in PDH, which could contribute to process efficiency and product selectivity.
