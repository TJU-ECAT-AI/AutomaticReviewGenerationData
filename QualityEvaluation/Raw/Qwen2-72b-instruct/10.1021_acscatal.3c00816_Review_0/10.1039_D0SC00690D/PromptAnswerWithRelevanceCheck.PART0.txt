1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, it does mention that PDH becomes a particularly important method to produce propylene using propane as feedstock due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. This suggests that PDH may offer advantages in terms of feedstock availability, potentially reducing reliance on traditional oil-based feedstocks. Additionally, the literature highlights that supported vanadium oxide catalysts used in PDH can achieve better reactivity and selectivity, especially excellent regeneration stability, compared to commercialized propane dehydrogenation plants utilizing Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts. This implies that PDH technology may offer process efficiency and product selectivity advantages over conventional methods.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是，它确实提到由于大规模开采页岩气，PDH成为使用丙烷作为原料生产丙烯的特别重要的方法。这表明PDH可能在原料供应方面提供优势，可能减少对传统石油基原料的依赖。此外，文献强调，在PDH中使用的支撑钒氧化物催化剂与商业化丙烷脱氢工厂使用的Pt基和CrOx基催化剂相比，可以实现更好的反应性和选择性，尤其是出色的再生稳定性。这表明PDH技术在过程效率和产品选择性方面可能比传统方法具有优势。
