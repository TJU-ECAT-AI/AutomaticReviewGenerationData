1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an important method to produce propylene using propane as feedstock, especially due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. This suggests that PDH may offer advantages in terms of feedstock availability, potentially lower costs, and possibly higher efficiency and selectivity compared to traditional methods that rely on naphtha or other heavier hydrocarbons.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体信息。但是，它确实提到PDH是使用丙烷作为原料生产丙烯的重要方法，特别是在大规模开采页岩气的情况下。这表明PDH可能在原料供应方面具有优势，可能成本更低，与依赖石脑油或其他更重的碳氢化合物的传统方法相比，可能具有更高的效率和选择性。
