1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is a highly endothermic reaction that requires high temperatures for high propane conversion, and that supported platinum-based catalysts are highly active for PDH but susceptible to deactivation by coke deposition. Frequent regenerations of deactivated catalyst by coke combustion are required in practice during which irreversible sintering of highly dispersed Pt species occurs under high-temperature and oxidizing conditions. Thus, the development of anti-sintering Pt-based catalysts that are stable during cyclic coke combustion and do not require oxychlorination regeneration is highly desired.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战与传统生产方法相比的具体优势。但是，它确实提到PDH是一种高度吸热反应，需要高温以实现高丙烷转化率，而基于铂的催化剂对PDH具有高度活性，但容易因焦炭沉积而失活。在实践中，需要频繁通过焦炭燃烧再生失活的催化剂，在此过程中，高度分散的Pt物种在高温和氧化条件下发生不可逆烧结。因此，开发在循环焦炭燃烧中稳定的抗烧结Pt基催化剂，且不需要氯氧化再生，是高度需要的。
