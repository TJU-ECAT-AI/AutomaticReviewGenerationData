1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is a highly endothermic reaction that requires high temperatures for high propane conversion, and that supported platinum-based catalysts are highly active for PDH but susceptible to deactivation by coke deposition. Frequent regenerations of deactivated catalyst by coke combustion are required, which can lead to irreversible sintering of highly dispersed Pt species under high-temperature and oxidizing conditions. The literature also notes that anti-sintering Pt-based catalysts that are stable during cyclic coke combustion and do not require oxychlorination regeneration are highly desired as coke deposition seems thermodynamically inevitable under PDH operation conditions.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在解决原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战与传统生产方法相比的具体优势。但是，它确实提到PDH是一种高度吸热反应，需要高温才能实现高丙烷转化率，而负载型铂基催化剂对PDH具有高度活性，但容易因焦炭沉积而失活。需要频繁地通过焦炭燃烧再生失活的催化剂，这可能会在高温和氧化条件下导致高度分散的Pt物种的不可逆烧结。文献还指出，抗烧结的铂基催化剂在循环焦炭燃烧中稳定，不需要氯氧化再生，因为焦炭沉积在PDH操作条件下似乎在热力学上是不可避免的。
