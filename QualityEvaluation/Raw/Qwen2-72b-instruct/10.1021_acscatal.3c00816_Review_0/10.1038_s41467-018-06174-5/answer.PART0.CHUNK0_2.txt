[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

[2] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction."

[3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its environmental friendliness, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Compared to oil-based cracking technologies, PDH uses natural or shale gas as feedstock, which contains significantly fewer impurities, making the process cleaner. As the demand for propylene increases, the contribution of PDH to overall propene production is expected to grow with the construction of new plants. However, commercial PDH catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species have drawbacks, including health and environmental concerns and high costs, which PDH technology aims to address.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它具有环保性、过程效率和产品选择性。与基于石油的裂解技术相比，PDH使用的是含杂质显著较少的天然气或页岩气作为原料，使过程更加清洁。随着丙烯需求的增加，PDH对整体丙烯生产贡献的增加，得益于新工厂的建设。然而，含有CrOx或Pt物种的商业PDH催化剂存在健康和环境问题以及高成本等缺点，PDH技术旨在解决这些问题。
