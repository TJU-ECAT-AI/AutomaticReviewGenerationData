[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

[2] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction."

[3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species."

[4] "According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

[5] "A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species."

[6] "To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its environmental friendliness, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Compared to oil-based cracking technologies, PDH uses natural or shale gas as feedstock, which contains significantly fewer impurities. This makes the process cleaner and more sustainable. The growing contribution of PDH to overall propylene production is evidenced by the construction of new plants. However, conventional PDH catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species have drawbacks. CrOx catalysts pose health risks due to the toxicity of Cr(VI), while Pt-based catalysts are expensive and prone to deactivation from Pt sintering. The use of Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds to re-disperse platinum is also environmentally harmful.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它具有环保性、过程效率和产品选择性。与基于石油的裂解技术相比，PDH使用天然气或页岩气作为原料，其中的杂质显著减少。这使得该过程更清洁、更可持续。PDH对整体丙烯生产日益增长的贡献体现在新工厂的建设上。然而，含有CrOx或Pt物种的传统PDH催化剂存在缺点。CrOx催化剂由于Cr(VI)的毒性而构成健康风险，而基于Pt的催化剂价格昂贵，且易因Pt烧结而失活。使用Cl2或含Cl化合物重新分散铂也是对环境有害的。
