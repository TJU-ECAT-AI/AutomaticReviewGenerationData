[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

[2] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction16."

[3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15."

[4] "According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

[5] "A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species."

[6] "To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."

[7] "Recently, we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane18,19,20."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is more environmentally friendly than oil-based cracking technologies because it uses natural/shale gas, which contains significantly fewer impurities than oil-based feedstock. PDH technology's contribution to overall propene production is expected to grow due to the construction of new plants. However, commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species have flaws. Exposure to Cr(VI) can cause various health effects, and Pt-based catalysts are expensive and prone to deactivation due to Pt species sintering. To re-disperse platinum, catalysts are treated with ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds. Recently, eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2 have been developed, but they require promotion with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane, or iso-butane.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术比基于石油的裂解技术更环保，因为它使用的是含杂质明显少于石油基原料的天然气。PDH技术对丙烯总产量的贡献预计将因新工厂的建设而增长。然而，含有CrOx或Pt物种的商业催化剂存在缺陷。Cr(VI)的暴露可能导致各种健康影响，而基于Pt的催化剂价格昂贵，且由于Pt物种的烧结而容易失活。为了重新分散铂，催化剂需要用生态有害的Cl2或含Cl化合物处理。最近，已经开发出了基于ZrO2的环保且成本高效的催化剂，但它们需要金属氧化物的促进，并且含有支持的Ru或Rh NP，以在丙烷、n-丁烷或异丁烷的非氧化脱氢中表现出高活性。
