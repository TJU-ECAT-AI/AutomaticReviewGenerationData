<quotes>

[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

[2] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction16."

[3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its environmental friendliness and efficiency. Unlike oil-based cracking technologies, PDH uses natural or shale gas as feedstock, which contains significantly fewer impurities. This makes the process cleaner and more sustainable. Moreover, with the construction of new PDH plants, the technology's contribution to overall propylene production is expected to increase. However, commercial PDH catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species have drawbacks, including health risks associated with Cr(VI) exposure and the high cost and deactivation of Pt-based catalysts.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它环保且效率高。与基于石油的裂解技术不同，PDH使用的是含杂质较少的天然气或页岩气作为原料，这使得该过程更清洁、更可持续。此外，随着新PDH工厂的建设，该技术对丙烯总产量的贡献预计将增加。然而，含有CrOx或Pt物种的商业PDH催化剂存在缺点，包括与Cr(VI)接触相关的健康风险以及Pt基催化剂的高成本和失活问题。

[6] "To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."

[7] "Recently, we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane18,19,20."

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术比基于石油的裂解技术更环保，因为它使用的是含杂质明显少于石油基原料的天然气。PDH技术对丙烯总产量的贡献预计将增长，因为正在建设新的工厂。然而，含有CrOx或Pt物种的商业催化剂存在缺陷。工作场所接触Cr(VI)可能导致各种健康影响，而基于Pt的催化剂成本高昂，且由于Pt物种的烧结而容易失活。为了重新分散铂，催化剂用生态有害的Cl2或含Cl化合物处理。最近，已经开发出了环保且成本高效的基于ZrO2的催化剂，但它们需要金属氧化物的促进，并且含有支持的Ru或Rh NP，以在丙烷、n-丁烷或异丁烷的非氧化脱氢中表现出高活性。
