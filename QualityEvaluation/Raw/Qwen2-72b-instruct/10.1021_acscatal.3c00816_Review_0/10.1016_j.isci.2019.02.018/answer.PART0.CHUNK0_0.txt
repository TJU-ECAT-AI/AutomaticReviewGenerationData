1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an attractive reaction for direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation. The designed catalysts exhibited high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in PDH, achieving propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream.
