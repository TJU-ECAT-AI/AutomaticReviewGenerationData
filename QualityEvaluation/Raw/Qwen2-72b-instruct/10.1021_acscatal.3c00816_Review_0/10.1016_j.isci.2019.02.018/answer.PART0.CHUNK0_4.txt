1.Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively. The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals. The approach consists of encapsulation of NPs into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on a Silicalite-1 support. The NC layer was established to control the size of ZnO NPs and to hinder their loss to a large extent at high temperatures. The designed catalysts exhibited high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in PDH. Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream.

1.非氧化性丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应在工业和科学领域都具有吸引力，因为它允许直接大规模生产丙烯，并对C-H活化进行基础分析。主要挑战在于在没有非贵金属的情况下，实现高活性、选择性和在线稳定性，以及环境友好和成本效益的催化剂。该方法包括将NPs封装到从zeolitic咪唑框架-8在Silicalite-1支撑上原位生长的氮掺杂碳（NC）层中。建立NC层是为了控制ZnO NPs的尺寸，并在很大程度上阻止它们在高温下的损失。设计的催化剂在PDH中表现出高活性、选择性和在线稳定性。在600C下，经过近6小时的在线时间，实现了约90%的丙烯选择性，丙烷转化率为44.4%。
