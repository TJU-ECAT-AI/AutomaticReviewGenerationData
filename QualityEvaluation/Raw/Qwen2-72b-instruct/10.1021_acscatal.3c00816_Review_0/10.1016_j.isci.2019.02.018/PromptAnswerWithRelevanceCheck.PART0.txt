1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is an attractive reaction for direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation. The designed catalysts exhibited high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in PDH, achieving propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体信息。但是，它确实提到PDH是一种有吸引力的反应，可以大规模直接生产丙烯，并进行C-H活化的基础分析。设计的催化剂在PDH中表现出高活性、选择性和在线稳定性，实现了约90%的丙烯选择性，在600C下近6小时在线后，丙烷转化率为44.4%。

1.Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively. The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals. The approach consists of encapsulation of NPs into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on a Silicalite-1 support. The NC layer was established to control the size of ZnO NPs and to hinder their loss to a large extent at high temperatures. The designed catalysts exhibited high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in PDH. Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream.

1.非氧化性丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应在工业和科学领域都具有吸引力，因为它允许直接大规模生产丙烯，并对C-H活化进行基础分析。主要挑战与实现高活性、选择性和在线稳定性有关，需要使用环保、成本效益高且不含非贵金属的催化剂。该方法包括将NPs封装到从zeolitic咪唑框架-8原位生长在Silicalite-1支撑上的氮掺杂碳(NC)层中。建立NC层是为了控制ZnO NPs的尺寸，并在很大程度上阻止它们在高温下的损失。设计的催化剂在PDH中表现出高活性、选择性和在线稳定性。在600C下，经过近6小时的在线时间，实现了约90%的丙烯选择性，丙烷转化率为44.4%。
