1.The growing global demand for propylene, together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy sources such as shale gas, has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most effective methods to produce propylene. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing propane, which is widely available from shale gas, as the feedstock. The PDH process operates at high temperatures to achieve reasonable conversion levels, making it more efficient than some conventional methods. Additionally, by directly converting propane to propylene, PDH offers high product selectivity, minimizing the production of unwanted byproducts.
