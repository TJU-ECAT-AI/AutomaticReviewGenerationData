          The growing global demand for propylene, together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy sources such as shale gas, has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most effective methods to produce propylene. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing propane, which is widely available from various sources including natural gas and refinery off-gases, as the feedstock. The PDH process operates at relatively mild conditions compared to steam cracking, which is the conventional method for propylene production, and it can achieve high propylene yields with minimal byproducts. This makes PDH a more efficient and selective process for propylene production. Additionally, the use of Pt-based catalysts in PDH processes provides superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage, leading to high propylene selectivity. By directly converting propane to propylene, PDH offers high product selectivity, minimizing the production of unwanted byproducts. It also improves process efficiency by operating at lower temperatures and pressures than steam cracking, resulting in lower energy consumption and potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, PDH offers higher product selectivity, as it directly converts propane to propylene with minimal formation of byproducts such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

          全球对丙烯需求的不断增长，以及从页岩气等清洁能源来源获得的丙烷供应量的增加，激发了人们通过直接脱氢生产丙烯的兴趣。丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯最有效的方法之一。它特别解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，通过利用从页岩气广泛获得的丙烷作为原料。PDH过程在高温下运行，以实现合理的转化水平，使其比某些传统方法更有效。此外，PDH过程中使用的基于Pt的催化剂对石蜡CH键具有优异的活化作用，对CC裂解的活性较低，从而导致丙烯的高选择性。通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，PDH提供了高产品选择性，最大限度地减少了不希望的副产品的生产。它还提高了过程效率，通过在比蒸汽裂解更低的温度和压力下运行，从而降低了能源消耗和潜在的温室气体排放。此外，PDH提供了更高的产品选择性，因为它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时最小限度地形成氢气和一氧化碳等副产品。
