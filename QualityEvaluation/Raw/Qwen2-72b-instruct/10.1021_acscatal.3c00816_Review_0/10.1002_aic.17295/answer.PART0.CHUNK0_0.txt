1.The growing global demand for propylene, together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy sources such as shale gas, has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most effective methods to produce propylene. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing propane, which is widely available from shale gas, as the feedstock. The PDH process operates at high temperatures to achieve reasonable conversion levels, making it more efficient than some conventional methods. Additionally, the use of Pt-based catalysts in PDH processes provides superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage, leading to high propylene selectivity.

1.全球对丙烯需求的不断增长，以及从页岩气等清洁能源来源获得的丙烷供应量的增加，激发了人们通过直接脱氢生产丙烯的兴趣。丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯最有效的方法之一。它特别解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战，通过利用从页岩气中广泛获得的丙烷作为原料。PDH过程在高温下运行，以实现合理的转化水平，使其比某些传统方法更有效。此外，PDH过程中使用的基于Pt的催化剂对石蜡CH键具有优异的活化作用，对CC裂解的活性较低，从而导致丙烯的高选择性。
