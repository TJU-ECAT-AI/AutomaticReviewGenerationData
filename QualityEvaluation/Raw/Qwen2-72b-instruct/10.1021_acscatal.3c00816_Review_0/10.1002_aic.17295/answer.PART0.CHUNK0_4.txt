1.The growing global demand for propylene, together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy sources such as shale gas, has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most effective methods to produce propylene. The direct dehydrogenation of propane offers a more efficient and selective route to propylene compared to conventional production methods, which often rely on steam cracking of naphtha or other heavier hydrocarbons. PDH specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is abundant in natural gas and associated gas streams. It also improves process efficiency by operating at lower temperatures and pressures than steam cracking, resulting in lower energy consumption and potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, PDH offers higher product selectivity, as it directly converts propane to propylene with minimal formation of byproducts such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

1.全球对丙烯需求的不断增长，以及从页岩气等清洁能源来源获得的丙烷供应量的增加，激发了人们通过直接脱氢生产丙烯的兴趣。丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯最有效的方法之一。与传统的生产方法相比，丙烷的直接脱氢为丙烯提供了一条更有效和选择性的途径，传统的生产方法通常依赖于石脑油或其他更重的碳氢化合物的蒸汽裂解。PDH通过利用丙烷具体解决了原料供应的挑战，丙烷在天然气和相关气体流中大量存在。通过在比蒸汽裂解更低的温度和压力下运行，它还提高了过程效率，从而降低了能源消耗和潜在的温室气体排放。此外，PDH提供了更高的产品选择性，因为它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时最小限度地形成氢气和一氧化碳等副产品。
