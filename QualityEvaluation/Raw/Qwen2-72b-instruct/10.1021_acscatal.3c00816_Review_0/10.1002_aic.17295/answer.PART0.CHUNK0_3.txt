1.The growing global demand for propylene, together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy sources such as shale gas, has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most effective methods to produce propylene. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing propane, which is widely available from various sources including natural gas and refinery off-gases, as the feedstock. The PDH process operates at relatively mild conditions compared to steam cracking, which is the conventional method for propylene production, and it can achieve high propylene yields with minimal byproducts. This makes PDH a more efficient and selective process for propylene production.

1.全球对丙烯的需求不断增长，加上从清洁能源来源（如页岩气）获得的丙烷越来越多，激发了人们通过直接脱氢有目的地生产丙烯的兴趣。丙烷脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯最有效的方法之一。它特别解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，通过利用丙烷作为原料，丙烷可从包括天然气和炼油厂副产品在内的各种来源广泛获得。PDH过程与传统的丙烯生产方法蒸汽裂解相比，在相对较温和的条件下运行，可以实现高丙烯产量，副产品最少。这使得PDH成为生产丙烯更有效、更选择性的过程。
