          [1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications."
          [2] "However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."
          [3] "Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention."
          [4] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."
          [5] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Propylene, a basic building block in industrial applications, has seen a significant increase in demand, reaching around 116 million tons in 2020. The PDH process, along with other techniques like the methanol to propylene process (MTP) and Fischer-Tropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), has attracted considerable attention. However, considering the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the PDH process is often regarded as the most promising pathway for producing high-value propylene. The advancements in hydraulic fracturing technology have further promoted the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane through the extraction of abundant shale gas, which strengthens the conversion and utilization of propane.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。丙烯是工业应用中的基本构建块，其需求在2020年达到了约1.16亿吨。PDH过程，连同其他技术如甲醇制丙烯过程（MTP）和费托水煤气变换反应（WGSR），已经引起了相当大的关注。然而，考虑到技术过程的成本和环境影响，PDH过程通常被视为生产高价值丙烯最有前景的途径。水力压裂技术的进步进一步促进了通过开采丰富的页岩气来转化和利用低价值丙烷，这加强了丙烷的转化和利用。
