          [1] "Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
          [2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
          [3] "Especially, PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
          [4] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [5] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly produce propylene without generating hybrid products. This technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates containing a large amount of propane can be extracted on a large scale, making the feedstock cheaper and more abundant. PDH technology is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product, which improves product selectivity. The demand for propylene is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, making the development of highly efficient propylene production technologies of vital importance both scientifically and economically.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它能够直接生产丙烯而不产生混合产品。该技术解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。随着水力压裂技术的发展，可以大规模提取含有大量丙烷的页岩气凝析液，使原料更便宜、更丰富。PDH技术是一种专有方法，只生产丙烯，不生产混合产品，提高了产品选择性。预计到2035年，丙烯需求将以每年平均2%至3%的速度增长，因此开发高效丙烯生产技术在科学和经济上都至关重要。
