          [1] "The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [2] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [3] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."
          [4] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties"
          [5] "A temperature range of 550 to 700 C results in reaching the equilibrium conversions of the atmospheric EDH reaction from ca. 10% to 40%, while the equilibrium conversion at 600 C corresponds to ca. 50% for the atmospheric PDH reaction."
          [6] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."
          [7] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
          [9] "Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene."
          [10] "Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes."
          [11] "Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene."

          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its ability to serve as an effective supplement to traditional production methods in light of the growing global demand for olefins. PDH can utilize the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, offering exclusive selectivity to olefins compared to other pathways like methanol-to-olefins (MTO), Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2, and N2O as oxidants. This exclusive selectivity to olefins addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH reactions, such as non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH), are thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, offering a process efficiency advantage over conventional production methods that rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. These conventional methods face challenges in terms of feedstock availability and process efficiency, while PDH specifically addresses these issues by utilizing alkanes as feedstocks, which are abundant in shale gas.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术作为最有可能的丙烯生产方法，其关键优势在于，面对全球对烯烃日益增长的需求，它能够作为传统生产方法的有效补充。PDH可以利用大规模开采的页岩气，与甲醇制烯烃（MTO）、费托合成制烯烃（FTO）以及使用O2、CO2和N2O作为氧化剂的烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）等其他途径相比，PDH具有对烯烃的专一选择性。这种对烯烃的专一选择性解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。PDH反应，如非氧化性乙烷脱氢（EDH）和丙烷脱氢（PDH），在热力学上是有限的，高度吸热，与依赖于裂解石脑油和重油的蒸汽裂解（SC）和流化催化裂化（FCC）的常规生产方法相比，提供了过程效率的优势。这些常规方法在原料供应和过程效率方面面临挑战，而PDH通过使用页岩气中丰富的烷烃作为原料，特别解决了这些问题。
