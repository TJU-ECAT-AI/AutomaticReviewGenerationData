          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has gained increasing attention due to the worldwide growing demand for propene and the increasing availability of propane from shale gas. PDH is recognized as one of the most effective technologies for propene production, which is a crucial industrial raw material for the manufacture of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone, and other industrial products. Compared to industrial Pt and Cr-based catalysts, non-noble zinc-based catalysts offer the advantages of lower cost and nontoxicity. However, these zinc-based catalysts often suffer from limited catalytic activity and poor stability. The introduction of moderate Ni into ZnO supported Silicalite-1 zeolite can enhance both catalytic activity and stability simultaneously. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing widely available propane from shale gas as feedstock, achieving high conversion rates and selectivity to propene under mild conditions.

          由于全球对丙烯需求的不断增长和页岩气中丙烷供应的增加，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术受到了越来越多的关注。PDH是生产丙烯最有效的技术之一，丙烯是生产聚丙烯、丙烯腈、环氧丙烷、丙酮等工业产品的重要工业原料。与工业Pt和Cr基催化剂相比，非贵金属锌基催化剂具有低成本和无毒性的优点。然而，它们通常存在催化活性有限和稳定性差的问题。将适量的Ni引入到ZnO支撑的Silicalite-1沸石中，可以同时提高催化活性和稳定性。PDH技术通过利用页岩气中广泛可用的丙烷作为原料，在温和条件下实现高转化率和高丙烯选择性，具体解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。
