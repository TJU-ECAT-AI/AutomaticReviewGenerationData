PDH can use renewable green propane as a feedstock, which is gaining traction as a sustainable alternative to non-renewable sources. The technology also avoids the formation of coke, which necessitates multi-reactor cycling for regeneration in non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene. A promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years, which use boron as the active component and are among the most active and selective reported to date for this reaction. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilizing CO2. However, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts. Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2. The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements. Future research should prioritize the low temperature activation of CO2. With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate.", "Doi": "10.1039/D1GC03700E"},
