Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal [2] , which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore.
          On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources [3] .
          The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost [ 4 ,5 ].

Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing. Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are widely applied in commercialized PDH processes, and both exhibit high activity and propylene yields. However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth.



[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
          [2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
          [3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
          [4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
          [5] "Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."
          [6] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."

[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
          [2] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction16."
          [3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15."
          [4] "According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."
          [5] "A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species."
          [6] "To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."
          [7] "Recently, we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane18,19,20."





Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on.1,2,3,4 The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum. Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways.





[1] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane."
          [2] "The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."
          [3] "Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field and to date there are several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH) (Sattler,2 2013), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2) (Atanga,3 2018) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2) (Carrero,4 2014 and Shi,5 2018)."
          [4] "The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 to identify over-arching themes and common rules for catalyst design."
          [5] "We do not try to capture aspects of reaction design and engineering, which itself is a vibrant field of research."
          [6] "We attempt to compare the performance of catalysts in the different sub-reactions by calculating a space time yield (STY), (measured in molC3H6 kgcat1 h1), which is based on the initial activity of the catalysts."
          [7] "Additionally, we emphasise the environmental and industrial perspectives of each reaction and the prospects for industrial application."
          [8] "Propene is a major platform chemical with a myriad of uses in the manufacturing and chemical industry."
          [9] "The majority of propene is used to manufacture polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer which is second only to polyethene in the scale of production."
          [10] "Polypropene has favourable physical properties such as high chemical resistance and good elasticity, which makes it useful in a broad range of applications, including packaging, manufacturing and in construction materials."
          [11] "Propene is also the precursor to many other polymer-related chemicals, including propene oxide (used to make polyurethane), acrylic acid (used to make acrylic polymers) and acrylonitrile (used to make polypropenonitrile)."
          [12] "Additionally, large scale chemicals such as isopropanol and cumene (used to manufacture phenol and acetone) are made from propene."
          [13] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030."
          [14] "Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
          [15] "Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."
          [16] "The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."
          [17] "The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation."
          [18] "Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant."
          [19] "This is summarised in Table 1, which compares steam cracking, MTO (from coal and natural gas) and dehydrogenation."
          [20] "Atom economy is a measurement of the percentage of atomic mass in the starting reagents that ends up in the final product."
          [21] "It serves as a useful indicator of how chemically efficient a process could be."
          [22] "It is important to remember that in practice, the real atom economy is determined by the selectivity of the catalyst, and the prevalence of side-reactions."
          [23] "Although it is not possible to precisely calculate the atom economy of SC or MTO due to the complexity of the process and uncertainty in the composition of the feedstock, it is apparent that both of these technologies are inferior to dehydrogenation."
          [24] "In the case of SC a wide range of chemicals are made, and while these are ultimately utilised in the production of other chemicals, the % of propene formed from such a process is low."
          [25] "Equally, in the MTO process from coal or natural gas, the atom economy is limited by the generation of H2O as a by-product."
          [26] "In contrast, in the case of dehydrogenation only H2 is generated as a by-product, meaning an atom economy of 95% is possible."
          [27] "With respect to the toxicity of the chemicals, SC forms various carcinogenic compounds, and the toxicity of methanol is well-established."
          [28] "In contrast, propane is non-hazardous."
          [29] "At present each of the feedstocks used in the main methods of propene production tend to be non-renewable."
          [30] "In the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock."
          [31] "However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass."
          [32] "In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels."
          [33] "Rodrguez-Vallejo et al. carried out life cycle analyses of naphtha cracking, propane dehydrogenation and MTO (using coal or natural gas as feedstocks)."
          [34] "In this analysis, the global warming potential (GWP), resource scarcity, impact on human health and the impact on the ecosystem was considered and quantified as a cost per kg of C3H6 produced."
          [35] "These data are shown in Table 1."
          [36] "In terms of the global warming potential of each process, the MTO based reactions are clearly worse than the naphtha cracking or direct dehydrogenation reactions, but the CO2 emissions of the coal-based feedstock is almost an order of magnitude higher than naphtha cracking."
          [37] "A similar trend was observed in the ecosystem category."
          [38] "This was measured in terms of local species lost integrated over time and underlines the gross negative impact of utilising coal as a feedstock in this chemistry."
          [39] "Resource scarcity was calculated based on the monetary burden of future mineral and fossil fuel extraction and shows that natural gas has around double the cost of that associated with propane, coal and naphtha."
          [40] "Finally, the cost to human health was estimated in terms of disability-adjusted life years, and naphtha cracking and propane dehydrogenation came out favourably compared to the MTO processes."
          [41] "Based on these metrics, it is clear that MTO from coal or natural gas has a larger environmental burden than SC or dehydrogenation."
          [42] "Opportunities for improving the sustainability of the dehydrogenation process were recently highlighted by Agarwal et al. who investigated various intensification and integration strategies."
          [43] "It was shown that such strategies, which involved additional waste heat recovery and off-gas recycling, up to 70% reductions in CO2 emissions were possible."
          [44] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
          [45] "Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane."
          [46] "Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum and the propane production industry has responded accordingly."
          [47] "The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale."
          [48] "TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year."
          [49] "Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year."
          [50] "The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation."
          [51] "While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity."
          [52] "Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel16 as well as glycerol17 and other substrates.18"
          [53] "With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this."
          [54] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
          [55] "However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield."
          [56] "These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review."
          [57] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
          [1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades."
          [2] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."
          [3] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based."
          [4] "However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene."
          [6] "While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component."
          [7] "These catalysts are amongst the most active and selective reported to date for this reaction."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2."
          [9] "Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."
          [10] "Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application."
          [11] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
          [12] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."
          [13] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
          [14] "Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority."
          [15] "With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate."

[1] "The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process."
          [2] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas."
          [3] "Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process."





Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2.
          The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9.
          Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO.
          For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream.
          The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.







Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable.





[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications."
          [2] "However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."
          [3] "Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention."
          [4] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."
          [5] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."





"Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has great potential to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, but the widely used Pt-based catalysts usually suffer from short-term stability and unsatisfactory propylene selectivity."















[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
          [2] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
          [3] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,4 ,5 ,6 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [4] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
          [5] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective."



Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent.1 The conventional propylene production processes include fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel.2 However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene. Thus, given these circumstances, a highly efficient way to produce propylene is urgently need, both scientifically and economically.3 In the past few years, multiple technologies for the production of propylene have been developed, such as the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process,4,5 FischerTropsch (FT) process,6 and propane dehydrogenation (PDH).7 Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products.715 In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap. Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions. The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable.



[1] "In the past several decades, light alkane dehydrogenation to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application."
          [2] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."
          [3] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."
          [4] "Although it is impossible to achieve the ideal state in practice, the actual results can approach this state very closely via the application of both an appropriate catalyst and the optimized reaction conditions."
          [5] "PDH is a high energy-consuming process."
          [6] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."
          [7] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."
          [8] "Thus, the actual reaction temperature and pressure for dehydrogenation plants should be determined by the variation trend of the equilibrium conversion with temperature and pressure as well as the severity of the unselective thermal reactions."
          [9] "Suitable reaction conditions are important not only for a commercial unit, but also for the exploration of new catalysts, which means that it is not worth carrying out an in-depth study on a catalyst possessing good performance only under the reaction conditions detached from engineering practice."

[1] "The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [2] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [3] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."
          [4] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties"
          [5] "A temperature range of 550 to 700 C results in reaching the equilibrium conversions of the atmospheric EDH reaction from ca. 10% to 40%, while the equilibrium conversion at 600 C corresponds to ca. 50% for the atmospheric PDH reaction."
          [6] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."
          [7] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
          [9] "Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene."
          [10] "Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes."
          [11] "Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene."





[1] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively. The Catofin process is operated at slightly positive atmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar, and the Oleflex process is usually operated at 13 bar, while the STAR process needs a higher pressure of 56 bar. Besides the catalytic system and the operation conditions especially the pressure, the other features like the type of reactor could also differ among the three processes."
          [2] "It has been proved that PtSn based catalysts could efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane, while the catalyst deactivation and the long-term stability issues are still the big challenges even for the aforementioned commercial catalysts."
          [3] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "The recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."
          [5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."
          [6] "The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."
          [7] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx. (7,8) The soft oxidant CO2 seems to be a good choice to overcome the problem, while it brings another challenge concerning the activation of CO2 to have it efficiently participate the reaction. (911) Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage."









[1] "Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
          [2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
          [3] "Especially, PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
          [4] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [5] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [2] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
          [3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [5] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
          [6] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [7] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [8] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."



[1] "The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."





Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal [2] , which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore.
          On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources [3] .
          The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost [ 4 ,5 ].

Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing. Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are widely applied in commercialized PDH processes, and both exhibit high activity and propylene yields. However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth.



[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
          [2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
          [3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
          [4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
          [5] "Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."
          [6] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."

[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
          [2] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction16."
          [3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15."
          [4] "According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."
          [5] "A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species."
          [6] "To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."
          [7] "Recently, we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane18,19,20."





Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on.1,2,3,4 The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum. Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways.





[1] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane."
          [2] "The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."
          [3] "Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field and to date there are several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH) (Sattler,2 2013), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2) (Atanga,3 2018) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2) (Carrero,4 2014 and Shi,5 2018)."
          [4] "The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 to identify over-arching themes and common rules for catalyst design."
          [5] "We do not try to capture aspects of reaction design and engineering, which itself is a vibrant field of research."
          [6] "We attempt to compare the performance of catalysts in the different sub-reactions by calculating a space time yield (STY), (measured in molC3H6 kgcat1 h1), which is based on the initial activity of the catalysts."
          [7] "Additionally, we emphasise the environmental and industrial perspectives of each reaction and the prospects for industrial application."
          [8] "Propene is a major platform chemical with a myriad of uses in the manufacturing and chemical industry."
          [9] "The majority of propene is used to manufacture polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer which is second only to polyethene in the scale of production."
          [10] "Polypropene has favourable physical properties such as high chemical resistance and good elasticity, which makes it useful in a broad range of applications, including packaging, manufacturing and in construction materials."
          [11] "Propene is also the precursor to many other polymer-related chemicals, including propene oxide (used to make polyurethane), acrylic acid (used to make acrylic polymers) and acrylonitrile (used to make polypropenonitrile)."
          [12] "Additionally, large scale chemicals such as isopropanol and cumene (used to manufacture phenol and acetone) are made from propene."
          [13] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030."
          [14] "Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
          [15] "Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."
          [16] "The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."
          [17] "The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation."
          [18] "Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant."
          [19] "This is summarised in Table 1, which compares steam cracking, MTO (from coal and natural gas) and dehydrogenation."
          [20] "Atom economy is a measurement of the percentage of atomic mass in the starting reagents that ends up in the final product."
          [21] "It serves as a useful indicator of how chemically efficient a process could be."
          [22] "It is important to remember that in practice, the real atom economy is determined by the selectivity of the catalyst, and the prevalence of side-reactions."
          [23] "Although it is not possible to precisely calculate the atom economy of SC or MTO due to the complexity of the process and uncertainty in the composition of the feedstock, it is apparent that both of these technologies are inferior to dehydrogenation."
          [24] "In the case of SC a wide range of chemicals are made, and while these are ultimately utilised in the production of other chemicals, the % of propene formed from such a process is low."
          [25] "Equally, in the MTO process from coal or natural gas, the atom economy is limited by the generation of H2O as a by-product."
          [26] "In contrast, in the case of dehydrogenation only H2 is generated as a by-product, meaning an atom economy of 95% is possible."
          [27] "With respect to the toxicity of the chemicals, SC forms various carcinogenic compounds, and the toxicity of methanol is well-established."
          [28] "In contrast, propane is non-hazardous."
          [29] "At present each of the feedstocks used in the main methods of propene production tend to be non-renewable."
          [30] "In the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock."
          [31] "However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass."
          [32] "In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels."
          [33] "Rodrguez-Vallejo et al. carried out life cycle analyses of naphtha cracking, propane dehydrogenation and MTO (using coal or natural gas as feedstocks)."
          [34] "In this analysis, the global warming potential (GWP), resource scarcity, impact on human health and the impact on the ecosystem was considered and quantified as a cost per kg of C3H6 produced."
          [35] "These data are shown in Table 1."
          [36] "In terms of the global warming potential of each process, the MTO based reactions are clearly worse than the naphtha cracking or direct dehydrogenation reactions, but the CO2 emissions of the coal-based feedstock is almost an order of magnitude higher than naphtha cracking."
          [37] "A similar trend was observed in the ecosystem category."
          [38] "This was measured in terms of local species lost integrated over time and underlines the gross negative impact of utilising coal as a feedstock in this chemistry."
          [39] "Resource scarcity was calculated based on the monetary burden of future mineral and fossil fuel extraction and shows that natural gas has around double the cost of that associated with propane, coal and naphtha."
          [40] "Finally, the cost to human health was estimated in terms of disability-adjusted life years, and naphtha cracking and propane dehydrogenation came out favourably compared to the MTO processes."
          [41] "Based on these metrics, it is clear that MTO from coal or natural gas has a larger environmental burden than SC or dehydrogenation."
          [42] "Opportunities for improving the sustainability of the dehydrogenation process were recently highlighted by Agarwal et al. who investigated various intensification and integration strategies."
          [43] "It was shown that such strategies, which involved additional waste heat recovery and off-gas recycling, up to 70% reductions in CO2 emissions were possible."
          [44] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
          [45] "Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane."
          [46] "Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum and the propane production industry has responded accordingly."
          [47] "The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale."
          [48] "TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year."
          [49] "Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year."
          [50] "The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation."
          [51] "While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity."
          [52] "Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel16 as well as glycerol17 and other substrates.18"
          [53] "With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this."
          [54] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
          [55] "However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield."
          [56] "These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review."
          [57] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
          [1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades."
          [2] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."
          [3] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based."
          [4] "However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene."
          [6] "While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component."
          [7] "These catalysts are amongst the most active and selective reported to date for this reaction."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2."
          [9] "Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."
          [10] "Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application."
          [11] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
          [12] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."
          [13] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
          [14] "Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority."
          [15] "With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate."

[1] "The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process."
          [2] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas."
          [3] "Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process."





Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2.
          The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9.
          Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO.
          For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream.
          The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.







Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable.





[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications."
          [2] "However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."
          [3] "Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention."
          [4] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."
          [5] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."





"Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has great potential to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, but the widely used Pt-based catalysts usually suffer from short-term stability and unsatisfactory propylene selectivity."















[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
          [2] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
          [3] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,4 ,5 ,6 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [4] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
          [5] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective."



Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent.1 The conventional propylene production processes include fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel.2 However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene. Thus, given these circumstances, a highly efficient way to produce propylene is urgently need, both scientifically and economically.3 In the past few years, multiple technologies for the production of propylene have been developed, such as the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process,4,5 FischerTropsch (FT) process,6 and propane dehydrogenation (PDH).7 Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products.715 In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap. Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions. The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable.



[1] "In the past several decades, light alkane dehydrogenation to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application."
          [2] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."
          [3] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."
          [4] "Although it is impossible to achieve the ideal state in practice, the actual results can approach this state very closely via the application of both an appropriate catalyst and the optimized reaction conditions."
          [5] "PDH is a high energy-consuming process."
          [6] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."
          [7] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."
          [8] "Thus, the actual reaction temperature and pressure for dehydrogenation plants should be determined by the variation trend of the equilibrium conversion with temperature and pressure as well as the severity of the unselective thermal reactions."
          [9] "Suitable reaction conditions are important not only for a commercial unit, but also for the exploration of new catalysts, which means that it is not worth carrying out an in-depth study on a catalyst possessing good performance only under the reaction conditions detached from engineering practice."

[1] "The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [2] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [3] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."
          [4] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties"
          [5] "A temperature range of 550 to 700 C results in reaching the equilibrium conversions of the atmospheric EDH reaction from ca. 10% to 40%, while the equilibrium conversion at 600 C corresponds to ca. 50% for the atmospheric PDH reaction."
          [6] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."
          [7] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
          [9] "Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene."
          [10] "Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes."
          [11] "Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene."





[1] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively. The Catofin process is operated at slightly positive atmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar, and the Oleflex process is usually operated at 13 bar, while the STAR process needs a higher pressure of 56 bar. Besides the catalytic system and the operation conditions especially the pressure, the other features like the type of reactor could also differ among the three processes."
          [2] "It has been proved that PtSn based catalysts could efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane, while the catalyst deactivation and the long-term stability issues are still the big challenges even for the aforementioned commercial catalysts."
          [3] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "The recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."
          [5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."
          [6] "The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."
          [7] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx. (7,8) The soft oxidant CO2 seems to be a good choice to overcome the problem, while it brings another challenge concerning the activation of CO2 to have it efficiently participate the reaction. (911) Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage."









[1] "Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
          [2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
          [3] "Especially, PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
          [4] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [5] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [2] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
          [3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [5] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
          [6] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [7] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [8] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."



[1] "The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."





Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal [2] , which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore.
          On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources [3] .
          The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost [ 4 ,5 ].

Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing. Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are widely applied in commercialized PDH processes, and both exhibit high activity and propylene yields. However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth.



[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
          [2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
          [3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
          [4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
          [5] "Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."
          [6] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."

[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
          [2] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction16."
          [3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15."
          [4] "According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."
          [5] "A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species."
          [6] "To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."
          [7] "Recently, we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane18,19,20."





Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on.1,2,3,4 The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum. Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways.





[1] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane."
          [2] "The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."
          [3] "Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field and to date there are several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH) (Sattler,2 2013), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2) (Atanga,3 2018) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2) (Carrero,4 2014 and Shi,5 2018)."
          [4] "The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 to identify over-arching themes and common rules for catalyst design."
          [5] "We do not try to capture aspects of reaction design and engineering, which itself is a vibrant field of research."
          [6] "We attempt to compare the performance of catalysts in the different sub-reactions by calculating a space time yield (STY), (measured in molC3H6 kgcat1 h1), which is based on the initial activity of the catalysts."
          [7] "Additionally, we emphasise the environmental and industrial perspectives of each reaction and the prospects for industrial application."
          [8] "Propene is a major platform chemical with a myriad of uses in the manufacturing and chemical industry."
          [9] "The majority of propene is used to manufacture polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer which is second only to polyethene in the scale of production."
          [10] "Polypropene has favourable physical properties such as high chemical resistance and good elasticity, which makes it useful in a broad range of applications, including packaging, manufacturing and in construction materials."
          [11] "Propene is also the precursor to many other polymer-related chemicals, including propene oxide (used to make polyurethane), acrylic acid (used to make acrylic polymers) and acrylonitrile (used to make polypropenonitrile)."
          [12] "Additionally, large scale chemicals such as isopropanol and cumene (used to manufacture phenol and acetone) are made from propene."
          [13] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030."
          [14] "Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
          [15] "Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."
          [16] "The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."
          [17] "The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation."
          [18] "Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant."
          [19] "This is summarised in Table 1, which compares steam cracking, MTO (from coal and natural gas) and dehydrogenation."
          [20] "Atom economy is a measurement of the percentage of atomic mass in the starting reagents that ends up in the final product."
          [21] "It serves as a useful indicator of how chemically efficient a process could be."
          [22] "It is important to remember that in practice, the real atom economy is determined by the selectivity of the catalyst, and the prevalence of side-reactions."
          [23] "Although it is not possible to precisely calculate the atom economy of SC or MTO due to the complexity of the process and uncertainty in the composition of the feedstock, it is apparent that both of these technologies are inferior to dehydrogenation."
          [24] "In the case of SC a wide range of chemicals are made, and while these are ultimately utilised in the production of other chemicals, the % of propene formed from such a process is low."
          [25] "Equally, in the MTO process from coal or natural gas, the atom economy is limited by the generation of H2O as a by-product."
          [26] "In contrast, in the case of dehydrogenation only H2 is generated as a by-product, meaning an atom economy of 95% is possible."
          [27] "With respect to the toxicity of the chemicals, SC forms various carcinogenic compounds, and the toxicity of methanol is well-established."
          [28] "In contrast, propane is non-hazardous."
          [29] "At present each of the feedstocks used in the main methods of propene production tend to be non-renewable."
          [30] "In the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock."
          [31] "However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass."
          [32] "In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels."
          [33] "Rodrguez-Vallejo et al. carried out life cycle analyses of naphtha cracking, propane dehydrogenation and MTO (using coal or natural gas as feedstocks)."
          [34] "In this analysis, the global warming potential (GWP), resource scarcity, impact on human health and the impact on the ecosystem was considered and quantified as a cost per kg of C3H6 produced."
          [35] "These data are shown in Table 1."
          [36] "In terms of the global warming potential of each process, the MTO based reactions are clearly worse than the naphtha cracking or direct dehydrogenation reactions, but the CO2 emissions of the coal-based feedstock is almost an order of magnitude higher than naphtha cracking."
          [37] "A similar trend was observed in the ecosystem category."
          [38] "This was measured in terms of local species lost integrated over time and underlines the gross negative impact of utilising coal as a feedstock in this chemistry."
          [39] "Resource scarcity was calculated based on the monetary burden of future mineral and fossil fuel extraction and shows that natural gas has around double the cost of that associated with propane, coal and naphtha."
          [40] "Finally, the cost to human health was estimated in terms of disability-adjusted life years, and naphtha cracking and propane dehydrogenation came out favourably compared to the MTO processes."
          [41] "Based on these metrics, it is clear that MTO from coal or natural gas has a larger environmental burden than SC or dehydrogenation."
          [42] "Opportunities for improving the sustainability of the dehydrogenation process were recently highlighted by Agarwal et al. who investigated various intensification and integration strategies."
          [43] "It was shown that such strategies, which involved additional waste heat recovery and off-gas recycling, up to 70% reductions in CO2 emissions were possible."
          [44] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
          [45] "Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane."
          [46] "Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum and the propane production industry has responded accordingly."
          [47] "The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale."
          [48] "TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year."
          [49] "Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year."
          [50] "The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation."
          [51] "While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity."
          [52] "Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel16 as well as glycerol17 and other substrates.18"
          [53] "With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this."
          [54] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
          [55] "However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield."
          [56] "These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review."
          [57] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
          [1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades."
          [2] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."
          [3] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based."
          [4] "However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene."
          [6] "While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component."
          [7] "These catalysts are amongst the most active and selective reported to date for this reaction."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2."
          [9] "Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."
          [10] "Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application."
          [11] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
          [12] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."
          [13] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
          [14] "Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority."
          [15] "With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate."

[1] "The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process."
          [2] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas."
          [3] "Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process."





Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2.
          The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9.
          Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO.
          For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream.
          The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.







Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable.





[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications."
          [2] "However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."
          [3] "Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention."
          [4] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."
          [5] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."





"Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has great potential to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, but the widely used Pt-based catalysts usually suffer from short-term stability and unsatisfactory propylene selectivity."















[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
          [2] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
          [3] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,4 ,5 ,6 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [4] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
          [5] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective."



Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent.1 The conventional propylene production processes include fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel.2 However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene. Thus, given these circumstances, a highly efficient way to produce propylene is urgently need, both scientifically and economically.3 In the past few years, multiple technologies for the production of propylene have been developed, such as the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process,4,5 FischerTropsch (FT) process,6 and propane dehydrogenation (PDH).7 Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products.715 In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap. Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions. The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable.



[1] "In the past several decades, light alkane dehydrogenation to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application."
          [2] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."
          [3] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."
          [4] "Although it is impossible to achieve the ideal state in practice, the actual results can approach this state very closely via the application of both an appropriate catalyst and the optimized reaction conditions."
          [5] "PDH is a high energy-consuming process."
          [6] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."
          [7] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."
          [8] "Thus, the actual reaction temperature and pressure for dehydrogenation plants should be determined by the variation trend of the equilibrium conversion with temperature and pressure as well as the severity of the unselective thermal reactions."
          [9] "Suitable reaction conditions are important not only for a commercial unit, but also for the exploration of new catalysts, which means that it is not worth carrying out an in-depth study on a catalyst possessing good performance only under the reaction conditions detached from engineering practice."

[1] "The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [2] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [3] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."
          [4] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties"
          [5] "A temperature range of 550 to 700 C results in reaching the equilibrium conversions of the atmospheric EDH reaction from ca. 10% to 40%, while the equilibrium conversion at 600 C corresponds to ca. 50% for the atmospheric PDH reaction."
          [6] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."
          [7] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
          [9] "Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene."
          [10] "Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes."
          [11] "Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene."





[1] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively. The Catofin process is operated at slightly positive atmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar, and the Oleflex process is usually operated at 13 bar, while the STAR process needs a higher pressure of 56 bar. Besides the catalytic system and the operation conditions especially the pressure, the other features like the type of reactor could also differ among the three processes."
          [2] "It has been proved that PtSn based catalysts could efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane, while the catalyst deactivation and the long-term stability issues are still the big challenges even for the aforementioned commercial catalysts."
          [3] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "The recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."
          [5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."
          [6] "The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."
          [7] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx. (7,8) The soft oxidant CO2 seems to be a good choice to overcome the problem, while it brings another challenge concerning the activation of CO2 to have it efficiently participate the reaction. (911) Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage."









[1] "Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
          [2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
          [3] "Especially, PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
          [4] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [5] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [2] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
          [3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [5] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
          [6] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [7] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [8] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."



[1] "The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."





Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal [2] , which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore.
          On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources [3] .
          The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost [ 4 ,5 ].

Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing. Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are widely applied in commercialized PDH processes, and both exhibit high activity and propylene yields. However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth.



[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
          [2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
          [3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
          [4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
          [5] "Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."
          [6] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."

[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
          [2] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction16."
          [3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15."
          [4] "According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."
          [5] "A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species."
          [6] "To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."
          [7] "Recently, we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane18,19,20."





Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on.1,2,3,4 The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum. Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways.





[1] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane."
          [2] "The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."
          [3] "Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field and to date there are several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH) (Sattler,2 2013), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2) (Atanga,3 2018) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2) (Carrero,4 2014 and Shi,5 2018)."
          [4] "The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 to identify over-arching themes and common rules for catalyst design."
          [5] "We do not try to capture aspects of reaction design and engineering, which itself is a vibrant field of research."
          [6] "We attempt to compare the performance of catalysts in the different sub-reactions by calculating a space time yield (STY), (measured in molC3H6 kgcat1 h1), which is based on the initial activity of the catalysts."
          [7] "Additionally, we emphasise the environmental and industrial perspectives of each reaction and the prospects for industrial application."
          [8] "Propene is a major platform chemical with a myriad of uses in the manufacturing and chemical industry."
          [9] "The majority of propene is used to manufacture polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer which is second only to polyethene in the scale of production."
          [10] "Polypropene has favourable physical properties such as high chemical resistance and good elasticity, which makes it useful in a broad range of applications, including packaging, manufacturing and in construction materials."
          [11] "Propene is also the precursor to many other polymer-related chemicals, including propene oxide (used to make polyurethane), acrylic acid (used to make acrylic polymers) and acrylonitrile (used to make polypropenonitrile)."
          [12] "Additionally, large scale chemicals such as isopropanol and cumene (used to manufacture phenol and acetone) are made from propene."
          [13] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030."
          [14] "Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
          [15] "Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."
          [16] "The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."
          [17] "The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation."
          [18] "Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant."
          [19] "This is summarised in Table 1, which compares steam cracking, MTO (from coal and natural gas) and dehydrogenation."
          [20] "Atom economy is a measurement of the percentage of atomic mass in the starting reagents that ends up in the final product."
          [21] "It serves as a useful indicator of how chemically efficient a process could be."
          [22] "It is important to remember that in practice, the real atom economy is determined by the selectivity of the catalyst, and the prevalence of side-reactions."
          [23] "Although it is not possible to precisely calculate the atom economy of SC or MTO due to the complexity of the process and uncertainty in the composition of the feedstock, it is apparent that both of these technologies are inferior to dehydrogenation."
          [24] "In the case of SC a wide range of chemicals are made, and while these are ultimately utilised in the production of other chemicals, the % of propene formed from such a process is low."
          [25] "Equally, in the MTO process from coal or natural gas, the atom economy is limited by the generation of H2O as a by-product."
          [26] "In contrast, in the case of dehydrogenation only H2 is generated as a by-product, meaning an atom economy of 95% is possible."
          [27] "With respect to the toxicity of the chemicals, SC forms various carcinogenic compounds, and the toxicity of methanol is well-established."
          [28] "In contrast, propane is non-hazardous."
          [29] "At present each of the feedstocks used in the main methods of propene production tend to be non-renewable."
          [30] "In the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock."
          [31] "However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass."
          [32] "In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels."
          [33] "Rodrguez-Vallejo et al. carried out life cycle analyses of naphtha cracking, propane dehydrogenation and MTO (using coal or natural gas as feedstocks)."
          [34] "In this analysis, the global warming potential (GWP), resource scarcity, impact on human health and the impact on the ecosystem was considered and quantified as a cost per kg of C3H6 produced."
          [35] "These data are shown in Table 1."
          [36] "In terms of the global warming potential of each process, the MTO based reactions are clearly worse than the naphtha cracking or direct dehydrogenation reactions, but the CO2 emissions of the coal-based feedstock is almost an order of magnitude higher than naphtha cracking."
          [37] "A similar trend was observed in the ecosystem category."
          [38] "This was measured in terms of local species lost integrated over time and underlines the gross negative impact of utilising coal as a feedstock in this chemistry."
          [39] "Resource scarcity was calculated based on the monetary burden of future mineral and fossil fuel extraction and shows that natural gas has around double the cost of that associated with propane, coal and naphtha."
          [40] "Finally, the cost to human health was estimated in terms of disability-adjusted life years, and naphtha cracking and propane dehydrogenation came out favourably compared to the MTO processes."
          [41] "Based on these metrics, it is clear that MTO from coal or natural gas has a larger environmental burden than SC or dehydrogenation."
          [42] "Opportunities for improving the sustainability of the dehydrogenation process were recently highlighted by Agarwal et al. who investigated various intensification and integration strategies."
          [43] "It was shown that such strategies, which involved additional waste heat recovery and off-gas recycling, up to 70% reductions in CO2 emissions were possible."
          [44] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
          [45] "Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane."
          [46] "Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum and the propane production industry has responded accordingly."
          [47] "The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale."
          [48] "TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year."
          [49] "Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year."
          [50] "The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation."
          [51] "While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity."
          [52] "Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel16 as well as glycerol17 and other substrates.18"
          [53] "With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this."
          [54] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
          [55] "However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield."
          [56] "These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review."
          [57] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
          [1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades."
          [2] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."
          [3] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based."
          [4] "However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene."
          [6] "While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component."
          [7] "These catalysts are amongst the most active and selective reported to date for this reaction."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2."
          [9] "Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."
          [10] "Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application."
          [11] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
          [12] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."
          [13] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
          [14] "Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority."
          [15] "With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate."

[1] "The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process."
          [2] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas."
          [3] "Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process."





Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2.
          The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9.
          Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO.
          For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream.
          The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.







Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable.





[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications."
          [2] "However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."
          [3] "Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention."
          [4] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."
          [5] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."





"Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has great potential to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, but the widely used Pt-based catalysts usually suffer from short-term stability and unsatisfactory propylene selectivity."















[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
          [2] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
          [3] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,4 ,5 ,6 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [4] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
          [5] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective."



Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent.1 The conventional propylene production processes include fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel.2 However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene. Thus, given these circumstances, a highly efficient way to produce propylene is urgently need, both scientifically and economically.3 In the past few years, multiple technologies for the production of propylene have been developed, such as the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process,4,5 FischerTropsch (FT) process,6 and propane dehydrogenation (PDH).7 Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products.715 In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap. Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions. The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable.



[1] "In the past several decades, light alkane dehydrogenation to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application."
          [2] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."
          [3] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."
          [4] "Although it is impossible to achieve the ideal state in practice, the actual results can approach this state very closely via the application of both an appropriate catalyst and the optimized reaction conditions."
          [5] "PDH is a high energy-consuming process."
          [6] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."
          [7] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."
          [8] "Thus, the actual reaction temperature and pressure for dehydrogenation plants should be determined by the variation trend of the equilibrium conversion with temperature and pressure as well as the severity of the unselective thermal reactions."
          [9] "Suitable reaction conditions are important not only for a commercial unit, but also for the exploration of new catalysts, which means that it is not worth carrying out an in-depth study on a catalyst possessing good performance only under the reaction conditions detached from engineering practice."

[1] "The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [2] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [3] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."
          [4] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties"
          [5] "A temperature range of 550 to 700 C results in reaching the equilibrium conversions of the atmospheric EDH reaction from ca. 10% to 40%, while the equilibrium conversion at 600 C corresponds to ca. 50% for the atmospheric PDH reaction."
          [6] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."
          [7] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
          [9] "Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene."
          [10] "Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes."
          [11] "Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene."





[1] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively. The Catofin process is operated at slightly positive atmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar, and the Oleflex process is usually operated at 13 bar, while the STAR process needs a higher pressure of 56 bar. Besides the catalytic system and the operation conditions especially the pressure, the other features like the type of reactor could also differ among the three processes."
          [2] "It has been proved that PtSn based catalysts could efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane, while the catalyst deactivation and the long-term stability issues are still the big challenges even for the aforementioned commercial catalysts."
          [3] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "The recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."
          [5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."
          [6] "The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."
          [7] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx. (7,8) The soft oxidant CO2 seems to be a good choice to overcome the problem, while it brings another challenge concerning the activation of CO2 to have it efficiently participate the reaction. (911) Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage."









[1] "Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
          [2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
          [3] "Especially, PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
          [4] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [5] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [2] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
          [3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [5] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
          [6] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [7] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [8] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."



[1] "The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."





Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal [2] , which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore.
          On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources [3] .
          The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost [ 4 ,5 ].

Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing. Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are widely applied in commercialized PDH processes, and both exhibit high activity and propylene yields. However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth.



[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
          [2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
          [3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
          [4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
          [5] "Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."
          [6] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."

[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
          [2] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction16."
          [3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15."
          [4] "According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."
          [5] "A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species."
          [6] "To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."
          [7] "Recently, we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane18,19,20."





Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on.1,2,3,4 The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum. Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways.





[1] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane."
          [2] "The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."
          [3] "Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field and to date there are several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH) (Sattler,2 2013), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2) (Atanga,3 2018) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2) (Carrero,4 2014 and Shi,5 2018)."
          [4] "The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 to identify over-arching themes and common rules for catalyst design."
          [5] "We do not try to capture aspects of reaction design and engineering, which itself is a vibrant field of research."
          [6] "We attempt to compare the performance of catalysts in the different sub-reactions by calculating a space time yield (STY), (measured in molC3H6 kgcat1 h1), which is based on the initial activity of the catalysts."
          [7] "Additionally, we emphasise the environmental and industrial perspectives of each reaction and the prospects for industrial application."
          [8] "Propene is a major platform chemical with a myriad of uses in the manufacturing and chemical industry."
          [9] "The majority of propene is used to manufacture polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer which is second only to polyethene in the scale of production."
          [10] "Polypropene has favourable physical properties such as high chemical resistance and good elasticity, which makes it useful in a broad range of applications, including packaging, manufacturing and in construction materials."
          [11] "Propene is also the precursor to many other polymer-related chemicals, including propene oxide (used to make polyurethane), acrylic acid (used to make acrylic polymers) and acrylonitrile (used to make polypropenonitrile)."
          [12] "Additionally, large scale chemicals such as isopropanol and cumene (used to manufacture phenol and acetone) are made from propene."
          [13] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030."
          [14] "Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
          [15] "Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."
          [16] "The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."
          [17] "The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation."
          [18] "Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant."
          [19] "This is summarised in Table 1, which compares steam cracking, MTO (from coal and natural gas) and dehydrogenation."
          [20] "Atom economy is a measurement of the percentage of atomic mass in the starting reagents that ends up in the final product."
          [21] "It serves as a useful indicator of how chemically efficient a process could be."
          [22] "It is important to remember that in practice, the real atom economy is determined by the selectivity of the catalyst, and the prevalence of side-reactions."
          [23] "Although it is not possible to precisely calculate the atom economy of SC or MTO due to the complexity of the process and uncertainty in the composition of the feedstock, it is apparent that both of these technologies are inferior to dehydrogenation."
          [24] "In the case of SC a wide range of chemicals are made, and while these are ultimately utilised in the production of other chemicals, the % of propene formed from such a process is low."
          [25] "Equally, in the MTO process from coal or natural gas, the atom economy is limited by the generation of H2O as a by-product."
          [26] "In contrast, in the case of dehydrogenation only H2 is generated as a by-product, meaning an atom economy of 95% is possible."
          [27] "With respect to the toxicity of the chemicals, SC forms various carcinogenic compounds, and the toxicity of methanol is well-established."
          [28] "In contrast, propane is non-hazardous."
          [29] "At present each of the feedstocks used in the main methods of propene production tend to be non-renewable."
          [30] "In the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock."
          [31] "However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass."
          [32] "In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels."
          [33] "Rodrguez-Vallejo et al. carried out life cycle analyses of naphtha cracking, propane dehydrogenation and MTO (using coal or natural gas as feedstocks)."
          [34] "In this analysis, the global warming potential (GWP), resource scarcity, impact on human health and the impact on the ecosystem was considered and quantified as a cost per kg of C3H6 produced."
          [35] "These data are shown in Table 1."
          [36] "In terms of the global warming potential of each process, the MTO based reactions are clearly worse than the naphtha cracking or direct dehydrogenation reactions, but the CO2 emissions of the coal-based feedstock is almost an order of magnitude higher than naphtha cracking."
          [37] "A similar trend was observed in the ecosystem category."
          [38] "This was measured in terms of local species lost integrated over time and underlines the gross negative impact of utilising coal as a feedstock in this chemistry."
          [39] "Resource scarcity was calculated based on the monetary burden of future mineral and fossil fuel extraction and shows that natural gas has around double the cost of that associated with propane, coal and naphtha."
          [40] "Finally, the cost to human health was estimated in terms of disability-adjusted life years, and naphtha cracking and propane dehydrogenation came out favourably compared to the MTO processes."
          [41] "Based on these metrics, it is clear that MTO from coal or natural gas has a larger environmental burden than SC or dehydrogenation."
          [42] "Opportunities for improving the sustainability of the dehydrogenation process were recently highlighted by Agarwal et al. who investigated various intensification and integration strategies."
          [43] "It was shown that such strategies, which involved additional waste heat recovery and off-gas recycling, up to 70% reductions in CO2 emissions were possible."
          [44] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
          [45] "Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane."
          [46] "Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum and the propane production industry has responded accordingly."
          [47] "The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale."
          [48] "TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year."
          [49] "Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year."
          [50] "The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation."
          [51] "While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity."
          [52] "Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel16 as well as glycerol17 and other substrates.18"
          [53] "With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this."
          [54] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
          [55] "However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield."
          [56] "These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review."
          [57] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
          [1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades."
          [2] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."
          [3] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based."
          [4] "However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene."
          [6] "While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component."
          [7] "These catalysts are amongst the most active and selective reported to date for this reaction."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2."
          [9] "Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."
          [10] "Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application."
          [11] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
          [12] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."
          [13] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
          [14] "Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority."
          [15] "With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate."

[1] "The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process."
          [2] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas."
          [3] "Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process."





Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2.
          The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9.
          Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO.
          For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream.
          The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.







Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable.





[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications."
          [2] "However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."
          [3] "Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention."
          [4] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."
          [5] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."





"Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has great potential to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, but the widely used Pt-based catalysts usually suffer from short-term stability and unsatisfactory propylene selectivity."















[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
          [2] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
          [3] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,4 ,5 ,6 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [4] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
          [5] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective."



Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent.1 The conventional propylene production processes include fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel.2 However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene. Thus, given these circumstances, a highly efficient way to produce propylene is urgently need, both scientifically and economically.3 In the past few years, multiple technologies for the production of propylene have been developed, such as the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process,4,5 FischerTropsch (FT) process,6 and propane dehydrogenation (PDH).7 Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products.715 In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap. Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions. The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable.



[1] "In the past several decades, light alkane dehydrogenation to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application."
          [2] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."
          [3] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."
          [4] "Although it is impossible to achieve the ideal state in practice, the actual results can approach this state very closely via the application of both an appropriate catalyst and the optimized reaction conditions."
          [5] "PDH is a high energy-consuming process."
          [6] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."
          [7] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."
          [8] "Thus, the actual reaction temperature and pressure for dehydrogenation plants should be determined by the variation trend of the equilibrium conversion with temperature and pressure as well as the severity of the unselective thermal reactions."
          [9] "Suitable reaction conditions are important not only for a commercial unit, but also for the exploration of new catalysts, which means that it is not worth carrying out an in-depth study on a catalyst possessing good performance only under the reaction conditions detached from engineering practice."

[1] "The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [2] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [3] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."
          [4] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties"
          [5] "A temperature range of 550 to 700 C results in reaching the equilibrium conversions of the atmospheric EDH reaction from ca. 10% to 40%, while the equilibrium conversion at 600 C corresponds to ca. 50% for the atmospheric PDH reaction."
          [6] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."
          [7] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
          [9] "Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene."
          [10] "Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes."
          [11] "Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene."





[1] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively. The Catofin process is operated at slightly positive atmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar, and the Oleflex process is usually operated at 13 bar, while the STAR process needs a higher pressure of 56 bar. Besides the catalytic system and the operation conditions especially the pressure, the other features like the type of reactor could also differ among the three processes."
          [2] "It has been proved that PtSn based catalysts could efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane, while the catalyst deactivation and the long-term stability issues are still the big challenges even for the aforementioned commercial catalysts."
          [3] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "The recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."
          [5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."
          [6] "The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."
          [7] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx. (7,8) The soft oxidant CO2 seems to be a good choice to overcome the problem, while it brings another challenge concerning the activation of CO2 to have it efficiently participate the reaction. (911) Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage."









[1] "Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
          [2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
          [3] "Especially, PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
          [4] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [5] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [2] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
          [3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [5] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
          [6] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [7] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [8] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."



[1] "The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."





Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal [2] , which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore.
          On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources [3] .
          The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost [ 4 ,5 ].

Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing. Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are widely applied in commercialized PDH processes, and both exhibit high activity and propylene yields. However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth.



[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
          [2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
          [3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
          [4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
          [5] "Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."
          [6] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."

[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
          [2] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction16."
          [3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15."
          [4] "According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."
          [5] "A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species."
          [6] "To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."
          [7] "Recently, we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane18,19,20."





Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on.1,2,3,4 The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum. Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways.





[1] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane."
          [2] "The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."
          [3] "Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field and to date there are several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH) (Sattler,2 2013), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2) (Atanga,3 2018) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2) (Carrero,4 2014 and Shi,5 2018)."
          [4] "The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 to identify over-arching themes and common rules for catalyst design."
          [5] "We do not try to capture aspects of reaction design and engineering, which itself is a vibrant field of research."
          [6] "We attempt to compare the performance of catalysts in the different sub-reactions by calculating a space time yield (STY), (measured in molC3H6 kgcat1 h1), which is based on the initial activity of the catalysts."
          [7] "Additionally, we emphasise the environmental and industrial perspectives of each reaction and the prospects for industrial application."
          [8] "Propene is a major platform chemical with a myriad of uses in the manufacturing and chemical industry."
          [9] "The majority of propene is used to manufacture polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer which is second only to polyethene in the scale of production."
          [10] "Polypropene has favourable physical properties such as high chemical resistance and good elasticity, which makes it useful in a broad range of applications, including packaging, manufacturing and in construction materials."
          [11] "Propene is also the precursor to many other polymer-related chemicals, including propene oxide (used to make polyurethane), acrylic acid (used to make acrylic polymers) and acrylonitrile (used to make polypropenonitrile)."
          [12] "Additionally, large scale chemicals such as isopropanol and cumene (used to manufacture phenol and acetone) are made from propene."
          [13] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030."
          [14] "Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
          [15] "Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."
          [16] "The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."
          [17] "The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation."
          [18] "Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant."
          [19] "This is summarised in Table 1, which compares steam cracking, MTO (from coal and natural gas) and dehydrogenation."
          [20] "Atom economy is a measurement of the percentage of atomic mass in the starting reagents that ends up in the final product."
          [21] "It serves as a useful indicator of how chemically efficient a process could be."
          [22] "It is important to remember that in practice, the real atom economy is determined by the selectivity of the catalyst, and the prevalence of side-reactions."
          [23] "Although it is not possible to precisely calculate the atom economy of SC or MTO due to the complexity of the process and uncertainty in the composition of the feedstock, it is apparent that both of these technologies are inferior to dehydrogenation."
          [24] "In the case of SC a wide range of chemicals are made, and while these are ultimately utilised in the production of other chemicals, the % of propene formed from such a process is low."
          [25] "Equally, in the MTO process from coal or natural gas, the atom economy is limited by the generation of H2O as a by-product."
          [26] "In contrast, in the case of dehydrogenation only H2 is generated as a by-product, meaning an atom economy of 95% is possible."
          [27] "With respect to the toxicity of the chemicals, SC forms various carcinogenic compounds, and the toxicity of methanol is well-established."
          [28] "In contrast, propane is non-hazardous."
          [29] "At present each of the feedstocks used in the main methods of propene production tend to be non-renewable."
          [30] "In the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock."
          [31] "However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass."
          [32] "In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels."
          [33] "Rodrguez-Vallejo et al. carried out life cycle analyses of naphtha cracking, propane dehydrogenation and MTO (using coal or natural gas as feedstocks)."
          [34] "In this analysis, the global warming potential (GWP), resource scarcity, impact on human health and the impact on the ecosystem was considered and quantified as a cost per kg of C3H6 produced."
          [35] "These data are shown in Table 1."
          [36] "In terms of the global warming potential of each process, the MTO based reactions are clearly worse than the naphtha cracking or direct dehydrogenation reactions, but the CO2 emissions of the coal-based feedstock is almost an order of magnitude higher than naphtha cracking."
          [37] "A similar trend was observed in the ecosystem category."
          [38] "This was measured in terms of local species lost integrated over time and underlines the gross negative impact of utilising coal as a feedstock in this chemistry."
          [39] "Resource scarcity was calculated based on the monetary burden of future mineral and fossil fuel extraction and shows that natural gas has around double the cost of that associated with propane, coal and naphtha."
          [40] "Finally, the cost to human health was estimated in terms of disability-adjusted life years, and naphtha cracking and propane dehydrogenation came out favourably compared to the MTO processes."
          [41] "Based on these metrics, it is clear that MTO from coal or natural gas has a larger environmental burden than SC or dehydrogenation."
          [42] "Opportunities for improving the sustainability of the dehydrogenation process were recently highlighted by Agarwal et al. who investigated various intensification and integration strategies."
          [43] "It was shown that such strategies, which involved additional waste heat recovery and off-gas recycling, up to 70% reductions in CO2 emissions were possible."
          [44] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
          [45] "Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane."
          [46] "Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum and the propane production industry has responded accordingly."
          [47] "The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale."
          [48] "TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year."
          [49] "Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year."
          [50] "The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation."
          [51] "While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity."
          [52] "Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel16 as well as glycerol17 and other substrates.18"
          [53] "With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this."
          [54] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
          [55] "However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield."
          [56] "These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review."
          [57] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
          [1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades."
          [2] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."
          [3] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based."
          [4] "However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene."
          [6] "While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component."
          [7] "These catalysts are amongst the most active and selective reported to date for this reaction."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2."
          [9] "Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."
          [10] "Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application."
          [11] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
          [12] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."
          [13] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
          [14] "Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority."
          [15] "With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate."

[1] "The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process."
          [2] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas."
          [3] "Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process."





Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2.
          The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9.
          Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO.
          For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream.
          The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.







Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable.





[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications."
          [2] "However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."
          [3] "Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention."
          [4] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."
          [5] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."





"Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has great potential to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, but the widely used Pt-based catalysts usually suffer from short-term stability and unsatisfactory propylene selectivity."















[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
          [2] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
          [3] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,4 ,5 ,6 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [4] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
          [5] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective."



Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent.1 The conventional propylene production processes include fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel.2 However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene. Thus, given these circumstances, a highly efficient way to produce propylene is urgently need, both scientifically and economically.3 In the past few years, multiple technologies for the production of propylene have been developed, such as the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process,4,5 FischerTropsch (FT) process,6 and propane dehydrogenation (PDH).7 Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products.715 In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap. Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions. The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable.



[1] "In the past several decades, light alkane dehydrogenation to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application."
          [2] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."
          [3] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."
          [4] "Although it is impossible to achieve the ideal state in practice, the actual results can approach this state very closely via the application of both an appropriate catalyst and the optimized reaction conditions."
          [5] "PDH is a high energy-consuming process."
          [6] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."
          [7] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."
          [8] "Thus, the actual reaction temperature and pressure for dehydrogenation plants should be determined by the variation trend of the equilibrium conversion with temperature and pressure as well as the severity of the unselective thermal reactions."
          [9] "Suitable reaction conditions are important not only for a commercial unit, but also for the exploration of new catalysts, which means that it is not worth carrying out an in-depth study on a catalyst possessing good performance only under the reaction conditions detached from engineering practice."

[1] "The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [2] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [3] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."
          [4] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties"
          [5] "A temperature range of 550 to 700 C results in reaching the equilibrium conversions of the atmospheric EDH reaction from ca. 10% to 40%, while the equilibrium conversion at 600 C corresponds to ca. 50% for the atmospheric PDH reaction."
          [6] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."
          [7] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
          [9] "Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene."
          [10] "Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes."
          [11] "Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene."





[1] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively. The Catofin process is operated at slightly positive atmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar, and the Oleflex process is usually operated at 13 bar, while the STAR process needs a higher pressure of 56 bar. Besides the catalytic system and the operation conditions especially the pressure, the other features like the type of reactor could also differ among the three processes."
          [2] "It has been proved that PtSn based catalysts could efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane, while the catalyst deactivation and the long-term stability issues are still the big challenges even for the aforementioned commercial catalysts."
          [3] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "The recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."
          [5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."
          [6] "The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."
          [7] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx. (7,8) The soft oxidant CO2 seems to be a good choice to overcome the problem, while it brings another challenge concerning the activation of CO2 to have it efficiently participate the reaction. (911) Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage."









[1] "Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
          [2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
          [3] "Especially, PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
          [4] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [5] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [2] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
          [3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [5] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
          [6] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [7] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [8] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."



[1] "The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."





Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal [2] , which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore.
          On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources [3] .
          The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost [ 4 ,5 ].

Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing. Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are widely applied in commercialized PDH processes, and both exhibit high activity and propylene yields. However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth.



[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
          [2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
          [3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
          [4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
          [5] "Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."
          [6] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."

[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
          [2] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction16."
          [3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15."
          [4] "According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."
          [5] "A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species."
          [6] "To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."
          [7] "Recently, we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane18,19,20."





Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on.1,2,3,4 The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum. Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways.





[1] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane."
          [2] "The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."
          [3] "Research into propane dehydrogenation is an ever-growing field and to date there are several review articles available on direct dehydrogenation (DDH) (Sattler,2 2013), soft oxidation with CO2 (ODH-CO2) (Atanga,3 2018) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-O2) (Carrero,4 2014 and Shi,5 2018)."
          [4] "The scope of this article is to critically review the literature on DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 to identify over-arching themes and common rules for catalyst design."
          [5] "We do not try to capture aspects of reaction design and engineering, which itself is a vibrant field of research."
          [6] "We attempt to compare the performance of catalysts in the different sub-reactions by calculating a space time yield (STY), (measured in molC3H6 kgcat1 h1), which is based on the initial activity of the catalysts."
          [7] "Additionally, we emphasise the environmental and industrial perspectives of each reaction and the prospects for industrial application."
          [8] "Propene is a major platform chemical with a myriad of uses in the manufacturing and chemical industry."
          [9] "The majority of propene is used to manufacture polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer which is second only to polyethene in the scale of production."
          [10] "Polypropene has favourable physical properties such as high chemical resistance and good elasticity, which makes it useful in a broad range of applications, including packaging, manufacturing and in construction materials."
          [11] "Propene is also the precursor to many other polymer-related chemicals, including propene oxide (used to make polyurethane), acrylic acid (used to make acrylic polymers) and acrylonitrile (used to make polypropenonitrile)."
          [12] "Additionally, large scale chemicals such as isopropanol and cumene (used to manufacture phenol and acetone) are made from propene."
          [13] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030."
          [14] "Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
          [15] "Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."
          [16] "The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."
          [17] "The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation."
          [18] "Green chemistry principles, such as atom economy, the use of toxic chemicals and the renewability of the feedstock, are especially relevant."
          [19] "This is summarised in Table 1, which compares steam cracking, MTO (from coal and natural gas) and dehydrogenation."
          [20] "Atom economy is a measurement of the percentage of atomic mass in the starting reagents that ends up in the final product."
          [21] "It serves as a useful indicator of how chemically efficient a process could be."
          [22] "It is important to remember that in practice, the real atom economy is determined by the selectivity of the catalyst, and the prevalence of side-reactions."
          [23] "Although it is not possible to precisely calculate the atom economy of SC or MTO due to the complexity of the process and uncertainty in the composition of the feedstock, it is apparent that both of these technologies are inferior to dehydrogenation."
          [24] "In the case of SC a wide range of chemicals are made, and while these are ultimately utilised in the production of other chemicals, the % of propene formed from such a process is low."
          [25] "Equally, in the MTO process from coal or natural gas, the atom economy is limited by the generation of H2O as a by-product."
          [26] "In contrast, in the case of dehydrogenation only H2 is generated as a by-product, meaning an atom economy of 95% is possible."
          [27] "With respect to the toxicity of the chemicals, SC forms various carcinogenic compounds, and the toxicity of methanol is well-established."
          [28] "In contrast, propane is non-hazardous."
          [29] "At present each of the feedstocks used in the main methods of propene production tend to be non-renewable."
          [30] "In the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock."
          [31] "However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass."
          [32] "In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels."
          [33] "Rodrguez-Vallejo et al. carried out life cycle analyses of naphtha cracking, propane dehydrogenation and MTO (using coal or natural gas as feedstocks)."
          [34] "In this analysis, the global warming potential (GWP), resource scarcity, impact on human health and the impact on the ecosystem was considered and quantified as a cost per kg of C3H6 produced."
          [35] "These data are shown in Table 1."
          [36] "In terms of the global warming potential of each process, the MTO based reactions are clearly worse than the naphtha cracking or direct dehydrogenation reactions, but the CO2 emissions of the coal-based feedstock is almost an order of magnitude higher than naphtha cracking."
          [37] "A similar trend was observed in the ecosystem category."
          [38] "This was measured in terms of local species lost integrated over time and underlines the gross negative impact of utilising coal as a feedstock in this chemistry."
          [39] "Resource scarcity was calculated based on the monetary burden of future mineral and fossil fuel extraction and shows that natural gas has around double the cost of that associated with propane, coal and naphtha."
          [40] "Finally, the cost to human health was estimated in terms of disability-adjusted life years, and naphtha cracking and propane dehydrogenation came out favourably compared to the MTO processes."
          [41] "Based on these metrics, it is clear that MTO from coal or natural gas has a larger environmental burden than SC or dehydrogenation."
          [42] "Opportunities for improving the sustainability of the dehydrogenation process were recently highlighted by Agarwal et al. who investigated various intensification and integration strategies."
          [43] "It was shown that such strategies, which involved additional waste heat recovery and off-gas recycling, up to 70% reductions in CO2 emissions were possible."
          [44] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
          [45] "Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane."
          [46] "Increasing public pressure to move away from such non-renewable feedstocks continues to gain momentum and the propane production industry has responded accordingly."
          [47] "The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale."
          [48] "TotalEnergies operates a bio-refinery in La Mede, which has a design capacity for bio-propane of 25000 tonnes per year."
          [49] "Additionally, Neste recently opened a renewable propane production plant, which will produce 40000 tonnes per year."
          [50] "The propane generated is then sold on to be used in direct propane dehydrogenation."
          [51] "While this is an important start, it represents less than 1% of annual propane capacity."
          [52] "Bio-propane can be produced from the processing of biomass, notably as a side-product in the production of bio-diesel16 as well as glycerol17 and other substrates.18"
          [53] "With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this."
          [54] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
          [55] "However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield."
          [56] "These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review."
          [57] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
          [1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades."
          [2] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."
          [3] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based."
          [4] "However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene."
          [6] "While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component."
          [7] "These catalysts are amongst the most active and selective reported to date for this reaction."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2."
          [9] "Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."
          [10] "Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application."
          [11] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
          [12] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."
          [13] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
          [14] "Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority."
          [15] "With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate."

[1] "The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process."
          [2] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas."
          [3] "Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process."





Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2.
          The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9.
          Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO.
          For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream.
          The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.







Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable.





[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications."
          [2] "However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."
          [3] "Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention."
          [4] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."
          [5] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."





"Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has great potential to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, but the widely used Pt-based catalysts usually suffer from short-term stability and unsatisfactory propylene selectivity."















[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
          [2] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
          [3] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,4 ,5 ,6 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [4] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
          [5] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective."



Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent.1 The conventional propylene production processes include fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel.2 However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene. Thus, given these circumstances, a highly efficient way to produce propylene is urgently need, both scientifically and economically.3 In the past few years, multiple technologies for the production of propylene have been developed, such as the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process,4,5 FischerTropsch (FT) process,6 and propane dehydrogenation (PDH).7 Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products.715 In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap. Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions. The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable.



[1] "In the past several decades, light alkane dehydrogenation to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application."
          [2] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."
          [3] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."
          [4] "Although it is impossible to achieve the ideal state in practice, the actual results can approach this state very closely via the application of both an appropriate catalyst and the optimized reaction conditions."
          [5] "PDH is a high energy-consuming process."
          [6] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."
          [7] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."
          [8] "Thus, the actual reaction temperature and pressure for dehydrogenation plants should be determined by the variation trend of the equilibrium conversion with temperature and pressure as well as the severity of the unselective thermal reactions."
          [9] "Suitable reaction conditions are important not only for a commercial unit, but also for the exploration of new catalysts, which means that it is not worth carrying out an in-depth study on a catalyst possessing good performance only under the reaction conditions detached from engineering practice."

[1] "The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [2] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
          [3] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."
          [4] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties"
          [5] "A temperature range of 550 to 700 C results in reaching the equilibrium conversions of the atmospheric EDH reaction from ca. 10% to 40%, while the equilibrium conversion at 600 C corresponds to ca. 50% for the atmospheric PDH reaction."
          [6] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."
          [7] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
          [9] "Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene."
          [10] "Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes."
          [11] "Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene."





[1] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively. The Catofin process is operated at slightly positive atmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar, and the Oleflex process is usually operated at 13 bar, while the STAR process needs a higher pressure of 56 bar. Besides the catalytic system and the operation conditions especially the pressure, the other features like the type of reactor could also differ among the three processes."
          [2] "It has been proved that PtSn based catalysts could efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane, while the catalyst deactivation and the long-term stability issues are still the big challenges even for the aforementioned commercial catalysts."
          [3] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "The recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."
          [5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."
          [6] "The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."
          [7] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx. (7,8) The soft oxidant CO2 seems to be a good choice to overcome the problem, while it brings another challenge concerning the activation of CO2 to have it efficiently participate the reaction. (911) Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage."









[1] "Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
          [2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
          [3] "Especially, PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
          [4] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [5] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [2] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
          [3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [5] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
          [6] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [7] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [8] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."



[1] "The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."
