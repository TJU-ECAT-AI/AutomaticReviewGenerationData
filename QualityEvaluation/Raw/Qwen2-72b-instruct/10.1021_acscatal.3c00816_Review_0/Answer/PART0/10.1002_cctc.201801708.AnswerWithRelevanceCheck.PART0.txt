          Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on.1,2,3,4 The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum. Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways.

          Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) is considered one of the most effective methods for propylene production due to the abundant supply of propane and the significant price difference between propane and propylene. This method specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, as it can produce sufficient propylene to meet market demand without relying on depleting petroleum resources. PDH technology utilizes abundant propane resources and takes advantage of the significant price difference between propane and propylene, making it one of the most promising methods for propylene production. It specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, as the traditional methods of producing propylene, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), are unable to meet the growing demand due to the depletion of petroleum resources.

          由于丙烷资源丰富，丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差距巨大，丙烷直接脱氢制丙烯（PDH）被认为是生产丙烯最有效的方法之一。该方法特别解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战，因为它可以在不依赖枯竭的石油资源的情况下生产足够的丙烯以满足市场需求。PDH技术利用丰富的丙烷资源，利用丙烷和丙烯之间的巨大价格差距，被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法之一。它特别解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战，因为传统的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC），由于石油资源的枯竭，无法满足日益增长的需求。
