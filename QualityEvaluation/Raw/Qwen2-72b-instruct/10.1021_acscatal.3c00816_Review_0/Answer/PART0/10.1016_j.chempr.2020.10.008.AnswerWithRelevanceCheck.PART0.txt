          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
          [2] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
          [3] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,4 ,5 ,6 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [4] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
          [5] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is becoming increasingly promising for propylene production due to the shift in feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, driven by the emergence of shale gas and the growing availability of natural gas. This technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH is an energy-intensive process due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions, requiring high reaction temperatures. This presents significant challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability, as larger ensembles of active sites can catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke. To overcome these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has proven to be effective.

          由于页岩气的出现和天然气供应的增加，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术正成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法之一，因为原料从石脑油转向了轻质烷烃。这项技术解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。PDH是一种能源密集型过程，由于反应的高正焓（ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1），需要高温反应，这对烯烃的选择性和催化剂的稳定性提出了重大挑战。特别是，已经证明，较大的活性位点集合会催化结构敏感的副反应，包括裂解和深度脱氢，导致C1和C2分子以及焦炭的产生。为了克服这些挑战，活性位点隔离策略已被证明是有效的。
