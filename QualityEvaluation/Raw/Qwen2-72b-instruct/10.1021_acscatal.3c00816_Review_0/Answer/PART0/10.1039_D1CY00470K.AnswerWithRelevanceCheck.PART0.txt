          The literature highlights the growing demand for propylene and the potential of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative production route using abundant propane feedstock from shale gas reserves. PDH could directly produce propylene from propane, which is attractive given the increasing market demand for propylene and the availability of cheap and abundant alkanes from shale gas reserves. The key advantages of PDH likely include better feedstock availability, potentially higher process efficiency, and improved product selectivity compared to traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil. PDH may offer benefits in terms of feedstock availability, potentially lower production costs, and direct production of propylene without the need for complex cracking processes. PDH may offer benefits in terms of feedstock availability, potentially lower costs due to the use of abundant shale gas, and a more direct process for producing propylene, which could enhance process efficiency and product selectivity compared to traditional methods that rely on naphtha or heavy oil. The literature focuses on the development of a highly active, selective, and durable catalyst for PDH, which could enhance process efficiency and product selectivity.

          文献确实强调了丙烯需求的增加以及丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）作为利用页岩气储备中丰富的丙烷原料的替代生产路线的潜力。PDH可以直接从丙烷生产丙烯，这在丙烯市场需求增加和页岩气储备中廉价且丰富的烷烃可用性的情况下具有吸引力。PDH的关键优势可能包括更好的原料可用性，潜在的更高过程效率，以及与传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解和重油流化催化裂化方法相比，产品选择性得到改善。PDH可能在原料供应、潜在的生产成本降低以及无需复杂的裂解过程直接生产丙烯方面提供优势。这表明PDH可能在原料供应方面提供优势，由于使用丰富的页岩气，可能成本更低，与依赖石脑油或重油的传统方法相比，生产丙烯的过程更直接，这可能提高过程效率和产品选择性。文献重点开发了一种用于PDH的高活性、选择性和耐用催化剂，这可能有助于提高过程效率和产品选择性。
