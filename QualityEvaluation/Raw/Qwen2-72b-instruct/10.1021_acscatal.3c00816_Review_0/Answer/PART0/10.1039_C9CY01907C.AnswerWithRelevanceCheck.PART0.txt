          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is a sustainable approach and an attractive catalytic route with higher selectivity than other methods to produce propene. It addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by providing a more environmentally friendly, direct, and efficient method for propene production from propane, which is abundant and can be sourced from various feedstocks including natural gas, refinery off-gases, and petrochemical processes. PDH technology also offers higher selectivity to propene compared to other methods, which can result in higher yields and lower production costs.
