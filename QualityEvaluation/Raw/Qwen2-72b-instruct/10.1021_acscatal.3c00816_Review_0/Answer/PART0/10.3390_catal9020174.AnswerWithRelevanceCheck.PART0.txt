          [1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
          [2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
          [3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
          [4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
          [5] "Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."
          [6] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic and process efficiency advantages. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by providing an alternative route that is not dependent on petroleum resources, which are becoming increasingly scarce. PDH is a commercially available technology that can directly convert propane into propylene, making it the most economical and shortest route for propylene production. However, the PDH process is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited, requiring high temperatures to promote catalytic activity. This high-temperature operation facilitates side reactions such as thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, leading to low propylene selectivity and rapid catalyst deactivation. Therefore, the development of PDH technology, especially in terms of improving the efficiency of catalysts with high selectivity and stability under severe operating conditions, is a significant challenge for the industrial production of propylene.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它在经济性和工艺效率方面具有优势。它通过提供一条不依赖于日益稀缺的石油资源的替代路线，解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。PDH是一种可商业获得的技术，可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，使其成为生产丙烯最经济、最短的途径。然而，PDH过程是高度吸热和平衡限制的，需要高温来促进催化活性。这种高温操作促进了热/催化裂解和焦炭形成等副反应，导致丙烯选择性低和催化剂快速失活。因此，PDH技术的发展，特别是在提高催化剂在恶劣操作条件下具有高选择性和稳定性的效率方面，是工业生产丙烯的重大挑战。
