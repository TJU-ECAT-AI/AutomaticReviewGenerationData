          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology can utilize abundant shale gas resources as feedstock, which are widely available and cost-effective compared to traditional feedstocks like naphtha. The process efficiency of PDH is high, with a high conversion rate of propane to propylene, and it offers a high selectivity for propylene production, minimizing the formation of by-products. Additionally, PDH technology can be implemented in a modular fashion, allowing for flexible production capacity and lower capital costs compared to large-scale petrochemical plants. It is highlighted as an on-purpose non-oxidative process that has caught much attention recently, driven by the development of shale gas exploration technology. It is suggested as an alternative production route for propylene with high efficiency and low cost, compared to conventional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. The literature emphasizes the need for novel non-noble metal-based catalysts due to the high price of platinum and the toxicity of chromium(VI), which limit their widespread use. Vanadium-based catalysts are found to be highly active and selective for propylene with good regeneration ability, making them a promising candidate for PDH technology.
