          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to non-petroleum based propylene with significant industrial relevance. PDH, employing Pt- or Cr-based catalysts, represents an emerging industrial route for propylene production. The as-prepared Zn@S-1 catalysts exhibit good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability in PDH reaction under employed conditions. The in-situ partial reduction of zinc species is observed and the partially reduced zinc cations are definitely identified as the active sites for PDH reaction. Zn-4@S-1 catalyst exhibits good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity and regeneration capability in PDH reaction. Typically, propylene STY of 24 and selectivity of 97% can be achieved at 853 K, demonstrating the great potential of such catalyst for industrial PDH process. The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, it does mention that PDH using Pt- or Cr-based catalysts represents an emerging industrial route for propylene production. The study focuses on developing alternative PDH catalysts due to the scarcity of platinum and the toxicity of chromium in current commercial PDH catalysts. Zinc, an earth-abundant and non-toxic metal, has been investigated as a promising alternative for PDH catalysts. The scarcity of platinum and the toxicity of chromium are mentioned as drawbacks of current commercial PDH catalysts, which has led to interest in exploring alternative non-noble metal and environment-friendly active components for PDH catalysts.

          丙烷脱氢(PDH)为非石油基丙烯提供了一条替代途径，在工业上具有重要意义。采用铂或铬基催化剂的PDH是丙烯生产的一种新兴工业途径。在所采用的条件下，制备的Zn@S-1催化剂在PDH反应中表现出良好的脱氢活性、高丙烯选择性和再生能力。观察到锌物种的原位部分还原，部分还原的锌阳离子被明确识别为PDH反应的活性位点。Zn-4@S-1催化剂在PDH反应中表现出良好的脱氢活性、高丙烯选择性和再生能力。通常，在853K时，丙烯的STY为24，选择性为97%，这表明这种催化剂在工业PDH过程中的巨大潜力。文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体优势。但是，它确实提到了使用Pt-或Cr-基催化剂的PDH代表了丙烯生产的一种新兴工业途径。研究的重点是开发替代的PDH催化剂，因为当前商业PDH催化剂中铂的稀缺性和铬的毒性。锌，一种地球丰富的、无毒的金属，已被研究作为PDH催化剂的一种有前景的替代品。铂的稀缺性和铬的毒性被提及为当前商业PDH催化剂的缺点，这引发了对探索替代非贵金属和环境友好的PDH催化剂活性成分的兴趣。
