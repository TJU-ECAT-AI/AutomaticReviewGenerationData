          [1] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively. The Catofin process is operated at slightly positive atmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar, and the Oleflex process is usually operated at 13 bar, while the STAR process needs a higher pressure of 56 bar. Besides the catalytic system and the operation conditions especially the pressure, the other features like the type of reactor could also differ among the three processes."
          [2] "It has been proved that PtSn based catalysts could efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane, while the catalyst deactivation and the long-term stability issues are still the big challenges even for the aforementioned commercial catalysts."
          [3] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "The recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."
          [5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."
          [6] "The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."
          [7] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx. (7,8) The soft oxidant CO2 seems to be a good choice to overcome the problem, while it brings another challenge concerning the activation of CO2 to have it efficiently participate the reaction. (911) Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods. The recent boom in natural gas production, including the exploitation of shale gas, has provided abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like propane. PDH technology can efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, offering simpler reactant and product distribution, less investment, and easier integration with present technology. This is in contrast to conventional processes such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, which are more complex and require higher investment. The PDH process operates under atmospheric pressure, making it more energy-efficient and cost-effective compared to processes that require higher pressures. However, catalyst deactivation and long-term stability issues remain challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of PDH technology. PDH offers a simpler reactant and product distribution, requires less investment, and is easier to integrate with existing technology. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and economical due to the exploitation of shale gas and natural gas production. PDH operates without the need for oxidants, avoiding the issues of deep oxidation and the production of thermodynamically stable products like COx that are common in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. This makes PDH a more efficient and selective process for propylene production.
