          The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH technologies, such as the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr. The literature focuses on the investigation of indium-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, highlighting their potential for high stability and selectivity. The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in PDH technologies. Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, Fe-, V-, Zr-based materials, and nanocarbon catalysts, indicating ongoing efforts to improve PDH technology.

          文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是，它确实提到了PDH技术，如使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺，以及使用支持的PtSn催化剂的Oleflex工艺，存在缺点，如Pt的高成本和快速失活，以及Cr可能造成的环境影响。文献集中研究了用于丙烷脱氢的铟基催化剂，强调了它们在高稳定性和选择性方面的潜力。全球对丙烯的需求不断增加，以及从页岩气中提取的丙烷成本目前较低，这重新激发了人们对PDH技术的兴趣。已经研究了许多其他PDH催化剂，包括镓、锌、钴、铁、钒、锆基材料和纳米碳催化剂，这表明了持续改进PDH技术的努力。
