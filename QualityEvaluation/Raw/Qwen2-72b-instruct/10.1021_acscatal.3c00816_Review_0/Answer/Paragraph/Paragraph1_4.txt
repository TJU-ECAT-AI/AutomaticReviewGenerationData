                    The emergence of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) as a promising and advantageous technology to address the challenges of meeting the growing global demand for propylene production, in the context of limitations faced by conventional methods, is substantiated by a plethora of studies. Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.mcat.2021.112081\] highlights PDH's ability to meet propylene demand with lower cost, steady supply from unconventional gas, and single-product efficiency. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012\] and \[10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62805-5\] further elucidates how PDH, using Pt- and CrOx catalysts, boosts C3H6 production, enhancing efficiency and selectivity over conventional methods, and economically converts abundant propane to propene with high selectivity, addressing declining fossil oil resources and increasing demand.
