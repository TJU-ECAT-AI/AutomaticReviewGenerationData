[1] "Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods. Conventional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which rely on naphtha and crude oil, are unable to meet the increasing demand for propylene. These methods are also characterized by high energy consumption and significant emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants. PDH, on the other hand, is a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly process that can produce propylene from propane, a readily available feedstock. This process not only reduces energy consumption but also minimizes the emission of pollutants, making it a more sustainable and viable option for propylene production.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面具有优势。传统方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化，依赖于石脑油和原油，无法满足丙烯日益增长的需求。这些方法的特点是能源消耗高，二氧化碳和氮氧化物污染物的排放量显著。相比之下，PDH是一种更节能、更环保的工艺，可以从丙烷这种容易获得的原料中生产丙烯。该工艺不仅降低了能源消耗，还减少了污染物的排放，使其成为生产丙烯更可持续和可行的选择。
