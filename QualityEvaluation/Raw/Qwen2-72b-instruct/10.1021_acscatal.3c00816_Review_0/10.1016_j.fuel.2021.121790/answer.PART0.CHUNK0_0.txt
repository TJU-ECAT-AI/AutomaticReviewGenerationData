[1] "Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and can be derived from natural gas, providing a more stable and sustainable source compared to naphtha and crude oil used in traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes. PDH is more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, as it requires less energy and produces fewer CO2 and NOx emissions than conventional methods. Moreover, PDH offers higher product selectivity for propylene, minimizing the production of by-products and improving overall process efficiency.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面具有优势。PDH使用丙烷作为原料，丙烷丰富，可从天然气中获得，与传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺中使用的石脑油和原油相比，提供了一个更稳定和可持续的来源。PDH更节能和环保，因为它比传统方法需要更少的能量，产生的二氧化碳和氮氧化物排放也更少。此外，PDH为丙烯提供了更高的产品选择性，最大限度地减少了副产品的生产，提高了整体工艺效率。
