[1] "Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH specifically tackles issues related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike traditional methods that rely on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking from naphtha and crude oil, PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is more widely available and can be sourced from natural gas. This makes PDH less dependent on the availability of oil-based feedstocks. In terms of process efficiency, PDH is more energy-efficient compared to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, as it requires less energy input. Additionally, PDH produces less CO2 and NOx emissions, making it a more environmentally friendly process. Furthermore, PDH offers higher product selectivity for propylene, as it directly converts propane to propylene with minimal byproducts, unlike the more complex and less selective traditional methods.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。PDH特别解决了与原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性相关的问题。与依赖于从石脑油和原油进行蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化的传统方法不同，PDH使用丙烷作为原料，这更广泛可用，可以从天然气中获得。这使得PDH对基于石油的原料的可用性依赖性较小。在过程效率方面，PDH比蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化更节能，因为它需要较少的能量输入。此外，PDH产生的二氧化碳和氮氧化物排放量较少，使其成为更环保的过程。此外，PDH为丙烯提供了更高的产品选择性，因为它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，副产品较少，与更复杂、选择性较低的传统方法不同。
