[1] "Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its high efficiency, environmental friendliness, and ability to address the challenges of conventional production methods. PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and readily available, unlike naphtha and crude oil used in traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes. PDH is more energy-efficient and produces less CO2 and NOx emissions compared to these conventional methods. Moreover, PDH has a higher product selectivity for propylene, making it an attractive alternative for meeting the growing global demand for this important chemical raw material.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它具有高效率、环保性，并能解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。PDH使用丙烷作为原料，与传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化工艺中使用的石脑油和原油相比，丙烷更加丰富且易于获得。PDH比传统方法更节能，产生的二氧化碳和氮氧化物排放也更少。此外，PDH对丙烯的产物选择性更高，使其成为满足全球对这种重要化工原料日益增长需求的有吸引力的替代方案。
