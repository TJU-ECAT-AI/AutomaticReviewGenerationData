[1] "Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its high efficiency, environmental friendliness, and ability to address the challenges of conventional production methods. Conventional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, rely on naphtha and crude oil as feedstocks, which are increasingly unable to meet the growing demand for propylene. These methods are also highly energy-intensive and result in significant emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants. PDH, on the other hand, offers a more energy-efficient and environmentally benign process for propylene production, making it an attractive alternative. PDH specifically addresses the challenges of conventional methods by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is more abundant and can be derived from natural gas, thereby improving feedstock availability. The process is also more efficient in terms of energy consumption and produces fewer emissions, making it a more sustainable option. Additionally, PDH offers higher product selectivity for propylene compared to conventional methods, which often produce a range of hydrocarbons.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它具有高效率、环保性，并能解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。传统方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化，依赖于石脑油和原油作为原料，这些原料越来越无法满足丙烯日益增长的需求。这些方法还高度耗能，并导致大量二氧化碳和氮氧化物污染物的排放。相比之下，PDH提供了一种更节能、更环保的丙烯生产过程，使其成为一个有吸引力的替代方案。PDH通过使用丙烷作为原料，具体解决了传统方法的挑战，丙烷更丰富，可从天然气中获得，从而提高了原料的可用性。该过程在能源消耗方面也更有效率，产生的排放更少，使其成为一个更可持续的选择。此外，PDH在产品选择性方面为丙烯提供了更高的选择性，而传统方法通常会产生一系列的烃类。
