[1] "Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and can be derived from natural gas, providing a more stable and sustainable source compared to naphtha and crude oil used in traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes. PDH is more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, as it requires less energy and produces fewer CO2 and NOx emissions than conventional methods. Moreover, PDH offers higher product selectivity for propylene, minimizing the production of by-products and improving overall process efficiency.

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its high efficiency, environmental friendliness, and ability to address the challenges of conventional production methods. Conventional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, rely on naphtha and crude oil as feedstocks, which are increasingly unable to meet the growing demand for propylene. These methods are also highly energy-intensive and result in significant emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants. PDH, on the other hand, offers a more energy-efficient and environmentally benign process for propylene production, making it an attractive alternative. PDH specifically addresses the challenges of conventional methods by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is more abundant and can be derived from natural gas, thereby improving feedstock availability. The process is also more efficient in terms of energy consumption and produces fewer emissions, making it a more sustainable option. Additionally, PDH offers higher product selectivity for propylene compared to conventional methods, which often produce a range of hydrocarbons.

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH specifically tackles issues related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike traditional methods that rely on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking from naphtha and crude oil, PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is more widely available and can be sourced from natural gas. This makes PDH less dependent on the availability of oil-based feedstocks. In terms of process efficiency, PDH is more energy-efficient compared to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, as it requires less energy input. Additionally, PDH produces less CO2 and NOx emissions, making it a more environmentally friendly process. Furthermore, PDH offers higher product selectivity for propylene, as it directly converts propane to propylene with minimal byproducts, unlike the more complex and less selective traditional methods.
