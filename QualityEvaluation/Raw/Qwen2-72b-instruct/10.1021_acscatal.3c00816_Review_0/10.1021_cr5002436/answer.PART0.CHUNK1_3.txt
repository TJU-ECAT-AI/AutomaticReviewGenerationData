1.The growing global demand for propylene has led to the development of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, which is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by utilizing propane, a readily available feedstock, as the primary source of propylene. This eliminates the need for naphtha cracking, which is a less efficient and more expensive process. PDH technology also offers higher product selectivity, as it directly converts propane to propylene without producing significant amounts of byproducts. Additionally, PDH technology is more energy-efficient and has a lower carbon footprint compared to conventional production methods, making it a more sustainable option for propylene production.

1.全球对丙烯需求的不断增长促使了丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术的发展，该技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它在原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性方面具有优势。PDH技术通过使用丙烷作为生产丙烯的主要原料，特别解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战，这消除了对石脑油裂解的需求，石脑油裂解是一种效率较低、成本较高的过程。PDH技术还提供了更高的产品选择性，因为它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而不会产生大量副产品。此外，与传统生产方法相比，PDH技术更节能，碳足迹更低，使其成为生产丙烯的更可持续的选择。
