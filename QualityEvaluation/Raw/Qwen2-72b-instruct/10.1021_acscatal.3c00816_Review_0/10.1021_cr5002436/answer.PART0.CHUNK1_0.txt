1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane, a widely available feedstock, as the primary source of propylene. This reduces the dependence on crude oil and its derivatives, which are subject to price volatility and geopolitical risks. PDH also offers higher process efficiency and product selectivity compared to traditional methods such as steam cracking, which often produce a wide range of hydrocarbons and require additional separation steps to isolate propylene. PDH technology can achieve high yields of propylene with minimal byproducts, making it a more economical and environmentally friendly option for propylene production.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。PDH特别通过使用丙烷作为生产丙烯的主要原料来解决这些挑战，丙烷是一种广泛可用的原料。这减少了对原油及其衍生物的依赖，后者受价格波动和地缘政治风险的影响。与传统的蒸汽裂解等方法相比，PDH提供了更高的过程效率和产品选择性，传统方法通常会产生一系列的烃类，并需要额外的分离步骤来分离丙烯。PDH技术可以实现高丙烯产量，副产品最少，使其成为生产丙烯更经济、更环保的选择。
