[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
[3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[5] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
[6] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[7] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[8] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."

1.The growing global demand for propylene has led to the development of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, which offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability by utilizing shale gas as a cost-effective and abundant feedstock, thanks to advancements in hydraulic fracturing technologies. This has resulted in a significant drop in gas costs, making shale gas an attractive source for the production of transportation fuels and chemicals. PDH technology also addresses process efficiency by shifting from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations, leading to the construction of ethane crackers and the dismantling or conversion of naphtha crackers. This shift has created opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenge of product selectivity by offering an on-purpose technique that yields a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products, resulting in higher purity olefins suitable for polymer production. The profitability of PDH technology is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making it a favorable option under current market conditions.

1.丙烯全球需求的不断增长促使了丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的发展，该技术在几个关键方面优于传统生产方法。PDH技术通过利用页岩气作为成本效益高且储量丰富的原料，解决了原料供应的挑战，这得益于水力压裂技术的进步。这导致了天然气成本的大幅下降，使页岩气成为生产交通运输燃料和化学品的有吸引力的来源。PDH技术通过从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩的乙烷用于蒸汽裂解装置，解决了过程效率的挑战，这导致了乙烷裂解器的建设以及石脑油裂解器的拆除或转换。这种转变创造了利用催化脱氢技术将轻质石蜡转化为相应烯烃的机会。PDH技术特别解决了产品选择性的挑战，提供了一种旨在生产特定烯烃而不是混合产品的技术，从而产生了适合聚合物生产的更高纯度的烯烃。PDH技术的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，这使得在当前市场条件下它成为一个有利的选择。
