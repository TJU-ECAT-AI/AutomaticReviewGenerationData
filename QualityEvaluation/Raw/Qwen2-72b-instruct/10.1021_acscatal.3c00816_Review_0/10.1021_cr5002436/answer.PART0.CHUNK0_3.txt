[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
[3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[5] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
[6] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[7] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[8] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."

The growing global demand for propylene has led to the emergence of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology as the most promising method for propylene production. This technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The steady increase in demand for chemical building blocks, such as propylene, has been observed in all major markets except the Eurozone, which has been affected by recent economic downturns. The development of hydraulic fracturing technologies has enabled the cost-effective extraction of large volumes of shale gas, leading to a significant drop in gas costs compared to 2005 prices. This has made shale gas an attractive feedstock for the production of transportation fuels and chemicals. The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, particularly ethane, has prompted a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States. This shift has resulted in the construction of ethane crackers and the dismantling or conversion of naphtha crackers. Steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, leading to a drop in propylene supply and a sharp rise in its price. This creates opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions very favorable. An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that they are on-purpose techniques, yielding a specific olefin rather than a mixture of products. Industrial dehydrogenation processes are optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.

全球对丙烯需求的不断增长促使丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法。该技术解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。除欧元区受近期经济衰退影响外，所有主要市场对化学建筑块，如丙烯，的需求稳步增长。水力压裂技术的发展使得能够以成本效益的方式提取大量页岩气，导致与2005年价格相比，天然气成本大幅下降。这使得页岩气成为生产运输燃料和化学品的有吸引力的原料。相对便宜的天然气液体，特别是乙烷，的高可用性促使美国从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩的乙烷用于蒸汽裂解装置。这一转变导致了乙烷裂解器的建设和石脑油裂解器的拆除或转换。相对于石脑油裂解，乙烷蒸汽裂解产生的除乙烯外的烯烃量微乎其微，导致丙烯供应下降，价格急剧上涨。这为定向催化技术，如轻质石蜡催化脱氢成相应的烯烃，创造了机会。丙烷脱氢的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，这使得当前的市场条件非常有利。脱氢技术的另一个优势是，它们是定向技术，产生特定的烯烃，而不是混合产品。工业脱氢过程被优化，以生产聚合物质量纯度的烯烃。
