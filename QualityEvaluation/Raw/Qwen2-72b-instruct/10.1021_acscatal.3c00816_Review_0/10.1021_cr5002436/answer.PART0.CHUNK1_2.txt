1.The growing global demand for propylene has led to an increased interest in propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, which offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, a readily available byproduct of natural gas processing and crude oil refining, as the primary feedstock. This reduces the dependence on naphtha, a more expensive and less abundant feedstock used in traditional steam cracking processes. PDH technology also improves process efficiency by operating at lower temperatures and pressures compared to steam cracking, resulting in lower energy consumption and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, PDH technology offers higher product selectivity, as it directly converts propane to propylene with minimal formation of byproducts such as ethylene and butadiene. This results in higher yields of propylene, which is the desired product, and reduces the need for additional separation and purification steps.

1.全球对丙烯需求的不断增长促使人们更加关注丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术，该技术在几个关键方面优于传统生产方法。PDH技术通过使用丙烷作为主要原料，具体解决了原料供应的挑战。丙烷是天然气加工和原油精炼的副产品，供应充足。这减少了对石脑油的依赖，石脑油是一种更昂贵、供应量更少的原料，用于传统的蒸汽裂解过程。PDH技术通过在较低的温度和压力下运行，与蒸汽裂解相比，提高了过程效率，导致能源消耗降低和温室气体排放减少。此外，PDH技术提供了更高的产品选择性，因为它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时最小化乙烯和丁二烯等副产品的形成。这导致丙烯产量更高，丙烯是所需的产品，减少了对额外分离和纯化步骤的需求。
