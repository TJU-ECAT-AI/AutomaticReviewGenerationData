1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane, a readily available and abundant feedstock, as opposed to the more expensive and less abundant naphtha used in conventional steam cracking. This results in a more cost-effective and sustainable production process. Additionally, PDH technology offers higher process efficiency and product selectivity, as it directly converts propane to propylene with minimal byproducts, unlike the more complex and less selective steam cracking process. The higher efficiency and selectivity of PDH technology lead to lower energy consumption and higher yields of propylene, making it a more environmentally friendly and economically viable option for propylene production.
