1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane, a readily available feedstock, as the primary source of propylene. This reduces the dependence on crude oil and allows for more efficient and selective production of propylene. PDH technology also offers higher yields and lower energy consumption compared to traditional methods, making it a more sustainable and cost-effective option for propylene production.
