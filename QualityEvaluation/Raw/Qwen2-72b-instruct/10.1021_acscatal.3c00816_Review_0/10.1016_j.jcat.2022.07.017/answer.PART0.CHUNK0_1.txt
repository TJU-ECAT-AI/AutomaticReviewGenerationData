1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology can utilize abundant shale gas as a feedstock, which is a significant advantage over traditional methods that rely on oil-based feedstocks. The process efficiency of PDH is also higher, as it can convert propane directly to propylene without the need for intermediate steps. This results in higher yields and lower energy consumption. Additionally, PDH technology offers better product selectivity, as it can produce propylene with minimal byproducts, making it a more sustainable and cost-effective option for propylene production.
