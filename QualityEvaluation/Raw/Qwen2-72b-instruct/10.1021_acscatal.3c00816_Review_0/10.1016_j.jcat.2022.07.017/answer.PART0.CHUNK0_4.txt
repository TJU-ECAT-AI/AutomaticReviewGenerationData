1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology can utilize abundant shale gas resources as feedstock, which are widely available and cost-effective compared to traditional feedstocks like naphtha. The process efficiency of PDH is high, with a high conversion rate of propane to propylene, and it offers a high selectivity for propylene production, minimizing the formation of by-products. These advantages make PDH a highly competitive and sustainable route for propylene production.
