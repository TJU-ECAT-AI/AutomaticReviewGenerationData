1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its ability to directly convert propane, a widely available feedstock, into propylene with high efficiency and selectivity. PDH technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, in terms of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is abundant in natural gas and associated gas streams. This reduces the dependence on naphtha, a more expensive and less abundant feedstock. In terms of process efficiency, PDH offers a simpler process with fewer steps compared to traditional methods, leading to lower energy consumption and capital costs. Additionally, PDH technology provides higher product selectivity, specifically targeting propylene production with minimal byproducts, which is crucial for meeting the increasing demand for this key petrochemical.
