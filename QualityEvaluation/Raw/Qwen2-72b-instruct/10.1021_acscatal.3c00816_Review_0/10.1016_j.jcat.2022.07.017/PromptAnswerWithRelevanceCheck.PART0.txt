1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, PDH is highlighted as an on-purpose non-oxidative process that has caught much attention recently, driven by the development of shale gas exploration technology. It is suggested as an alternative production route for propylene with high efficiency and low cost, compared to conventional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. The literature emphasizes the need for novel non-noble metal-based catalysts due to the high price of platinum and the toxicity of chromium(VI), which limit their widespread use. Vanadium-based catalysts are found to be highly active and selective for propylene with good regeneration ability, making them a promising candidate for PDH technology.

1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology can utilize abundant shale gas as a feedstock, which is a significant advantage over traditional methods that rely on oil-based feedstocks. The process efficiency of PDH is also higher, as it can convert propane directly to propylene without the need for intermediate steps. This results in higher yields and lower energy consumption. Additionally, PDH technology offers better product selectivity, as it can produce propylene with minimal byproducts, making it a more sustainable and cost-effective option for propylene production.

1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its ability to directly convert propane, a widely available feedstock, into propylene with high efficiency and selectivity. PDH technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, in terms of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is abundant in natural gas and associated gas streams. This reduces the dependence on naphtha, a more expensive and less abundant feedstock. In terms of process efficiency, PDH offers a simpler process with fewer steps compared to traditional methods, leading to lower energy consumption and capital costs. Additionally, PDH technology provides higher product selectivity, specifically targeting propylene production with minimal byproducts, which is crucial for meeting the increasing demand for this key petrochemical.
