1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, PDH is highlighted as an on-purpose non-oxidative process that has caught much attention recently, driven by the development of shale gas exploration technology. It is suggested as an alternative production route for propylene with high efficiency and low cost, compared to conventional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. The literature emphasizes the need for novel non-noble metal-based catalysts due to the high price of platinum and the toxicity of chromium(VI), which limit their widespread use. Vanadium-based catalysts are found to be highly active and selective for propylene with good regeneration ability, making them a promising candidate for PDH technology.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体优势。然而，PDH被强调为一种有目的的非氧化过程，最近由于页岩气勘探技术的发展而受到广泛关注。与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解相比，它被建议为一种高效率、低成本的丙烯替代生产路线。文献强调，由于铂的高价格和六价铬的毒性，限制了它们的广泛应用，因此需要新型的非贵金属基催化剂。发现基于钒的催化剂对丙烯具有高活性和选择性，并具有良好的再生能力，这使它们成为PDH技术的有希望的候选者。
