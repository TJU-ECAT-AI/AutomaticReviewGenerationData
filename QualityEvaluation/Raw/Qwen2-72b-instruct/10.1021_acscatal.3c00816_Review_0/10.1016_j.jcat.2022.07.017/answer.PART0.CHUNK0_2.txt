1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology can utilize abundant shale gas as a feedstock, which is a significant advantage over traditional methods that rely on oil-based feedstocks. The process is highly efficient, with high propylene yields and selectivity, making it an attractive alternative to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. Additionally, PDH technology can be implemented in a modular fashion, allowing for flexible production capacity and lower capital costs compared to large-scale petrochemical plants.
