1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does highlight the interest in catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes as an effective route to produce high-valued light alkenes, with a focus on the development of a novel non-toxic dehydrogenation catalyst with low cost. The exploration of Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) as a catalyst for propane dehydrogenation is presented as a promising approach due to its higher propane conversion and better dehydrogenation stability compared to conventional methods.
