1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does highlight the interest in catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce high-valued light alkenes, with a focus on developing a novel, non-toxic, and low-cost dehydrogenation catalyst. The Sn-containing HMS catalyst is noted for its efficiency in propane conversion and stability, which could potentially contribute to process efficiency and product selectivity in PDH technology.
