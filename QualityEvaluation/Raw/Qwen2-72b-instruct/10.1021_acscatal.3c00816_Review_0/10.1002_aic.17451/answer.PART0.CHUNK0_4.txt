1.The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products. It is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands.
