1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does highlight the significance of PDH in upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene, which suggests that PDH may offer advantages in terms of feedstock availability. The literature also mentions that supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, indicating that PDH technology may offer high process efficiency. Furthermore, the literature reports that the CoSiBeta catalysts show state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propylene selectivity, suggesting that PDH technology may offer high product selectivity.
