1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does highlight the significance of PDH in upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene, which suggests that PDH may offer advantages in terms of feedstock availability. The literature also mentions the high catalytic activity and selectivity of the CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH, which could imply that PDH technology may offer improved process efficiency and product selectivity compared to conventional methods.

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does highlight that PDH is of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene. This suggests that PDH technology may offer advantages in terms of feedstock availability, potentially using more abundant and lower-cost propane as a feedstock compared to conventional methods. The literature also mentions that supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, indicating that PDH technology may offer high process efficiency. However, these catalysts suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation. The literature further states that the design of a green and low-priced PDH catalyst with high reactivity and great selectivity to propylene is still urgent and challenging, implying that PDH technology aims to address the challenges of product selectivity and environmental impact associated with conventional production methods.
