1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does highlight that PDH is of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene. This suggests that PDH technology may offer advantages in terms of feedstock availability, potentially using more abundant and lower-cost propane as a feedstock compared to conventional methods. The literature also mentions that supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, indicating that PDH technology may offer high process efficiency. However, these catalysts suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation. The literature further states that the design of a green and low-priced PDH catalyst with high reactivity and great selectivity to propylene is still urgent and challenging, implying that PDH technology aims to address the challenges of product selectivity and environmental impact associated with conventional production methods.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是，它确实强调PDH在化工行业中具有重大意义，将价格低廉、储量丰富的丙烷升级为高价值的丙烯。这表明PDH技术可能在原料供应方面具有优势，可能使用比传统方法更丰富、成本更低的丙烷作为原料。文献还提到，PDH工业中使用的CrOx和Pt支撑催化剂表现出非常高的催化活性，表明PDH技术可能提供高过程效率。然而，这些催化剂存在各种问题，如价格高昂、环境不友好和快速失活。文献进一步指出，设计绿色、低成本、高反应性和高丙烯选择性的PDH催化剂仍然迫切且具有挑战性，这意味着PDH技术旨在解决与传统生产方法相关的产物选择性和环境影响问题。
