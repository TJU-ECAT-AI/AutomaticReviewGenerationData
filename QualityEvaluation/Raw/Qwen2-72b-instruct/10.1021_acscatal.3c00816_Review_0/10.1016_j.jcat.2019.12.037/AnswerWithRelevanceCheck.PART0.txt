          The literature highlights the significance of PDH in upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene, suggesting advantages in terms of feedstock availability. It mentions the high catalytic activity and selectivity of the CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH, indicating improved process efficiency and product selectivity compared to conventional methods. Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, suggesting high process efficiency. However, these catalysts suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation. The design of a green and low-priced PDH catalyst with high reactivity and great selectivity to propylene is still urgent and challenging, implying that PDH technology aims to address the challenges of product selectivity and environmental impact associated with conventional production methods.
