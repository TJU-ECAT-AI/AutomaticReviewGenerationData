1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does highlight the significance of PDH in upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene, which suggests that PDH may offer advantages in terms of feedstock availability. The literature also mentions the high catalytic activity and selectivity of the CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH, which could contribute to process efficiency and product selectivity.
