1.The literature does not provide specific advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology over conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, it does mention that PDH is an attractive alternative to produce propene and isobutene, especially for propene where the demand cannot be further increased in the steam cracking process. The literature also highlights the disadvantages of current industrial catalysts for PDH, such as the price of platinum and the toxicity of chromium, and discusses the development of novel catalysts to overcome these drawbacks.
