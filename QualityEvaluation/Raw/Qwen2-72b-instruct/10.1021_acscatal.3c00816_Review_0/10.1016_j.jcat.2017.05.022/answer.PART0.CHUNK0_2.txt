1.The literature does not provide specific advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology over conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, it does mention that PDH is an attractive alternative to produce propene and isobutene, especially for propene where the demand cannot be further increased in the steam cracking process. The literature also highlights that VOx/MCM-41 catalysts show good onstream stability and high selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane, which could potentially address the challenges faced by conventional production methods.

1.文献没有具体说明丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术与传统生产方法相比，在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的具体优势。但是，它确实提到PDH是生产丙烯和异丁烯的有吸引力的替代方法，特别是在丙烯需求无法通过蒸汽裂解过程进一步增加的情况下。文献还强调，VOx/MCM-41催化剂在丙烷和异丁烷的非氧化脱氢中表现出良好的在线稳定性以及高选择性，这可能有助于解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。
