1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production or how it addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does discuss the development of novel catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane to produce propene and isobutene, respectively. The use of supported VOx catalysts is highlighted as a promising approach due to their good onstream stability and high selectivity. This suggests that PDH technology, which likely employs such catalysts, may offer advantages in terms of process efficiency and product selectivity compared to conventional methods.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术生产丙烯的具体优势，也没有说明它如何解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。但是，它确实讨论了开发新型催化剂用于丙烷和异丁烷的脱氢，以分别生产丙烯和异丁烯。强调使用支持VOx催化剂是一种有前景的方法，因为它们具有良好的在线稳定性（onstream stability）和高选择性。这表明PDH技术可能使用此类催化剂，与传统方法相比，在过程效率和产品选择性方面可能具有优势。
