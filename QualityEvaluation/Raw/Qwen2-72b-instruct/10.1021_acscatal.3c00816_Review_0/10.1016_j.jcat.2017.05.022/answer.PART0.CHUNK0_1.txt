1.The literature does not provide specific advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology over conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, it does mention that PDH is an attractive alternative to produce propene and isobutene, especially due to the growing demand for propene. The literature focuses on the development of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane, highlighting their good onstream stability and high selectivity. The catalysts show promise for PDH technology, which could potentially address the challenges of conventional methods by offering a more direct and efficient route to produce propene from propane.

1.文献没有具体说明丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术与传统生产方法相比，在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的具体优势。但是，它确实提到PDH是生产丙烯和异丁烯的有吸引力的替代方法，特别是由于丙烯需求的不断增长。文献重点介绍了VOx/MCM-41催化剂在丙烷和异丁烷非氧化脱氢中的开发，强调了它们良好的在线稳定性及高选择性。这些催化剂对PDH技术显示出潜力，可能通过提供更直接和有效的途径从丙烷生产丙烯，从而解决传统方法的挑战。
