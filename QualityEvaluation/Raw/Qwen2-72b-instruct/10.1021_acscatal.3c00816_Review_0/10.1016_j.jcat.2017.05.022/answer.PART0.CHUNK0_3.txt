1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production or how it addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does discuss the development of novel catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane, which is an alternative method for producing lower olefins like propylene and isobutene. The literature highlights the importance of developing new catalysts due to the disadvantages of current technologies, such as the high price of platinum-based catalysts and the toxicity of chromium-based catalysts. It also mentions that supported materials with catalytically active oxides of vanadium, molybdenum, iron, gallium, or indium, as well as bulk carbon and zinc titanate, are being considered as promising candidates for dehydrogenation reactions.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术生产丙烯的具体优势,也没有说明它如何解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。但是,它确实讨论了为生产较低级烯烃(如丙烯和异丁烯)开发新型催化剂用于丙烷和异丁烷脱氢的进展。文献强调了由于当前技术的缺点,如铂基催化剂的高价格和铬基催化剂的毒性,开发新型催化剂的重要性。它还提到,含有催化活性的钒、钼、铁、镓或铟氧化物的支撑材料,以及碳块体和钛酸锌,正被视为脱氢反应的有希望的候选材料。
