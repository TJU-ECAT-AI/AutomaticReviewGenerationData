1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production or how it addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does discuss the development of novel catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane to produce propene and isobutene, respectively. The use of supported VOx catalysts is highlighted as a promising approach due to their good onstream stability and high selectivity. This suggests that PDH technology, which likely employs such catalysts, may offer advantages in terms of process efficiency and product selectivity compared to conventional methods.

1.The literature does not provide specific advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology over conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, it does mention that PDH is an attractive alternative to produce propene and isobutene, especially due to the growing demand for propene. The literature focuses on the development of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane, highlighting their good onstream stability and high selectivity. The catalysts show promise for PDH technology, which could potentially address the challenges of conventional methods by offering a more direct and efficient route to produce propene from propane.

However, it does discuss the development of novel catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane, which is an alternative method for producing lower olefins like propylene and isobutene. The literature highlights the importance of developing new catalysts due to the disadvantages of current technologies, such as the high price of platinum-based catalysts and the toxicity of chromium-based catalysts. It also mentions that supported materials with catalytically active oxides of vanadium, molybdenum, iron, gallium, or indium, as well as bulk carbon and zinc titanate, are being considered as promising candidates for dehydrogenation reactions.
