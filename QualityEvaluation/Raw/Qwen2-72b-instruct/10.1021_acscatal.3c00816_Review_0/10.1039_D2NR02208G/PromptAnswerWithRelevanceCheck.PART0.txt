1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Propylene, a basic building block in industrial applications, has seen a significant increase in demand, reaching around 116 million tons in 2020. The PDH process, along with other techniques like the methanol to propylene process (MTP) and Fischer-Tropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), has attracted considerable attention. However, considering the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the PDH process is often regarded as the most promising pathway for producing high-value propylene. The advancements in hydraulic fracturing technology have further promoted the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane through the extraction of abundant shale gas, which strengthens the conversion and utilization of propane.

[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications. However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020.1 The traditional propylene production process includes steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light alkane, and crude oil byproducts by other processes. However, there still exist vast obstacles such as the low target selectivity of olefins, restricted fossil energy resources, and insufficient market supply, which make it urgent to develop new processes to achieve valuable propylene. Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention.24 Methanol steam reforming and coal gasification reaction are highly exothermic and the initiation phase demands lots of energy consumption, leading to an aggravated greenhouse effect.5 Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products.6 Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane.7 The production of olefins from propane could be simply classified into three categories as follows: (1) reaction without an oxidant involved in propane dehydrogenation, simply designated as direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene; (2) oxygen or air jointly involved in dehydrogenation, denoted as PDH-O2; and (3) carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant or hydrogen serving as feeding gas, named CO2/H2 mediated dehydrogenation (PDH-CO2/PDH-H2).4 It should be noted that the catalysis of the dehydrogenation of propane concerning oxides as reactants is hardly constrained by a thermodynamic equivalent. In contrast, the direct dehydrogenation along with H2 as a reactant involved in the reaction process is restricted by thermodynamic balance.5 What's more, the prime bottlenecks of PDH-O2 during commercial application can be concluded as follows: (1) the conversion rate and selectivity of PDH are too small to achieve practical industrial utilization; meanwhile, the incomplete reaction of alkanes needs to be recycled using a pure oxide, resulting in increased cost and energy consumption. (2) Due to the competition of adsorption, the introduction of oxides might sharply weaken the interaction between the active center and propane, leading to a low propane conversion and poor propene selectivity.6 Modern process technology mainly includes Catofin, Oleflex, STAR, Linde, FBD-4, ADHO, FCDh and K-PROt processes for prolonged periods of time (Fig. 1).8 Among them, the most widely applicable processes are Oleflex and Catofin processes, in which catalysts consist of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively.8,9"

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional propylene production processes, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, have limitations such as low olefin selectivity, restricted fossil energy resources, and insufficient market supply. PDH technology, on the other hand, offers a pathway to produce high-value propylene from abundant low-valued propane, which is extracted from Earth-abundant shale gas through advancements in hydraulic fracturing technology. This process is more cost-effective and environmentally friendly compared to methanol steam reforming and coal gasification reactions, which are highly exothermic and require significant energy consumption, contributing to the greenhouse effect. PDH technology is not constrained by thermodynamic equivalents when oxides are used as reactants, unlike direct dehydrogenation with hydrogen as a reactant, which is restricted by thermodynamic balance. The commercial application of PDH-O2, however, faces challenges such as low conversion rates and selectivity, incomplete reaction of alkanes, and increased costs and energy consumption due to the need for recycling using a pure oxide. Despite these challenges, PDH technology remains the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to convert abundant low-valued propane into high-value propylene with high efficiency and selectivity.

1.丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。传统的丙烯生产过程，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化，存在诸如低烯烃选择性、受限的化石能源资源和市场供应不足等限制。相比之下，PDH技术提供了一条从丰富的低价值丙烷中生产高价值丙烯的途径，丙烷通过水力压裂技术的进展从地球丰富的页岩气中提取。与甲醇蒸汽重整和煤气化反应相比，该过程更具成本效益和环境友好，后者是高度放热的，需要大量能量消耗，加剧了温室效应。当氧化物用作反应物时，PDH技术不受热力学等价的限制，而直接脱氢反应中氢作为反应物时，受热力学平衡的限制。然而，PDH-O2的商业应用面临诸如低转化率和选择性、烷烃反应不完全、使用纯氧化物回收导致成本和能耗增加等挑战。尽管存在这些挑战，PDH技术仍然是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它能够以高效率和选择性将丰富的低价值丙烷转化为高价值丙烯。
