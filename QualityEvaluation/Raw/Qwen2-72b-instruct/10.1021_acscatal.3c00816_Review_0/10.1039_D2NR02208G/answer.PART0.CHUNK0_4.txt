[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications."
[2] "However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020.1"
[3] "Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention.24"
[4] "Methanol steam reforming and coal gasification reaction are highly exothermic and the initiation phase demands lots of energy consumption, leading to an aggravated greenhouse effect.5"
[5] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products.6"
[6] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane.7"

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The global demand for propylene, a basic building block in industrial applications, has significantly increased, reaching around 116 million tons in 2020. Conventional production methods, such as methanol to propylene (MTP) and Fischer-Tropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), are highly exothermic and require significant energy consumption, contributing to the greenhouse effect. In contrast, PDH technology offers a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach to propylene production. It utilizes low-valued propane, which is abundant in shale gas, as a feedstock, making it a more sustainable and economically viable option. The PDH process is highly efficient and selective, producing high-quality propylene with minimal byproducts. This makes it an attractive alternative to conventional methods, especially in light of the growing global demand for propylene.

1.由于丙烯是工业应用中的基本构建块，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是生产丙烯的最有希望的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法在原料可用性，过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。全球对丙烯的需求已显著增加，2020年达到约1.16亿吨。传统生产方法，如甲醇到丙烯（MTP）和费托水煤气变换反应（WGSR），是高度放热的，需要大量的能量消耗，导致温室效应加剧。相比之下，PDH技术提供了一种更经济，更环保的丙烯生产方法。它利用在页岩气中丰富的低价值丙烷作为原料，使其成为更可持续和经济上可行的选择。PDH过程高效且选择性高，产生高质量的丙烯，副产品极少。这使其成为传统方法的有吸引力的替代品，特别是在全球对丙烯的需求不断增长的背景下。
