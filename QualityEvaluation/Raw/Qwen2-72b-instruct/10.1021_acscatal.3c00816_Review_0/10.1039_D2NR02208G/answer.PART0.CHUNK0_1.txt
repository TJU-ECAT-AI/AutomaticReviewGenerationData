[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications. However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020.1 The traditional propylene production process includes steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light alkane, and crude oil byproducts by other processes. However, there still exist vast obstacles such as the low target selectivity of olefins, restricted fossil energy resources, and insufficient market supply, which make it urgent to develop new processes to achieve valuable propylene. Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention.24 Methanol steam reforming and coal gasification reaction are highly exothermic and the initiation phase demands lots of energy consumption, leading to an aggravated greenhouse effect.5 Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products.6 Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane.7 The production of olefins from propane could be simply classified into three categories as follows: (1) reaction without an oxidant involved in propane dehydrogenation, simply designated as direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene; (2) oxygen or air jointly involved in dehydrogenation, denoted as PDH-O2; and (3) carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant or hydrogen serving as feeding gas, named CO2/H2 mediated dehydrogenation (PDH-CO2/PDH-H2).4 It should be noted that the catalysis of the dehydrogenation of propane concerning oxides as reactants is hardly constrained by a thermodynamic equivalent. In contrast, the direct dehydrogenation along with H2 as a reactant involved in the reaction process is restricted by thermodynamic balance.5 What's more, the prime bottlenecks of PDH-O2 during commercial application can be concluded as follows: (1) the conversion rate and selectivity of PDH are too small to achieve practical industrial utilization; meanwhile, the incomplete reaction of alkanes needs to be recycled using a pure oxide, resulting in increased cost and energy consumption. (2) Due to the competition of adsorption, the introduction of oxides might sharply weaken the interaction between the active center and propane, leading to a low propane conversion and poor propene selectivity.6 Modern process technology mainly includes Catofin, Oleflex, STAR, Linde, FBD-4, ADHO, FCDh and K-PROt processes for prolonged periods of time (Fig. 1).8 Among them, the most widely applicable processes are Oleflex and Catofin processes, in which catalysts consist of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively.8,9"

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its high-valued target products, cost-effective technical process, and environmental benefits. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a more efficient and selective process for converting propane to propylene, utilizing Earth-abundant shale gas, and avoiding the greenhouse effect associated with methanol steam reforming and coal gasification reactions. PDH technology also overcomes the limitations of traditional propylene production processes, such as low olefin selectivity, restricted fossil energy resources, and insufficient market supply.
