[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications."
[2] "However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."
[3] "Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention."
[4] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."
[5] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Propylene, a basic building block in industrial applications, has a high demand that was not met in 2020. The PDH process, along with other techniques like the methanol to propylene process (MTP) and Fischer-Tropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), has attracted significant attention. Considering the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, PDH is often seen as the most promising pathway for producing high-value propylene. The advancements in hydraulic fracturing technology have further promoted the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane, making PDH an attractive option for utilizing Earth-abundant shale gas.
