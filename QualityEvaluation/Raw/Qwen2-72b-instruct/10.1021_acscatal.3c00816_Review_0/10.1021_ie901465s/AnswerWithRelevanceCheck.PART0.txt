          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is advantageous for propylene production due to its ability to utilize cheap and readily available propane and butane as feedstocks, which are produced by various petrochemical processes. This technology does not require significant investment as existing production facilities can be easily retrofitted. PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering higher propylene selectivity and process efficiency, making it a promising method for propylene production in light of the growing global demand.
