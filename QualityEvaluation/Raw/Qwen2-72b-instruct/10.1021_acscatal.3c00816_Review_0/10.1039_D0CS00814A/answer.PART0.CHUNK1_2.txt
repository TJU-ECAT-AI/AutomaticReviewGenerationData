1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH specifically tackles issues related to feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is widely available as a byproduct of natural gas processing and crude oil refining. This makes PDH less dependent on specific feedstocks compared to traditional steam cracking methods. In terms of process efficiency, PDH offers a more direct route to propylene, avoiding the intermediate steps and energy losses associated with steam cracking. This results in higher overall efficiency and lower energy consumption. Additionally, PDH technology can achieve higher product selectivity, focusing primarily on the conversion of propane to propylene with minimal formation of byproducts, which enhances the economic viability of the process.
