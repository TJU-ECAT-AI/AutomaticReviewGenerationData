1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH specifically tackles issues related to feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is abundant and can be sourced from various natural gas processing and oil refining operations. This reduces dependence on traditional naphtha feedstocks. In terms of process efficiency, PDH offers a more direct route to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking and subsequent separation processes, leading to higher yields and lower energy consumption. Additionally, PDH technology allows for higher product selectivity, focusing primarily on propylene production with minimal byproducts, making it an attractive option for meeting the increasing demand for this versatile petrochemical.
