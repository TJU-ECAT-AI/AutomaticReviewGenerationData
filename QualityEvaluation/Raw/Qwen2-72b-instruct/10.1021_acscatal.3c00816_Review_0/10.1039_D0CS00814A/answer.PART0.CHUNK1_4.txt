1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH specifically tackles issues related to feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is abundant and can be sourced from various natural gas processing and oil refining operations. This reduces dependency on traditional oil-based feedstocks. In terms of process efficiency, PDH offers a more direct route to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking and subsequent separation processes, which are energy-intensive and complex. PDH also demonstrates higher product selectivity, as it directly converts propane to propylene with minimal byproducts, enhancing overall yield and efficiency.
