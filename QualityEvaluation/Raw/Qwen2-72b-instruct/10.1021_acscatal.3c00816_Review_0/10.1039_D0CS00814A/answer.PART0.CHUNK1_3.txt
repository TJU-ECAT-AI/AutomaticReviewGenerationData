1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH technology specifically addresses the issues of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is abundant and widely available. It improves process efficiency by directly converting propane to propylene in a single step, eliminating the need for intermediate processes. PDH also enhances product selectivity by producing propylene with high purity and minimal byproducts, making it a preferred choice for propylene production.
