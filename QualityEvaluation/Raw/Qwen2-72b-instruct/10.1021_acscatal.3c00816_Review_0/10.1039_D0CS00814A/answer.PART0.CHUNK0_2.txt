[1] "Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
[2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
[3] "Especially, PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
[4] "Therefore, the development of highly efficient propylene production technologies is of vital importance, both scientifically and economically."
[5] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has received extensive attention in recent years as an industrial technology for direct propylene production. It is considered one of the most promising methods for propylene production due to its ability to produce only propylene, not a hybrid product. This addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, as the development of hydraulic fracturing technology has made shale gas condensates, which contain a large amount of propane, cheaper and more plentiful. PDH technology also improves process efficiency and product selectivity, which is vital for meeting the growing global demand for propylene. The Dow Chemical Company forecasted that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035.

1.近年来，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术作为直接生产丙烯的工业技术，受到了广泛关注。由于PDH技术能够仅生产丙烯，而不是混合产品，因此被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法之一。这解决了传统生产方法在原料供应方面的挑战，因为水力压裂技术的发展使得含有大量丙烷的页岩气凝析油更便宜、更丰富。PDH技术还提高了工艺效率和产品选择性，这对于满足全球对丙烯日益增长的需求至关重要。陶氏化学公司预测，到2035年，丙烯需求将以每年平均2%至3%的速度增长，预计在2016年至2035年间将超过生产能力。
