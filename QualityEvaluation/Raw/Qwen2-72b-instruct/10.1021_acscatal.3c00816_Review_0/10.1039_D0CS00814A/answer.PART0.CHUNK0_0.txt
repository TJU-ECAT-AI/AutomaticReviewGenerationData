[1] "Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
[2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
[3] "Especially, PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
[4] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has received extensive attention in recent years as an industrial technology for direct propylene production. It is considered one of the most promising methods for propylene production because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product. With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates containing a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful. Therefore, PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by providing a direct, efficient, and selective method for propylene production.

1.近年来，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术作为直接生产丙烯的工业技术，受到了广泛关注。它被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法之一，因为它是一种专有方法，只生产丙烯，而不是混合产品。随着水力压裂技术的发展，可以大规模提取含有大量丙烷的页岩气凝析液，使原料更便宜、更丰富。因此，PDH技术通过提供直接、高效和选择性的丙烯生产方法，特别解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
