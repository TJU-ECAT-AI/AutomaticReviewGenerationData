[1] "Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
[2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
[3] "Especially, PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
[4] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production, which has received extensive attention in recent years. With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates containing a large amount of propane can be extracted on a large scale, making the feedstock cheaper and more abundant. PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising methods for propylene production because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product. The Dow Chemical Company forecasted in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种直接生产丙烯的工业技术，近年来受到广泛关注。随着水力压裂技术的发展，可以大规模开采含有大量丙烷的页岩气凝析油，使原料更便宜、更丰富。PDH技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法之一，因为它是一种专有方法，只生产丙烯，而不是混合产品。2016年，陶氏化学公司预测，到2035年，丙烯需求将以每年2%至3%的平均速度增长，预计2016年至2035年间将超过生产能力。
