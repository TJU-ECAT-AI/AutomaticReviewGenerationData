1.In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its advantages in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH specifically tackles issues related to feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is widely available as a byproduct of natural gas processing and crude oil refining. This makes PDH less dependent on specific feedstocks compared to steam cracking, which primarily uses naphtha. In terms of process efficiency, PDH offers a more direct route to propylene, bypassing the intermediate production of lighter hydrocarbons that are common in steam cracking. This direct conversion results in higher yields of propylene per unit of feedstock. Additionally, PDH technology can achieve high selectivity towards propylene, minimizing the formation of byproducts such as ethylene and butadiene, which are more prevalent in steam cracking. The higher selectivity and direct conversion of propane to propylene in PDH processes contribute to lower overall energy consumption and reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to steam cracking.

1.鉴于全球对丙烯需求的不断增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面具有优势。PDH通过利用丙烷，具体解决了原料供应的问题，丙烷作为天然气加工和原油精炼的副产品，广泛可用。这使得PDH对特定原料的依赖性低于主要使用石脑油的蒸汽裂解。在过程效率方面，PDH为丙烯提供了一条更直接的途径，绕过了蒸汽裂解中常见的较轻烃类中间体的生产。这种直接转化导致每单位原料的丙烯产量更高。此外，PDH技术可以实现对丙烯的高选择性，最小化乙烯和丁二烯等副产品的形成，这些副产品在蒸汽裂解中更为普遍。PDH过程中丙烯的高选择性和丙烷直接转化为丙烯，有助于降低整体能耗和温室气体排放，与蒸汽裂解相比。
