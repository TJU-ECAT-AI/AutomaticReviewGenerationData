Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has been paid increasing attention owing to worldwide growing demand of propene and the increasing availability of propane from shale gas. PDH is one of the most effective technologies to produce propene, which is an important industrial raw material for the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone and other industrial products. Compared with industrial Pt and Cr-based catalysts, non-noble zinc-based catalysts have the advantages of low cost and nontoxic. However, they often suffer from limited catalytic activity and poor stability. The introduction of moderate Ni into ZnO supported Silicalite-1 zeolite can increase catalytic activity and stability simultaneously.

1.由于全球对丙烯需求的不断增长和页岩气中丙烷供应的增加，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术受到了越来越多的关注。PDH是生产丙烯最有效的技术之一，丙烯是生产聚丙烯、丙烯腈、环氧丙烷、丙酮等工业产品的重要工业原料。与工业Pt和Cr基催化剂相比，非贵金属锌基催化剂具有低成本和无毒的优点。然而，它们通常受到有限的催化活性和较差稳定性的困扰。将适量的Ni引入到ZnO支撑的Silicalite-1沸石中，可以同时提高催化活性和稳定性。
