1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has been paid increasing attention owing to worldwide growing demand of propene and the increasing availability of propane from shale gas. PDH is one of the most effective technologies to produce propene, which is an important industrial raw material for the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone and other industrial products. Compared with industrial Pt and Cr-based catalysts, non-noble zinc-based catalysts have the advantages of low cost and nontoxic. However, they often suffer from limited catalytic activity and poor stability. The introduction of moderate Ni into ZnO supported Silicalite-1 zeolite can increase catalytic activity and stability simultaneously.

1.由于全球对丙烯需求的不断增长和页岩气中丙烷供应的增加，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术受到了越来越多的关注。PDH是生产丙烯最有效的技术之一，丙烯是生产聚丙烯、丙烯腈、环氧丙烷、丙酮等工业产品的重要工业原料。与工业Pt和Cr基催化剂相比，非贵金属锌基催化剂具有低成本和无毒的优点。然而，它们通常受到有限的催化活性和较差稳定性的困扰。将适量的Ni引入到ZnO支撑的Silicalite-1沸石中，可以同时提高催化活性和稳定性。
