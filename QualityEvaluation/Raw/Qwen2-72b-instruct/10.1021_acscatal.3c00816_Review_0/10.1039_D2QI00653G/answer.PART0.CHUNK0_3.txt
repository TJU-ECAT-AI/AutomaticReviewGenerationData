[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent.1 The conventional propylene production processes include fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel.2 However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene. Thus, given these circumstances, a highly efficient way to produce propylene is urgently need, both scientifically and economically.3 In the past few years, multiple technologies for the production of propylene have been developed, such as the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process,4,5 FischerTropsch (FT) process,6 and propane dehydrogenation (PDH).7 Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products.715 In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap. Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions. The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is recognized as one of the most promising methods for propylene production due to its on-purpose process that specifically targets propylene production, avoiding the generation of mixed hydrocarbon products. This technology is particularly advantageous in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods, which heavily rely on fossil fuels and emit large amounts of CO2, while also having relatively low propylene selectivity. PDH technology benefits from the advent of fracking technology, which produces shale gas rich in propane, making feedstocks for PDH extremely cheap. Additionally, PDH factories are highly adaptable, capable of running various reactions, and the significant price difference between propylene and propane, coupled with the growing propylene market, makes PDH highly profitable.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其专门针对丙烯生产，避免了混合烃类产品的生成，而被公认为是最有前景的丙烯生产方法之一。这种技术特别有助于解决传统生产方法面临的挑战，这些方法严重依赖化石燃料，排放大量二氧化碳，同时丙烯选择性相对较低。PDH技术得益于水力压裂技术的出现，该技术生产的页岩气富含丙烷，使PDH的原料极其便宜。此外，PDH工厂高度可调，能够运行各种反应，丙烯和丙烷之间的显著价格差异，加上丙烯市场的增长，使得PDH极具盈利性。
