1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production or how it addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, PDH technology is generally known to offer advantages such as higher feedstock flexibility, potentially higher process efficiency, and better product selectivity compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. PDH can use propane as a direct feedstock, which is more widely available and can be sourced from various natural gas processing and oil refining operations. This reduces dependency on naphtha, a more expensive and less abundant feedstock for steam cracking. PDH processes are also designed to produce propylene with minimal by-products, improving overall yield and selectivity. Additionally, PDH plants can be smaller and more modular, potentially leading to lower capital and operating costs.

1.文献没有提供关于丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术生产丙烯的具体优势，也没有说明它如何解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。但是，PDH技术通常具有以下优势：与传统的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解方法相比，具有更高的原料灵活性，潜在的更高过程效率和更好的产品选择性。PDH可以使用丙烷作为直接原料，丙烷的来源更广泛，可以从各种天然气加工和石油精炼作业中获得。这减少了对蒸汽裂解中更昂贵、更稀缺的原料石脑油的依赖。PDH工艺设计用于生产丙烯，同时产生最少的副产品，从而提高整体产量和选择性。此外，PDH工厂可以更小、更模块化，可能带来更低的资本和运营成本。
