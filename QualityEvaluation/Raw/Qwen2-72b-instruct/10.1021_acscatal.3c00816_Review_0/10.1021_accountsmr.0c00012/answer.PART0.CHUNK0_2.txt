[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."

[2] "Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are widely applied in commercialized PDH processes, and both exhibit high activity and propylene yields."

[3] "However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth."

[4] "Nanostructured catalysts (NCs) based on metals and/or metal oxides with tunable geometric and electronic properties play significant roles because such features intrinsically influence the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is developing as a promising method for propylene production, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH uses Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, which exhibit high activity and propylene yields. However, the process is endothermic and requires high temperatures, leading to issues like coking and particle sintering. Nanostructured catalysts, with tunable geometric and electronic properties, are crucial as they influence the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface, improving process efficiency and product selectivity.
