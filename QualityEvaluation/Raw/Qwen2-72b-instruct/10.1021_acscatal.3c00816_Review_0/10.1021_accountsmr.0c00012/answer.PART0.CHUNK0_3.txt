[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing. Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are widely applied in commercialized PDH processes, and both exhibit high activity and propylene yields. However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is developing as a promising method for propylene production. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by using propane as a feedstock, which is widely available. PDH processes using Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts exhibit high activity and propylene yields. However, PDH is an endothermic process that requires high temperatures, which can lead to coking side reactions and particle sintering, affecting the selectivity and stability of the catalyst.
