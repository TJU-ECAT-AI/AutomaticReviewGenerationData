[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing. Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are widely applied in commercialized PDH processes, and both exhibit high activity and propylene yields. However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a developing technology for the production of propylene, a significant compound in the chemical industry. PDH uses Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, which have high activity and propylene yields. However, PDH is an endothermic process that requires high temperatures, leading to issues with selectivity and catalyst stability due to coking and particle sintering.
