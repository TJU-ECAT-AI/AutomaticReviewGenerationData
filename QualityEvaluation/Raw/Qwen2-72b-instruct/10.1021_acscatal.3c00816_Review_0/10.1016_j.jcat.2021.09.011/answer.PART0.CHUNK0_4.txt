1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene, implying that PDH offers advantages in process efficiency and product selectivity. The literature also notes that the industrial demand for ethylene and propylene was previously satisfied by large-scale production from naphtha crackers, but the availability of a new and less expensive source of ethylene from ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas has disrupted the previous ethylene-propylene production balance, suggesting that PDH may offer benefits in terms of feedstock availability.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体信息。但是,它确实提到PDH因其能够满足大量丙烯需求的最有效工艺而受到关注,这意味着PDH在工艺效率和产品选择性方面提供了优势。文献还指出,工业对乙烯和丙烯的需求以前是通过大规模生产从石脑油裂解来满足的,但天然气和页岩气中乙烷裂解产生的更便宜的乙烯来源打破了以前的乙烯-丙烯生产平衡,这表明PDH可能在原料供应方面提供了优势。
