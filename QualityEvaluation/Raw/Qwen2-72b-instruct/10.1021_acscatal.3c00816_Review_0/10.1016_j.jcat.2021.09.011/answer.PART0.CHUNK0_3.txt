1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH is considered the most efficient process to meet the large demand for propylene, especially since the previous ethylene-propylene production balance was disrupted by the availability of ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas. This suggests that PDH offers a more flexible and potentially less expensive source of propylene compared to traditional methods that rely on naphtha crackers.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体优势信息。但是，它确实提到PDH被认为是满足大量丙烯需求的最有效过程，特别是在天然气和页岩气中的乙烷裂解成为可用的更便宜的乙烯来源，打破了以前的乙烯-丙烯生产平衡之后。这表明PDH提供了一个更灵活的，可能成本更低的丙烯来源，与依赖于石脑油裂解炉的传统方法相比。
