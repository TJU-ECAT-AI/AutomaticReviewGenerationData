1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods. However, it does mention that PDH has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene, suggesting that PDH offers advantages in process efficiency and product selectivity. The literature also notes that the industrial demand for ethylene and propylene was previously satisfied with a balance by large-scale production from naphtha crackers, but the availability of ethylene from ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas has disrupted this balance, causing a need to find proper on-purpose methods for propylene production. PDH is one such method that can address the challenges of feedstock availability and process efficiency in propylene production.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的具体信息。但是,它确实提到PDH因其能够满足大量丙烯需求的最有效工艺而受到关注,这表明PDH在工艺效率和产品选择性方面具有优势。文献还指出,工业对乙烯和丙烯的需求以前是通过大规模的石脑油裂解生产来平衡的,但天然气和页岩气中乙烷裂解产生的乙烯打破了这种平衡,导致需要找到适当的特定目的方法来生产丙烯。PDH就是一种可以解决丙烯生产中原料供应和工艺效率挑战的方法。
