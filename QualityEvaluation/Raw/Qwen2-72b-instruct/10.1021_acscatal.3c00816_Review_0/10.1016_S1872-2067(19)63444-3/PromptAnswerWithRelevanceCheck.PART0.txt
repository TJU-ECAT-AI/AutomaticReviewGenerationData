1.The growing global demand for propylene has led to increased attention on propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology as an alternative method for propylene production. PDH is seen as a promising method because it can turn low-value propane into value-added propylene, making it a great means for utilizing shale gas. This technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, as it does not rely on the steam cracking of naphtha or the fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil. PDH also offers process efficiency and product selectivity advantages, as it can achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

1.The growing global demand for propylene has led to increased attention on propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology as an alternative method for propylene production. PDH offers several key advantages over conventional production methods, particularly in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike traditional methods that rely on steam cracking of naphtha or fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil, PDH can directly convert propane, a readily available and abundant feedstock, into propylene. This makes PDH a more sustainable and cost-effective option, especially in regions with abundant shale gas resources. Moreover, PDH technology typically exhibits higher process efficiency and product selectivity, as it can directly target the conversion of propane to propylene with minimal production of by-products. This results in a cleaner, more targeted production process that can better meet the increasing demand for propylene while minimizing environmental impact and maximizing economic benefits.

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to turn low-value propane into value-added propylene, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH is an alternative way to obtain propylene, mainly from the steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil. With the increasing demand for propylene and the exploitation of shale gas, PDH has drawn great attention and been widely employed in commercial propylene production. The commercial PDH catalysts are based on Pt and CrOx, but the high cost of Pt and toxicity of CrOx greatly hinder their further wide application. Moreover, both of them are easy to be deactivated and need frequent regeneration. Supported VOx catalysts have been intensively employed in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (OPDH), while they have received relatively less attention in oxygen-free PDH reaction.
