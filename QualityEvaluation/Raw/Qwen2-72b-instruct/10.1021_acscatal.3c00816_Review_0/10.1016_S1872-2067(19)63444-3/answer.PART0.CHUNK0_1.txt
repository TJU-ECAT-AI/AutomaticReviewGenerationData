1.The growing global demand for propylene has led to increased attention on propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology as an alternative method for propylene production. PDH is seen as a promising method because it can turn low-value propane into value-added propylene, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike conventional methods that rely on steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil, PDH can utilize propane, which is abundant in shale gas, as a feedstock. This makes PDH a great means for converting low-value propane into high-value propylene, especially in light of the increasing demand for propylene and the exploitation of shale gas.

1.全球对丙烯需求的不断增长使得人们更加关注丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术作为丙烯生产的一种替代方法。PDH被视为一种有前景的方法，因为它可以将低价值的丙烷转化为增值的丙烯，解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。与依赖于石脑油蒸汽裂解和重油流化催化裂化的传统方法不同，PDH可以利用在页岩气中丰富的丙烷作为原料。这使得PDH成为将低价值丙烷转化为高价值丙烯的一种极好方式，特别是在丙烯需求增加和页岩气开发的背景下。
