1.The growing global demand for propylene has led to increased attention on propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology as an alternative method for propylene production. PDH is seen as a promising method because it can turn low-value propane into value-added propylene, making it a great means for utilizing shale gas. This technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, as it does not rely on the steam cracking of naphtha or the fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil. PDH also offers process efficiency and product selectivity advantages, as it can achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

1.全球对丙烯需求的不断增长使得人们更加关注丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术作为丙烯生产的一种替代方法。PDH被视为一种有前景的方法，因为它可以将低价值的丙烷转化为高附加值的丙烯，是利用页岩气的绝佳方式。这项技术解决了传统生产方法在原料供应方面的问题，因为它不依赖于石脑油的蒸汽裂解或重油的流化催化裂化。PDH在过程效率和产品选择性方面也具有优势，因为它可以实现高丙烷转化率和高丙烯选择性。
