1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to turn low-value propane into value-added propylene, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH is an alternative way to obtain propylene, mainly from the steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil. With the increasing demand for propylene and the exploitation of shale gas, PDH has drawn great attention and been widely employed in commercial propylene production. The commercial PDH catalysts are based on Pt and CrOx, but the high cost of Pt and toxicity of CrOx greatly hinder their further wide application. Moreover, both of them are easy to be deactivated and need frequent regeneration. Supported VOx catalysts have been intensively employed in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (OPDH), while they have received relatively less attention in oxygen-free PDH reaction.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前途的方法，因为它能够将低价值的丙烷转化为增值的丙烯，解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。PDH是一种获得丙烯的替代方式，主要来自石脑油的蒸汽裂解和重油的流体催化裂化。随着丙烯需求的增加和页岩气的开发，PDH引起了广泛关注，并被广泛应用于商业丙烯生产。商业PDH催化剂基于Pt和CrOx，但Pt的高成本和CrOx的毒性极大地阻碍了它们的进一步广泛应用。此外，两者都容易失活，需要频繁再生。支持VOx催化剂已被广泛用于丙烷氧化脱氢至丙烯（OPDH），而在无氧PDH反应中，它们受到的关注相对较少。
