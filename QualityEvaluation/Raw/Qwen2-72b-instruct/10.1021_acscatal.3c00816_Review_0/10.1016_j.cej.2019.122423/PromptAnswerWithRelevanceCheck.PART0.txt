Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, PDH is considered a promising method for propylene production due to its potential to utilize abundant natural gas and shale gas resources as feedstock, which can provide a stable and cheap source for light alkanes including propane. Direct transformation of propane is an efficient way to increase propylene production. PDH offers an alternative to conventional cracking processes, which consume a large amount of energy and often result in a gap between demand and supply of propene. The non-oxidative PDH route is considered more efficient and has become an emerging technology used today.

1.文献没有提供丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法挑战方面的具体信息。然而，PDH被认为是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，因为它有可能利用丰富的天然气和页岩气资源作为原料，这可以为包括丙烷在内的轻烷烃提供稳定和廉价的来源。丙烷的直接转化是一种提高丙烯产量的有效方式。PDH为传统裂解工艺提供了一种替代方案，传统裂解工艺消耗大量能源，且经常导致丙烯需求和供应之间的差距。非氧化PDH路线被认为更有效，已成为今天使用的新兴技术。
