1.The literature does not provide specific information on the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. However, PDH is considered a promising method for propylene production due to its potential to utilize abundant natural gas and shale gas resources as feedstock, which can provide a stable and cheap source for light alkanes including propane. Direct transformation of propane to propylene is an efficient way to increase propylene production. PDH technology is expected to offer process efficiency and product selectivity advantages over conventional methods, which consume large amounts of energy and often result in a gap between demand and supply of propene.

1.文献没有提供关于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法挑战方面的具体信息。然而，PDH被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法之一，因为它有可能利用丰富的天然气和页岩气资源作为原料，为包括丙烷在内的轻烷烃提供稳定和廉价的来源。丙烷的直接转化是增加丙烯产量的有效途径。PDH技术预计在过程效率和产品选择性方面将比传统方法具有优势，传统方法消耗大量能源，且经常导致丙烯需求与供应之间的差距。
