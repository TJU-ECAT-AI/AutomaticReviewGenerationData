<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

[1] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230)"
[2] "Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233)"
[3] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228)"
[4] "A direct one-step reaction pathway is highly disfavored (Ea > 65 kcal mol1), because it involves a four-center transition state with a carbon in the β-position (Scheme 15e). (227)"
[5] "Finally, alumina supported Th hydride species, generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyze H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b). (242)"
[6] "This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c)."
[7] "Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."

1.硅胶支持的锆氢化物是单氢化物和双氢化物的混合物，其中双氢化物对CH4的反应性更强。这些物种催化H2/D2或CH4/D2混合物中的H/D交换反应，通过逐步插入氘，即使在室温以下的温度下，反应也很快。反应途径是一个两步机制，涉及通过σ键变位的CH键活化，形成金属烷基中间体，然后是氢解，再生金属氢化物并在烷烃中掺入氘。直接一步反应途径是高度不利的。
2.氧化铝支持的钍氢化物催化D2/烷烃混合物的H/D交换反应。这个反应很快，速率在800-1200 h1之间，对末端CH键有轻微的选择性。氘的掺入并不具有选择性，二甲基环己烷在H/D交换过程中通过β-H转移和链行走机制发生顺反异构化。
