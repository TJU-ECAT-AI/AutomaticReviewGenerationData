Scheme 15 Scheme 15. (a) CH Bond Activation of Cycloalkanes on Silica Supported Zirconium Hydrides [ZrH]; (b) Formation and Structure of [ZrH]; (c) H/D Exchange Reaction Catalyzed by [ZrH] (M = Zr); (d) Stepwise Mechanism (Favored); (e) One-Step Mechanism (Unfavored) The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230) Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233) Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228) A direct one-step reaction pathway is highly disfavored (Ea > 65 kcal mol1), because it involves a four-center transition state with a carbon in the β-position (Scheme 15e). (227) The related silica supported tantalum hydrides are prepared in a similar way. They are mixtures of surface species (Scheme 16a), and current data are consistent with the presence of mono- and tris-hydride species. (234) This system displays a similar reactivity to zirconium hydrides, i.e. the low temperature activation of alkanes and H/D exchange reactions, through very likely the same mechanism, σ-bond metathesis (Scheme 15c and d, M = Ta). (235-238) Nonetheless, in the specific case of cycloalkanes, the cycloalkyl surface species evolved toward more highly unsaturated species through dehydrogenation processes. For instance, activation of cyclopentane yields a well-defined silica supported cyclopentandienyl tantalum species, (238) which involves successive CH bond activation processes (Scheme 16b). (239, 240) In the case of methane, it leads to the formation of TaCH3, TaCH2, and TaCH species (Scheme 16c). (234) Computational studies suggest that the tris-hydride Ta species is probably the active species and activates alkanes via σ-bond metathesis. (241) Scheme 16 Scheme 16. (a) Formation and Structure of the Silica Supported Tantalum Hydrides [TaH]; (b) Reaction of [TaH] with Cyclopentane; (c) Reaction of [TaH] with CH4 Finally, alumina supported Th hydride species, generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyze H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b). (242) This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c). Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d).
Scheme 17 Scheme 17. Alumina Supported Th Hydrides and H/D Exchange Reactions: (a) Formation of [ThH]; (b) H/D Exchange of D2/Alkane Mixtures; (c) Selectivity in Isotopomer; (d) Chain Walking Mechanims of Incorporation of D at Different Positions of an Alkane Like metal-hydride, metal-alkyl and metal-aryl species can activate CH bonds, leading to the exchange of perhydrocarbyl ligand. (224, 243, 244) While not directly evidenced experimentally, computational studies suggest that the methyl/methyl exchange of the d0 zirconium methyl species in the presence of methane can readily take place via σ-bond metathesis (Scheme 18a). (228) Similarly, the silica supported Ir-complex (SiO)Ir(Ph)(PMe3)Cp* reacts with benzene to exchange its phenyl ligand, like its molecular equivalents (Scheme 18b). (245) Scheme 18 Scheme 18. (a) Methyl/Methane Exchange on a d0 Metal, e.g. M = Zr; (b) Phenyl/Benzene Exchange on Ir Activation of Alkanes on Silica Supported Metal Alkylidenes and Alkylidynes Surface metal alkylidene species are typically formed via decomposition of bis-alkyl intermediates via α-H abstraction, (246) and the reverse step corresponds to the CH bond activation of an alkane onto a MC bond. (247-250) Evidence for this process has been obtained in the metathesis of alkane (CH3CH2R) on various well-defined metal neopentyl neopentylidene species (M = Ta, (251, 252) Mo, (253, 254) W, (255) and Re (254)) through the formation of cross-metathesis products with the following selectivity tBuCH3 > tBuCH2CH3 > tBuCH2CH2R, while the coupling product, tBuCH2CH2CH2R, is not detected (Table 1, entries 19). Note that the formation of these products requires neopentyl neopentylidene surface species and an alkane of general structure RCH2CH3. This implies that both the neopentyl and the neopentylidene ligands are important and that β-H transfer is probably a key step. These products probably result from a stepwise mechanism involving known elementary steps of molecular organometallic chemistry (Scheme 19, R1 = R2 = tBu): (i) CH bond activation of RCH2CH3 on the metal alkylidene, thus forming an intermediate with three pendant alkyl ligands [M(CH2tBu)2(CH2CH2R)], (247-250) of which one has a β-H; alternative mechanisms are possible involving the replacement of the alkyl ligand via σ-bond metathesis or the formation of an alkylidyne ligand prior to CH bond activation (Scheme 19a); (ii) decomposition of this intermediate via α-H abstraction leading to tBuCH3 and a neopentylidene alkyl intermediate [M(CHtBu)(CH2CH2R)] (Scheme 19b); (iii) further decomposition via β-H abstraction, generating neopentylidene hydride intermediates [M(CHtBu)(H)] and RCHCH2; (iv) disproportionation of these intermediates via [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion, which yields two sets of products [M(CHR)(H)]/tBuCHCH2 and [M(CH2)(H)]/tBuCHCHR; (v) subsequent alkene insertion into the metal alkylidene hydride intermediates, CH bond activation, and decomposition, generating [M(CHR)(CH2R)] and [M(CH2)(CH2R)] along with the cross-metathesis products tBuCH2CH3 and tBuCH2CH2R (Scheme 19c). The higher selectivity of tBuCH2CH3 compared to that of tBuCH2CH2R would be the consequence of the more facile approach in the [2 + 2]-cycloaddition step of the alkene in the former case (1,3) compared to the latter (1,2), which is consistent with what is observed in the cross-metathesis of propene and well-defined neopentylidene surface complexes (formation of about a 3 to 1 ratio of tBuCHCH2 and tBuCHCHMe).

Reaction of Alkanes (RCH2CH3) with Alkyl Alkylidene Metal Surface Species, M(CHR1)(CH2R2): (a) CH Bond Activation; (b) Rearrangement; (c) Formation of Cross-metathesis Products Finally, the reaction of propane with silicaalumina and alumina supported bisalkylalkylidyne W systems, namely [(AlSO)W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] or [(SiO)SiO2-Al2O3W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2], (260-262) also yields the cross-metathesis products tBuCH3 and tBuCH2CH3 as well as tBuCH2CH2CH3. Nonetheless, the relative ratio of these products is very different from what is obtained by the alkyl alkylidene species and in particular the low selectivity of tBuCH2CH2CH3 (Table 1, entries 1012). This probably shows that the mechanisms of formation of these products differ, and could result from with CH bond activation of propane on the metal-alkylidyne species as recently demonstrated in molecular systems. (263-265) However, recent DFT calculations suggest that CH bond activation on these alkyl alkylidyne complexes is a high energy process, and an alternative mechanism has been proposed, which involves the formation of alkene on alumina site by dehydrogenation (vide supra section ) and alkene metathesis on a bis-alkylidene intermediate. (62) Intramolecular CH Bond Activation Processes Thermal decomposition of bis-alkyl surface species leads to formation of well-defined silica supported metal alkylidene complexes via α-H abstraction. This elementary step involves the intramolecular activation of the CH bond at one of the alkyl ligands in the α-position by an adjacent ligand (here another alkyl), which corresponds to an intramolecular version of a σ-bond metathesis process. (246, 266) This process is typically observed upon the grafting of molecular alkylidene complexes on silica surfaces, e.g. Ta and Re, (267-269) which first react with the surface silanols via [1,2]-addition, yielding bis-alkyl species before decomposing into the alkylidene (Scheme 20a). Note however that other grafting pathways have been encountered; for example, grafting of Mo and W alkylidene complexes usually takes place via the direct electrophilic cleavage of σ-bonded ligands (Scheme 20b). (258, 259, 270) Note also that [(tBuCH2)3Mo(N)] reacts with surface silanols to generate [(SiO)Mo(NH)(CH2tBu)3], which probably decomposes into the putative surface complex [(SiO) Mo(NH)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)], as evidenced by the evolution of tBuCH3 and the high activity of this species in alkene metathesis (Scheme 20c). (271, 272) The α-H abstraction process has also been observed upon the thermal treatment of bis(alkyl) surface species [(SiO)2M(CH2R)2] (M = Ti, Zr, and Cr; Scheme 20d), which yields [(SiO)2M(CHR)]. (273-275) Finally, the mechanism of grafting [Os(CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2], a d2 complex, is also noteworthy and leads to [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] via isomerization of the metal fragment from a bis-alkylidene into an alkyl alkylidyne complex (Scheme 21a). (276) One of the key steps involves an intramolecular CH bond activation process, α-H transfer, to transform the bis-alkylidene into an alkyl alkylidyne fragment. Experimental and theoretical studies point toward two possible grafting processes: (i) isomerization of [Os(CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2] into [Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] upon coordination of a surface silanol through α-H transfers followed by σ-bond metathesis or (ii) grafting via σ-bond metathesis followed by isomerization of the metal fragment. This is in sharp contrast with the grafting of the corresponding alkylidyne complexes [M(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] of d0 metals (M = Mo and W), which takes place via σ-bond metathesis without isomerization of the metal fragment (Scheme 21b).
