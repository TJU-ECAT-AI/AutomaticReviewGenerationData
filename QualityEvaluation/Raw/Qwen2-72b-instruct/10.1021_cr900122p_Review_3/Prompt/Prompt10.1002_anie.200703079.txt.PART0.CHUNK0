An Alkylidyne Analogue of Tebbe's Reagent: Trapping Reactions of a Titanium Neopentylidyne by Incomplete and Complete 1,2-Additions Graphical Abstract Who is the man behind the aluminum mask? The first Group4 Lewis acid stabilized alkylidyne (2; see picture) is generated by incomplete addition of trimethylaluminum across a {TiCtBu} moiety (1; PNP=[2-{P(CHMe2)2}-4-MeC6H3]2N). In contrast, B(OCH3)3 completely adds to 1 by BO bond cleavage to afford an unusual alkylidene. Complex 2, a masked alkylidyne titanium compound, also ring-opens pyridine.Methylenation of carbonyl-containing functionalities has driven the research of organotitanium reagents for use in organic chemistry.1,2 Tebbe's reagent, [Cp2Ti{CH2AlCl(CH3)2}] (Cp=C5H5),3 a Lewis acid stabilized methylidene complex prepared from addition of two equivalents of Al(CH3)3 to [Cp2TiCl2] [Eq.(1)], was one of the first reported early-transition-metal systems to perform olefin metathesis in a catalytic manner.4 Hence, it is not surprising that this complex can be often utilized as a Wittig-like reagent for carbonyl methylenation reactions, since it is more reactive than prototypical phospha-Wittig reactants, and works particularly well for sterically encumbered carbonyl groups present in aldehydes, esters, lactones, and amides.5 It has been argued that the AlMe2Cl moiety in Tebbe's reagent alleviates the nucleophilic nature of the alkylidene αcarbon, thus rendering this reagent far less basic than a Wittig system. Consequently, methylidene-group transfer reactions involving Tebbe's complex and a chiral substrate often do not result in epimerization of the product.5 Although Tebbe's reagent was first prepared almost 30years ago, examples of an alkylidyne analogue for this seminal species have remained elusive, presumably because of the incipient negative charge confined at the TiC multiply bonded α-carbon atom. (1) Herein we report that an alkylidyne moiety in [(PNP)TiCtBu] (A; PNP=[2-{P(CHMe2)2}-4-methylphenyl]2N), generated from [(PNP)TiCHtBu(CH2tBu)] (1),6 can be conveniently stabilized with Al(CH3)3 to afford the first example of a Lewis acid stabilized Group4 alkylidyne [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)Al(CH3)3}] (2). Our studies suggest that Al(CH3)3 likely accelerates α-hydrogen abstraction in the process of making compound 2. We also demonstrate that complex 2 is remarkably stable, but in the presence of pyridine behaves as an alkylidyne analogue of Tebbe's reagent, thus cleanly ring opening the strong CN bond of the N-heterocycle. During the course of our studies we discovered that complex 1 can cleave the BO bond of the Lewis acid B(OCH3)3 to afford an unusual titanium complex containing an alkylidene ligand substituted with an electrophilic motif B(OCH3)2. The solid state structures for the zwitterionic species [(PNP)Ti{CtBuAl(CH3)3}] as well as the product resulting from BO bond cleavage across the TiC moiety in A are also presented and discussed.Our inability to trap the alkylidyne moiety in A by addition of Lewis bases, such as PR3 (R=CH3, Ph), THF, HMPA (hexamethyl phosphoramide), OP(CH3)3, and pyridines,7,8 prompted us to investigate whether the nucleophilic nature in the TiC linkage could be sequestered by a Lewis acid, such as Al(CH3)3. Tebbe and co-workers reported an analogous reaction involving [Cp2Ti(CH3)2] and Al(CH3)3 to afford [Cp2Ti{CH2Al(CH3)3}], which was characterized spectroscopically.3 However, this zwitterion was never generated in pure form and was contaminated by residual dimethyl precursor.3 We treated compound 16 with neat or stoichiometric Al(CH3)3, at low temperatures, which resulted in immediate formation of the zwitterionic complex [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)Al(CH3)3}] (2) concurrent with CH3tBu extrusion.9 Complex 2 has been characterized by 1H, 13C, 31P, and 27Al NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, as well as by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies.9 Whereas the 31PNMR spectrum clearly suggests 2 to have C1 symmetry in solution (two doublets, JPP=36Hz), the 1HNMR spectrum displays three inequivalent methyl resonances for the Al(CH3)3 moiety in 2, consistent with the two terminal Al(CH3)2 methyl groups being diastereotopic owing to the skewed symmetry of the PNP aryl framework.6,9 This diagnostic signature confirms that a rigid TiCAlC four-membered ring in 2 is preserved in solution at room temperature. Interestingly, the 13C and 13C{1H} NMR spectrum of 2 reveals a resonance at δ=333.0ppm for a highly deshielded carbon atom, which is consistent with a TiC multiply bonded functionality. This resonance does not couple directly to a hydrogen atom. Notably, the low-temperature 27Al NMR spectrum of 2 (40C) showed a broad resonance at δ=56.8 ppm (Δν1/2=5890Hz), and upon warming the probe to 45C, a second but minor resonance at δ=195.1ppm emerged with Δν1/2=5417Hz.9 Cooling the solution again to low temperature caused the second resonance to vanish, thus hinting that another species might be equilibrating with 2 upon warming.A structural analysis for 2 (Figure1)10 unambiguously portrays an unperturbed {(PNP)Ti} unit containing a remarkably short Lewis acid stabilized alkylidyne moiety (TiC, 1.825(2)Å),11 which is bridged by a {AlCH3} unit to furnish a puckered, four-membered alatitanacyclobutene. Intuitively, complex 2 originates from coordination of Al(CH3)3 to the nucleophilic alkylidyne carbon in putative A (Scheme1). Alternatively, formation of 2 can be viewed as an incomplete 1,2-AlC addition across the TiC functionality in A to yield a long AlCH3 bond for the bridging group (2.079(2)Å) compared to the terminal AlCH3 group (ca. 1.98Å). Congruently, bridging of the methyl group results in a comparatively long TiCH3 (2.293(3)Å) bond, when such a distance is compared to terminal TiCalkyl linkages in similar compounds, such as [(PNP)TiCHtBu(R)] (R=Ph, 2.141(5)Å; CH2tBu, 2.206(5)Å).6 Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Molecular structures of 2(left) and 5(right), with thermal ellipsoids set at 50% probability.

Also portrayed (lower) is the formation of complex 2 from 1 (by PathB orC)or 3 by addition of Al(CH3)3. See text for details.Based on the above metrical parameters, several isomeric structures could be proposed for 2 resulting from complete or incomplete methide transfer between aluminum and titanium (2 and 2a, Scheme1, upper left), or from adduct formation (structures 2b and 2c, Scheme1, upper right). Whereas the reactivity of isomer 2b is questionable, isomer 2a is best described as an alkylidene analogue and should display chemistry more closely to that of a TiC functionality. Isomer 2c on the other hand is more likely to expel Al(CH3)3, forming A, and should thus react like an alkylidyne. However, 2c was found to be 37kcalmol1 higher (by DFT methods) in energy than the other two isomers.9 Natural bond order (NBO) calculations agree well with our proposed connectivity for the resting-state geometry in 2. The computed Ti1C31 NBO is 2.04, a value confined between a bond order of two (1.74) and three (2.49), both of which we have previously reported.8 On the other hand, the Al36C31 NBO is 0.48, suggesting a weaker linkage than a terminal AlCH3 bond (NBO for Al36C37, 0.92; for Al36C38, 0.91). As implied by the bond lengths in the solid-state structure of 2, the Ti1C39 NBO is 0.57 and Al36C39 is 0.37. Hence, the interaction of the bridging methyl group is weak for both titanium and aluminum and best reflects an incomplete addition by formation of an ionic species. Further examination of the electronic structure of 2 shows that the HOMO is a πorbital composed of the TiC bond, and the LUMO is consistent with a d0Ti dxy nonbonding orbital (Figure2). However, HOMO2 can be recognized as a slipped σbond involving the Tid and C31px orbitals, whereas the HOMO6 is best viewed as being a lone pair of electrons originating from C39. As a result, the bridging methyl group in 2 can be considered more as an ionic interactionweaker than normal AlC bonds, whereas the Ti1C31 bond has stronger TiC interactions than a generic TiC bond.Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Most important molecular orbitals of the Ti-C31-Al-C39 metallacycle core of 2 (isodensity=0.05au). RedC, whiteH, yellowTi and P, light blueAl and N. Only the P and N atoms of the PNP ligand are shown for clarity.As noted above, formation of 2 might proceed by incomplete 1,2-Al addition of Al(CH3)3 across the TiC linkage of putative A (Scheme1, PathA). However, alkyl abstraction in 1 by Al(CH3)3 could also result in formation of an alkylidene cation concurrent with formation of the superbasic ion [Al(CH2tBu)(CH3)3] (Scheme1, PathB). This superbase would then ensue generation of 2 by α-deprotonation. Schrock and Sharp have proposed a similar pathway in the formation of a [Cp2Ta{CH2Al(CH3)3}(CH3)].12 Alternatively, the assembly of 2 could also proceed by addition of Al(CH3)3 to the nucleophilic alkylidene carbon in 1 followed by α-hydrogen abstraction (Scheme1, PathC). As formation of 2 from 1 and Al(CH3)3 is rapid (after several seconds the reaction is complete), we propose that Al(CH3)3 does in fact promote elimination of CH3tBu given that the t1/2 for 1 in benzene is much slower with a value of 3.1h at 25C (kavg=6.5(4)×105s1).6 We also found that compound 2 can be prepared from [(PNP)TiCHtBu(Ph)] (3) and Al(CH3)3 over several minutes at 25C (Scheme1).6 These results imply that the Lewis acid accelerates α-hydrogen abstraction in precursors 1 and 3, especially since the latter precursor can only equilibrate to A in benzene under forcing conditions (95120C) with a kavg=1.2(2)×105s1.6 As a result, we speculate that PathsB and C are operative in these reactions, and that a naked alkylidyne intermediate, PathA, is not generated in these reactions.To test whether 2 is indeed an alkylidyne synthon, we investigated several substrates that would react cleanly with 1 via a transient alkylidyne intermediate. Unfortunately, complex 2 is remarkably stable at temperatures above 80C for 2days in C6H6,6 and in the presence of nitriles,13 which is in stark contrast to 1. In the presence of Lewis bases, such as quinuclidine, HMPA, and phosphines, complex 2 slowly decomposes at >90C, but to a myriad of intractable products. However, treatment of 2 with excess pyridine at 40C over 2days results in quantitative conversion into the known azametallabicyclic compound [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)CC4H4NH}] (4)8 and the adduct [(CH3)3Al(NC5H5)] (Scheme2).9 The ring-opened pyridine complex 4 can be prepared independently from 1 in neat pyridine, and the results of mechanistic studies are in accordance with intermediate A being generated along the reaction coordinate.8 This result does support the notion that 2 is a synthon to A, but only when the reagent can sequester the Lewis acid while simultaneously acting as a substrate for the nucleophilic {TiCtBu} ligand.Scheme 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Synthesis of complexes 4 and 5 from compounds 2 and 1, respectively.Milder electrophiles also react with 1, but result instead in complete 1,2-addition. For example, treatment of 1 with B(OCH3)3 causes a rapid color change from green to red, concurrent with formation of the alkylidene methoxide complex [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)B(OCH3)2}(OCH3)] (5; Scheme2).9 The solid-state structure of 5 (Figure1)14 is a six-coordinate TiIV alkylidene species (TiC, δ=323.7ppm), in which of one of the methoxy groups has migrated from boron to the metal center.14 As a result, the alkylidene carbon has accepted a B(OCH3)2 group (11BNMR spectroscopy: δ=40.2ppm, Δν1/2=11692Hz). Based on the molecular structure of 5, all the OCH3 groups should be inequivalent, given the skewed orientation of each inequivalent phosphorus arm (31PNMR spectrum: two doublets with JPP=47Hz). However, the 1HNMR spectrum of 5 implies that the interaction suggested by the solid-state structure is fluxional; the spectrum indicates only two inequivalent OCH3 groups in a 2:1 ratio (Scheme2). The solid-state structure of 5 (Figure1) has a TiC bond (1.976(2)Å) which is longer than other titanium alkylidene linkages reported with this ligand.6,7,11b This elongation could be the result of a higher coordination environment about the metal center. Most notably, the alkoxide distance (Ti1O41, 1.787(4)Å) is much shorter than the dative Ti1O32 interaction (2.206(4)Å).In conclusion, the Lewis acid stabilized titanium alkylidyne 2, analogous to Tebbe's reagent, was prepared and structurally characterized. In the presence of pyridine, 2 extrudes the Al(CH3)3 protecting group, thus behaving as a naked titanium alkylidyne, ultimately ring opening the N-heterocycle. As opposed to incomplete 1,2-addition of Al(CH3)3 across the the TiC linkage, milder electrophiles, such as B(OCH3)3, break apart to form an unprecedented titanium alkylidene incorporating the B(OCH3)2 moiety.
