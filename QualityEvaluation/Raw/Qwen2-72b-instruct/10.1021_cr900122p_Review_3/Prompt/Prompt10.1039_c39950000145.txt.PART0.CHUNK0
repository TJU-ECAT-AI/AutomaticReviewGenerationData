K, PO. Box 38000, 7030 BN Amsterdam, The Netherlands Thermal a-H abstraction from (C5H4R)2Ti(CH2CMe3)2 (R = H, Me) produces reactive titanocene neopentylidene intermediates under mild conditions, that can either be trapped with PMe3 to yield the alkylidene complexes (C5H4R)2(CHCMe3)PMe3,or add C-H bonds of hydrocarbon substrates R'H (R'H = benzene, p-xylene) to the T=C double bond to ptoduce (C5H4R)2Ti(CH2CMe3)R';an alternative reaction pathway, insertion of the alkylidene moiety into the cyclopeniadienyl C-C bond, has been observed in the presence of THF.The reactivity of trmsition-metal to nonmetal multiple bonds includes a wide varicty of reaction types, a number of which are relevant to useful processes such as hydrocarbon oxidation,ole fin metathesis and polymerisation. Recent investigations of the reactivity of met al-nonmetal multiple bonds have involved act I vation of hydri carbon C-H bonds by do-metal imido species. Intermolecidar addition of a C-H bond to an M=NR functionality consti1 Utes the microscopic reverse of a-elimina- tion from metal-hj drocarbyl-amido complexes and has now been established foi a number of transition metals (Zr,2 Ti,3 V,4 Ta' 1. Although mctal alkylidene species are, like imido complexes, also readily obtained via a-elimination, the corre- sponding reverse r( activity of metal-carbon double bonds in metal alkylidenes h,is to our knowledge been limited to a few inti amolecular casec,.6,7 Here we describe the generation under mild conditions of reactive titanocene neopentylidene species that are able to effe2t intermolecular addition of both sp2- and sp3-C-H bonds to the Ti=CHR double bond.Precursors of the neopentylidene species are the bis- (neopentyl) complc yes (C5H4R)2Ti(CH2CMe3)2 (R = H la, Me lb).They can b i k isolated at or below 0 "C from the reaction of h e correspondin;; dichlorides with Mg(CH2CMe3)Zadioxane in diethyl ether. Complex la has been previously described (but not spectroscopically characterised) as the product of the reaction between (C5H5)2 Tic12 and neopentyllithium at -80 "C.8 It can b<, stored as a solid for weeks at -40 "C,whereas l b  is an 0 1 1  and has to be used within a few days of preparation, even M hen stored cold. Compounds 1 decompose in wlution at ambient temperatures via a-H abstraction to give neopentane and a ti I anocene neopentylidene species. The latter can be trapped v ith PMe3 to give the thermally stable alkylidene complex 3s (CsH4R)2Ti(CHCMe3)PMe3 (R = H 2a, Me 2b, Scheme 1).
These show spectroscopic features typical of titanocene alkylidenes.9 For example, 2a has its 1H- and 13C- NMR Ti=CH- and Ti=CH- resonances at 6 12.32 (JpH = 7.2 Hz) and 6 3
12.9
(JpB = 27 Hz, JCH = 110 Hz) respectively. The bisneopentyl comp exes 1 are thus convenient precursors of titanocene alkylideiie species under mild conditions. 1 1 1 ,

Complex l a reacts in neat C6D6 to produce quantitatively (by NMR) the [1-2H] neopentyl L2H5] phenyl complex (C5H5)2 Ti(CHDCMe3)(C6D5) [2H6]-3a, with the selective incorpora- tion of one deuterium on the neopentyl a-carbon (Scheme 1).
This is evident from (a) the lJCD coupling constant of 18 Hz, (b) the isotope shift A6 of -1.0 ppm in the 13C-NMR spectrum of [2H6]-3a by comparison with separately prepared non-deu- teriated 3a, and (c) the inequivalence of the diastereotopic CsH5-ligands in [2H6]-3a. The reaction follows simple first- order kinetics over the temperature range 12.9-40.4 "C, and kinetic parameters were determined from an Arrhenius plot (of seven k-determinations over the cited temperature range) as AH$ = 18.2(5) kcal mol-l and A S  = -11.9(8) kcal mol-1 K-1 (1 cal = 4.184 J). A comparison with the kinetic parameters of the thermal decomposition of (C5Me&TiMe2 (via a-H abstraction followed by intramolecular trapping by C- H activation of the CMes-ligand Me-groups)6u of AH$ = 27.6 kcal mol-I and ASS = -2.8 kcal mol-l K-I shows that a-H abstraction in la is much more facile, and that the transition state has a higher degree of organisation, presumably due to the large CMe3 substituents on the alkyl groups. In solution at 20 "C, la has a half-life of 56 min, while this is only 20 min for the methylcyclopentadienyl derivative lb, showing that alkyl substitution on the cyclopentadienyl ligand facilitates the a-H abstraction process.
Intermolecular activation of benzylic sp3-CH bonds was also observed: reaction of la with [2HIo]-p-xylene produces (C5&)2- Ti(CHDCMe3)(CD2C6D4CD3-p) (
[2H
10]-4), although in this solvent, unlike in benzene, paramagnetic side products are formed. In mixed alkyl-benzyl complexes of this kind, the benzylic a-hydrogens are themselves susceptible to a-H abstraction, leading eventually to bis(benzy1ic) products. Thus in protio-p-xylene l a is transformed via transient protio-4 to the bis benzylic product (CSH5)2Ti(CH2C6H4Me-p)2

Attempts at intermolecular activation of aliphatic C-H bonds on titanocene alkylidene intermediates have so far produced inconclusive results. In alkane solvents (a-pentane, cyclohex- ane) complexes 1 produce dark poorly-soluble materials,suggesting reduction of the metal centre. However, in the presence of a few equivalents of THF a product is formed concurrently that indicates at least one alternative reaction pathway for these unsaturated alkylidene intermediates. Based on 1H- and W-NMR data$ the product was identified as a cyclohexadienyl complex,(C5H5)[y5-C5H5C(H)CMe3]- Ti(THF) 6, a compound apparently derived from an expansion of the cyclopentadienyl ring by insertion of the alkylidene moiety into one of the C-C bonds. The compound slowly decomposes under reaction conditions, liberating tert-butyl- benzene. The latter was identified by NMR spectroscopy (IH,13C) and GC through comparison with an authentic sample.
Cyclopentadienyl ring expansion has been observed in some cyclopentadienyl-metal-acyl complexes (M = TiLo, Tall, UI2),where the reaction is believed to involve the acyl as a 'Fischer'- type carbene that inserts into the CsH5 C-C bond.

unprecedented for early transition metal alkylidenes, and the precise mechanism of the observed reaction is as yet unclear.
Competition between ring expansion and C-H addition was observed in aromatic solvents in the presence of THF (4 equiv. per Ti), allowing an estimate of the relative trapping efficiency of the alkylidene intermediate by the aromatic substrates. In C6D6, the ring expansion product 6 and the C-H addition product [2H6]-3a are formed in a 23:77 ratio from la, as determined by NMR.5 A normal isotope effect appears to be present in the trapping of the alkylidene intermediate by C-H bonds, as the ratio 6 to 3a decreases to 4 :96 for the reaction in
C6H6
under otherwise identical conditions. The ring-expansion to C-H addition ratio increases to approximately 45:55 in [2Hlo]-p-xylene,showing that xylene is a less efficient trapping agent for the neopentylidene intermediate than benzene.
In conclusion, titanocene bis(neopenty1) complexes form convenient precursors of unsaturated alkylidene species that are able to effect intermolecular C-H activation. One possible reason for the readily observed intermolecular C-H activation in this system is that it may have difficulties in forming dimers:no evidence was obtained for formation of 1,3-dirnetallacyclo- butane species similar to [(C5H5)2Ti(p-CH2)]213 (for compari- son, the molybdenum complex (C5H5)Mo(CH2CMe3)2(N0) forms dimeric (C5H5)2M02(NO)(CHCMe3)(p-NO)- (p- CHCMe3) upon loss of neopentane).l4 In the absence of favourable intramolecular C-H activation pathways, it allows trapping of the Ti=C functionality by intermolecular addition of C-H bonds. The efficiency of this trapping is substrate- dependent, as can be seen from competition experiments with the ring-expansion reaction in the presence of THE Thus, it appears that intermolecular addition of C-H bonds to transition metal-heteroatom double bonds does not necessarily require a very high polarity of the latter.
