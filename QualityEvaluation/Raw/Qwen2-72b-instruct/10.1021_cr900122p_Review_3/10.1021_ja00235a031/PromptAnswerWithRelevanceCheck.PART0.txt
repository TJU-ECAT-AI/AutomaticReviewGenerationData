Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides, nor does it discuss their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, or mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. The literature focuses on the synthesis, structure, and reactivity of organoscandium compounds, particularly permethylscandocene derivatives, and their involvement in C-H bond activation reactions. It does not provide comparative data or details on the specific processes of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking in the context of the requested catalysts.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

提供的文献没有包含关于硅胶支撑的锆氢化物或氧化铝支撑的钍氢化物的信息，也没有讨论它们的制备、结构、催化性质，或在H/D交换和烷基化反应中的机制。文献主要关注有机钪化合物，特别是全甲基钪化合物衍生物的合成、结构和反应性，以及它们在C-H键活化反应中的参与。它没有提供关于请求的催化剂的具体过程的比较数据或详细信息，如σ-键交换、氢解或链行走。

The provided literature does not contain information on silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides, nor does it discuss their preparation, structure, or catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The document focuses on the synthesis and reactivity of organoscandium compounds, particularly Cp*,Sc-R derivatives, and their involvement in σ-bond metathesis reactions with hydrocarbons and Sc-R (R = H, alkyl, aryl) bonds of permethylscandocene derivatives. It does not provide comparisons or contrasts between the specified catalysts or detail mechanisms of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis for silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides.
