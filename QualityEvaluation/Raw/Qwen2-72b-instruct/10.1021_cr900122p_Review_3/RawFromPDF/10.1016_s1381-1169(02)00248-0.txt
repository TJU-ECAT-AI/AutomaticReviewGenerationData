Abstract
When silica is employed as a bidentate ligand to bis(alkyl) complexes of the early ﬁrst-row transition metals, rare terminal
alkylidene fragments are readily formed and stabilized. These materials have the empirical formula (≡
≡SiO)2M=CHEMe3,
where M is Ti, V, or Cr and E is C or Si, incorporating two covalent interactions with oxygens of the silica surface which serve
to immobilize the grafted complexes. The silica-supported alkylidene complexes undergo several typical reactions, including
electrophilic cleavage with H+ and Br2, metathetical exchange with acetone and styrene, and addition of a silane. Reaction
with ethylene leads to oligomerization/polymerization, for which the material with M = Cr is particularly effective. The
mechanism of initiation of polymerization, as well as the inﬂuence of the silica support (fumed versus precipitated) on the
composition of the active sites, is discussed.

1. Introduction
Many examples of alkylidene ligands bound to
high-valent complexes of Mo, W, Ta and Nb are extant
in the literature, and a large number have been char-
acterized by X-ray diffraction as well as spectroscopy
[1,2]. Alkylidene complexes of other transition met-
als, while not isolated, are believed to be formed in
situ during activation of inorganic catalyst precursors
with alkylating agents. The utility of well-deﬁned
complexes has been extensively demonstrated in the
polymerization of alkynes [3], metathesis polymer-
ization of alkenes [4], and oleﬁnation of ketones [3].

The demonstration of the alkylidene ligand as an
active site for oleﬁn activation has led to wide accep-
tance of the Chauvin mechanism for oleﬁn metathesis
[5]. There are also intriguing possibilities for the
participation of alkylidene ligands in Ziegler–Natta
polymerization [6], although evidence for such sys-
tems is scarce [7]. The formation of alkylidene lig-
ands on heterogeneous catalysts used for metathesis
(oxide-supported Mo, W or Re) [8,9] and polymeriza-
tion (oxide-supported Cr) [10,11] has been suggested,
although in most cases such ligands are difﬁcult to
detect since the fraction of active sites is very low,
typically ≤1% [12].
One versatile route to molecular alkylidene com-
plexes is thermally-induced -H abstraction from a
bis(alkyl) complex [2,13–15]. During our investiga-
tion of bis(alkyl) complexes of Ti(IV), V(IV) and

Cr(IV) supported by silica as a ligand, we discov-
ered such a family of -H abstraction reactions. They
give rise to stable terminal alkylidene complexes, rare
in the ﬁrst-row transition series, which undergo re-
actions characteristic of high-valent molecular alkyli-
dene complexes of their heavier congeners, as well
as some which are less well-documented in solution
but which are potentially relevant to mechanisms in
heterogeneous catalysis, such as initiation of oleﬁn
oligomerization and polymerization.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Preparation and characterization of
silica-supported bis(alkyl) metal complexes
The homoleptic metal alkyls MR4 (where M is Ti
or Cr and R is CH2CMe3; M is V or Cr and R is
CH2SiMe3) react at room temperature with the hy-
droxyl groups present on the surface of a non-porous
Aerosil silica partially dehydroxylated at 200 ◦C.
The resulting material contains alkylmetal fragments
grafted onto the silica surface, as shown by their in situ
IR spectrum, seen for M = Cr and R = CH2CMe3
in Fig. 1A and B (curve a). The appearance of vibra-
tions characteristic of the hydrocarbon modes of the
organic ligands is accompanied by the disappearance
of the band at 3747 cm−1 assigned to the ν(O–H) vi-
bration of mutually non-interacting surface hydroxyl
groups, designated ≡
≡SiOH. At the same time, RH is
liberated into the gas phase, where it was conﬁrmed
to be the sole volatile product of the reaction. The
surface-modiﬁed silicas acquire colors characteristic
of their grafted organometallic fragments, viz. yellow,
green and orange for M = Ti, V and Cr, respectively.
When the experiment is performed as a gas–solid
reaction in which the organometallic complex is sub-
limed in vacuo onto a silica powder or self-supporting
disk, the reaction occurs with a well-deﬁned and re-
producible stoichiometry (Table 1). The amount of
protonated ligand RH liberated into the gas phase
represents two equivalents for each metal complex
grafted onto the silica surface, Eq. (1):
2(≡
≡SiOH) + MR4 →(≡
≡SiO)2MR2 + 2RH
(1)
This 2:1 grafting stoichiometry was previously re-
ported by several groups for the reactions of MR4

200 ◦C [16–19], and contrasts with the 1:1 stoichiom-
etry reported for reactions on such silicas treated at
400 ◦C or above [17,20–24]. On this basis, Ballard
speculated that the majority of hydroxyl groups on
the 200 ◦C silica surface do not occur randomly, but
rather are distributed in pairs [17]. He also observed
that the paired structure is lost once the silica is heated
to 450 ◦C, upon which the grafting stoichiometry
changes to give supported complexes with the formula
≡
≡SiOMR3. Others have argued that the observation
of an overall 2:1 stoichiometry implies only an average

composition (≡
≡SiO)2MR2, with important contribu-
tions from ≡
≡SiOMR3 and (≡
≡SiO)3MR [23,25].
We observed the grafting stoichiometry shown in
Eq. (1) regardless of metal loading on Aerosil-200
silica, up to a maximum of ca. 2 wt.% M. The sur-
face reaction is self-limiting, i.e. metal loadings above
2 wt.% (ca. 0.4 mmol g−1) were not achieved, and ex-
periments in which more MR4 was added resulted in
later desorption of unreacted MR4 from the silica sur-
face to a liquid N2 cold trap. These results imply that
grafting occurs exclusively on surface hydroxyl sites,
since the number of accessible hydroxyl sites on this
silica (0.86 mmol g−1) is close to 2 M.
Silica-supported complexes derived from VR4 and
CrR4 are paramagnetic and give no observable 13C
CP/MAS spectra. However, it was possible to de-
rive magnetic moments for the surface organometa-
llic fragments from variable temperature magnetic
susceptibility measurements on the metal-modiﬁed
silicas. Both (≡
≡SiO)2V(CH2SiMe3)2 and (≡
≡SiO)2Cr
(CH2CMe3)2 showed Curie–Weiss behavior down
to 4 K. The values derived for µeff are 1.57 and
2.68 B.M., respectively, consistent with magnetically
isolated d1 and d2 sites. The 13C CP/MAS spectrum
for diamagnetic (≡
≡SiO)2Ti(CH2CMe3)2 shows the
methylene, quaternary and methyl carbons at 112, 35
and 32 ppm (Fig. 2). The spectrum is similar to those
reported for ≡
≡SiOM(CH2CMe3)3 (M = Ti [24], Zr
[20], Hf [21]), although in those cases the methylene
carbon was not detected. The 29Si CP/MAS spectrum
of (≡
≡SiO)2Ti(CH2CMe3)2 shows no peak due to
≡
≡SiNp, conﬁrming the absence of neopentyl transfer
to silicon atoms of the surface during grafting.
2.2. Formation of silica-supported alkylidene
complexes
Each of the silica-supported bis(alkyl) metal com-
plexes is stable at room temperature provided it is
scrupulously protected from air. However, each un-
dergoes a thermal transformation in vacuo resulting in
the evolution of a further equivalent of RH (Table 1).
These reactions occur with a precise stoichiometry,
regardless of the loading of the metal complex on sil-
ica, and argue strongly for compositional uniformity
of the supported organometallic fragments. Since,
at full loading, virtually no accessible hydroxyls re-
main, and since the presence of strong metal–oxygen
bonds to the surface effectively prohibits mobility of

the supported organometallic fragments, the thermal
transformation is inferred to be intramolecular. Fur-
thermore, we assert that it consists of -H abstraction
to generate essentially quantitatively the correspond-
ing silica-supported alkylidene complexes (Eq. (2)):
(≡
≡SiO)2M(CH2EMe3)2
→(≡
≡SiO)2M=CHEMe3 + EMe4
(E = C, Si)
(2)
Such reactions are analogous to the formation of
transient neopentylidene complexes deduced from
isotope labeling studies [26] and predicted by calcu-
lation [27] for thermolysis of Ti(CH2CMe3)4. Other
mechanisms of decomposition of the molecular com-
plex, such as -H abstraction and Ti-C homolysis, are
calculated to have higher barriers [28] and have been
ruled out experimentally [26]. In contrast, thermolysis
of Cr(CH2CMe3)4 has been suggested to proceed via
-H abstraction to give a transient chromacyclobutane
intermediate [29]. Additional evidence implicating re-
action at the -H was therefore sought for M = Cr. An
isotope-labeling experiment in which the -H atoms
of (≡
≡SiO)2Cr(CH2CMe3)2 were replaced by D, via
grafting of Cr(CD2CMe3)4, and subsequent ther-
molysis, produced neopentane identiﬁed by GC/MS
as predominantly C(CH3)3(CD3) (Eq. (3)) [30].
Protonolysis of the presumed (≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CDCMe3
product with water vapor yielded the expected
C(CH3)3(CDH2) (Eq. (4)):
(≡
≡SiO)2Cr(CD2CMe3)2
→(≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CDCMe3 + C(CH3)3(CD3)
(3)
(≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CDCMe3 + xsH2O
→C(CH3)3(CDH2)
(4)
Similarly, reaction of (≡
≡SiO)2Cr(CH2CMe3)2 with
DCl gave mostly C(CH3)3(CH2D), while treatment of
(≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 gave mostly C(CH3)3(CD2H)
(Eq. (5)):
(≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 + xsDCl
→C(CH3)3(CHD2)
(5)
As well, electrophilic cleavage of the neopentylidene
ligand with Br2 yielded C(CH3)3(CBr2H) (Eq. (6)):
(≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 + xsBr2
→C(CH3)3(CHBr2)

tegrated rate equation.
The -H abstraction reactions of (≡
≡SiO)2M(CH2
EMe3)2 occur at characteristic temperatures, de-
pending on the identities of M and E. Each of the
reactions exhibits ﬁrst-order kinetic behavior, shown
for M = Ti in Fig. 3, as expected for an intramolec-
ular transformation. Rate constants were measured
by following the evolution of hydrocarbon RH in
the gas phase by in situ IR spectroscopy. The values
obtained for -H abstraction/elimination at ca. 70 ◦C
are k = 1.93 × 10−4, 1.10 × 10−4, 0.90 × 10−4
and ca. 0.2 × 10−4 s−1 for (≡
≡SiO)2V(CH2SiMe3)2,
(≡
≡SiO)2Ti(CH2CMe3)2,
(≡
≡SiO)2Cr(CH2CMe3)2
and (≡
≡SiO)2Cr(CH2SiMe3)2, respectively. The rate
constant for thermolysis of (≡
≡SiO)2Cr(CD2CMe3)2
at this temperature is 0.28 × 10−4 s−1, yielding a
kinetic isotope effect kH/kD = 3.2. This effect is
temperature-dependent [31], implying a multi-step
mechanism for the transformation where M = Cr.
Similar reactions were not observed for the com-
plexes
≡
≡SiOM(CH2EMe3)3,
which
show
much
greater thermal stability than their bis(alkyl) ana-
logues. We speculate that greater metal electrophilic-
ity in the bis(siloxide)-substituted complexes may
facilitate -H abstraction, however, steric effects

cannot be ruled out. Also, coordination of an adjacent
siloxane ligand ≡
≡Si2O to (≡
≡SiO)2M(CH2EMe3)2
may enhance the rate of formation of the alkylidene
complex.
IR spectra of the silica-supported metal alkylidenes
are not diagnostic since no especially low frequency
vibration was detected for the C–H stretching mode
[32] (suggesting that the supported complexes are
not so electron-deﬁcient as their empirical formula
(≡
≡SiO)2M=CHEMe3 implies, vide infra). However,
in each case, the integrated absorbance of the C–H
vibrations decreased by 50%, consistent with the
loss of one alkyl ligand. No ν(M=C) vibration was
identiﬁed due to the high absorbance of the silica
support below 1300 cm−1. The magnetic moments
of (≡
≡SiO)2V=CHSiMe3 and (≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3
were measured to be 1.63 and 2.77 B.M., respec-
tively, conﬁrming that the oxidation states and
mononuclearity of the supported metal alkylidenes
remain unchanged from that of their precursors
(≡
≡SiO)2M(CH2EMe3)2.
The natural abundance 13C CP/MAS NMR spec-
trum of (≡
≡SiO)2Ti=CHCMe3 does not display any
new low ﬁeld signal attributable to the alkylidene
carbon. This ﬁnding is similar to a previous report
for a silica-supported Ta neopentylidene complex
[33], and is presumably due to its low abundance,
low cross-polarization efﬁciency and rigidity of the
alkylidene carbon.
2.3. Reactions of silica-supported alkylidene
complexes
Isolable high-valent alkylidene complexes of the
early ﬁrst-row transition metals are relatively rare
[1,34–38]. Their reactivity has thus been much less
investigated compared to heavier congeners. How-
ever, there are many “characteristic” reactions of
metal alkylidenes of the second and third-row metals,
which are considered diagnostic of M=C functional-
ity [32]. The degree of resemblance between these
molecular complexes and silica-supported alkyli-
dene complexes was therefore explored through
reactivity.
Reactions of silica-supported alkylidene complexes
with electrophiles such as H+ and Br2 are described
earlier. The pseudo-Wittig reaction of (≡
≡SiO)2
Cr=CHCMe3 with acetone yields 2,5,5-trimethyl-
pent-1-ene [39] (Eq. (7)):
(≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 + xsMe2C=O
→Me2C=CHCMe3
(7)
Oleﬁn metathesis products neohexene and trimethyl-
vinylsilane were detected upon reaction of (≡
≡SiO)2
M=CHEMe3 (M = V, Cr) with styrene (Eq. (8)):
(≡
≡SiO)2M=CHEMe3 + xsPhCH=CH2
→H2C=CHEMe3
(E = C, Si)
(8)
The initial surface organometallic product is presum-
ably the benzylidene complex (≡
≡SiO)2M=CHPh,
which was not isolated since it appears to undergo
subsequent reaction with styrene.
In contrast, reaction of (≡
≡SiO)2M=CHEMe3 with
excess ethylene yielded no oleﬁn metathesis prod-
ucts, consistent with the observations made for reac-
tions of Ta(V) and Cr(VI) neopentylidene complexes
[35,40]. Ethylene uptake was instead characterized
by oligomerization/polymerization. The nature of the
reaction was strongly metal-dependent: for M = Cr,
polymerization was rapid and extensive, whereas
ethylene uptake self-terminated after addition of ca.
40 eq. C2H4 for M = V and Ti (Fig. 4). Traces of lin-
ear -oleﬁns (1-hexene, 1-octene, etc.) were also de-
tected. When (≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 was dosed with
a very small amount (ca. 1 equivalent) of ethylene,
the volatiles detected were primarily the C7 oleﬁns
4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene, 4,4-dimethylpent-1-ene and
2,3,3-trimethylbutene. The origin of these products is
likely the coupling of a neopentylidene ligand with
ethylene. In support of this hypothesis, reaction of
(≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 with a small amount of C2D4
generated (CD3)CD=CHC(CH3)3, identiﬁed by its
MS fragmentation pattern.
Surface organometallic complexes with the general
formula (≡
≡SiO)2MR2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) have been re-
ported to react with H2 to give supported metal hydride
complexes which hydrogenate [19,41] and polymerize
[16,42,43] oleﬁns. The formation of spectroscopically
detectable hydrido complexes generally results in a
dramatic increase in polymerization activity [44,45],
however, hydrogenation of the silica-supported com-
plexes requires elevated temperatures (100–200 ◦C)
and results, in particular for M = Ti, in a number of
different supported hydride complexes as well as par-
tial reduction of the metal. Therefore, the possibility

of forming hydrido complexes of the silica-supported
ﬁrst-row metals under milder conditions, i.e. directly
from the supported alkylidenes, was explored.
Exposure of (≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHEMe3 to 100 Torr H2
at room temperature resulted in no discernable reac-
tion, as judged by a lack of change in the IR spec-
trum, even after several days. Upon heating, the onset
of hydrogenation was noted at ca. 150 ◦C, accompa-
nied by formation of volatile hydrocarbons such as
methane, ethane and propane in addition to neopen-
tane (E = C) and SiMe4 (E = Si). The intermediacy
of surface Cr–H species is inferred, however, the quan-
tities formed were too small to permit spectroscopic
detection.
An alternate low temperature route to metal hy-
drides from alkylidenes is the addition of a silane
across M=C, reported recently for M = Ta [46,47]. Al-
though (≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 gave no reaction when
treated with Me3SiH, even after several days at room
temperature, a reaction occurred readily with 70 Torr
Et2SiH2 vapor. In the IR spectrum, the integrated in-
tensity of the vibrations in the ν(C–H) region increased
to approximately double its initial value, while two
new hydride vibrations were detected at 2137 and
2078 cm−1 (Fig. 5). The frequency of the higher en-
ergy mode closely resembles the spectrum of Et2SiH2,
which consists of two closely-spaced bands at 2140
and 2133 cm−1. The lower energy mode is inferred to
belong to ν(Cr–H). The reaction with Et2SiH2 is for-
mulated as addition of the silane across the Cr=C bond
(Eq. (9)):
(≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 + xsEt2SiH2
→(≡
≡SiO)2(H)CrC(H)(SiHEt2)(CMe3)
(9)
The presence of a surface Cr hydride was further
conﬁrmed by exposure of the sample to CH3I, upon
which methane was detected in the gas phase above

the sample by its characteristic IR spectrum. Fur-
thermore, exposure of the Et2SiH2-treated sample to
D2 resulted in a very slow loss of ν(Cr–H) intensity
and the appearance of a weak band at 1557 cm−1,
consistent with the conversion of Cr–H to Cr–D. The
hydride complex is also an active catalyst for ethylene
polymerization; details will be reported later.
The silica-supported alkylidene complexes de-
scribed here are not electrophilic enough to activate
the C–H bonds of arenes, as has been reported for
transient [(2,6-iPr2–C6H3)N)2Cr=CHCMe3] [35] or
alkanes, similar to Cp*W(NO)(CHCMe3) [48]. Al-
though the formula (≡
≡SiO)2M=CHEMe3 as written
suggests a high degree of coordinative unsaturation,
this is almost certainly mitigated by the abundance
of surface oxygens within coordination distance of M
(vide infra).
2.4. Effect of silica support
The Aerosil silica used in all of the experiments
described above is a highly pure, non-porous com-
bustion aerosol with irregularly shaped primary par-
ticles of average diameter 12 nm. It is further known
from small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering mea-
surements that the surfaces of such fumed silica parti-
cles are smooth (surface fractal dimension Ds = 2.0)
down to the molecular length-scale [49]. The extent of
hydroxylation of the surface exerts a strong effect on
subsequent reaction chemistry with MR4, yielding ei-
ther (≡
≡SiO)2MR2 or ≡
≡SiOMR3, as described earlier.
Despite the empirical evidence for formulation of
the alkylidene complexes as (≡
≡SiO)2M=CHEMe3,
the coordination number of the metal in these or the
bis(alkyl) complexes which precede them has not yet
been established. Indeed, we believe it is highly un-
likely that three-coordinate complexes persist in the
presence of many possible oxygen donor atoms dis-
posed in proximity around the silica-supported alkyli-
dene complexes. Association with the oxygen of a
nearby siloxane bridge to form a pseudo-tetrahedral
surface complex is a likely possibility (Eq. (10)):
(≡
≡SiO)2M=CHEMe3 + ≡
≡SiOSi≡
≡
→(≡
≡SiO)2(≡
≡Si2O)M=CHEMe3
(10)
Since the strength of the metal–siloxane interaction
may inﬂuence reactivity of the silica-supported alkyli-
denes, and the nature of the silica is known to be
particularly important in determining the activity of
supported polymerization catalysts [42,50], evidence
for siloxane participation in the coordination sphere
was sought by varying the nature of the silica.
Grafting of Cr(CH2EMe3)4 on a porous silica gel,
Sylopol-952, was accomplished in the same fashion
as the reaction on Aerosil. After thermal treatment in
vacuo at 200 ◦C, the accessible hydroxyl content of
this silica, 1.25 mmol g−1, is signiﬁcantly higher than
that of Aerosil-200. Regardless of loading, the reac-
tion of Cr(CH2EMe3)4 with the surface OH groups
of Sylopol-952 occurs with the same stoichiometry
as on Aerosil-200. For E = C, the reaction results
in the liberation of (2.0 ± 0.3) CMe4 per grafted
Cr (average of four experiments). Thus, the sur-
face complexes on Sylopol silica are formulated as
(≡
≡SiO)2Cr(CH2EMe3)2. The IR spectra of the sup-
ported organochromium fragments is very similar on
porous and non-porous silicas (Fig. 1) with the ex-
ception that a much larger fraction of the hydroxyls
which appear in the IR spectrum of the Cr-modiﬁed
Sylopol silica are inaccessible to organochromium
reagents.
166
M.C. Beaudoin et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 190 (2002) 159–169
Thermolysis of (≡
≡SiO)2Cr(CH2CMe3)2 supported
on Sylopol-952 at 70 ◦C resulted in the evolution of
1.1 ± 0.2 eq. CMe4 as the exclusive volatile prod-
uct. The rate constant, k = 0.98 × 10−4 s−1, is sim-
ilar to that measured for the material prepared with
Aerosil-200 (k = 0.90×10−4 s−1). Therefore, we sug-
gest that a neopentylidene complex of Cr(IV) is again
formed, and that the nature of the silica support does
not appear to substantially inﬂuence either grafting or
-H abstraction. Nevertheless, evidence for an effect
of the silica “ligand” on the subsequent reactivity of
supported alkylidene complexes was found in their re-
actions with ethylene (vide infra).

(40–400 Torr) of C2H4 over (≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3
on Aerosil-200 has been investigated and the kinetics
reported in some detail [51]. The gas–solid reaction
displays no observable induction period at room tem-
perature, no deactivation occurs during the course
of polymerization and there is no evidence for mass
transport effects. Mechanistic investigation of the
reaction, including measurement of the activation pa-
rameters and the absence of a primary kinetic isotope
effect, rules out alkylidene complexes as propagating
intermediates (which appeared in earlier proposals for
polymerization mechanisms over Phillips catalysts
[10,11]), and agrees with the ﬁndings of computational
investigations [52,53]. Furthermore, the formation of
neopentylidene-containing oleﬁns during polymeriza-
tion suggests that the alkylidene ligand is eliminated
from the supported catalyst upon exposure to ethy-
lene during a fast initiation reaction. High-valent Cr
alkylidenes have been predicted to undergo reductive
elimination upon reaction with oleﬁns, in contrast to
Mo and W analogues which favor metathesis [54].
Although the mechanism of polymerization has
been studied extensively for cationic, d0 complexes
of group IV, many other electron conﬁgurations are
known to be consistent with appreciable activity. The
d2 conﬁguration (i.e. Cr(IV)) in our homologous se-
ries of silica-supported complexes is by far the most
active. The involvement of a cationic silica-supported
Cr(IV) complex was suggested in a computational
study [52], but its formation is considered unlikely,
since protonation of the alkylidene ligand by a surface
silanol would also undoubtedly be accompanied by
the formation of a covalent metal–siloxide interaction
[53].
The precise nature of the initiation is still unclear.
However, it seems reasonable to postulate an inter-
action between ethylene and (≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3
to generate the chromacyclobutane analogous to that
required by its metathetical reaction with styrene
(Eq. (8)). Calculations on a model Cr ethylidene
system predict a highly exothermic (2 + 2) addition
of ethylene with almost no barrier [52]. Although
neohexene, the oleﬁn metathesis product, was not
detected, formation of 2,3,3-trimethylbutene suggests
that de-insertion of neohexene can occur, followed
by rotation of the coordinated oleﬁn. However, it
must rapidly re-add to (≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CH2 to generate
the chromacyclobutane with the tert-butyl substituent
in the -position (Scheme 1). This mechanism of
isomerization, albeit for the transformation of the
-substituted metallacyclobutane to the -substituted
isomer, has been demonstrated for a titanocene com-
plex [55].
Extrusion
of
4,4-dimethylpentenes
from
an
-t-butyltitanacyclobutane has been observed [38,40],
with a suggested mechanism of -H elimination to
the allyl hydride complex, followed by reductive
elimination [32,38]. On our catalyst, the immediate
organometallic product may be the reduced ethylene
complex, or the chromacyclopentane, via the cycliza-
tion of two coordinated C2H4 at the reduced Cr site.
Both ﬁnd precedent in experimental studies of tantala-
cyclobutane decomposition in the presence of oleﬁns
[38,40], observations of ethene trimerization by ho-
mogeneous Cr [56,57] and Ta [58] catalysts, and the-
oretical calculations on Cr(IV) model complexes [53].
Spontaneous extrusion of C7 oleﬁns is thus inferred
to precede the formation of polyethylene on the ac-
tive sites. This observation allows us to estimate the
number of such sites in two ways. First, the ν(C–H)
intensity in the in situ IR spectrum decreases to ap-
proximately two-thirds of its initial value upon expo-
sure of (≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 to C2D4, implying that
one-third of the neopentylidene ligands were elimi-
nated. Second, treatment of the polymer-enshrouded
catalyst with HCl after polymerization resulted in the
liberation of 0.67 eq. of neopentane per Cr, suggest-
ing that two-thirds of the neopentylidene sites did not
react with ethylene. In agreement with these ﬁndings,

selective poisoning of the active sites with substoichio-
metric amounts of O2 resulted in complete inhibition
of polymerization activity for ca. 60 Torr C2H4 when
the amount of O2 added corresponded to 20% of total
Cr [59].
The inability of a substantial fraction of neopentyli-
dene sites to add ethylene, despite the presumed facil-
ity of this reaction, suggests that initiation is inhibited
by another, stronger interaction, such as the coordi-
nation of an adjacent siloxane oxygen as in Eq. (10).
Since the strength of the interaction is presumably
dependent on geometric considerations, which might
be expected to vary for different sites on the silica
surface, it is reasonable to assume that ethylene can
displace the siloxane ligand in some but not all of the
supported complexes (Eq. (11)):
(≡
≡SiO)2(≡
≡Si2O)Cr=CHCMe3 + C2H4
⇆(≡
≡SiO)2(C2H4)Cr=CHCMe3 + ≡
≡SiOSi≡
≡
(11)
According to this explanation, higher pressures of
C2H4 should be able to activate more neopentyli-
dene sites, due to displacement of the equilibrium
shown in Eq. (11) to the right. In agreement with
this hypothesis, the threshold for inhibition of poly-
merization activity by O2 increased from 20 to
30% poisoning of the Cr sites when the C2H4
pressure was raised from 60 to 250 Torr. The dis-
tribution of binding constants for C2H4 may also
contribute to the broad polydispersities (typically
15 < Mw/Mn < 20) of the polyethylene produced
over both “single-site” (≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 [59]
and heterogeneous Cr/SiO2 catalysts in general.
The reaction of (≡
≡SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3, supported
on Sylopol-952, with 40 Torr C2H4 is not spontaneous
at room temperature. This ﬁnding was surprising in
view of the very similar stoichiometry of the grafting
reaction and IR spectrum compared to the Aerosil-200
reaction. Upon further investigation, we discovered
that polymerization does occur in the presence of 1 atm
C2H4. We propose that spectroscopically undetected
(thus far) siloxane coordination results in a stronger
interaction with the potential active sites on the surface
of Sylopol-952 than on Aerosil-200 surface, thereby
inhibiting polymerization at lower pressures. This phe-
nomenon is suggested to be a consequence of the sur-
face roughness of the silica gel (with a surface fractal
dimension close to 3.0 [60]), resulting in greater prox-
imity of adjacent siloxanes to the grafted Cr sites.

3. Experimental
AerosilTM-200 (BET surface area 183 m2 g−1) is
an amorphous, non-porous fumed silica manufac-
tured by Degussa Corp. Sylopol-952 (BET surface
area 309 m2 g−1) is a precipitated silica gel from
Grace–Davison. The content of accessible hydroxyls
on each silica, after partial dehydroxylation, was mea-
sured by VOCl3 chemisorption [61]. Ti(CH2CMe3)4,
V(CH2SiMe3)4, Cr(CH2CMe3)4 and Cr(CH2SiMe3)4
were prepared by literature procedures and puriﬁed
by sublimation [62–65]. Vacuum techniques for the
preparation and characterization of bis(alkyl) and
alkylidene complexes grafted onto silica surfaces,
including selective deuterium isotope labeling, have
previously been described in detail [22,31]. Since
the supported organometallic complexes are highly
air-sensitive, all manipulations were performed fol-
lowing strict high vacuum protocols, using breakseal
techniques.
High purity C2H4 (Matheson), H2 (Air Products)
and C2D4 (98% D, Cambridge Isotopes) were further
puriﬁed by passing each one through a trap containing
a mixture of BTS Deoxo Catalyst (Caledon Labora-
tories Ltd.) and 3 Å molecular sieves (Aldrich), then
stored in glass high vacuum bulbs. The desired gas
was transferred into the in situ reactor containing the
catalyst through a high vacuum line (base pressure
<10−4 Torr) equipped with a capacitance manometer
reading absolute pressures. Liquid reagents were pur-
chased from Aldrich, dried over molecular sieves and
stored under vacuum in glass vessels equipped with
high vacuum Teﬂon stopcocks. Vapor phase trans-
fer into the reactors was achieved via the vacuum
manifold.
All IR experiments were performed in situ, in
reactors with IR-transparent KCl windows. In exper-
iments with a single gaseous product, quantitation
of the volatile organic component was also achieved
by IR, using the gas phase spectra of known pres-
sures of pure compounds to construct calibration
curves. For NMR experiments, the Ti-modiﬁed silica
was prepared in powdered form in a Schlenk tube
equipped with a high vacuum stopcock and 5 mm o.d.
Pyrex NMR tubes welded onto the main body of the
Schlenk tube at right angles. Samples were transferred
in vacuo into the NMR tubes and sealed at 30 mm
lengths with a torch, to give tubes containing approxi-
mately 50 mg of sample. The 13C and 29Si CP/MAS
(cross polarization/magic angle spinning) NMR spec-
tra were recorded on a Bruker ASX-200 spectrometer
at frequencies of 50.32 and 39.75 MHz, respectively.
13C spectra were collected at a spin rate of 4 kHz
using a 4.4 ms 90◦proton pulse with a contact time
of 2 ms and relaxation delay of 2 s and treated with
20 Hz line broadening. For 29Si spectra, the contact
time was 10 ms and the relaxation delay 1 s.
Mixtures of volatile organic products were analyzed
by GC and/or GC/MS. Metal analyses were performed
by colorimetry after quantitative extraction from
the modiﬁed silicas, following previously described
procedures [66].
