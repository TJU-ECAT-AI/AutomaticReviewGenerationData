Early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido or alkyl com-
plexes readily react with alkanes and/or hydrogen at relatively
low temperatures to participate in exchange reactions,[1] which
usually proceed via -bond metathesis since the metal com-
plexes are in their highest oxidation state and cannot, in
principle, undergo oxidative addition.[2]
yields of free-base porphyrins to be less than 1% of those of the
porphyrin complexes. The phosphorescence emission of the
complex at 300 K and of ligand at 77 K or 300 K did not appear.
The results of SPS and fluorescence studies show that the higher
the fluorescence intensity, the lower the surface photovoltage.
In conclusion, we have prepared the first series of lanthan-
ide(III) benzoporphyrin liquid crystals and demonstrated the
application of cyclic voltammetry, surface photovoltage spectro-
scopy, and luminescence measurements in the analysis of
hexagonal liquid crystals.
Experimental Section
Tetraalkyltetrabenzoporphyrin zinc (TATBPZn, alkyl  A C14H29): A
mixture of phthalimide (300 mg, 2.0 mmol) and zinc(II) hexadeca-
noate (700 mg, 1.2 mmol) was heated in a Mafu Stove at 350C for
25 min. The crude product was purified by column chromatography
(silica gel, CHCl3). TATBPZn was obtained as green solid (429.4 mg,
0.3 mmol, 62% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) 7.43 ±7.48 (m, 16H;
isoindole), 0.87 ± 0.90 (t, 12H; CH3), 1.26 (s, 96H; CH2), 1.60 (s, 8H;

conductance (DMF, 25C): 5.4 1cm2mol1 (nonelectrolyte).[12]
14L: TATBPZn (1.0 103 mg, 0.7 mmol) was dissolved in chloroform
(150 mL), then trifluoroacetic acid (0.13 mL, 1.6 mmol) was added at
room temperature. After stirring for 10 min, the reaction mixture was
neutralized with an aqueous ammonia solution, and then washed
with water. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was purified
by column chromatography (silica gel, CHCl3). 14L was obtained as a
green solid (838.9 mg, 0.6 mmol, 88% yield).

14YbOH: A mixture of 14L (300 mg, 0.23 mmol) and YbCl3 (129.6 mg,
0.5 mmol) in imidazole (1.0 104 mg) was heated at 172C under N2
for 10 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to 70C, and ethanol
(10 mL) and then chloroform (20 ml) were added. After the mixture
was washed with water, 0.1% AgNO3 was added until no further AgCl
precipitated. The mixture was purified by column chromatography
(neutral alumina, ethanol). 14YbOH was obtained as a green solid

Conversely,
the
silica-supported
zirconium
hydride
1,
[(SiO)3ZrH],[3] a d0 complex, also catalyses the H/D exchange
reaction and, recently, careful kinetic studies have allowed
activation energies to be obtained.[4] The H/D exchange reaction
of alkanes on 1 can take place via three pathways, which ought
to include a CH bond activation step (Scheme 1):[1] process 1)
successive direct and reversible interactions of the CH bond of
Scheme 1. Pathways for exchange reactions on 1 (Zr(SiO)3Zr).
the alkane with 1, Equation (1), which itself undergoes a fast H/D
exchange with hydrogen [H2 or D2, Equation (2)]; proces-
s 2) cleavage and formation of the CH bond via successive
CH bond activation, Equation (3), and hydrogenolysis reactions
[the reverse reaction, Equation (3)]; and process 3) exchange
reactions between the Mmethyl and methane, Equation (4) in
combination with the hydrogenolysis step, Equation (3).
All these reactions are thought to be possible on 1, and kinetic
barriers will favour one (or more) of these pathways. Therefore,
probing transition states for the various pathways can allow the
evaluation of their activation energies, and thereby the most
probable reaction pathway(s).
Chemical reactivity and spectroscopic studies including
extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) agree with
the presence of an average of three oxygen atoms around the
zirconium centre at a distance of 1.95 ä. In order to simplify the
system for calculation, we used a cluster of three silicon atoms
surrounded by oxygen atoms to represent the silica surface, in
which three of the oxygen atoms were bound to a zirconium
centre as shown in Figure 1a. The geometries were optimised
through density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the
ADF1999 code,[5] using a double zeta STO basis set and
polarization functions (basis IV, according to ADF classification),
and the PW91[6] gradient corrected (GGA) functional.[7] For the
model system 1m, [(SiO)3ZrH], the low energy geometry has
the hydrogen ligand bonded normally to the surface, with (ZrH)
and (ZrO) bond distances of 1.908 and 1.99 ä, respectively; the
Figure 1. Optimised geometries of a) 1m [(SiO)3ZrH] and b) 2m
[(SiO)3ZrCH3].
latter being in agreement with those found experimentally by
EXAFS.[3d] For [(SiO)3ZrMe], 2m (see Figure 1b), the calculated
ZrC bond length is 2.284 ä; both this value and that of the ZrH
bond are in agreement with the literature data of some similar
molecular complexes.[8] Noteworthy is the calculated vibrational
frequency for the ZrH bond, 1630 cm1, which is very close to
the
experimental
value
observed
in
IR
spectroscopy
(1638 cm1).[3] All these data give confidence in this simplified
model for the silica-supported zirconium hydride, which can be
used further for modelling the reactions.
Most of the reactions considered [Equations (1), (2) and (4)]
are isoenergetic, whereas the CH activation [Equation (3)] was
calculated to be slightly endothermic (Table 1), as expected for
early transition metals,[9] by 27 kJmol1 (Helec) or 10.5 kJmol1 if
a zero point energy (ZPE) correction was applied; a full
correction brought it to 0 (Htot) and led to a calculated free
energy (G298) of around 5 kJmol1, mainly composed of the
entropic term (TStot).
Four different pathways have been considered [Equa-
tions (1) ± (4)], and the evaluation of the activation energy for
each of them was conducted through the optimisation of
transition-state geometries. In each case, it was possible to
locate and characterise a transition state (TS; see Figure 2) via
vibrational analysis. Noteworthy are the following observa-
tions: All transition states correspond to a metal centre
surrounded by three ligands (in addition to those of the silica
model), which are in a coplanar arrangement. In all cases, the
XH bond (X  H or CH3) of the reactant was stretched (see
Supporting Information). In all the transition state structures,
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) shows an out-
of-phase combination with a nodal point at the central atom
(Figure 3). The quasi colinearity of the three ligands is the most
stable arrangement, since it probably minimises antibonding
interactions between the two external atoms (in opposite
phases). The relative energies (Helec, Htot) of these transition
states (Table 2; Figure 2) depend, in fact, on the nature and the
position of the ligands (H versus CH3), and vary as follows:

(TS1).[10] This shows that having a hydrogen atom as the central
ligand is probably the major requirement for a low energy
transition state. This can be easily understood, since hydrogen
orbitals are of s symmetry, so that overlap with other types of
orbitals is less angular dependent. Moreover, the bond distances
for ZrX (X H or CH3) is in fact key in determining the
geometrical arrangement, hence the impossibility of a linear
transition state when carbon is in the central position.[11]
Based on the calculated enthalpies of activation, it is possible
to conclude that the mechanism for H/D exchange in a CH4/H2
mixture does not involve a direct exchange [Equation (1), TS1] or a
methyl exchange [Equation (4), TS4], but rather it involves a two-
step process, that is CH bond activation [Equation (3)] followed
by hydrogenolysis [Equation(3)]. The rate determining step,
which will determine the activation energy, is therefore the
highest energy process of the two successive processes
[Equation (3) versus Equation(3)], that is the CH bond
activation. Besides, the calculated activation enthalpies for this
step are around 92 (H
elec, 87 (H
ZPE and 86 (H
tot kJmol1
(Table 2),
which
are
higher than
the
experimental
value
(28 kJmol1),[4] but relatively close to those previously reported.[2]
Moreover, the calculated activation enthalpies for H/D ex-
change in H2/D2 mixtures [Equation (2), TS2], which are around
33.5 (H
elec, 4.5 (H
ZPE and 18 (H
tot kJmol1 (Table 2), point
to a very fast process as observed experimentally, but with a
higher
activation
enthalpy
than
the
experimental
one
(9 kJmol1, estimated).[4] On the other hand, all the calculated
activation entropies (for TS1±4, S
tot range between 129 and
174 Jmol1K1, Table 3) are very negative and in full agree-
ment with highly ordered transition-states
as well as experimental data (S
exp 
113 Jmol1K1).[3c]
How is it possible to account for the
difference between experimental and the-
oretical activation enthalpies?[12] First of all,
one might propose that the current, highly
symmetric, model (1m and 2m) is too
simple and is not a good representation
of the active species as described so far, 1,
[(SiO)3ZrH]. It can also be suggested that
another species might be responsible for
the catalytic event. Since measured Eas
correspond to those of the (more) active species, it could arise
only from a small fraction of the surface species. Silica is
amorphous, and its surface is heterogeneous; it is therefore
conceivable that the actual active species may have a geometry
(or a structure) slightly different from that described exper-
imentally (1 according to EXAFS) or theoretically (small cluster
model 1m). One possibility is the presence of a more electro-
philic species, which could be responsible for the measured Ea
and catalysis.[13]
We are currently looking at probing the exact nature of the
active site by both an investigation of the model structure
(theoretical) and by using new tools to understand if different
species are present on the surface (experimental).

[9] These calculated values are close to those calculated from bond
dissociation energies (BDE) and bond dissociation enthalpies (BDH) for
H2, CH4, (Zr-H) and (Zr-Me) for which the CH bond activation should
have an endothermic enthalpy of reaction in the 54 ± 79 kJmol1 range.

[10] For an experimental work and discussions on the relative energies of
transition states for -bond metathesis pathways, see ref. [1i].
[11] A conceptual approach on the reason for the different energies for the
various types of TS has also been discussed, see ref. [2m].
[12] Experimental activation energies (Ea) in heterogeneous catalysis are, in
fact, apparent activation energies (Eaapparent), which have not been
corrected for the enthalpy of adsorption (Hads) of the alkane/H2 mixture
onto the support. This can artificially decrease the true Eas of the actual
elementary step since Eaapparent  Ea Hads. Hads  14 kJmol1 in the
case of methane (A. R. Parriego, J. M. Guil, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1976, 57,
166), which cannot account for the difference in activation enthalpies
(H
tot  H
exp  58 kJmol1).
[13] For example, using [Cl2ZrH] as a simple ™extreme∫model, which is a fully
cationic system, shows that there is in that case no activation barrier for
H2/D2 exchange via [Cl2ZrH3
] as a transition state. This confirms the
presence of a more electrophilic system on the surface. It is also possible
to propose a zirconium dihydride species, see ref. [2l] and references
cited therein.
