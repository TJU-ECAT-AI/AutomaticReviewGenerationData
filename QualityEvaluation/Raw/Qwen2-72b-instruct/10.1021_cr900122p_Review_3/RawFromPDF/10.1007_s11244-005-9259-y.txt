The model reactions of ethylene polymerization and hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes (propane, n-butane, and n-pentane) on the
silica-supported zirconium hydrides (BSiAO)3ZrIVH, (BSiAO)2ZrIVH2, and (BSiAO)2ZrIIIH were studied using the DFT
approach. Catalytic processes under study were shown to occur involving diﬀerent surface hydrides. The ethylene polymerization
was found to proceed at comparable rates on the zirconium monohydrides, (BSiAO)3ZrH, and dihydrides, (BSiAO)2ZrH2.
Cleavage of linear alkanes on the monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable; however, the dihydrides
(BSiAO)2ZrH2 can act as catalysts of the process under mild conditions. Hydrides of the trivalent zirconium, (BSiAO)2ZrIIIH, can
also contribute to the hydrogenolysis reaction. A feature of all the systems studied is low regioselectivity of the corresponding
processes.

1. Introduction
Silica-supported hydrides of the early transition
metals (Zr and Ti) are the active catalysts of the
processes involving the formation and the cleavage of
the CAH and CAC bonds under mild conditions.
Among such processes are the oleﬁn polymerization
[1–7], hydrogenation of oleﬁns [8], isotope exchange in
alkanes [9], as well as hydroisomerization and hydrog-
enolysis of alkanes [10–14]. The last two processes,
which were experimentally investigated by Basset et al.
[8,10–17], have been the focus of recent interest of
researchers in the above-mentioned catalytic systems.
Usually, the catalysts are prepared by coating the
surface of partially dehydroxylated silica with organo-
metallic compounds MR4 (M ¼ Ti, Zr; R ¼ allyl, benzyl
[1–7], neopentyl, etc. [8–10,15,16]) followed by heating
to 423 K under hydrogen. Under these conditions, the
system always contains a mixture of the surface-sup-
ported metal hydrides [7,16]. According to the IR
spectroscopic data, the major hydride species
are
M(IV) monohydrides (BSiAO)3MH [8,16] and dihy-
drides (BSiAO)2MH2 [4]. The ESR studies [2, 4–7]
revealed that some amount of the M(III) compounds (up
to 5% and 30% of the total amount of the supported Zr
and Ti, respectively) is also always present in the system.
Among those, the formation of M(III) hydrides was
hypothesized [1] and subsequently detected [5–7].
Despite a considerable body of experimental data on
these systems, it is still unclear which species are
responsible for the catalytic activity. Since the system
always contains at least two types of the surface
hydrides, each of them can be involved in the catalytic
processes mentioned above. Basset et al. [8,10–17] who
made the major contribution to the development of
experimental studies in this research area suggested that
the dominant monohydrides (BSiAO)3MH are the main
catalytic species in the reactions of both formation
(polymerization) and the cleavage (hydrogenolysis) of
the CAC bonds, which are treated as the mutually
reverse reactions [11–13].
Earlier, we have studied the reactions of isotope
exchange in methane [18] and hydrogenolysis of butane
[19] on the surface hydrides of tetravalent zirconium. It
was found that the calculated activation parameters of
the reactions involving zirconium dihydrides are in better
agreement with those reported in the experimental study
by Hall et al. [9]. In a continuation of our investigations
we have studied the mechanisms of catalytic oleﬁn
polymerization [20] and catalytic hydrogenolysis of the
CAC bonds in linear alkanes (propane, n-butane, and n-
pentane) [21] on the model compounds 1–3. In the
present work, we are considering all above-mentioned
processes in the framework of a uniﬁed research strategy.
The ‘‘cut’’ fragments of the silica structure were
replaced by ﬂuorine atoms. This procedure permits a
correct description of the structure and electronic
properties of the silica-supported compounds [22]. The
reasons are as follows. First, the electronic properties of
the ﬂuorine atoms are similar to those of the oxygen
atoms in the O–Si fragment. Second, in contrast to the

O–H fragment, the ﬂuorine atoms are incapable of
forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which distort
the structure of the model species. Third, we have also
studied a number of less constrained models and found
that the energies and thermodynamic parameters of the
reaction intermediates are only slightly dependent on the
choice of the model [18].
2. Computational details
All calculations were carried out using the original
program PRIRODA developed by Laikov [23]. The
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the
exchange-correlation functional by Perdew, Burke, and
Ernzerhof [24] was employed. The 28 core electrons of
Zr, 10 for Si and 2 for C, O, and F were described by
effective core potentials [25–27]. The orbital basis sets of
contracted Gaussian-type functions of size (5s1p)/[3s1p]
for H, (5s5p2d)/[3s3p2d] for C, O, F, and Si, and
(9s9p8d)/[5s5p4d] for Zr were used for the remaining
electrons in conjunction with the density-ﬁtting basis
sets of uncontracted Gaussian-type functions of size
(5s1p) for H, (6s3p3d1f) for C, O, F, and Si, and
(10s6p6d5f5g)
for
Zr.
The
spin-unrestricted
DFT
method was used for open-shell species.
Full geometry optimization of all the structures
studied in this work was performed using analytical
gradients and was followed by analytical calculations of
the second derivatives of energy with respect to coor-
dinates in order to characterize the nature of the
resulting stationary points (minima or saddle points)
on the potential energy surface (PES). Zero-point
vibrational energies and thermodynamic characteristics
were calculated using the ideal gas, rigid rotor, and
harmonic oscillator approximations.
In studying the PES of the systems considered we
found that there are usually several local energy minima
corresponding to structures with slightly different con-
formation of an alkyl group bound to the Zr atom. We
considered all possible conformations of each structure
studied and chose the one with the lowest energy. It is
these structures that are discussed in the text below. All
other possible conformations are, as a rule, not men-
tioned.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Surface-supported zirconium monohydrides
3.1.1. Ethylene polymerization
For the ethylene polymerization on monohydrides 1
[20], we established a mechanism, which is analogous in
general
to
the
mechanism
proposed
earlier
for
(BSiAO)3ZrH [10, 11] (scheme 1). The geometries were

optimized, and the energies were calculated for all the
structures presented in scheme 1. The energy diagram
for the transformations presented in scheme 1 is shown
in Figure 1(a).
The ﬁrst stage of the process involves insertion of an
ethylene molecule into the Zr–H bond (transformations 1
! 4 ! 5 ! 6 via transition state 5) and is thermodynam-
ically favorable. The corresponding energy barrier is low
(DE6¼ ¼ 3.0 kcal mol)1, DG298
6¼ ¼ 3.9 kcal mol)1 rela-
tive to complex 4; DE6¼ ¼ )5.2 kcal mol)1, DG298
6¼ ¼
5.7 kcal mol)1 relative to free reactants 1 + C2H4). The
polymer chain growth involves the successive insertion of
ethylene molecules into the newly formed Zr–C bond
(Scheme 1, transformations 6 ! 7 ! 8 ! 9). The reaction
pathway begins with the formation of a weak oleﬁn
complex 7 and passes through the transition state
8 with the highest energy (DE6¼ ¼ 10.7 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼14.0 kcal mol)1 relative to complex 7; DE6¼ ¼
5.3 kcal mol)1, DG298
6¼ ¼ 20.2 kcal mol)1 relative to
6 + C2H4). Therefore, the transformation 7 ! 8 ! 9 is
the rate-determining step of the overall polymerization
process.
The catalytic species 1 can be regenerated by hydrog-
enolysis of the Zr–C bond in 9 in the presence of
hydrogen. Earlier, we have reported a detailed study of
this reaction taking hydrogenolysis of the Zr–CH3 bond

in related compounds as an example [18]. The process
was shown to proceed without the formation of the
pre-reaction complex via the four-centered transition
state (transition state 10 in Scheme 1, Figure 1(b)).
This transformation requires the overcoming of an
energy
barrier
(DE6¼ ¼ 13.2 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼
24.1 kcal mol)1 relative to 9) and is energetically favor-
able. The overall sequence of transformations including
the ﬁnal stage can be described by the following reaction
equation: 2C2H4 + H2 ! C4H10. The thermodynamic
parameters of this reaction (DH0 ¼ –55.1 kcal mol)1)
calculated using the tabulated thermodynamic data [28]
are in good agreement with the results of our calcula-
tions (DH298 ¼ )57.3 kcal mol)1).
3.1.2. Hydrogenolysis of butane
In essence, the mechanism of the reaction of the
model compound 1 with butane molecule [19, 21] is
similar to the sequence of transformations, which is the
reverse of ethylene polymerization on these species
(scheme 1). The energy proﬁle of the reaction is shown
in ﬁgure 1(b).
Hydrogenolysis begins with exchange of the hydride
ligandin1bythealkyl ligand,resultingintheformationof
the n-butyl intermediate 9 and elimination of a hydrogen
molecule according to the r-bond metathesis mechanism
via
transition
state
10
(DE6¼ ¼ 18.6 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼ 27.0 kcal mol)1 relative to 1 + C4H10). It
proceeds without the formation of pre- and post-reaction
complexes. This was evidenced, here and afterwards, by
the study of the relaxation from the saddle point to the sides
of reactants and products, respectively. The resulting n-
butyl intermediate 9 has a non-agostic conﬁguration of an
alkyl fragment, as the zirconium atom turns out to be
coordinatively saturated in the case of these species.
Further transformation of the intermediate 9 involves
cleavage of the C2-C3 bond and the b-ethyl transfer
toward the zirconium atom to give a weak oleﬁn complex
7 via transition state 8. The energy barrier to this
transformation
is
high
(DE6¼ ¼ 31.4 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼ 30.9 kcal mol)1 relative to 9), while the process
itself
is
thermodynamically
unfavorable
(DE ¼
20.6 kcal mol)1, DG298 ¼ 16.9 kcal mol)1). A feature of
complex 7 is the absence of vacancies in the coordination
sphere of the metal atom, so it cannot coordinate an extra
hydrogen molecule. Therefore, the only channel of
further transformations of complex 7 can involve the
elimination of ethylene molecule in accordance with the
mechanism proposed by Basset et al. [10]. The corre-
sponding conversion of 7 into 6 causes an additional
increase in the energy of the system (DE ¼ 5.4 kcal mol)1
relative to 7), which is however compensated by a
considerable
increase
in
the
entropy
(DG298 ¼
)6.3 kcal mol)1).
The ﬁnal stage of transformation, which closes the
catalytic cycle, involves the exchange of the ethyl ligand
in the derivative 6 by the hydride ligand via transition
state 25. This transformation requires the overcoming of
an energy barrier (DE6¼ ¼ 13.2 kcal mol)1, DG298
6¼ ¼
24.7 kcal mol)1 relative to 6) and is accompanied by a
small energy gain (DE ¼ )6.0 kcal mol)1, DG298 ¼
)2.2 kcal mol)1).
Hydrogenolysis of butane following the Basset cata-
lytic cycle results in ethane and ethylene, so the overall
reaction equation has the form: C4H10 ! C2H6 +
C2H4. Our calculations of the thermodynamic parame-
ters of this reaction gave DH298 ¼ 22.7 kcal mol)1
and DG298 ¼ 11.0 kcal mol)1, which are in a good
agreement with the values calculated using the tabu-
lated standard energies of formation [28] (DH0 ¼
22.4 kcal mol)1, DF 0 ¼ 12.5 kcal mol)1). The results
obtained suggest that hydrogenolysis of butane on the
surface monohydrides 1 according to the Basset mech-
anism cannot occur under mild conditions since the
process is unfavorable from both kinetic and thermo-
dynamic considerations.
The thermodynamic restriction of hydrogenolysis of
alkanes can be overcome if the loss of energy for the
cleavage the CAC bond in the butane molecule is
compensated owing to the formation of two ethane
molecules in the catalytic cycle. The overall process
(C4H10 + H2 ! 2C2H6) is thermodynamically allowed
(DH298 ¼ )11.8 kcal mol)1, DG298 ¼ )14.8 kcal mol)1;
DH0 ¼ )10.3 kcal mol)1, DF 0 ¼ )11.6 kcal mol)1; cal-
culated using the reference data [28]). We found that the
process is feasible under assumption that the Zr(IV)
dihydrides (2) or Zr(III) hydrides (3) are involved as the
catalytically active species.
3.2. Surface-supported zirconium dihydrides
3.2.1. Ethylene polymerization
Ethylene polymerization on dihydrides 2 [20] (scheme
2, Figure 2(a)) begins with the insertion of two ethylene
molecules into two Zr–H bonds. The ﬁrst insertion
occurs barrierlessly and leads to the formation of the b-
agostic intermediate 11. The insertion of the second
ethylene molecule to the residual Zr–H bond of 11
proceeds via transition state 13. Transformations 11 !
12 ! 13 ! 14 require the overcoming of an energy
barrier (DE6¼ ¼ 1.9 kcal mol)1, DG298
6¼ ¼ 3.8 kcal mol)1
relative
to
12;
DE6¼ ¼ )6.2 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼
6.7 kcal mol)1 relative to 11 + C2H4) and are exother-
mic. As opposed to the intermediate 11, the agostic
interactions of any kind are absent in the resulting
intermediate 14, indicating a decrease in the degree of
coordinative unsaturation of Zr in this compound.
Because of the high reactivity of the Zr–H bonds
toward the ethylene molecule, in the beginning of the
polymerization process both hydride ligands are con-
verted into alkyl derivatives and participate in further
transformations in this form.
Growth of the polymer chain involves the insertion of
ethylene molecules into one of the Zr–C bonds of the
D.V. Besedin et al./Hydrogenolysis of Alkanes and Oleﬁn Polymerization
50
intermediate 14 and is presented as a sequence of
transformations 14 ! 15 ! 16 ! 17 in Scheme 2,
which include the formation of a weak oleﬁn complex
15. The process is thermodynamically favorable. The
transition state 16 has the highest energy on the
reaction
pathway
(DE6¼ ¼ 9.5 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼
14.3 kcal mol)1 relative to 15; DE6¼ ¼ 5.4 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼ 20.4
kcal mol)1 relative to 14 + C2H4),
therefore the transformation 15 ! 16 ! 17 is the rate-
determining step of the overall process.
It should be noted that subsequent interaction of 17
with the next ethylene molecule can result in insertion of
ethylene both into the ZrAEt bond to give a dibutyl
derivative and into the ZrABu bond to give an ethyl-
hexyl derivative. The activation barriers to these two
processes calculated in this work (DE6¼ ¼ 5.4 and
5.9 kcal mol)1;
DG298
6¼ ¼ 12.3
and
12.5 kcal mol)1,
respectively, relative to 17 + C2H4) and the energies
of the corresponding transformations (DE ¼ )25.4 and
)24.6 kcal mol)1; DG298 ¼ )10.8 and )10.1 kcal mol)1,
respectively, relative to 17 + C2H4) suggest that the
processes can occur nearly equiprobably. In other
words, the dihydrides 2 diﬀer from monohydrides 1 as
catalysts of ethylene polymerization in that the former
provide the possibility for two polymer chains to grow
simultaneously on the same catalytic specimen.
The catalytic species 2 can be regenerated under
hydrogen by successive hydrogenolysis of the ZrAC
bonds in compound 17. This can occur involving either
the above-mentioned ethyl derivative 11 or the n-butyl
derivative 18. Analysis of the thermodynamic and kinetic
characteristics of these channels shows their proximity.
The energy characteristics of ethylene polymerization
on zirconium hydrides 1 and 2 suggest rather high rates
of both processes at room temperature. Both monohy-
drides 1 and dihydrides 2 should have similar activity
toward ethylene polymerization because of the very
close values of the energy barriers to the rate-determin-
ing step of the reaction. The corresponding values for 1
and 2, respectively, are DE6¼ ¼ 10.7 and 9.5 kcal mol)1
(relative to complexes), 5.3 and 5.4 kcal mol)1 (relative
to free reactants); DG298
6¼ ¼ 14.0 and 14.3 kcal mol)1
(relative to complexes), 20.2 and 20.4 kcal mol)1 (rela-
tive to free reactants).
Despite the possibility for two polymer chains to
grow simultaneously on dihydrides 2, the overall rate of
ethylene polymerization catalyzed by these species must
be of the same order of magnitude as the rate of the
corresponding process involving the monohydrides 1,
since the catalytic species provide the possibility for
insertion of only one ethylene molecule at each instance
of time.
3.2.2. Hydrogenolysis of butane
Scheme 3 presents the mechanism of the interaction
between the model compound 2 and butane molecule
(the energy proﬁle of the reaction is shown in ﬁg-
ure 2(b)) [19,21]. The presence of the second hydride

ligand in compound 2 makes the mechanism of hydrog-
enolysis of butane on these species qualitatively diﬀerent
from the mechanism of the reaction of monohydrides 1
with butane molecule (see above).
Hydrogenolysis begins with the formation of alkyl-
zirconium hydride 18 via the four-centered transition
state 26 without the formation of the pre and post-
reaction complexes. This step is characterized by a lower
energy
barrier
(DE6¼ ¼ 12.6 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼
21.7 kcal mol)1 relative to free reactants) compared to
the corresponding reaction of Zr(IV) monohydrides
(1 + C4H10). The resulting alkylhydride derivative 18,
like its ethyl analog 11 considered above, has a b-agostic
conﬁguration of an alkyl moiety.
Cleavage of the aliphatic b-CAC bond in intermedi-
ate 18 via transition state 27 requires the overcoming of
an energy barrier (DE6¼ ¼ 33.8 kcal mol)1, DG298
6¼ ¼
34.1 kcal mol)1 relative to 18), which is close to the
barrier to the corresponding process catalyzed by
monohydrides 1. However, a very important diﬀerence
of the catalytic species 2 from 1 is that relaxation of the
transition state 27 immediately leads to the dialkyl
derivative 14 bypassing the formation of the oleﬁn
complex. In other words, relaxation of TS 27 is

accompanied by the migration of the coordinated
ethylene molecule from the alkyl fragment toward
the hydride ligand followed by the formation of the
H–CH2CH2 bond and the CH3CH2–Zr bond. As can be
seen in the energy diagram (ﬁgure 2(b)), the transfor-
mation of 18 into 14 is accompanied by a decrease in the
energy of the system (DE ¼ )6.5 kcal mol)1, DG298 ¼

between 18 and 14 (2.4  105 for T ¼ 298 K and
1.1  104 for T ¼ 423 K) suggest that hydrogenolysis
of butane on dihydrides 2 is thermodynamically allowed
and can occur at rather high rates at the elevated
temperatures (~423 K) corresponding to the actual
reaction conditions.
Dihydride

can
be
regenerated
by
successive
replacement of ethyl ligands in the intermediate 14 by
the hydride ligand similarly to the above-mentioned
alkyl-hydride exchange reactions (transformations 14 !
28 ! 11 ! 29 ! 2). The process is accompanied by
the
energy
gain
(DE ¼ )11.0 kcal mol)1,
DG298 ¼
)7.3 kcal mol)1).
3.3. Surface-supported trivalent zirconium hydrides
3.3.1. Ethylene polymerization
As mentioned above, the real catalytic system always
contains a rather large amount of Zr(III) compounds,
among those the presence of Zr(III) hydrides was
detected [5,7]. Therefore, we considered compound 3
as
a
possible
model
of
the
surface
hydride
(BSiAO)2ZrIIIH and estimated the possibility for ethyl-
ene polymerization (scheme 4, ﬁgure 3(a)) to occur on
the Zr(III) hydride species.
Analogously to the above-mentioned processes, the reac-
tion of the model compound 3 begins with the insertion
of ethylene molecule into the Zr–H bond (transforma-
tions
3 ! 19 ! 20 ! 21) [20]. The
thermodynamic
characteristics (DE and DG298) of this transformation
(3 + C2H4 ! 19)
are
)33.6
and
)22.0 kcal mol)1,
respectively. The former value is so large that allows
compensation of the entropy loss due to the formation
of complex 19. This complex has a parallel orientation
of coordinated ethylene molecule in respect to the ZrAH
bond, which is the only valid way of orientation that
allows its further transformations described below.
The oleﬁn p-complex 19 is thermodynamically stable.
Because of this, its transformation into the primary
insertion product 21 requires the overcoming of a some-
what higher energy barrier 20 (DE6¼ ¼ 4.8 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼ 5.1 kcal mol)1 relative to 19) and is accom-
panied by smaller energy gain (DE ¼ )6.0 kcal mol)1,
DG298 ¼ )4.0 kcal mol)1 relative to 19) compared to the
analogous reactions of the Zr(IV) monohydrides and
dihydrides. Nevertheless, the overall energy eﬀect of
ethylene insertion into the Zr–H bond (3 + C2H4 ! 21)
is
even
somewhat
higher
(DE ¼ )39.6 kcal mol)1,
DG298 ¼ )25.9 kcal mol)1).
The energy of ethylene bonding to the Zr(III)
compounds has even stronger effect on the possibility
of transformations 21 ! 22 ! 23 ! 24. The formation
of a strong oleﬁn p-complex 22 is also characterized by a
negative DG298 value ()16.2 kcal mol)1). During the
formation of this complex, the loss of a b-agostic
interaction found in the initial intermediate 21 is
Scheme 3.

observed, while an ethylene molecule coordinates nearly
perpendicular in respect to the ZrAC bond. From the
energetic point of view, the transformation 22 ! 23 !
24 requires the overcoming of a rather high energy
barrier (transition state 23; DE6¼ ¼ 28.1 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼ 30.0 kcal mol)1 relative to 22). Moreover, it
turns out to be somewhat thermodynamically unfavor-
able
(DE ¼ 1.6 kcal mol)1,
DG298 ¼ 5.4 kcal mol)1).
Therefore, even if we assume the presence of Zr(III)
hydrides in the real catalytic system as the catalysts of
oleﬁn polymerization, they cannot compete with the
Zr(IV) hydrides. This conclusion is consistent with the
experimentally observed reduction of the catalyst activ-
ity toward the ethylene polymerization with an increase
in the amount of Zr(III) [2, 5].
3.3.2. Hydrogenolysis of butane
Scheme 5 presents the sequence of reactions of the
model compound 3 with butane molecule, which results
in cleavage of the CAC bond [21]. The energy diagram
for the key stages of the process is shown in ﬁgure 3(b).
Similarly to the reactions of the species 1 and 2 (see
above), the interaction 3 + C4H10 begins with exchange
of the hydride ligand in compound 3 by alkyl substituent
via transition state 31, which results in the intermediate
24. A marked distinction between this stage and the
reactions of the zirconium(IV) compounds (see sections
1 and 2) is the formation of a pre-reaction agostic
complex 30 with butane molecule and a post-reaction
complex
32 of the alkylzirconium derivative with
hydrogen molecule. The formation of complex 30 is
an exothermic process (DE ¼ )5.8 kcal mol)1, DH298 ¼
)4.7 kcal mol)1 relative to the non-interacting reagents)
but is accompanied by loss of entropy; because of this,
the
change
in
the
Gibbs
free
energy
is
positive
(DG298 ¼ 3.9 kcal mol)1). The reaction 3 + C4H10 !
24 + H2 is much less endothermic (DE ¼
0.7 kcal
mol)1, DG298 ¼ 0.4 kcal mol)1) compared to the corre-
sponding transformations of the systems 1 + ~
C4H10
and 2 + ~
C4H10. What is more, it requires the overcom-
ing of the lower energy barrier on the reaction pathway
(transition state 31; DE6¼ ¼ 12.6 kcal mol)1, DG298
6¼ ¼
12.7 kcal mol)1 relative to 30; DE6¼ ¼ 6.8 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼ 16.5 kcal mol)1 relative to 3 + C4H10). Dis-
sociation of the post-reaction complex 32 by elimination
of hydrogen molecule is accompanied by rotation of the
alkyl fragment about the ZrAC and the formation of a
strong b-agostic bond; as a consequence, the energy of
the system decreases. According to our ﬁndings, this
transformation (32 ! 24 + H2) proceeds in two steps
and requires the overcoming of an energy barriers not
larger than DE6¼ ¼ 1.5 kcal mol)1. Because this barrier
is negligible compared to the barriers to the other steps,
we will skip the detailed description of this stage.
The key stage of the process, namely, the cleavage of
the aliphatic CAC bond in the intermediate 24 is the
reverse of the formation of the CAC bond in the course
of ethylene polymerization (scheme 4). This stage occurs
via transition state 23 and results in complex 22. As can
be seen in the energy diagram (ﬁgure 3(b)), the energy
barrier to this transformation (DE6¼ ¼ 26.6 kcal mol)1;
DG298
6¼ ¼ 24.6 kcal mol)1 relative to 24) is much lower
than the barriers to cleavage of the CAC bond on the
Zr(IV) hydrides 1 and 2. The process turns out to be
thermodynamically
favorable
(DE ¼ –1.6 kcal mol)1,
DG298 ¼ –5.4 kcal mol)1 relative to 24). From thermo-
dynamics considerations, a high degree of coordinative
unsaturation of the zirconium atom in compound 24
makes the b-alkyl transfer very favorable because it
results in ﬁlling of the coordination vacancy of Zr.
Let us consider further transformations of complex
22. Similarly to complex 7, it can undergo a dissociation
Scheme 4.
D.V. Besedin et al./Hydrogenolysis of Alkanes and Oleﬁn Polymerization

with
elimination
of
ethylene
molecule
(22
!
21 + C2H4). According to calculations, this process is
thermodynamically forbidden (DE ¼ 27.8 kcal mol)1;
DG298 ¼ 16.2 kcal mol)1).
However,
examination
of
the potential energy surface of the system 22 + H2
revealed that, in contrast to the corresponding com-
plexes of tetravalent zirconium, the complex in question
can enter into an exchange reaction with a hydrogen
molecule. This results in replacement of the alkyl
substituent at the Zr atom by the hydride ligand while
retaining the ethylene molecule within the coordination
sphere of the metal (22 ! 33 ! 19, see scheme 5). The
energy
barrier
to
this
transformation
(DE6¼ ¼
11.0 kcal mol)1, DG298
6¼ ¼ 22.1 kcal mol)1 relative to
22) is somewhat lower than to the b-alkyl transfer. The
process
is
accompanied
by
some
energy
gain
(DE ¼ )7.3 kcal mol)1, DG298 ¼ )5.6 kcal mol)1).
Further transformations of intermediate 19 involve
insertion of coordinated ethylene molecule into the
ZrAH bond via the transformations 19 ! 20 ! 21 (see
section 3.3.1). Regeneration of the catalytic species 3 by
exchange of the alkyl ligand to the hydride ligand in the
intermediate 21 via transition state 35 to give the pre-
and post-reaction complexes 34 and 36, respectively,

3.4. Regioselectivity of hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes
on the surface hydrides of Zr(III) and Zr(IV)
To assess the regioselectivity of hydrogenolysis of
alkanes on the surface zirconium hydrides, we studied
the interaction of the model compounds 1–3 with other
linear alkanes (propane, n-butane, and n-pentane)
assuming diﬀerent fashion of ‘‘anchoring’’ the alkane
to the zirconium hydride (at the primary and the C2-
secondary carbon atoms) [21]. This allowed the evalu-
ation of the eﬀect of the alkyl chain length and the
presence of the a-branchings in the corresponding
alkylzirconium derivatives on the energy characteristics
of hydrogenolysis of the CAC bond. Tables 1–3 list the
energy characteristics of the reactions of hydrogenolysis
of linear alkanes on the model compounds 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, for R ¼ propyl (a: R0 ¼ CH3, R00 ¼ H), n-
butyl (b: R0 ¼ C2H5, R00 ¼ H), s-butyl (c: R0 ¼ CH3,
R00 ¼ CH3), and s-pentyl (d: R0 ¼ C2H5, R00 ¼ CH3).
The mechanism of the interaction between the model
compound 1 and linear alkanes RH (table 1) is similar to
the
mechanism
of
hydrogenolysis
of
butane
(see
scheme 1). The formation of the surface alkylzirconium
compounds 90 from 1 + RH requires the overcoming of
energy barriers with comparable heights (DE6¼ ¼ 18.6 )
19.6 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼ 26.7 )
28.0 kcal mol)1
relative to 1 + RH) and is endothermic (DE ¼ 5.3 )
6.1 kcal mol)1, DG298 ¼ 2.9 ) 4.0 kcal mol)1). As in the
case of n-butyl derivative 9 studied above, no agostic
interactions are present in other alkyl intermediates 90 as
Scheme 5.

well. The energy barriers to the activation of the primary
CAH bonds of propane (a) and butane (b) are slightly
(approximately 1 kcal mol)1) lower then the correspond-
ing barriers to the activation of the secondary CAH bonds
of butane (c) and pentane (d). This suggests that the rate of
the interaction of 1 with the primary bonds of RH must be
somewhat higher, which is in agreement with the conclu-
sion drawn by Basset et al. in their experimental study
[14], namely, that the reaction of the surface zirconium
hydrides with propane results in the corresponding n-
propyl derivative as the major product.
The energy barriers to cleavage of the aliphatic
b-CAC bond in the alkyl complexes 90 by transfer of the
alkyl fragment R0 (transformations 90 ! 80 ! 70) are as
follows: DE6¼ ¼ 29.5 ) 31.4 kcal mol)1 and DG298
6¼ ¼
28.4 ) 30.9 kcal mol)1 relative to 90. The barriers to the
bond cleavage in t1he branched alkylzirconium deriva-
tives 90c and 90d are somewhat lower compared to the
linear compounds 90a and 90b (table 1). The formation
of the weak oleﬁn complexes 70 is characterized by the
parameters DE ¼ 11.4 ) 20.6 kcal mol)1 and DG298 ¼
8.3 ) 16.9 kcal mol)1 relative to 90. Branching at the a-
position of the alkyl chain in compounds 90c and 90d
causes a considerable reduction of the endothermicity of
the process. Besides, the b-methyl transfer occurs easier
than the b-ethyl transfer. Because of this, the interme-
diate 90c is characterized by both the lowest energy
barrier to transformation into 70c and the smallest
endothermicity of this process. The equilibrium con-
stants for this reaction stage are 8.8  10)7–3.9  10)13
(calculated for normal conditions, T ¼ 298 K) and
1.3  10)4–4.3  10)9 (calculated for the elevated tem-
perature, T ¼ 423 K, corresponding to the actual exper-
imental conditions).
Elimination
of oleﬁn (C2H4, R00 ¼ H or C3H6,
R00 ¼ CH3) in the complexes 70a–d is accompanied by
an increase in energy (DE ¼ 5.4 ) 7.1 kcal mol)1 rela-
tive to 70a–d) and a considerable entropy gain, which
leads to the overall decrease in the Gibbs free energy of
the system (DG298 ¼ ()6.9) – ()3.9) kcal mol)1). As a
result, changes in the Gibbs free energy in the course of
transformations 90 ! 60 + CH2=CHR00 are DG298 ¼
4.3 ) 10.7 kcal mol)1
and
for
the
overall
process
(1 + RH ! 60 + CH2 = CHR00)
they
are
DG298 ¼
8.3 ) 13.6 kcal mol)1
(DE ¼
24.6 ) 31.4 kcal mol)1,
DH298 ¼ 17.9 ) 25.8 kcal mol)1). Thus, in all the cases
studied (a – d) cleavage of the CAC bond in linear
alkanes by the mechanism proposed by Basset et al.
[10,11] appears to be thermodynamically unfavorable.
The energy barriers to transformations 2 + RH !
180+H2 (table 2, scheme 3) are as follows: DE6¼¼12.6 )
14.2 kcal mol)1 and DG298
6¼ ¼ 21.7 ) 23.5 kcal mol)1.
These reactions are accompanied by an insigniﬁcant
increase
in
the
energy
of
the
system
(DE ¼
1.4 ) 2.1 kcal mol)1, DG298 ¼ 0.3 ) 1.2 kcal mol)1). It
should be noted that the diﬀerences between the activa-
tion energies of the interaction with the primary and
secondary CAH bonds of RH are more pronounced in the
case of dihydrides 2 as compared to the analogous
reactions of monohydrides 1 (see table 2). The resulting
intermediates 180 are characterized by the b-agostic
conﬁguration of an alkyl chain in all the cases considered.
Cleavage of the aliphatic b-CAC bond in alkyl
hydrides 180 via transition state 270 is characterized by
the energy barriers DE6¼ ¼ 32.8 ) 34.4 kcal mol)1 and
DG298
6¼ ¼ 32.0 ) 34.1 kcal mol)1 and is accompanied
by some energy gain (DE ¼ ()10.2) – ()6.5) kcal mol)1,
DG298 ¼ ()11.3) – ()7.3) kcal mol)1 relative to 180).
Transfer of the b-methyl fragment in 180a and 180c
requires the overcoming of lower energy barriers and is
accompanied by greater energy gain compared to the
b-ethyl transfer (180b and 180d). The estimates of the rate
constants for the limiting stage of the reaction 180 ! 140
(2.0  10)12 ) 1.3  10)9 s)1 for T ¼ 298 K and 4.6 
10)5 ) 2.6  10)3 s)1 for T ¼ 423 K) and the constants
of the equilibrium between the reagents and products
(2.3  105 – 1.9  108 for T ¼ 298 K and 1.1  104 )
1.8  106 for T ¼ 423 K) suggest that in all cases (a – d)
hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on dihydrides 2 is
thermodynamically allowed and can occur at moderate
rates at the elevated temperatures (~423 K) correspond-
ing to the actual reaction conditions.
As mentioned above, a peculiar feature of the model
compound 3 is the formation of the pre-reaction and
post-reaction complexes in the alkyl/hydride exchange
reactions. The formation of complexes 300 in the reac-
tion 3 + RH (table 3, scheme 5) is an exothermic
process. Its thermodynamic characteristics (DE ¼ ()5.8)
– ()5.6) kcal mol)1, DH298 ¼ ()4.7) – ()4.5) kcal mol)1
relative to the non-interacting reagents) were found to be
only slightly dependent on the nature of the alkane
molecule. Nevertheless, the loss of entropy upon the
formation of complexes 300 is somewhat larger in the
case of ‘‘anchoring’’ the alkane molecules to the sec-
ondary (c–d, DG298 ¼ 5.5 ) 5.7 kcal mol)1) rather than
primary carbon atom (a–b, DG298 ¼
3.9 kcal mol)1).
Because of this, the energy barriers to the formation
reactions of branched alkylzirconium derivatives (transi-
tion states 310) are somewhat higher (c–d, DE6¼ ¼
13.9 ) 14.0 kcal mol)1
relative
to
300;
DE6¼ ¼
6.8 ) 6.9 kcal mol)1 relative to 3 + RH) compared to
the barriers to the formation of the corresponding
linear alkylzirconium derivatives (a–b, DE6¼ ¼ 12.5 )
12.6 kcal mol)1
relative
to
300;
DE6¼ ¼ 8.3 )
8.4 kcal mol)1 relative to 3 + RH). Noteworthy is that
both types of the reaction are characterized by close
values
of
the
Gibbs
free
energy
(DG298
6¼ ¼
11.7 ) 12.6 kcal mol)1
relative
to
300;
DG298
6¼ ¼
16.2 ) 17.6 kcal mol)1 relative to 3 + RH).
The energy effect of the dissociation of the post-
reaction complexes 320 via the elimination of hydrogen
molecule to give intermediates 240 is rather strongly
dependent on the structure of the alkane molecule under
study and on the fashion of its coordination. For
D.V. Besedin et al./Hydrogenolysis of Alkanes and Oleﬁn Polymerization
58
instance, we found that the DE values are )0.4 kcal
mol)1 for propane ‘‘anchored’’ to the primary carbon
atom (a) and )0.7 and )2.4 kcal mol)1 for butane
‘‘anchored’’ to the primary (b) and secondary (c) carbon
atom, respectively. Calculations revealed no post-reac-
tion complex 320d on the potential energy surface of the
system in the case of pentane ‘‘anchored’’ to the C2 atom
(d). Because of considerable entropy gain in the cases (a–
c) the DG298 values are negative and lie between )11.1
and )9.8 kcal mol)1. In contrast to the reactions of
the Zr(IV) compounds 1 and 2 (see sections 1 and 2),
the transformations 3 + RH !240 + H2 can be con-
sidered as nearly thermally neutral processes (DE ¼
0.5 ) 1.1 kcal mol)1, DG298 ¼ 0.1 ) 0.5 kcal mol)1).
Cleavage of the aliphatic CAC bond in the inter-
mediates 240 via transition state 230, which results in
strong p-complexes 220, must occur somewhat easier
in the case of the b-methyl transfer (a, c; DE6¼ ¼
24.8 ) 25.5 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼
23.8 ) 25.2
kcal
mol)1 relative to 240) compared to the b-ethyl transfer
(b, d; DE6¼ ¼ 26.6 ) 27.1 kcal mol)1, DG298
6¼ ¼ 24.6 )
25.6 kcal mol)1 relative to 240). Moreover, migration of
the b-Me group causes a more pronounced decrease in the
energy of the system upon transformations 240 !
230 ! 220 (DE ¼ ()7.0) – ()5.0) kcal mol)1, DG298 ¼
()11.6) – ()8.7) kcal mol)1), than b-Et (DE ¼ ()3.6) –
()1.6) kcal mol)1, DG298 ¼ ()8.3) – ()5.4) kcal mol)1).
This is in good agreement with the earlier ﬁndings for the
Zr(IV) compounds 1 and 2. In all the cases studied (a – d),
transformations 240 ! 230 ! 220 are characterized by the
lowest energy barriers compared to the model reactions of
the Zr(IV) compounds.
In contrast to this, hydrogenolysis of the ZrAC
bonds in complexes 220 with retention of the coordi-
nated oleﬁn molecule via transition state 330 to give
intermediates 190 must be somewhat more favorable
in the case of ZrAEt (b, d) rather than ZrAMe bond
(a, c). The former process is characterized by both
lower energy barriers (DE6¼ ¼ 11.0 ) 11.5 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼ 22.1 ) 23.1 kcal mol)1 relative to 220) and
higher exothermicity (DE ¼ ()7.3) – ()6.4) kcal mol)1,
DG298 ¼ ()5.6) – ()4.6) kcal mol)1). In the latter case,
the corresponding values are as follows: DE6¼ ¼ 12.6 )
12.9 kcal mol)1,
DG298
6¼ ¼
23.5 ) 24.8 kcal mol)1,
DE ¼ ()5.7) – ()4.6) kcal mol)1, and DG298 ¼ ()4.1) –
()3.2) kcal mol)1. Further transformation of the inter-
mediates 190 requires the overcoming of low energy
barriers and are accompanied by an energy gain, the
energy characteristics of these stages being only slightly
dependent on the nature of the alkane in question.
Therefore, we will not dwell on this point.
Thus, all the reactions of hydrogenolysis of linear
alkanes on the model compounds 1–3 are characterized
by close values of the energy characteristics and seem to
be feasible for 2 and 3 at elevated temperatures
(~423 K). A similar study of the reactions of branched
alkanes is currently in progress. Preliminary results
point that the energy proﬁles of the reactions of linear
and branched alkanes with the metal hydrides of
diﬀerent structure are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent despite a
similarity of the
mechanism
of hydrogenolysis
of
branched alkanes to that established earlier for linear
alkanes.
4. Concluding remarks
In our studies [19–21] we have examined some
important issues concerning the kinetics and mecha-
nisms of the catalytic processes involving the formation
(ethylene polymerization) and cleavage (hydrogenolysis
of alkanes) of the CAC bonds on the silica-supported
zirconium hydrides. The unique ability of these systems
to catalyze both processes depending on the presence of
hydrogen in the system was rationalized.
Three types of catalytic species have been studied, all
of
them,
(BSiAO)3ZrIVH,
(BSiAO)2ZrIVH2
and
(BSiAO)2ZrIIIH, being observed experimentally [2, 4–
8, 16]. We have shown that diﬀerent catalytic processes
occur involving diﬀerent surface hydrides. The rates of
ethylene polymerizations on the monohydrides (B
SiAO)3ZrH and dihydrides (B SiAO)2ZrH2 were found
to be of the same order of magnitude. Since the amount
of monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH present in the system is
always much larger than that of dihydrides, the former
should be considered as the major catalytic species for
the polymerization reaction.
Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides
(B SiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable. In
contrast to this, the dihydrides (B SiAO)2ZrH2, which
are present in the real catalytic systems (this was reliably
proved earlier [4,8]) can act as the catalysts of hydrog-
enolysis of linear alkanes at the same temperatures as
those reported in the experimental studies by Basset
et al. [9–11]. The main distinctions between dihydrides
and monohydrides are a higher degree of coordinative
unsaturation of the Zr atom and the presence of an
additional site for binding the substrate in the former.
Relatively high degree of coordinative unsaturation of
the surface species in all the systems studied is respon-
sible for rather low regioselectivity of the process. This is
in good agreement with the experimental data reported
by Basset et al. [11, 29], according to which hydrogen-
olysis of linear alkanes and polyethylene always results
in a mixture of low-molecular-weight alkanes.
Earlier [18], we have shown that the activation energy
for isotope exchange in methane on zirconium hydrides
reported in the experimental study by Hall et al. [9] is
somewhat lower than the energy barrier to the reaction
of dihydrides with the methane molecule obtained from
our calculations (7 vs. 9–11 kcal mol)1, respectively).
This means that some other species that are more
reactive than dihydrides can also contribute to the
kinetics of the isotope exchange. The most promising

candidates
are
hydrides
of
trivalent
compounds,
(BSiAO)2ZrIIIH, which, according to the results ob-
tained in our works [20, 21], also can be eﬃcient
catalysts of hydrogenolysis of alkanes.
Despite the fact that Basset et al. reliably proved that
monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH were the major type of
the surface metal hydrides in the samples of catalysts
employed in their study [10], we believe that additional
experimental investigations are required. They should
involve preparation of samples with diﬀerent amount of
the zirconium monohydrides and dihydrides, kinetic
measurements for hydrogenolysis of alkanes and ethyl-
ene polymerization on the samples prepared, and the
elucidation of the nature of the trivalent zirconium
compounds.
