Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

1. The literature does not provide a comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. It focuses on the activation of C-H bonds in cyclooctane and methane by a silica-supported tantalum hydride complex. The complex is able to activate the C-H bonds at low temperatures, forming tantalum-alkyl surface complexes. These complexes can be transformed into tantalum-alkoxy derivatives under molecular oxygen, which then react with acetic acid to form alkyl acetates. The high activity of the surface organometallic fragments in catalytic conditions is attributed to the high electrophilic character of the metals and their immobilization and isolation, which prevent dimerization or deactivation. The mechanism of C-H bond activation involves a σ-bond metathesis process, but an oxidative addition of the C-H bond followed by hydrogen elimination cannot be excluded.

1. 文献没有提供硅胶支撑的锆氢化物和氧化铝支撑的钍氢化物的比较。它专注于硅胶支撑的钽氢化物复合物对环辛烷和甲烷中C-H键的激活。该复合物能够在低温下激活C-H键，形成钽-烷基表面复合物。这些复合物在分子氧下可转化为钽-烷氧基衍生物，然后与乙酸反应形成烷基乙酸盐。表面有机金属片段在催化条件下的高活性归因于金属的高亲电性和它们的固定化和隔离，这防止了二聚化或失活。C-H键激活的机制涉及σ-键的变位过程，但不能排除C-H键的氧化加成后氢气的消除。

1. The document does not provide information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides or a direct comparison with silica-supported zirconium hydrides. It does, however, describe the preparation and catalytic properties of a silica-supported tantalum hydride complex in C-H bond activation reactions. The complex is formed by the reaction of the trisneopentyl(neopenty1idene)tantalum complex with silanol groups of silica previously dehydroxylated at 500°C. This complex activates cyclooctane and methane at room temperature to form tantalum-alkyl surface species, which can be transformed under molecular oxygen into tantalum-alkoxy derivatives that react with acetic acid to produce alkylacetates. The high activity of the complex in catalytic conditions is attributed to the high electrophilic character of tantalum, which is formally an eight-electron species, and the immobilization and isolation of the tantalum centers that prevent dimerization or deactivation. The mechanism of C-H bond activation by the complex is not definitively established but may involve a σ-bond metathesis mechanism or an oxidative addition of the C-H bond followed by hydrogen elimination.

1. 文件没有提供关于氧化铝支撑的钍氢化物的信息，也没有直接比较二氧化硅支撑的锆氢化物。但是，它描述了二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物复合物在C-H键活化反应中的制备和催化性能。该复合物由三新戊基(新戊基)钽复合物与先前在500°C下脱羟基化的二氧化硅的硅醇基团的反应形成。该复合物在室温下活化环辛烷和甲烷，形成钽-烷基表面物种，这些物种在分子氧下转化为钽-烷氧基衍生物，这些衍生物与乙酸反应产生烷基乙酸盐。该复合物在催化条件下的高活性归因于钽的高亲电性，钽是正式的八电子物种，以及钽中心的固定化和隔离，防止了二聚化或失活。C-H键活化复合物的机制尚未确定，但可能涉及σ-键的变位机制或C-H键的氧化加成，随后是氢的消除。

1. The literature does not provide a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, it does describe the activation of C-H bonds by a silica-supported tantalum hydride complex. This complex activates the C-H and C-D bonds of cyclooctane and CD4, respectively, to form cyclooctyl and perdeuteriomethyl-tantalum surface complexes. These complexes can be transformed under molecular oxygen into tantalum-alkoxy derivatives, which with acetic acid give rise to the corresponding alkylacetates. The activation occurs at low temperatures, and the complex is believed to have a d0 configuration, similar to other early transition metal complexes reported to activate C-H bonds. The high reactivity is attributed to the electrophilic character of tantalum, which is formally an eight-electron species, and the immobilization and isolation of the tantalum centers on the silica surface, which prevents dimerization or deactivation.
