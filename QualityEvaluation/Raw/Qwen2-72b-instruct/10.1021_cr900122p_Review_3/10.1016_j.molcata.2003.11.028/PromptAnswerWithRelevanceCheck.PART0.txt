Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

The literature does not provide information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides or a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides are described as being active in the depolymerisation of polyethylene into lower oligomers and diesel range hydrocarbons. The mechanism involves a β-alkyl transfer which is the microscopic reverse of the Cossee mechanism of olefin insertion into a metal alkyl bond. The literature does not detail the reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in the processes of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis for either catalyst.

文献没有提供关于氧化铝支持的钍氢化物的信息，也没有直接比较硅胶支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的信息。描述的硅胶支持的锆氢化物在聚乙烯的解聚反应中是活性的，产物为较低的寡聚物和柴油范围的烃类。该机制涉及β-烷基转移，这是Cossee机制的微观逆反应，即烯烃插入金属烷基键。文献没有详细说明H/D交换和烷基化反应中两种催化剂的反应速率、选择性，以及σ-键化、氢解和链行走的作用。

The literature does not provide information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides or a direct comparison with silica-supported zirconium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, H/D exchange, or alkane metathesis. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides are described as being active in polyethylene depolymerisation, involving a mechanism that includes a beta-alkyl transfer elementary step. No details are given on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of sigma-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking in these processes for either zirconium or thorium hydrides.

The literature does not provide information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides or a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The document focuses on the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic properties of silica-supported rhenium carbene species for olefin metathesis, silica-alumina-supported zirconium hydrides for polyethylene depolymerisation, and silica-supported tantalum hydride for alkane hydrogenolysis and alkane metathesis. It does not discuss the mechanisms of H/D exchange or alkane metathesis for alumina-supported thorium hydrides, nor does it provide data on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes for either catalyst.
