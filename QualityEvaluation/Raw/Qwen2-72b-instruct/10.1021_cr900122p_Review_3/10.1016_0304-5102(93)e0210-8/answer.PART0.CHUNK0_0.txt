1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, it does detail the catalytic properties of alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The thorium catalysts are described as being highly active for hydrogenation reactions, with turnover frequencies comparable to or exceeding those of conventional group 9 heterogeneous alkane activation catalysts. The selectivity of C-H functionalization is substantial, and the order of reactivity does not parallel C-H bond dissociation energies. The mechanism involves Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic a-bond metathesis pathway, followed by deuterolysis. Chain walking and hydrogenolysis are not explicitly discussed in the context of alkane metathesis, but the literature does mention that the mechanism for arene hydrogenation involves a sequence of steps including insertion, hydrogenation, and hydrogenolysis.

1.文献没有直接比较硅胶支撑的锆氢化物和氧化铝支撑的钍氢化物。但是，它确实详细描述了氧化铝支撑的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的催化性质。钍催化剂被描述为在氢化反应中具有高度活性，其周转频率与传统第9族异质烷基活化催化剂相当甚至更高。C-H功能化的选择性很大，反应顺序并不平行于C-H键的解离能。机制涉及Th-C键的形成和HD的消除，通过四中心，异裂的α-键变位途径，随后是氘化。链行走和氢解在烷基变位的上下文中没有被明确讨论，但文献确实提到，芳烃氢化机制涉及一系列步骤，包括插入、氢化和氢解。
