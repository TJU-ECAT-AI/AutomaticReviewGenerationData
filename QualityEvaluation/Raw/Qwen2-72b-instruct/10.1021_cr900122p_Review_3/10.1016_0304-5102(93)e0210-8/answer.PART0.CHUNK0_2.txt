1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. However, it does detail the catalytic properties of alumina-supported thorium hydrides, specifically Th(allyl),/DA, in C-H bond activation reactions. The catalyst is highly active for hydrogenation of arenes and alkane activation, with turnover frequencies comparable to or exceeding those of conventional group 9 heterogeneous alkane activation catalysts. The mechanism involves four-center, heterolytic a-bond metathesis pathways for Th-C bond formation and HD elimination, followed by deuterolysis. Alkane skeletal isomerization occurs via beta-H elimination and readdition of the Th+-H to the opposite face of the double bond. The reaction rates are high, and there is substantial selectivity in C-H functionalization, with primary > secondary > tertiary C-H bonds being activated. The roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes are not explicitly discussed, but the literature suggests that these mechanisms are involved in the activation and isomerization of alkanes.

1.文献没有直接比较硅胶支撑的锆氢化物和氧化铝支撑的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性能。但是，它详细描述了氧化铝支撑的钍氢化物，特别是Th(allyl),/DA，在C-H键活化反应中的催化性能。该催化剂在芳烃氢化和烷烃活化方面表现出高活性，其周转频率与传统第9族异质烷烃活化催化剂相当或更高。机制涉及四中心，异裂a-键变位途径，用于Th-C键的形成和HD消除，随后是氘化。烷烃骨架异构化通过β-H消除和Th+-H到双键对面的再添加发生。反应速率高，C-H功能化有显著的选择性，主要>二级>三级C-H键被激活。σ-键变位、氢化和链行走的作用在这些过程中没有明确讨论，但文献表明，这些机制参与了烷烃的活化和异构化。
