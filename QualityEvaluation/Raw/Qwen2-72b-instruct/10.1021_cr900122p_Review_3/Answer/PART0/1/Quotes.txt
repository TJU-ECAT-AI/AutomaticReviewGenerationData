[1] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230)"
          [2] "Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233)"
          [3] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228)"
          [4] "A direct one-step reaction pathway is highly disfavored (Ea > 65 kcal mol1), because it involves a four-center transition state with a carbon in the β-position (Scheme 15e). (227)"
