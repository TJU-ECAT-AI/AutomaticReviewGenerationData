The literature does not provide a comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. It focuses on the activation of C-H bonds in cyclooctane and methane by a silica-supported tantalum hydride complex. The complex is able to activate the C-H bonds at low temperatures, forming tantalum-alkyl surface complexes. These complexes can be transformed into tantalum-alkoxy derivatives under molecular oxygen, which then react with acetic acid to form alkyl acetates. The high activity of the surface organometallic fragments in catalytic conditions is attributed to the high electrophilic character of the metals and their immobilization and isolation, which prevent dimerization or deactivation. The mechanism of C-H bond activation involves a σ-bond metathesis process, but an oxidative addition of the C-H bond followed by hydrogen elimination cannot be excluded. The complex activates the C-H and C-D bonds of cyclooctane and CD4, respectively, to form cyclooctyl and perdeuteriomethyl-tantalum surface complexes. The activation occurs at low temperatures, and the complex is believed to have a d0 configuration, similar to other early transition metal complexes reported to activate C-H bonds. The high reactivity is attributed to the electrophilic character of tantalum, which is formally an eight-electron species, and the immobilization and isolation of the tantalum centers on the silica surface, which prevents dimerization or deactivation. The supported tantalum-hydride complex activates cyclooctane and methane at room temperature to form the corresponding tantalum-alkyl surface species. These species can be transformed under molecular oxygen into tantalum-alkoxy derivatives, which with acetic acid give rise to the corresponding alkylacetates. The high activity of the complex in catalytic conditions is attributed to the high electrophilic character of tantalum, which is formally an eight-electron species, and the immobilization and isolation of the tantalum centers that prevent dimerization or deactivation. The mechanism of C-H bond activation involves a σ-bond metathesis process, as no hydride is left on the surface after alkane activation.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. However, it does detail the catalytic properties of alumina-supported thorium hydrides, specifically Th(allyl)/DA, in alkane C-H activation and isomerization reactions. The turnover frequencies for these reactions are comparable to or exceed those of conventional group 9 heterogeneous alkane activation catalysts. The selectivity of C-H functionalization does not parallel C-H bond dissociation energies, with primary > secondary > tertiary and sterically less hindered > sterically more hindered. The mechanism proposed for the activation and isomerization of alkanes involves Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic a-bond metathesis pathway, followed by deuterolysis. Cycloalkane skeletal isomerization occurs via a β-H elimination and readdition of the Th+-H to the opposite face of the double bond. The roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes are not explicitly discussed in the literature.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, it details the preparation of silica-supported zirconium hydrides by contacting molecular tetraalkyl complexes of zirconium with a partially dehydroxylated silica surface, resulting in a tris(siloxy)/mono(hydrido) structure. These catalysts exhibit high activity in olefin polymerization, hydrogenation, and isomerization, with rapid reaction rates even at low temperatures. The mechanism of C-H bond activation involves σ-bond metathesis, as evidenced by low activation energy and high negative entropy in H/D exchange reactions. Selectivity is towards the formation of multiply labeled methanes after CH3D builds up. The role of σ-bond metathesis is significant, providing a constrained transition state that minimizes steric interactions and avoids the formation of a ZrMe intermediate. H/D exchange rates between methane and hydrogen support the view of σ-bond metathesis, with low activation energy and high negative entropy. The activation energy for H2/D2 exchange is estimated to be about 2 kcal/mol. The literature does not provide information on the selectivity of the catalysts or the roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking in these processes.

The literature does not provide information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides or a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides are described as being active in the depolymerisation of polyethylene into lower oligomers and diesel range hydrocarbons. The mechanism involves a β-alkyl transfer which is the microscopic reverse of the Cossee mechanism of olefin insertion into a metal alkyl bond. The literature does not detail the reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in the processes of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis for either catalyst. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides are described as being active in polyethylene depolymerisation, involving a mechanism that includes a beta-alkyl transfer elementary step.

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides, with the bis-hydride being more reactive towards CH4. These hydrides catalyze H/D exchange reactions in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium, which is very fast even at temperatures below room temperature. The reaction pathway is a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis, which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane. A direct one-step reaction pathway is highly disfavored.

The roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes are not explicitly discussed in the literature.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, it details the preparation of silica-supported zirconium hydrides by contacting molecular tetraalkyl complexes of zirconium with a partially dehydroxylated silica surface, resulting in a tris(siloxy)/mono(hydrido) structure. These catalysts exhibit high activity in olefin polymerization, hydrogenation, and isomerization, with rapid reaction rates even at low temperatures. The mechanism of C-H bond activation involves σ-bond metathesis, as evidenced by low activation energy and high negative entropy in H/D exchange reactions. Selectivity is towards the formation of multiply labeled methanes after CH3D builds up. The role of σ-bond metathesis is significant, providing a constrained transition state that minimizes steric interactions and avoids the formation of a ZrMe intermediate. H/D exchange rates between methane and hydrogen support the view of σ-bond metathesis, with low activation energy and high negative entropy. The activation energy for H2/D2 exchange is estimated to be about 2 kcal/mol. The literature does not provide information on the selectivity of the catalysts or the roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking in these processes.

The literature does not provide information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides or a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides are described as being active in the depolymerisation of polyethylene into lower oligomers and diesel range hydrocarbons. The mechanism involves a β-alkyl transfer which is the microscopic reverse of the Cossee mechanism of olefin insertion into a metal alkyl bond. The literature does not detail the reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in the processes of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis for either catalyst. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides are described as being active in polyethylene depolymerisation, involving a mechanism that includes a beta-alkyl transfer elementary step. No details are given on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of sigma-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking in these processes for either zirconium or thorium hydrides. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides are described as being active in polyethylene depolymerisation, involving a beta-alkyl transfer mechanism.

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides, with the bis-hydride being more reactive towards CH4. These hydrides catalyze H/D exchange reactions in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium, which is very fast even at temperatures below room temperature. The reaction pathway is a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis, which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane. A direct one-step reaction pathway is highly disfavored.

The literature does not provide a comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. It focuses on the activation of C-H bonds in cyclooctane and methane by a silica-supported tantalum hydride complex. The complex is able to activate the C-H bonds at low temperatures, forming tantalum-alkyl surface complexes. These complexes can be transformed into tantalum-alkoxy derivatives under molecular oxygen, which then react with acetic acid to form alkyl acetates. The high activity of the surface organometallic fragments in catalytic conditions is attributed to the high electrophilic character of the metals and their immobilization and isolation, which prevent dimerization or deactivation. The mechanism of C-H bond activation involves a σ-bond metathesis process, but an oxidative addition of the C-H bond followed by hydrogen elimination cannot be excluded. The complex activates the C-H and C-D bonds of cyclooctane and CD4, respectively, to form cyclooctyl and perdeuteriomethyl-tantalum surface complexes. The activation occurs at low temperatures, and the complex is believed to have a d0 configuration, similar to other early transition metal complexes reported to activate C-H bonds. The high reactivity is attributed to the electrophilic character of tantalum, which is formally an eight-electron species, and the immobilization and isolation of the tantalum centers on the silica surface, which prevents dimerization or deactivation. The supported tantalum-hydride complex activates cyclooctane and methane at room temperature to form the corresponding tantalum-alkyl surface species. These species can be transformed under molecular oxygen into tantalum-alkoxy derivatives, which with acetic acid give rise to the corresponding alkylacetates.

However, it does detail the catalytic properties of alumina-supported thorium hydrides, specifically Th(allyl)/DA, in alkane C-H activation and isomerization reactions. The turnover frequencies for these reactions are comparable to or exceed those of conventional group 9 heterogeneous alkane activation catalysts.
