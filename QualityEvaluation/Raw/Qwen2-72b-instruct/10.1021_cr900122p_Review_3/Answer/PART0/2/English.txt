Alumina-supported thorium hydrides catalyze H/D exchange reactions of a D2/alkane mixture. This reaction is fast, with rates of 800-1200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds. The incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cis-trans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism.
