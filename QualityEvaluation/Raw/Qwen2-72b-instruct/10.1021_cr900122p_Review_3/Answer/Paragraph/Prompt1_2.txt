It focuses on the activation of C-H bonds in cyclooctane and methane by a silica-supported tantalum hydride complex. The complex is able to activate the C-H bonds at low temperatures, forming tantalum-alkyl surface complexes. These complexes can be transformed into tantalum-alkoxy derivatives under molecular oxygen, which then react with acetic acid to form alkyl acetates. The high activity of the surface organometallic fragments in catalytic conditions is attributed to the high electrophilic character of the metals and their immobilization and isolation, which prevent dimerization or deactivation. The mechanism of C-H bond activation involves a σ-bond metathesis process, but an oxidative addition of the C-H bond followed by hydrogen elimination cannot be excluded. The complex activates the C-H and C-D bonds of cyclooctane and CD4, respectively, to form cyclooctyl and perdeuteriomethyl-tantalum surface complexes. The activation occurs at low temperatures, and the complex is believed to have a d0 configuration, similar to other early transition metal complexes reported to activate C-H bonds. The high reactivity is attributed to the electrophilic character of tantalum, which is formally an eight-electron species, and the immobilization and isolation of the tantalum centers on the silica surface, which prevents dimerization or deactivation. The supported tantalum-hydride complex activates cyclooctane and methane at room temperature to form the corresponding tantalum-alkyl surface species. These species can be transformed under molecular oxygen into tantalum-alkoxy derivatives, which with acetic acid give rise to the corresponding alkylacetates.

{"Quotes": "No quotes provided.", "English": "The literature does not provide a comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. It focuses on the activation of C-H bonds in cyclooctane and methane by a silica-supported tantalum hydride complex. The complex is able to activate the C-H bonds at low temperatures, forming tantalum-alkyl surface complexes. These complexes can be transformed into tantalum-alkoxy derivatives under molecular oxygen, which then react with acetic acid to form alkyl acetates. The high activity of the surface organometallic fragments in catalytic conditions is attributed to the high electrophilic character of the metals and their immobilization and isolation, which prevent dimerization or deactivation. The mechanism of C-H bond activation involves a σ-bond metathesis process, but an oxidative addition of the C-H bond followed by hydrogen elimination cannot be excluded. The complex activates the C-H and C-D bonds of cyclooctane and CD4, respectively, to form cyclooctyl and perdeuteriomethyl-tantalum surface complexes. The activation occurs at low temperatures, and the complex is believed to have a d0 configuration, similar to other early transition metal complexes reported to activate C-H bonds. The high reactivity is attributed to the electrophilic character of tantalum, which is formally an eight-electron species, and the immobilization and isolation of the tantalum centers on the silica surface, which prevents dimerization or deactivation. The supported tantalum-hydride complex activates cyclooctane and methane at room temperature to form the corresponding tantalum-alkyl surface species. These species can be transformed under molecular oxygen into tantalum-alkoxy derivatives, which with acetic acid give rise to the corresponding alkylacetates. The high activity of the complex in catalytic conditions is attributed to the high electrophilic character of tantalum, which is formally an eight-electron species, and the immobilization and isolation of the tantalum centers that prevent dimerization or deactivation.

However, it does detail the catalytic properties of alumina-supported thorium hydrides, specifically Th(allyl)/DA, in alkane C-H activation and isomerization reactions. The turnover frequencies for these reactions are comparable to or exceed those of conventional group 9 heterogeneous alkane activation catalysts. The selectivity of C-H functionalization does not parallel C-H bond dissociation energies, with primary > secondary > tertiary and sterically less hindered > sterically more hindered. The mechanism proposed for the activation and isomerization of alkanes involves Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic a-bond metathesis pathway, followed by deuterolysis. Cycloalkane skeletal isomerization occurs via a β-H elimination and readdition of the Th+-H to the opposite face of the double bond.

{"Quotes": "No quotes provided", "English": "The literature does not provide a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, it details the preparation of silica-supported zirconium hydrides by contacting molecular tetraalkyl complexes of zirconium with a partially dehydroxylated silica surface, resulting in a tris(siloxy)/mono(hydrido) structure. These catalysts exhibit high activity in olefin polymerization, hydrogenation, and isomerization, with rapid reaction rates even at low temperatures. The mechanism of C-H bond activation involves σ-bond metathesis, as evidenced by low activation energy and high negative entropy in H/D exchange reactions. Selectivity is towards the formation of multiply labeled methanes after CH3D builds up. The role of σ-bond metathesis is significant, providing a constrained transition state that minimizes steric interactions and avoids the formation of a ZrMe intermediate. H/D exchange rates between methane and hydrogen support the view of σ-bond metathesis, with low activation energy and high negative entropy. The activation energy for H2/D2 exchange is estimated to be about 2 kcal/mol.
