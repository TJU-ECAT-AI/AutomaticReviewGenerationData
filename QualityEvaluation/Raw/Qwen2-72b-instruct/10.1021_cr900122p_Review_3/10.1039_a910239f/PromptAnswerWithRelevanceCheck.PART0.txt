Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

1.No relevant quotes were found in the provided literature to compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The literature focuses on the silica-supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH and its catalytic properties in H/D exchange reactions between CH4 and CD4.

1. The literature does not provide information on the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, nor does it detail their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The document focuses on the silica supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH, which catalyses the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 at 150 C producing the statistical distribution of all methane isotopomers. The rate of the H/D exchange reaction is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than that of the alkane metathesis reaction. A mechanism in which the tantalum hydride species is the active intermediate in the catalytic cycle rather than the TaCH3 species is consistent with the experimental observations.

1. 文献没有提供关于硅胶支撑的锆氢化物和氧化铝支撑的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质的信息，也没有详细说明它们在H/D交换和烷基化反应中的机制。该文件主要关注硅胶支撑的钽氢化物(·SiO)2TaH，它在150 C下催化CH4和CD4之间的H/D交换反应，产生所有甲烷同位素的统计分布。H/D交换反应的速率大约是烷基化反应速率的两个数量级。一种机制，其中钽氢化物物种是催化循环中的活性中间体，而不是TaCH3物种，与实验观察一致。
