I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

(1) with a silica dehydroxylated at 500 "C produces a mixture of (=SiO)Ta(=CHC- (CH3)3)(CH2C(CH3)3)2 (2a) and (Wi0)2Ta(=CHC(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH3)3) (2b) and neopentane gas (on average 1.3 equiv/equiv of tantalum). The reaction of 2d2b with water produces 2.6 mol of neopentane. The reaction of 2d2b with acetone produces 1 equiv of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene per grafted tantalum, indicating that 2a,b each bear one carbene ligand. When 1 is reacted with fully (>90%) deuterated silica, the product neopentane is only 38% monodeuterated. The product of this reaction (2deut) is hydrolyzed with D20 to produce 2.6 equiv (per Ta) of neopentane as a mixture of neopentane-4, -dl, -d2, and -d3 (3.3:54.4:36.7:5.5). The presence of neopentane-d3 is evidence for the incorporation of deuterium into the tantalum surface complex during the synthesis of 2d2b. The volatile product of the reaction of with acetone is 1 equiv of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene which is 15% monodeuterated, demonstrating some incorporation of deuterium in the carbenic positions of &ut.
The isotopomeric distribution in the volatile products of these reactions is traced to a mechanism of formation of 2a,b in which the first reaction of surface silanol with 1 is the addition of 0-H across the Ta=C double bond.
Introduction Alkylidene complexes are generally considered to be the reactive intermediates in the metathesis of olefins and in the polymerization of alkynes.' The presence of alkylidene species in heterogeneous catalysts for these reactions has often been suggested but rarely confiied. Such species have been indicated by infrared spectroscopy2 and by chemical reactivity3 but the actual surface organometallic species have never been fully characterized.We report herein that the reaction of Ta(=CHC(CH&)- (CHzC(CH3)3)3 (1) with partially dehydroxylated silica produces a mixture of surface tantalum(V) alkylidene complexes formu- lated (SiO)xTa(=CHC(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH)3)3-x (x = 1,2) (2).The reaction of 1 with deuterated silica surface SiO-D silanols leads to partially deuterated 2. Detailed analyses of the isotopomeric distribution of reaction products are compared favorably to a mechanistic model which supposes that alkylidene complexes are formed by a mechanism of initial addition of surface silanol across the tantalum-carbon double bond of 1,producing a tetraalkyl tantalum siloxide intermediate which then can undergo an elimination of neopentane via a-hydride transfer to form a carbene complex. @Abstract published in Advance ACS Abstracts, April 1, 1995.

When the tantalum(V) alkylidene complex Ta[=CHC(CH,)3]- [CHzC(CH&]3 (1)4 was sublimed onto a disk of silica which has been dehydroxylated at 500 "C (Si02(500), 20 mg), the infrared spectrum (Figure 1) showed that the band attributed to linear silanol groups5 at 3747 cm-' (Figure la) disappeared totally and instantaneously on contact at room temperature with the tantalum alkylidene complex. At the same time, a group of bands appeared in the regions 3000-2800 and 1500-1300 cm-', which are attributed to v(C-H) and 6(C-H) vibrations of neopentyl andor neopentylidene groups. Excess 1 was removed under vacuum at 80 "C (Figure lb). The gaseous product of this reaction was identified as neopentane by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy. The simul- taneous decrease in the intensity of surface silanol bands and increase in the intensity of v(C-H) and 6(C-H) bands, together with the release of neopentane, suggest the formation of one or several chemisorbed organotantalum surface species, 2.
Characterization of 2: Elemental Analysis. Elemental analysis for tantalum of the silica disk described above was performed and confirmed the presence of tantalum in 2 (5.15% Ta). The reaction was reproduced on a larger scale (500 mg).
This allowed for transfer of the tantalum-bearing material under inert atmosphere and thus simultaneous tantalum and carbon analyses. The TdSiO2 material was found to contain 3.04% ( 4 )

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
