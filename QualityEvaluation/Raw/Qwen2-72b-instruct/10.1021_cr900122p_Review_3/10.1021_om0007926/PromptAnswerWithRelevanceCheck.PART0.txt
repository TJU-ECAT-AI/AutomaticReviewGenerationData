Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, it does detail the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. These catalysts are prepared by contacting molecular tetraalkyl complexes of zirconium with a partially dehydroxylated silica surface. The structure of the supported zirconium materials is consistent with a tris(siloxy)/mono(hydrido) structure. The catalytic properties of these materials include high activity in olefin polymerization, hydrogenation, and isomerization. The mechanism of C-H bond activation involves a σ-bond metathesis pathway, as evidenced by the low energy of activation and high negative entropy of activation for H/D exchange reactions between methane and hydrogen. The reaction rates are rapid, even at low temperatures, and the selectivity is towards the formation of multiply labeled methanes after CH3D builds up. The role of σ-bond metathesis is significant in these processes, as it provides a constrained transition state that minimizes potential steric interactions and avoids the formation of a ZrMe intermediate.

1.文献没有直接比较二氧化硅支撑的锆氢化物和氧化铝支撑的钍氢化物。但是，它确实详细描述了二氧化硅支撑的锆氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性能。这些催化剂是通过将锆的四烷基复合物与部分脱羟基的二氧化硅表面接触制备的。支撑的锆材料的结构与三(siloxy)/单(hydrido)结构一致。这些材料的催化性能包括在烯烃聚合、氢化和异构化中的高活性。C-H键活化的机制涉及σ-键变位途径，这从甲烷和氢气之间的H/D交换反应的低活化能和高负熵活化中得到证据。反应速率即使在低温下也很快，选择性是形成多重标记的甲烷，一旦CH3D积累起来。σ-键变位在这些过程中起着重要作用，因为它提供了一个受约束的过渡态，最小化了潜在的立体相互作用，并避免了ZrMe中间体的形成。

These catalysts are prepared by contacting molecular tetraalkyl complexes of zirconium with a partially dehydroxylated silica surface. The structure of the supported zirconium materials is consistent with a tris(siloxy)/mono(hydrido) structure. The catalysts are highly active in H/D exchange reactions, with H/D exchange between hydrogen and deuterium being rapid even at liquid nitrogen temperatures. The activation energy for H2/D2 exchange is estimated to be about 2 kcal/mol. The H/D exchange rates between methane and hydrogen support the view that these reactions proceed via σ-bond metathesis, with a low energy of activation and a high negative entropy of activation. The literature does not provide information on the selectivity of the catalysts or the roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking in these processes.

1.文献没有直接比较硅胶支撑的锆氢化物和氧化铝支撑的钍氢化物。但是，它确实详细描述了硅胶支撑的锆氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性能。这些催化剂是通过将锆的四烷基复合物与部分脱羟基的硅胶表面接触制备的。支撑的锆材料的结构与三（硅氧基）/单（氢化物）结构一致。催化剂在H/D交换反应中非常活跃，即使在液氮温度下，氢和氘之间的H/D交换也很快。H2/D2交换的活化能估计约为2 kcal/mol。甲烷和氢之间的H/D交换速率支持这些反应通过σ-键变位进行的观点，具有低的活化能和高的负熵。文献没有提供关于催化剂选择性的信息，也没有提供氢解和链行走在这类过程中的作用的信息。
