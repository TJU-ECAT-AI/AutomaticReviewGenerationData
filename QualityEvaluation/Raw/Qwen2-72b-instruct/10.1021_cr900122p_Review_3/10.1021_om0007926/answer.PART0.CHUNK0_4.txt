1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, it does detail the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. These catalysts are prepared by contacting molecular tetraalkyl complexes of zirconium with a partially dehydroxylated silica surface. The structure of the supported zirconium materials is consistent with a tris(siloxy)/mono(hydrido) structure. The catalytic properties of these materials include high activity in olefin polymerization, hydrogenation, and isomerization. The mechanism of C-H bond activation involves a σ-bond metathesis pathway, as evidenced by the low energy of activation and high negative entropy of activation in H/D exchange reactions. The reaction rates are rapid, even at low temperatures, and the selectivity is towards the formation of multiply labeled methanes. The role of σ-bond metathesis in these processes is significant, as it provides a constrained transition state that facilitates the exchange of hydrogen atoms between the catalyst and the substrate. The literature does not provide information on the roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking in these processes.

1.文献没有直接比较硅胶支撑的锆氢化物和氧化铝支撑的钍氢化物。但是，它确实详细描述了硅胶支撑的锆氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质。这些催化剂是通过将锆的四烷基复合物与部分脱羟基的硅胶表面接触制备的。支撑的锆材料的结构与三(siloxy)/单(hydrido)结构一致。这些材料的催化性质包括在烯烃聚合、氢化和异构化中的高活性。C-H键活化机制涉及σ-键变位途径，如H/D交换反应中低的活化能和高的负熵活化所证明的。反应速率即使在低温下也很快，选择性倾向于形成多重标记的甲烷。σ-键变位在这些过程中的作用是显著的，因为它提供了一个受约束的过渡态，促进了催化剂和底物之间的氢原子交换。文献没有提供关于这些过程中氢解和链行走作用的信息。
