The recent surge in shale gas production has significantly impacted the economics of natural gas, making it more competitive than crude oil \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. This economic shift has bolstered the viability of alternative olefin production methods, such as dehydrogenation and MTO, relative to traditional processes like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. Advanced CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) and PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts have been pivotal in this development, enabling continuous operation of dehydrogenation reactions for several years \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still present challenges, necessitating improvements in noble metal loading, catalyst stability, and energy efficiency \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. Alternative catalysts, while promising, suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and irrecoverable activity post-regeneration \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which lacks the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative methods, holds potential but requires the identification of suitable catalysts and oxidizing agents \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. The development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system hinges on finding the optimal combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. Cofeeding CO2, while potentially beneficial, may also lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. Solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, offer a promising alternative for selectively oxidizing hydrogen in the SHC reaction \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. Membrane introduction to the reactor system can remove hydrogen, shifting the equilibrium toward olefin production \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. Catalyst deactivation, exacerbated by coke deposition when hydrogen partial pressure decreases, remains a significant challenge \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. The interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration is critical in industrial settings \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. Operando spectroscopy is anticipated to enhance process control sophistication in the near future \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. UVvis spectroscopy can monitor long-term irreversible catalyst deactivation \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. The demand for olefins, driven by their widespread use as feedstock in the chemical industry, is expected to remain high \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. The announcement of numerous new PDH projects in recent years, utilizing advanced CrOx/Al2O3 or PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, underscores the industry's commitment to continuous operation for several years \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. The reactions, however, face limitations such as limited equilibrium conversion and side reactions at high temperatures \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. Alternative catalysts, including GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have been explored but have not yet become practical alternatives due to rapid deactivation and irrecoverable activity after regeneration \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\]. Addressing these issues will require further research \[10.1021/cr5002436_7\].
                ※※※
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in dehydrogenation technologies, particularly the development of CrOx/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, have significantly enhanced the industrial viability of olefin production. However, the field is not without challenges, including the need for improved catalyst stability, reduced noble metal loading, and enhanced energy efficiency. The exploration of oxidative dehydrogenation, while promising, necessitates the discovery of suitable catalysts and oxidizing agents that can overcome thermodynamic limitations. Solid oxygen carriers and membrane introduction offer innovative solutions for hydrogen removal and equilibrium shifting. The future of dehydrogenation technologies will likely involve the integration of advanced spectroscopy techniques for real-time process monitoring and control. Addressing catalyst deactivation and regeneration, particularly in the context of coke deposition, will be crucial for sustained industrial operation. The ongoing demand for olefins, coupled with the limitations of current technologies, presents an opportunity for the development of novel catalysts and process improvements. Future research should focus on the optimization of existing systems, the exploration of alternative catalysts, and the integration of advanced monitoring and control technologies to enhance efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability.
