          [1] "the recent surge in shale gas production has rendered the cost of natural gas very economical as compared to that of crude oil. Therefore, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."
          [2] "The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts. These catalysts and technologies have been advanced to a point where the reaction can be run continuously for several years."
          [3] "current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
          [4] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
          [6] "finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
          [7] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [8] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
          [9] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system."
          [10] "catalyst deactivation represents an additional challenge, as coke deposition increases when the hydrogen partial pressure drops."
          [11] "It is very important to heed the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration in industrial settings."
          [12] "operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control."
          [13] "UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor the long-term irreversible deactivation of the catalyst."
          [14] "Because of their widespread use as feedstock in the chemical industry, the demand for olefins is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future."
          [15] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years."
          [16] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
          [17] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [18] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."

          The surge in shale gas production has made natural gas more economically viable than crude oil, leading to the competitiveness of alternative olefin production methods like dehydrogenation and MTO compared to traditional methods such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. CrOx/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts have been developed to a point where dehydrogenation reactions can run continuously for several years. Current dehydrogenation technologies need improvement in noble metal loading, catalyst stability, and energy efficiency. Alternative catalysts deactivate too quickly due to coke deposition and the inability to fully recover activity through regeneration. Oxidative dehydrogenation avoids thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative methods, but requires finding the right catalyst and oxidizing agent. Developing an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system depends on finding the right combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent. Cofeeding CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction. Solid oxygen carriers offer an alternative solution for selectively oxidizing hydrogen in the SHC reaction. Membranes can be introduced to the reactor system to remove hydrogen and shift the equilibrium toward olefin production. Catalyst deactivation is a challenge as coke deposition increases when hydrogen partial pressure drops. Careful attention to the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration is crucial in industrial settings. Operando spectroscopy is expected to provide more sophisticated process control in the near future. UVvis spectroscopy can monitor long-term irreversible catalyst deactivation. The demand for olefins is expected to remain high due to their widespread use as feedstock in the chemical industry. Dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in recent years, utilizing advanced CrOx/Al2O3 or PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts that allow continuous operation for several years. The reactions face challenges such as limited equilibrium conversion and side reactions at high temperatures. Alternative catalysts like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx have been explored but have not yet become practical alternatives due to rapid deactivation and irrecoverable activity after regeneration. Further research is needed to address these issues.

          页岩气产量的激增使得天然气在经济上比原油更具竞争力，这使得脱氢和MTO等替代的烯烃生产方法与传统的流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂解方法相比更具竞争力。CrOx/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂已经发展到脱氢反应可以连续运行数年的程度。当前的脱氢技术在贵金属负载、催化剂稳定性和脱氢过程的能源效率方面仍有改进空间。替代催化剂由于焦炭沉积和无法通过再生步骤完全恢复活性而过快失活。氧化脱氢避免了非氧化脱氢方法的热力学限制，但需要找到合适的催化剂和氧化剂。开发有效的氧化脱氢系统取决于找到正确的催化剂材料和氧化剂的组合。二氧化碳共馈可能会导致额外的焦炭沉积，这是由于逆向水煤气变换反应。固体氧载体，如CeO2、SbO4、In2O3、WO3、PbOx、Tl2O3和BiO3，为选择性氧化SHC反应中产生的氢提供了一种替代解决方案。可以通过向反应器系统引入膜来去除反应混合物中的氢气。催化剂失活是一个挑战，因为当氢气分压下降时，焦炭沉积会增加。在工业环境中，仔细关注催化剂失活和再生之间的相互作用至关重要。近期报告表明，原位光谱学将在不久的将来提供更复杂的工艺控制手段。UVvis光谱法可以监测催化剂的长期不可逆失活。由于页岩气产量的激增，天然气与原油相比变得更加经济，这使得获得烯烃的替代方法，如脱氢和MTO，相对于传统的流体催化裂化和蒸汽裂解方法更具竞争力。这导致近年来宣布了数十个新的PDH项目，这些项目将使用CrOx/Al2O3或PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。这些技术已经发展到可以连续运行数年。然而，脱氢技术仍有改进空间，包括降低贵金属负载、提高催化剂稳定性以及提高脱氢过程的能源效率的需求。反应存在局限性，如有限的平衡转化率和高温下的副反应。尽管金属氧化物如GaOx、MoOx和VOx等替代催化剂在过去几十年中受到了广泛关注，但尚未开发出PtSn和CrOx系统的实用替代品。事实上，这些替代配方失活速度过快，主要是由于焦炭沉积，以及它们的活性无法通过再生步骤完全恢复。
