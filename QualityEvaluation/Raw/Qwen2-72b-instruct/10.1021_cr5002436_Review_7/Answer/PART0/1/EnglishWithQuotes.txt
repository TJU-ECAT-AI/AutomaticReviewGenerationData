CrOx/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts have been developed to a point where dehydrogenation reactions can run continuously for several years. Current dehydrogenation technologies need improvement in noble metal loading, catalyst stability, and energy efficiency. Alternative catalysts deactivate too quickly due to coke deposition and the inability to fully recover activity through regeneration. Oxidative dehydrogenation avoids thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative methods, but requires finding the right catalyst and oxidizing agent. Developing an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system depends on finding the right combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent. Cofeeding CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction. Solid oxygen carriers offer an alternative solution for selectively oxidizing hydrogen in the SHC reaction. Membranes can be introduced to the reactor system to remove hydrogen and shift the equilibrium toward olefin production. Catalyst deactivation is a challenge as coke deposition increases when hydrogen partial pressure drops. Careful attention to the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration is crucial in industrial settings. Operando spectroscopy is expected to provide more sophisticated process control in the near future. UVvis spectroscopy can monitor long-term irreversible catalyst deactivation. The demand for olefins is expected to remain high due to their widespread use as feedstock in the chemical industry. Dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in recent years, utilizing advanced CrOx/Al2O3 or PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts that allow continuous operation for several years. The reactions face challenges such as limited equilibrium conversion and side reactions at high temperatures. Alternative catalysts like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx have been explored but have not yet become practical alternatives due to rapid deactivation and irrecoverable activity after regeneration. Further research is needed to address these issues.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436_7"},
