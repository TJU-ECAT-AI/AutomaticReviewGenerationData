[1] "Because of their widespread use as feedstock in the chemical industry, the demand for olefins is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the recent surge in shale gas production has rendered the cost of natural gas very economical as compared to that of crude oil. Therefore, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."
[2] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts. These catalysts and technologies have been advanced to a point where the reaction can be run continuously for several years."
[3] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
[4] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
[5] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[6] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[7] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."

1.The surge in shale gas production has made natural gas more economically viable than crude oil, leading to the competitiveness of alternative olefin production methods like dehydrogenation and MTO compared to traditional methods. Dozens of new PDH projects have been announced, utilizing advanced CrOx/Al2O3 or PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts that allow continuous operation for several years. However, current technologies need improvement in noble metal loading, catalyst stability, and energy efficiency. The reactions face challenges such as limited equilibrium conversion and side reactions at high temperatures. Alternative catalysts like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx have been explored but have not yet become practical alternatives due to rapid deactivation and irrecoverable activity after regeneration. Further research is needed to address these issues.

1.页岩气产量的激增使得天然气在经济上比原油更具竞争力，这使得脱氢和MTO等替代的烯烃生产方法与传统的流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂解方法相比更具竞争力。已经宣布了数十个新的PDH项目，利用先进的CrOx/Al2O3或PtSn/Al2O3催化剂，这些催化剂可以连续运行数年。然而，当前的技术需要在贵金属负载、催化剂稳定性和脱氢过程的能源效率方面进行改进。反应面临有限的平衡转化率和高温下副反应的普遍存在的挑战。尽管在过去几十年中，诸如GaOx、MoOx和VOx等金属氧化物等替代催化剂受到了广泛关注，但尚未开发出实用的PtSn和CrOx系统的替代品。事实上，这些替代配方失活速度过快，主要是由于焦炭沉积，以及它们的活性无法通过再生步骤完全恢复。因此，需要进一步的研究来解决这些问题。
