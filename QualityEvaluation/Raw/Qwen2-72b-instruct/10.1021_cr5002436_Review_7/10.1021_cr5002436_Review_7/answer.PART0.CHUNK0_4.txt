[1] "Because of their widespread use as feedstock in the chemical industry, the demand for olefins is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the recent surge in shale gas production has rendered the cost of natural gas very economical as compared to that of crude oil. Therefore, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."
[2] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts."
[3] "These catalysts and technologies have been advanced to a point where the reaction can be run continuously for several years. Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
[4] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
[5] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[6] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[7] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."

1.The surge in shale gas production has made natural gas more economical compared to crude oil, leading to the competitiveness of alternative methods for obtaining olefins, such as dehydrogenation and MTO, over traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. This has resulted in the announcement of dozens of new PDH projects in recent years, which will use either CrOx/Al2O3 or PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. These technologies have advanced to allow continuous operation for several years. However, there is still room for improvement in dehydrogenation technologies, including the need to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve energy efficiency. The reactions have limitations such as limited equilibrium conversion and side reactions at high temperatures. Alternative catalysts like metal oxides have been studied, but none have yet become a practical alternative to PtSn and CrOx systems due to issues with fast deactivation and inability to fully recover activity through regeneration.

1.由于页岩气产量的激增，天然气与原油相比变得更加经济，这使得获得烯烃的替代方法，如脱氢和MTO，相对于传统的流体催化裂化和蒸汽裂解方法更具竞争力。这导致近年来宣布了数十个新的PDH项目，这些项目将使用CrOx/Al2O3或PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。这些技术已经发展到可以连续运行数年。然而，脱氢技术仍有改进空间，包括降低贵金属负载、提高催化剂稳定性以及提高脱氢过程的能源效率的需求。反应存在局限性，如有限的平衡转化率和高温下的副反应。尽管金属氧化物如GaOx、MoOx和VOx等替代催化剂在过去几十年中受到了广泛关注，但尚未开发出PtSn和CrOx系统的实用替代品。事实上，这些替代配方失活速度过快，主要是由于焦炭沉积，以及它们的活性无法通过再生步骤完全恢复。
