<quotes>

[1] "the recent surge in shale gas production has rendered the cost of natural gas very economical as compared to that of crude oil. Therefore, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."
[2] "The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts. These catalysts and technologies have been advanced to a point where the reaction can be run continuously for several years."
[3] "current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
[4] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[6] "finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
[7] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
[8] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
[9] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system."
[10] "catalyst deactivation represents an additional challenge, as coke deposition increases when the hydrogen partial pressure drops."
[11] "It is very important to heed the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration in industrial settings."
[12] "operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control."
[13] "UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor the long-term irreversible deactivation of the catalyst."

1.The surge in shale gas production has made natural gas more economically viable than crude oil, leading to the competitiveness of alternative olefin production methods like dehydrogenation and MTO compared to traditional methods. Dozens of new PDH projects have been announced, utilizing advanced CrOx/Al2O3 or PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts that allow continuous operation for several years. However, current technologies need improvement in noble metal loading, catalyst stability, and energy efficiency. The reactions face challenges such as limited equilibrium conversion and side reactions at high temperatures. Alternative catalysts like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx have been explored but have not yet become practical alternatives due to rapid deactivation and irrecoverable activity after regeneration. Further research is needed to address these issues.
