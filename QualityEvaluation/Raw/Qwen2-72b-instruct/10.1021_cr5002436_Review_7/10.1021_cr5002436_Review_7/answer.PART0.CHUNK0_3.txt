[1] "Because of their widespread use as feedstock in the chemical industry, the demand for olefins is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the recent surge in shale gas production has rendered the cost of natural gas very economical as compared to that of crude oil. Therefore, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."
[2] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts. These catalysts and technologies have been advanced to a point where the reaction can be run continuously for several years."
[3] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
[4] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
[5] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[6] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[7] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."

1.The surge in shale gas production has made natural gas more economically viable than crude oil, leading to the competitiveness of alternative olefin production methods like dehydrogenation and MTO compared to traditional methods such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. This has resulted in the announcement of numerous new PDH projects in recent years, which will use either CrOx/Al2O3 or PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, technologies that have advanced to allow continuous operation for several years. However, current dehydrogenation technologies require improvement in noble metal loading, catalyst stability, and energy efficiency. The reactions face challenges such as limited equilibrium conversion and side reactions at high temperatures. Despite attention to alternative catalysts like metal oxides, no practicable alternative to PtSn and CrOx systems has been developed due to issues with fast deactivation and inability to fully recover activity through regeneration.

1.由于页岩气产量的激增，天然气的成本与原油相比变得非常经济，这使得像脱氢和MTO这样的替代烯烃生产方法与流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂解等传统方法相比更具竞争力。这导致近年来宣布了大量新的PDH项目，这些项目将使用CrOx/Al2O3或PtSn/Al2O3催化剂，这些技术和催化剂已经发展到可以连续运行数年的程度。然而，当前的脱氢技术在贵金属负载、催化剂稳定性和脱氢过程的能源效率方面仍有改进空间。反应面临有限的平衡转化率和高温下副反应普遍存在的挑战。尽管金属氧化物如GaOx、MoOx和VOx等替代催化剂在过去几十年中受到了广泛关注，但尚未开发出PtSn和CrOx系统的实用替代品，因为这些替代配方失活过快，主要是由于焦炭沉积，以及它们的活性无法通过再生步骤完全恢复。
