At 540C, atmospheric pressure and WHSV of 2 h1, initial microreactor propylene yields from neat propane are 48.2% at about 90% selectivity, compared to equilibrium olefin yields of 20.0% at about 95% selectivity when only the DH catalyst is used. The overall propylene yield improvement is 140%. In this novel redox process arrangement no gaseous oxygen is cofed to the physical mixture; the lattice oxygen of the SHC catalyst is the sole oxidizing agent to selectively combust the hydrogen produced in situ by the dehydrogenation of the propane, catalyzed by the commingled DH catalyst. Periodic regeneration with air is necessary to replenish the lattice oxygen of the SHC catalyst depleted in the redox reaction.
Although still significantly (i.e., 65%) above equlibrium, the high initial DH + SHC propylene yields are not sustainable and decline from 48.2% (first cycle) to 33.0% (tenth cycle); i.e., 2.1%/cycle; they are ascribed to the loss of Bi2O3 dispersion on the SiO2 support caused by the deep redox cycling. Shortening the redox cycle or increasing the SHC/DH catalyst ratio lessen the decline. However, the identification of a more redox stable catalyst is imperative to make the process practical. Some suggestions are provided. It is surmised that the DH + SHC redox process approach will ultimately (i.e., once a sufficiently redox stable SHC catalyst is identified) be preferred over the DH- > SHC- > DH cofed approach to improve conventional dehydrogenation processes such as the Oleflex and Catofin processes. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

A more novel alternative approach to DH- > SHC- > DH cofed process operation [4] is a so called DH + SHC redox process [3]. In this configuration,the DH and SHC catalysts are physically mixed and the lattice oxygen [OL] of the SHC catalyst is the sole oxidizing agent to selectively combust the in situ formed hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation of the paraffin which is catalyzed by the commingled DH component. Recently, a series of metal oxides have been identified, e.g., Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12, In2O3, In2Mo3O12 and Sb2O4 that convert hydrogen in great preference to light paraffins or olefins, with SHC se- lectivites in excess of 98% [3,4]. They function either in the presence or absence of gaseous oxygen [3] and are therefore, also suitable for DH + SHC redox process operation discussed here.
The key to the functioning of these selected Bi-, In- and Sb-containing oxides in a DH + SHC redox process is the relatively large amount of lattice oxy- gen contained in these metal oxides, and the ease and enormous preference with which their lattice oxygen reacts with hydrogen rather than hydrocarbons [3].
This behavior contrasts that of the noble metal based SHC catalysts used by Imai et al. [1] or the pore- mouth restricted Si(Cu, Fe, Ni)HZSM-5 compositions used by Lin et al. [2]. While both of these latter systems are suited for DH- > SHC- > DH cofed op- eration, they are inoperative for DH + SHC redox operation. The reason is that the noble metal based catalysts possess essentially no usable lattice oxygen while the zeolite-based catalysts contain only a very small amount of reducible lattice oxygen per unit weight of catalyst.
Although the DH + SHC redox process is cyclic in nature while the HD- > SHC- >DH cofed process is continuous; there are several advantages to the redox mode of operation. In the cofed process, hydrogen and gaseous oxygen must be handled in a single reactor (SHC reactor) which poses a potential safety hazard.
The use of oxygen is preferred over air in the cofed process because if air were to be used as the oxidant in the SHC stage(s), the process stream would become highly diluted with nitrogen, making the staging and separation unduly costly. Quite to the contrary, hydro- gen and gaseous oxygen are never cofed or co-reacted in the redox process, posing no safety hazard. Another advantage of the redox mode is that air instead of oxy- gen can be used in the regeneration cycle, which is much less expensive and easier to handle than gaseous oxygen.
The DH + SHC redox process study reported here for the conversion of propane to propylene was per- formed on a microreactor scale with a physical mix- ture of a 0.7 wt.% PtSn-ZSM-5 DH catalyst and a 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2 SHC catalyst.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts
A 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2 composition employed in this study as the SHC catalyst was prepared as discussed earlier [3,4] and was sized to 2040 mesh before use in catalytic evaluations. A 0.7 wt.% PtSn-ZSM-5 DH catalyst used here was the same as that of a complimentary study [4] and was prepared according to known procedures [5].
2.2. Experimental setup and procedures
The experimental setup for the DH and DH + SHC redox experiments was an automated microreactor unit described earlier [3].
The
DH
experiments were carried out with a 50/50 wt.% physical mixture of a
0.7 wt.%
PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst and quartz; the DH + SHC re- dox experiments with a 50/50 wt.% physical mixture of the same 0.7 wt.% PtSn-ZSM-5 DH catalyst and a 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2 catalyst.
Two sets of DH + SHC redox experiments were carried out. In the first set, four 130 min redox cy- cles were performed, followed by regeneration with air. The experimental conditions were 550C, atm press, WHSV 2 h1 and neat propane as feed. Within each redox cycle, six consecutive gas samples were taken for analysis. The first sample was taken by collecting the entire effluent in an evacuated gas bulb over the initial 5 min of the experiment and with an aliquot therefrom being analyzed by GC (Hewlett Packard). Subsequent samples were taken at 25 min time intervals; again collecting the entire effluent over respective 5 min time spans. The hydrocarbon flow was stopped after 130 min on stream and the catalyst mixture flushed with 200 cc/mm helium for
R.K. Grasselli et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 189 (1999) 914
11 5 min, followed by regeneration in O2/He for 15 min before propane feed was reintroduced and another redox cycle started. The regeneration conditions were relatively mild by flowing a 2% O2 in He stream at 350C over the catalyst mixture for the first 5 min,increasing the O2 concentration of the gas stream at a rate of 5%/min over the next 10 min until an O2 level of 21% was reached. The aim was to minimize the exotherm, and to avoid Pt agglomeration in the zeolite of the DH catalyst.
In a second set of experiments, the redox period between regenerations was shortened from 130 to
2.8 min. The intent was to less deeply reduce the
SHC catalyst, minimizing its restructuring. The gas sampling was performed as in the first set, except that the time collection of respective effluent samples in a pre-evacuated gas bulb prior to GC analysis amounted to 2.8 min rather than 5 min. The experimental condi- tions were the same as in the first set, except that the temperature was lowered to 540C.
The cabon balances in both sets of experiments were typically 100 + /2%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. DH experiments
The DH experiments using a 0.7 wt.% PtSn-ZSM-5 DH catalyst diluted with 50 wt.% quartz were carried out in a microreactor at 540C, atmospheric pressure,neat propane as feed and at space velocities (WHSV) of 1, 2, and 4 (g C3/g cat/h). The hydrogenation reaction was carried out over a period of 130 min,with periodic sampling and analysis of the effluent,followed by an artificial air (i.e., O2/He) regeneration for 15 min as indicated in Section 2. At WHSV = 1 and 2 h1 the propane conversions are stable over the course of the four cycles tested and are 23.5% and
22.5%, respectively, the corresponding selectivities
to propylene are 97% and 98%, respectively. The carbon balances are 100+/2%. Due to the relative constancy of the propane conversions and propylene yields, it was assumed that equilibrium was achieved under either condition. The propane conversion be- gins to decrease (by about 1.5% absolute) at WHSV= 4 h1, although the propylene selectivity remains high at about 98%. Due to the indicated activity decline at the higher WHSV, the intermediate WHSV = 2 h1 was chosen to be representative of equilibrium DH and is illustrated as the base line over four 130 min cycles in Fig. 2.
3.2. DH+SHC redox experiments
In the DH + SHC redox process mode, the DH and SHC catalysts are physically intimately mixed in a single reactor (Fig. 1) and the lattice oxygen [O]L of SHC catalyst is the sole oxidant for the combustion of the in situ produced hydrogen coming from the de- hydrogenation reaction of the paraffin, catalyzed by the DH component. As the lattice oxygen of the SHC catalyst becomes depleted in the redox cycle, it must be replenished by gaseous oxygen in a subsequent re- oxidation step. Thereafter, a new redox cycle can be started again. Because of the high selectivity and ac- tivity requirements of the lattice oxygen for preferen- tial conversion of hydrogen over hydrocarbons in the redox process operation, only a limited number of cat- alysts meet these demands [3]. Bi2O3 is one of them.
In a first set of DH + SHC redox experiments the physically mixed PtSn-ZSM-5 + Bi2O3/SiO2 cata- lysts (1/1 weight ratio) were tested at 550C, atm pressure, WHSV 2 h1 and neat propane as feed. The propylene yields are shown in Fig. 2, and are com- pared to the yield base line of the above discussed dehydrogenation only. The propylene yield for the mixed (DH + SHC) catalyst system over the initial Fig. 1. Schematic of DH + SHC redox process mode operation.

Fig. 2. Comparison of DH and DH + SHC redox mode opera- tions. C3= yield vs. time on stream and redox cycle. Feed: neat propane, temperature = 550C, pressure = atm, WHSV = 2 h1, cy- cle time=130 min. 5 min of feed flow is 44.4% and hence significantly higher than the 19.2% yield obtained under campa- rable conditions with the DH catalyst system alone.
It is a 130% yield improvement over equilibrium. At longer times on stream the propylene yield declines and converges to equilibrium values which is entirely expected, because the lattice oxygen of the SHC cat- alyst is spent and the SHC catalyst ceases to function until it is again re-oxidized.
The results reveal that Bi2O3 acts as an effective SHC catalyst in the absence of gaseous oxygen and in the presence of a DH catalyst, as long as it has still some available lattice oxygen. Under the condi- tions of the experiment, 17 cc C3/g cat/min (WHSV 2 h1) were fed to the reactor over the time span of 5 min, the period over which the first sample was col- lected. If the DH + SHC redox reactor were to perform as an infinite series of perfectly selective DH- > SHC stages, then in this idealized case all of the propane would be converted by the DH catalyst to propylene and all of the hydrogen by the SHC catalyst to wa- ter. Under such idealized conditions the DH catalyst would generate 85 cc or 3.8 mmole hydrogen during the 5 min of the reaction. To combust this H2O would require the equivalent of 3.8 mg atom lattice oxygen [O]L/g cat/5 min. Since each gram of Bi2O3/SiO2 cat- alyst contains the equivalent of 2.7 mg atom [O]L,there is at best only enough lattice oxygen available to com- bust 2.7/3.8 or 71% of the hydrogen produced by the DH catalyst. If any of the lattice oxygen of the SHC catalyst were to be used to also produce COx from the hydrocarbons, the maximum attainable propylene yield would be less than 71%. If a 98% preferential se- lectivity for H2 over propane combustion is assumed for Bi2O3 (i.e., a value found earlier for the redox re- action in the absence of a DH catalyst [3]), the hy- drocarbon combustion would require an equivalent of about 0.8 mg atom [O]L, thereby lowering the pos- sible propane conversion to 2.70.8/3.8 or to about 50%. (Note: To produce CO2 and H2O from propane requires 10 [O]L as compared to 1[O]L to convert H2 to H2O). In good agreement with these simple stoi- chiometric considerations is the experimentally found propane conversion of 49.5%. Since in addition to COx there are also some cracked by-products formed,the propylene yield observed is not the thus expected
48.5% (i.e., if [O]L selectivity for H2 were 98%), but
still a very reasonably close value of 44.4%. Thus, the material balance closure of these experiments is very good, confirming that Bi2O3 is a good and selective SHC catalyst.
It is obvious, that the duration of the 130 min re- dox cycle is long for the highly reactive Bi2O3, since all of its lattice oxygen is already consumed within,or even prior to, the termination of the first sampling (i.e., within or before the initial 5 min). When avail- able lattice oxygen is lacking in the SHC catalyst, the DH + SHC system begins to operate simply as a con- ventional DH system and the olefin production reverts to equilibrium values of about 1920% propylene (see Fig. 2). Under these rather severe reduction conditions,the Bi2O3 catalyst begins to age by loss of Bi2O3 dis- persion on the SiO2 support, impairing the subsequent reoxidation process of the reduced catalyst. Therefore,the propane conversions and propylene yields decline with cycle number as seen from the initial (5 min) sam- plings of consecutive cycles (Fig. 2). The initial propy- lene yield of 44.7% (first cycle) declines to 31.5% (fourth cycle); a decline of approximately 3.2%/cy- cle. Nonetheless, even under these harsh experimental conditions the observed olefin yield increase after four redox cycles using a physically mixed DH + SHC cat- alyst system is still about 50% above the equilibrium yield attained by the DH catalyst alone.
In a second set of DH + SHC redox experiments (Fig. 3) the redox cycle time was substantially short- ened to last only 2.8 min, instead of the 130 min used

Initial C3= yields. Feed: neat propane, temperature = 540C, pres- sure=atm, WHSV=2 h1, duration of runs = 2.8 min. in the first set of experiments. The experimental con- ditions were 540C, atm pressure, WHSV 2 h1 and neat propane as feed. The effluent sampling was done over the entire 2.8 min of each respective redox cycle and with air regeneration between the cycles as de- scribed in Section 2.
The duration of the redox experiments is shortened to the point that only 80% of the available lattice oxy- gen of the Bi2O3 catalyst should be consumed if only the in situ formed hydrogen were extracting the lattice oxygen of the SHC catalyst (i.e., the C3 feed/[O]L ra- tio was set at 0.8). However, since the independently measured SHC selectivity of this catalyst is about 98% [3], with the remainder of the lattice oxygen going to produce COx, essentially all the available lattice oxy- gen of the Bi2O3 would still be consumed in 2.8 min of the experiment.
The results shown in Fig. 3 reveal that an initial propane conversion of 59.9% and a propylene yield of
48.2% are obtained under DH + SHC redox conditions
using the physical mixture of 0.7 wt.% PtSn-ZSM-5 and 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2. This compares favorably with a 27.5% propane conversion and a 20% propy- lene yield when only the PtSn-ZSM-5 DH catalyst is used. Hence, the propylene yield increase is 140% for the first cycle of operation. Based on thermodynamic calculations [4], the 48.2% propylene yield is equiv- alent to that expected from about 22.5 theoretical,sequential DH- > SHC- > DH stages, demonstrating a rather good overall efficiency of the physical mixture.
Fig. 4. Comparison of DH and DH + SHC redox mode opera- tions. C3conversion and C3= yield vs. redox cycle. Feed: neat propane, temperature = 540C, pressure=atm, WHSV=2 h1 cycle time=2.8 min.
Unfortunately, this initial favourable performance begins to decline with cycle time. Over the period of 10 consecutive redox cycles, the propylene yield de- creases from 48.2% (1st cycle) to 33.0% (10th cycle) (Fig. 4), a decrease of about 2.2%/cycle. Nonetheless,the propylene yield remains over the entire 10 cycles of operation well (i.e., at least 65%) above equilibrium.
The reduction of the Bi2O3 is still too severe to en- tirely halt some irreversible restructuring and thereby loss of active phase dispersion on the SiO2 catalyst support. Although the activity of the Bi2O3/SiO2 system declines, the selectivity remains essentially unimpaired. While the redox cycles could be still fur- ther shortened to further curtail the activity decline,it becomes a matter of diminishing returns. A better approach would be to increase the SHC/DH catalyst ratio or to slow down the release of the lattice oxy- gen of Bi2O3 by chemical means (e.g., doping). In sum, a more rugged SHC catalyst must be found for the DH + SHC redox operation to become a practical reality.
4. Conclusions
A physical mixture of equal weights of a 0.7 wt.% PtSn-ZSM-5 DH catalyst and a 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2 SHC catalyst, when operated in a DH + SHC redox 14

process mode, gave propylene yields from propane in excess of equilibrium. In this process arrangement, no gaseous oxygen is co-fed to the physical mixture of catalysts during the redox process. The sole oxidizing agent for the selective conversion of the in situ gen- erated hydrogen is the lattice oxygen of the SHC cat- alyst. The SHC catalyst which is reduced during the redox process must be periodically reoxidized with air.
In this microreactor scale study, propylene yields from neat propane as high as 48.2% were obtained at 540C, atm pressure and WHSV 2 h1 in the ini- tial stages of the experiment, comprising a 140% yield improvement above the 20.0% equilibrium yield ob- tained when the DH catalyst was used alone.
Although the olefin yields remain well above equi- librium value (i.e., >65% higher), they unfortunately decline from the initial 48.2% to 33.0% after 10 redox cycles (ie., 2.1%/cycle). The decline, ascribed to the loss of Bi2O3 dispersion on the SiO2 support caused by the deep reduction cycling is too large for the process to be practical as it stands, using the catalysts employed. Therefore, a more rugged SHC catalyst composition must be identified to make the process practical. Possible candidates for this purpose are solids exhibiting excellent reversibility of lattice oxy- gen removal and re-incorporation after severe reduc- tion used in (amm)oxidation reactions and comprise several Bi-based complex mixed metal molybdates and their analogous tungstates and phosphates. Such catalysts are extremely insensitive to restructuring in (amm)oxidation reactions even under the most severe reducing conditions [6]. They might prove to be also useful as SHC catalysts.
Finally, it is surmised that the novel DH + SHC redox process approach discussed in this study will ultimately (i.e., once a sufficiently redox stable SHC catalyst is identified) be preferred over the older DH- > SHC- > DH cofed approach [1,2,4] to improve conventional dehydrogenation processes such as the Oleflex and Catofin processes.
