Abstract
Single-atom catalysts (SACs) and single-cluster catalysts (SCCs) are the new frontier of heterogeneous catalysis, which exhibit high activity, selectivity, stability, and atomic efficiency as well as precise tunability. However, the lack of efficient methods for producing high-loading and high-purity SACs and SCCs hinders their industrial applications. In this work, we propose a general and efficient strategy for the production of high-loading and high-purity SACs and SCCs anchored on suitable substrates. Our strategy relies on the existence of an electrochemical potential window (EcPW) we predict within which any aggregate forms of the target metal on the substrate are leached away by electrochemical oxidation, while the strongly bound single atoms or single clusters remain at the substrate. We demonstrate the applicability of this strategy with modeling the production of Pt, Pd, and Ni SACs anchored on N-doped graphene and Fe2O3 as well as Pt3 and Ni3 SCCs anchored on graphdiyne.

Introduction
Since the first single-atom catalyst (SAC) Pt1/FeOx was reported in 2011, (1) studies of SAC have been increasing significantly, (2−5) spanning a wide range of applications to diverse chemical processes, such as CO oxidation, (1,6,7) water–gas shift, (8,9) methane conversion, (10,11) selective hydrogenation, (12,13) hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), (14) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), (15−18) to name but a few. Not only does the SAC design maximize the atomic efficiency but it also provides appealing activity and stability, both of which can potentially be engineered, due to the precisely defined structure of the active center. The stability of SAC strongly depends on the binding between the single atom (SA) and the substrate, especially under operating conditions. (19) The well-defined local coordination scenario is also responsible for its selectivity and activity.
Although SACs possess attractive merits, their industrial applications are often hindered by a too low loading concentration (CL) of SAs on the substrate. The SA CL was only 0.17 wt % in the original Pt1/FeOx SAC (1) and was later promoted to 1.5 wt % in the Pd1/TiO2 SAC by a photochemical method. (20) Recent reports showed that the CL in pseudo-SACs can reach up to 4.30 and 7.5 wt % for the loading of Pt atoms, (12,13) but they are contaminated by adjacent Pt–Pt interactions, so they are not pure SACs and thus more or less lose the merit of a well-defined active center that is key to precise tunability. It is the aggregation of SAs during either the loading process or the subsequent treatment that makes it difficult to maintain single atomic dispersity while increasing the SA loading.
Thus, it is essential for practical applications of SACs to formulate a reliable synthesis strategy to transfer the target-SA-containing species to the substrate and effectively anchor the SAs with both precise atomic dispersity and high CL. Currently, there are a few options to prepare SACs with both pros and cons. (3,21)
The wet-chemistry methods have been widely used to prepare supported metal catalysts for decades, and it was found that the precursor materials often contain target metal species with different sizes ranging from SA to nanoparticles (NPs). (22) The synthesis of SAC can then be realized by reducing the CL of the target metal to an extremely low level, (1,23,24) and this has become one of the most popular strategies. However, the CL of SAC has to be low enough to avoid aggregation. Flytzani-Stephanopoulos’ group proposed a cyanide leaching variant of the wet-chemistry method to selectively remove metal NPs by tuning the concentration of CN–. (8,25−27) This approach ensures the purity of SAs, but the reported SAC CL’s are low. (8) For instance, the Au CL’s on ceria supports before and after cyanide leaching are about 1 and 0.6 wt %, respectively, (28) and the Au CL on titania reaches a marginally larger value (∼1 wt %). (29)
The atomic layer deposition (ALD) method is a typical technique to produce uniformly grown material on the substrate with high precision. (30) By controlling the precursor vapor pulse, ALD has been successfully used to fabricate SACs, (31,32) but it is limited by the specific type of precursors and requires a high-quality substrate surface that results in high cost. Similarly, this method cannot deliver high SA loading due to aggregation. For instance, only ∼1.5 wt % CL of Pt SAs on graphene was obtained after 50 ALD cycles, while very small Pt clusters were also observed. (31)
The mass-selected soft-landing method can deposit precisely defined metal clusters (including SA) onto the support using the quadrupole mass filter and deflector assembly and thus is a powerful technique to prepare model catalysts for fundamental studies. (33−35) However, this method appears to be impractical for large-scale fabrication because of the high cost and low yield.
There are also a few other methods for the synthesis of SACs, including pyrolysis treatment, (36) photochemical route, (20) and high-temperature vapor transport. (37−39) All of the above methods are by nature to manipulate the chemical potential of SAs in the course of preparation and anchor them by thermodynamics or kinetics. However, there is no efficient method so far that achieves high purity and high CL of SAs simultaneously.
Herein, we propose an electrochemical route as a general and efficient method for producing SACs with both high purity and high CL. Starting from the well-defined substrate with metal atoms predeposited by routine techniques that do not require precise control, we find that there exists a sufficiently large electrochemical potential window with applied voltage in which all metal forms other than the strongly bound SA are oxidized and leached out (Scheme 1). Thus, this formulates an efficient and general strategy to prepare pure SAC with high CL. We demonstrate this proposal with first-principles modeling of producing Group 10 element SACs on three typical substrates, N-doped porous graphene, (14,16,17,40) ferric oxide, (1,38) and graphdiyne. (41−45) The last case also indicates the applicability of our method to produce precisely defined surface single-cluster catalyst (SCC) (46) with high CL. A prerequisite for our strategy to work is that the substrate has sufficiently strong binding with the particular SA/SC, so that the chemical potential of the target metal in the anchored SA/SC is lower than that in the supported clusters and nanoparticles. With this prerequisite fulfilled, the theoretical results show that our strategy can produce high-loading and high-purity SAC/SCC, even with a distribution of different-sized clusters on the substrate surface.

aThe red or blue curve is for the case with strong binding between support and SA or SC (single cluster), so the chemical potential drops off sharply at the SA or SC form, while the black curve is for the case with no support or weak binding between support and any form of target metal, and the chemical potential curve just follows the Gibbs–Thomson equation.
Theoretical and Computational Details
Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations
Molecular dynamics and structure optimization were carried out using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) flavor of spin-polarized DFT as implemented in VASP 5.4.4 (47−49) with the plane-wave basis sets of 400 eV cutoff kinetic energy to approximate the valence electron densities and the projector augmented wave (PAW) method to account for the core–valence interaction. (50) The DFT+U method with U – J = 3.0 eV was used to describe the strong correlation of the localized Fe 3d states. (1,51) For Ni, Pd, and Pt, the +U correction was not applied for consistency because the electronic states of supported metal clusters resemble those of bulk metal (with delocalized valence electrons) more, for which the +U correction is normally not exceedingly necessary. Single gamma-point sampling was used for Brillouin zone integration. The geometry optimization and self-consistent field convergence criterion were set to 0.02 eV/Å and 10–6 eV, respectively. The free energy corrections for Ni, Pd, and Pt bulk were calculated using Phonopy, (52) which includes the zero-point energy (ZPE) and enthalpic and entropic contributions from phonons. The free energy correction for supported clusters was obtained similarly by including the ZPE and enthalpic and entropic contributions from vibrational degrees of freedom calculated with the substrate fixed.
To properly describe the electrochemical interfaces, grand canonical DFT calculations with explicit constant electrochemical potential (μe) and implicit CANDLE solvation model were performed using JDFTx 1.4.2. (53,54) The GBRV (55) ultrasoft pseudopotentials (USPP) were used with a plane wave cutoff of 544 eV (20 a.u.). All other settings are similar to those in VASP calculations. The ionic screening of net charges resulting from the constant μe condition was achieved with cation (0.1 M K+) and anion (0.1 M F–) components in the fluid model under the joint DFT framework. (56,57) In previous work, we found that the relative free energies are linearly dependent on the applied potential (U) when |U| < ∼2 V (vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)), (58,59) so the U dependence of the relative free energies was determined by calculations at U = 0 and 2 V.
Electronic Structure Analysis
Crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis was performed with the LOBSTER 3.1.0 package, which reconstructs the orbital-resolved wave functions via projection of the delocalized PAW to localized atomic-like basis sets. (60,61) Basis sets given by Koga (62,63) with additional functions fitted to atomic VASP PBE wave functions were used. (64) Atomic charges were computed using the atom-in-molecule (AIM) scheme proposed by Bader, (65) while Mulliken and Löwdin charges were obtained from projected wave functions by LOBSTER. (64) The electron density differences were evaluated using the formula Δρ = ρ(Mn/substrate) – ρ(Mn) – ρ(substrate).
Substrate Models
The α-Fe2O3(0001)-p(3 × 3) slab containing 8 layers of Fe atoms and 5 layers of O atoms was adopted to model the O-terminated surface. The bottom Fe–O layers were frozen during geometry optimization. The graphene-p(6 × 6) with one SV and two DVs was adopted to model the NC materials. The graphdiyne-p(2 × 2) was adopted to well accommodate the M3 SC. All supercells are with the vacuum layers of at least 10 Å.
We here emphasize that while focusing on demonstrating the electrochemical potential window strategy conceptually, we only considered model substrate surfaces without including any variations such as different surface orientations/terminations and defects (including impurities), which can in principle modify the binding of substrate with the SA/SC and thus play a role in the applicability of our approach. We plan to pursue this direction in future work on computational screening for substrates for SAC/SCC.
Results and Discussion
Predicting the Threshold Potential Un
We formulate here a simple scheme, which is similar to the computational hydrogen electrode approach, (66) to calculate the free energies of solvated cations G(M2+(aq)) from the experimental standard reduction potentials U0 and the calculated free energies of bulk metals G(M(s)) as follows
(1)
The U0’s of Group 10 elements are listed below (67)
(2)
(3)
(4)
Note that all of the U0’s are referenced to the SHE, so the predicted potentials in this work all inherit the SHE scale.
The leaching process is investigated with differential leaching steps for an n-atom metal cluster anchored on the substrate (denoted as Mn/substrate)
(5)
Thus, the corresponding reaction free energies at a certain applied potential U can be written as
(6)
where the free energies G(Mn/substrate) and G(Mn–1/substrate) are linearly dependent on U as described in the Theoretical and Computational Details
(7)
where k is the linear coefficient for U dependence and G0 is the free energy at U = 0 V, both indexed by n of Mn/substrate. Combining eqs 1, 6, and 7, one derives
(8)
It requires ΔG(Mn–Mn–1) < 0 for the leaching step to take place spontaneously, and thus, the threshold potential Un for leaching one metal atom from Mn/substrate is
(9)
We benchmark our computational scheme on the electrochemical potential for leaching a single Pt atom from the monolayer step on the Pt(111) surface, and the predicted value is in good agreement with experiment (see the Supporting Information (SI) for details). This implies that our first-principles-based scheme is likely to work fine for similar systems (Pt, Pd, and Ni metal clusters). Further calculations on the electrochemical potential window for other metal systems are ongoing in our laboratory.
The electrochemical potential for each leaching step was calculated based on geometry optimization of clusters upon removal of a Pt atom, except for the structure of the initial M20 cluster that is the global minimum from simulated annealing. The real process of electrochemical leaching is likely to be fast (a nonequilibrium process) and unlikely to sufficiently explore the high-dimensional potential energy surfaces of clusters to reach its global minimum. In addition, we calculated the threshold potentials near the electrochemical potential windows with global minimum structures from simulated annealing and found quantitative agreement with our results from geometry optimization, which supports our predictions, particularly the existence of electrochemical potential windows.
Note that the theoretical modeling has its limits (e.g., the approximation used in the DFT method), and the current work aims at proposing the existence of the electrochemical potential window using an ideal model system without considering the factors such as explicit and dynamic solvent and electrolyte effects, electrode restructuring, pH, etc. Experimental work utilizing this strategy and considering the complicated conditions will still be needed to develop this model.
SAs on N-Doped Porous Graphene
We first investigate the Pt loading on the N-doped porous graphene (denoted as NC). The transition metal atom anchored by coordination with N atoms (M–Nx) in NC has been widely studied as the highly active center for catalytic reactions, (14,16,17,68,69) and the single and double vacancies (SV, DV) formed in graphene by multi-N-atom doping (Nx-graphene, x = 3, 4) are two of the most common defects in NC materials. (40,70,71) Thus, a 6 × 6 supercell of graphene with two DVs and one SV is built to model the local structure of a real NC material. A Pt20 NP is then deposited onto the NC surface by simulated annealing from 1000 to 100 K, followed by structure optimization. This modeling process is to mimic any experimental deposition procedure that does not necessarily impose precise control of the chemical potential for the target metal element, such as the traditional impregnation method and coprecipitation method. During simulated annealing, two Pt atoms are spontaneously trapped by DVs and the remaining Pt18 NP is anchored at SV, which is in line with the experimental finding that the NP and SA coexist. (22)
The ΔG(Mn–Mn–1) and corresponding Un to leach every metal atom (from n = 20 to 1) were then calculated. As shown in Figure 1a, all 18 Pt atoms composing the NP anchored at SV are leached out to form Pt2+ in aqueous solution at U = 0.67 V, and the two Pt SAs remain at the DV defects coordinated by four N atoms. Further leaching the two Pt SAs requires U > 1.80 V. Thus, there is a U window of 1.13 V, within which all forms of Pt other than the strongly bound SA are electrochemically leached away from the NC surface to dissolve into the electrolyte, and this formulates an elegant strategy for producing high-purity and high-loading Pt/NC SAC that does not require highly precise control of the chemical potential for Pt.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Threshold leaching potentials Un (vs SHE) for Mn/NC, with M = Pt (a), Pd (b), and Ni (c). Gray area marks the potential window, within which all forms of metals (including NPs) are depleted, except for the SA form (SA-M) at DV defects that remains. Optimized configurations of M20/NC and (SA-M)2/NC are shown alongside. Color code for elements is as follows: Pt, cyan; Pd, dark green; Ni, light green; C, gray; N, blue.
Note that the threshold U required to leach the Pt SA at the SV defect is only −0.14 V, which is much lower than those for the Pt atoms of NP and the Pt SAs at the DV defects. Thus, it is the concentration of the DV defect that determines the maximum of the SA CL, and our strategy can achieve such maximal loading naturally with perfect purity, as long as the initial deposition populates all of the DV defects with Pt SAs. We further considered the electrochemical leaching of Pd20/NC and Ni20/NC (Figure 1b and 1c), and both present similar behavior to that of Pt20/NC with wide windows of U ranging from 0.55 to 1.53 V and from −0.33 to 0.91 V, respectively, within which only the SA form of metals at the DV defects remains on the NC surface. Thus, we propose our strategy of utilizing the electrochemical potential window as a general methodology for the production of high-loading SAC with high purity.
Note that some of the predicted leaching potentials are of negative values, which do not necessarily imply reducing conditions. Whether the condition is reductive or oxidative is relative to the reference electrode. All U values reported here refer to the SHE, and one can simply employ a reference electrode with a standard reduction potential lower than U to make the working electrode oxidative and deliver the leaching by electrochemical oxidation.
SAs on Fe2O3
Besides NC, metal oxides are the other kind of typical substrate for SACs, such as in the original study of Pt1/FeOx. (1) Thus far, the synthesis of Pt1/FeOx is achieved by coprecipitation, which is a wet-chemistry method that suffers from low SA CL and impurity problem. (1) Thus, we investigate the applicability of our strategy to the synthesis of Group 10 element SACs anchored on the Fe2O3(0001) surface.
Following the modeling procedure in the NC cases, a Pt20 NP is initially deposited onto the O-terminated α-Fe2O3(0001) surface, where the bottom layer of Pt20 NP is bound with the surface oxygen spontaneously. Figure 2a shows that the 17 Pt atoms composing the NP are leached out at U = 0.82 V, and the remaining three Pt atoms are atomically dispersed and coordinated with three or four surface O atoms, which is the same configuration as the SAC reported in previous work on Pt1/FeOx. (1,72) Further leaching these well-anchored SAs requires at least U > 1.05 V. Thus, there is a sufficiently large window of U spanning 0.23 V that enables the simple fabrication of high-purity and high-loading Pt/FeOx SAC.
Figure 2

Gray area marks the potential window, within which all forms of metals (including NPs) are depleted, except for the SA form that remains. Optimized configurations of M20/Fe2O3 and (SA-M)3 or 4/Fe2O3 are shown alongside. Color code for elements is as follows: Pt, cyan; Pd, dark green; Ni, light green; Fe, purple; O, red.
If the initial deposition of Pt NPs ensures full coverage of the Fe2O3 surface, our strategy can in principle deliver the theoretical maximum of SA CL, i.e., 4.55 per nm2, assuming that the Fe2O3(0001) surface is perfect with few defects. (38) While the current experimental technique (coprecipitation method) only achieved a SA CL of ∼0.08 per nm2. (1) It is worth emphasizing here that different from the NC case, the SA loading on the Fe2O3 surface does not require any specific defect and thus achieves high concentrations more straightforwardly via our strategy. Similarly, we investigate the applicability of our strategy to produce Pd and Ni SAs anchored on the Fe2O3(0001) surface, and both cases (Figure 2b and 2c) present reasonably large windows of U ranging from 0.61 to 0.82 V and 0.01 to 0.37 V, respectively. Thus, we confirm that our strategy is a general methodology applicable to producing high-purity and high-loading SACs anchored on typical substrates.
SCs on Graphdiyne
The third substrate we considered is graphdiyne, which features assembled layers of sp- and sp2-hybridized carbon atoms with triangular holes enclosed by six triple bonds that can accommodate one or more metal atoms. (42) Following the above procedure, a Pt20 NP is initially deposited on a 2 × 2 monolayer graphdiyne surface and the bottom layer of NP spontaneously adopts a 3-atom form that sits at the triangular hole and binds with the surrounding triple bonds. Figure 3a shows that the first 17 Pt atoms composing the NP are leached out at U = 0.68 V, and the remaining Pt3 single cluster (SC) is located at the triangular hole with each Pt atom coordinated with two CC triple bonds and the other two Pt atoms. It is worth noting here that the required potential to leach the first Pt atom of Pt3 SC is as high as 0.93 V, while further leaching the other two Pt atoms only needs 0.38 and 0.29 V, respectively. Thus, the Pt3 SC is the most stable form anchored on the graphdiyne surface, and there exists a sufficiently large window of U ranging from 0.68 to 0.93 V that delivers simple production of high-purity and high-loading Pt3/graphdiyne SCC. Note that the SC loading on graphdiyne does not depend on any defects and thus in principle can achieve the maximal concentration, i.e., with every other triangular hole populated with an SC.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Threshold leaching potentials Un (vs SHE) for Mn/graphdiyne, with M = Pt (a), Pd (b), and Ni (c). Gray area marks the potential window, within which all forms of metals (including NPs) are depleted, except for the M3 SC at the hole of graphdiyne. Optimized configurations of M20/ graphdiyne and SC-M3/graphdiyne are shown alongside. Color code for elements is as follows: Pt, cyan; Pd, dark green; Ni, light green; C, gray.
The SCC, as a new concept, has been reported to demonstrate intriguing performance for complicated reactions, such as Ag3 for propyl epoxidation, (33) Ru3 for oxidation of alcohols, (73) and Fe3 and Rh1Co3 for ammonia synthesis. (46,74) Thus, we further investigate the applicability of our strategy to produce Pd and Ni SCs anchored on graphdiyne (Figure 3b and 3c). The Ni case also presents a sufficiently large window of U ranging from −0.30 to −0.02 V that enables the simple synthesis of Ni3/graphdiyne SCC. However, the Pd3 SC anchored on graphdiyne is not sufficiently stable with respect to the Pd NP, so there is no clear-cut window of U for straightforward production of Pd3/graphdiyne SCC. Thus, our strategy is applicable to producing high-purity and high-loading SCCs, but it does impose implicitly the requirement that the SC-substrate binding strength should be sufficiently strong. It is also confirmed that our strategy can produce larger SCs like Ni6 on graphyne-3, which has larger holes enclosed by 9 CC triple bonds (Figure S1).
Comparing with Similar Methods
Fundamentally, our strategy via electrochemistry simply exploits the chemical potential difference between SA/SC and nanoparticles to achieve selective purging. Some of existing synthesis methods for SAC are also manipulating the chemical potential of the target metal by different techniques. For instance, Flytzani-Stephanopoulos et al. tune the concentration of cyanide to leach Au nanoparticles as Au(CN)2–, (8) Datye and Zhang et al. control the pressure of O2 and temperature to remove Pt nanoparticles in the form of PtO2, (38,39) and Li and Wang et al. control the pressure of CO and temperature to remove certain Au and Rh atoms in the forms of Au–CO and Rh(CO)2. (19,75,76) Our electrochemical approach outshines these existing methods because without resorting to any specific chemical interactions it is applicable to any target metal and enables facile control to achieve both precise purging and the theoretical maximum of SAC/SCC CL, as long as the initial predeposition populates all anchor sites. The only prerequisite for our strategy is the existence of a chemical potential window as shown in Scheme 1c.
Our theoretically proposed strategy has some experimental roots: electrochemical deposition has been long employed to synthesize nanostructures, (77−79) and there have been reported experimental studies to prepare SACs via an electrochemical deposition route by controlling the applied potential or current, for example, electrodeposition of Au clusters on boron-doped diamond (80) and electrodeposition of singly dispersed Pt atoms and clusters on bismuth. (81) However, compared to controlled electrodeposition synthesis which is often subject to contamination by different-sized clusters due to aggregation, our strategy via electrochemical leaching enables facile control of applied potential and ensures the purity of SA/SC due to the existence of a potential window.
SA/SC-Substrate Bonding Analysis
The electrochemical potential windows we find above arise from the strong local bonding of SA/SC with substrates. On the Fe2O3 and NC substrates, a Group 10 SA is coordinated to four O or N atoms with a square planar configuration, and its dx2–y2 orbital experiences a large splitting that stabilizes the binding. Here, the COHP analysis was adopted to characterize the bonding strength, in which the interaction between two orbitals centered at neighboring atoms is described by the product of their corresponding Hamiltonian matrix element and the densities of states matrix. From the projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP) analysis (Figure 4a–c), the splitting of dx2–y2 results in the bonding contribution well below the Fermi level and most of the antibonding interaction above the Fermi level. By integrating the COHP below the Fermi level, one can estimate the bonding contribution between the neighboring atoms and thus quantify the bonding strength. The integrated pCOHP (IpCOHP) summed over all ligands of each Pt atom are −12.6, −14.2, and −7.8 eV on NC, Fe2O3, and graphdiyne, respectively (Figures S2–S4). For comparison, the IpCOHP summed over all Pt–Pt bonds of each atom in the Pt metal bulk is only −6.0 eV, indicating weaker binding than that of Pt SA/SC with substrate (Figure S5). Hence, the aggregate forms of Pt are easier to be leached by electrochemical oxidation.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Projected crystal orbital Hamilton populations (pCOHP) for (a) four N–Pt, (b) four O–Pt, and (c) five C–Pt bonds per Pt atom and corresponding integrated values (IpCOHP). Red area marks the pCOHP for N–Pt(dx2–y2), or O–Pt(dx2–y2), or C–Pt(dx2–y2). Calculated electron density differences upon SA/SC loading for Pt SA on (d) NC and (e) Fe2O3 and (f) Pt3 SC on graphdiyne indicate the electron transfer from SA/SC to substrate.
Electron density difference analysis (Figure 4d–f) shows the electron transfer from Pt SA/SC to adjacent N or O with Bader charges of Pt atoms to be +1.00, +1.41, and +0.31 |e| on NC, Fe2O3, and graphdiyne, respectively (Table S1). On the contrary, the Pt atoms of aggregate forms are neutral. Thus, the electrostatic interactions also contribute to stabilizing the anchored Pt SA/SC. The above discussion highlights a prerequisite for our strategy, i.e., suitable substrates that have sufficiently strong binding with the target SA/SC, and it is a natural next step to screen for such substrates that enables our strategy to produce a much wider range of SACs and SCCs.
Conclusions
In summary, we report an efficient and general strategy for the production of high-purity and high-loading SACs and SCCs anchored on suitable substrates. The key idea of our strategy is the presence of an electrochemical potential window we predict for purging any aggregate forms of target metal while preserving its strongly bound SA/SC form. This enables a simple route to produce high-quality SACs and SCCs by any routine predeposition methods followed by electrochemical leaching. We illustrate this idea with Pt, Pd, and Ni SACs anchored on NC and Fe2O3 as well as Pt3 and Ni3 SCCs anchored on graphdiyne. We further point out that the applicability of our strategy can be readily extended to a wide range of SACs and SCCs in combination with prescreening for suitable substrates.

Abstract
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Schematic Illustrations of (a) Predeposited Pt on the Substrate with Aggregate and SA Forms and (b) only SAs Left on the Substrate after Selective Leaching within the Electrochemical Potential Window (EcPW), and (c) General Trends of Chemical Potentials (∂G/∂ni) for Three Typical Cases with Respect to Particle Sizesa
aThe red or blue curve is for the case with strong binding between support and SA or SC (single cluster), so the chemical potential drops off sharply at the SA or SC form, while the black curve is for the case with no support or weak binding between support and any form of target metal, and the chemical potential curve just follows the Gibbs–Thomson equation.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Threshold leaching potentials Un (vs SHE) for Mn/NC, with M = Pt (a), Pd (b), and Ni (c). Gray area marks the potential window, within which all forms of metals (including NPs) are depleted, except for the SA form (SA-M) at DV defects that remains. Optimized configurations of M20/NC and (SA-M)2/NC are shown alongside. Color code for elements is as follows: Pt, cyan; Pd, dark green; Ni, light green; C, gray; N, blue.

Figure 2. Threshold leaching potentials Un (vs SHE) for Mn/Fe2O3(0001), with M = Pt (a), Pd (b), and Ni (c). Gray area marks the potential window, within which all forms of metals (including NPs) are depleted, except for the SA form that remains. Optimized configurations of M20/Fe2O3 and (SA-M)3 or 4/Fe2O3 are shown alongside. Color code for elements is as follows: Pt, cyan; Pd, dark green; Ni, light green; Fe, purple; O, red.

Figure 3. Threshold leaching potentials Un (vs SHE) for Mn/graphdiyne, with M = Pt (a), Pd (b), and Ni (c). Gray area marks the potential window, within which all forms of metals (including NPs) are depleted, except for the M3 SC at the hole of graphdiyne. Optimized configurations of M20/ graphdiyne and SC-M3/graphdiyne are shown alongside. Color code for elements is as follows: Pt, cyan; Pd, dark green; Ni, light green; C, gray.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Projected crystal orbital Hamilton populations (pCOHP) for (a) four N–Pt, (b) four O–Pt, and (c) five C–Pt bonds per Pt atom and corresponding integrated values (IpCOHP). Red area marks the pCOHP for N–Pt(dx2–y2), or O–Pt(dx2–y2), or C–Pt(dx2–y2). Calculated electron density differences upon SA/SC loading for Pt SA on (d) NC and (e) Fe2O3 and (f) Pt3 SC on graphdiyne indicate the electron transfer from SA/SC to substrate.
