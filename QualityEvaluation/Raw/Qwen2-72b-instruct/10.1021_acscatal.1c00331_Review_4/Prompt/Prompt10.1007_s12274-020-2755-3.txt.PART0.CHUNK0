ABSTRACT
The local coordination environment of catalysts has been investigated for an extended period to obtain enhanced catalytic performance. Especially with the advancement of single-atom catalysts (SACs), research on the coordination environment has been advanced to the atomic level. The surrounding coordination atoms of central metal atoms play important roles in their catalytic activity, selectivity and stability. In recent years, remarkable improvements of the catalytic performance of SACs have been achieved by the tailoring of coordination atoms, coordination numbers and second- or higher-coordination shells, which provided new opportunities for the further development of SACs. In this review, the characterization of coordination environment,tailoring of the local coordination environment, and their related adjustable catalytic performance will be discussed. We hope this review will provide new insights on further research of SACs.

1 Introduction The problem of energy shortage is especially crucial for human beings in recent years. Efficient exploration and utilization of the earths existed fossil sources are some of the most reasonable strategies to release the energy problem. Human beings ability to convert the existed fossil sources to clean energy will influence the industrial development and humans daily life,which are significantly depended on the catalytic activity of catalysts [13]. Hence, in past decades, researchers have paid great effort on the development of new catalysts including heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts. As for homogeneous catalysts, manipulating active metal centers and their surrounding coordination atoms are effective strategies to improve the catalytic activity and selectivity [4], which are equally important to the catalytic properties of traditional heterogeneous catalysts due to the mixed coordination environments between catalytic metal particles and supports [57]. However, the inevitable size dispersion of metal nanoparticles could also weaken the catalytic selectivity as well as the atomic utilization [1, 8].
The development of new catalysts with improved catalytic properties is one of the most important subjects in chemistry and catalysis.
Single-atom catalysts (SACs) could combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, which were designed and put forward in last century and were newly specified and developed by many groups in the last decade [1,2, 614]. The SACs featured atomic dispersed metal atoms loaded on supports can exhibit comparable atom utilizations and the property of controllable coordination environment with homogeneous catalysts [1518]. Besides, the uniform atomic active sites achieved by flexible synthesis strategies exhibit high selectivity in many important reactions such as propane dehydrogenation [19, 20], CH bond oxidation [11, 21], O2 reduction [22, 23], N2 fixation [24, 25] and CO2 reduction [2629] etc. To date, the study on SACs has been advanced to consider the coordination environment of central metal atoms at atomic level with help from the high-resolution characterization technologies [7, 10, 30]. In most circumstance, the central metal atoms of SACs were fixed on supports by coordination bonds with N, S, O, etc. atoms from support materials or metalmetal bonds (Scheme 1). The electronic and geometric structures of central metal atoms could be adjustable by tailoring

A comprehensive review on modulating the local coordination of SACs and their related enhanced catalytic performance is timely important.
In this review, we will first introduce the characterization technologies of coordination environment, which is vital for further investigations of SACs. Then, the local coordination environment of SACs and their influence of catalytic performance will be illustrated from some representative publications,which are categorized by macroscopic support materials (Section 3.1), specific coordination atoms (Section 3.2), and complicated second- and higher-coordination shell (Section 3.3).
Finally, the future challenges and opportunities for modulating the coordination environment of SACs are forecasted. 2  Characterization of coordination environment In the early days, the characterizations of the coordination environment were rare, owing to the lack of advanced characterization technologies. However, due to the development from traditional bulk catalysts to atomic engineered new catalysts, the analysis of the coordination environment of central metal atoms and its significant influence on the investigation of catalytic performance has been emphasized.
One vital technology to analyze the coordination environment of the metallic complex is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
The chemical shift exhibited on NMR spectrums indicated the different coordination environments. For example, Zhang et al. applied 31P NMR and 1H NMR to characterize the coordination abilities between metal cations and phosphines (or thiols/ benzenes) (as illustrated in Fig. 1(a)) [3537]. The chemical shift of the NMR spectrum could reflect the coordination abilities between metal cations and ligands. As for solid-state catalysts with supported metal atoms or nanoparticles, the X-ray derived spectroscopies (include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy techniques) are most essential approaches to characterize their coordination environments. Metal atoms coordinated by different atoms from the support will exhibit different binding energies characterized by XPS and XANES. The coordination atoms and valence states of central metal atoms could be concluded by the fitting of the spectrums and concerning the XPS database [38]. In Wangs study, the difference of FeS, CoS and NiS coordination could be determined based on the different binding energies of S 2p detected by high-resolution XPS (as illustrated in Fig. 1(b)) [39]. For further detailed characterization, EXAFS is the key technology to analyze the coordination environment, especially for single atomic catalysts.
The different coordination environments of central metal atoms would exhibit different bond distances (R shift exhibited in Fourier transform (FT) functions of the EXAFS spectra). Also,the absence of the signal of the metalmetal bond is critical evidence to define a SACs. For example, Wang et al. reported the coordination environment of W atoms supported on metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived N-doped carbon (Fig. 1(c)) [40]. By comparing the k3-weight FT-EXAFS curves of the W SAC with samples made of WW, WO, WN, and WC bonds, single atomically dispersed W catalysts could be determined.
To further evaluate the coordination environments of active sites, in situ characterizations could provide more valuable information during dynamic changes [41, 42]. Basically, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) could be utilized to indicate the evolution of the coordination environment during the synthesis process. For example, Corma et al. determined the reversible transformation from Pt single atoms to nanoparticles supported on high-silica chabazite zeolite by the combination of in situ XAFS and XANES [43].
Besides the essential characterization during the synthesis process, in situ characterizations also played an important role in determining the coordination environments of active sites during the catalytic process. For example, Yang et al. investigated the coordination environment of two kinds of Pt3Ni nanoframe during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by in situ XANES and XAFS [44]. The different coordination environments of two Pt3Ni catalysts characterized by in situ XAFS at working potentials illustrated their differed performance and stabilities in the ORR process. Similarly, Xing et al. applied in situ XANES to evaluate the coordination environment of Fe SA/CN under various potentials, which illustrated the real active sites and reaction pathways in the ORR process [45]. Besides ORR,in situ XAS at working atmospheres and temperatures was Figure 1  (a) 31P NMR spectra of different cations with TBP coordination (reproduced with permission from Ref.

Nano Res. www.theNanoResearch.comwww.Springer.com/journal/12274  Nano Research 3 also applied to studies of the coordination environments of another heterogeneous catalysis. For example, Zeng et al. revealed the adsorption properties of H2 and CO on the surface of Rh SA/CoO during hydroformylation reaction by in situ XPS and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform [46].
Besides the in situ XAS, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also applied to analyze the coordination environment of SACs. For example, in situ environmental TEM and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were utilized to characterize the transformation from nano- particles to single atoms [47, 48]. Suenaga et al. reported the characterization of coordination environment and migration of Re/Au atoms on single-layer MoS2 support by in situ annular dark-field STEM [49], which provided with new opportunities for direct observations of the interactions between single atoms and coordination environments. Christopher et al. reported that the dynamic response of Pt single atoms anchored on TiO2 was characterized by in situ aberration-corrected STEM [50].
The mobility of Pt atoms when heated at a high temperature within H2 atmosphere characterized by in situ aberration-corrected STEM enlightened us to understand the coordination behavior of SACs further. Hence, further applications of in situ techniques could provide with more insightful investigations of catalytic mechanisms.
To further investigate the coordination environment of SACs, theoretical predictions are significant to optimize the coordination environments for high catalytic performance.
For example, Zeng et al. reported the evaluations of activities of graphene-based SACs with different nitrogen coordination numbers for ORR, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in theoretical insights [51].
They reported that the optimal coordination environment could be Fe-pyridine/pyrrole-N4 for ORR, Co-pyrrole-N4 for OER, and Mn-pyrrole-N4 for HER, which could help design synthesis of SACs with organized coordination environments.
In a recent publication by Wang et al., the N coordination effects of Mn-Nx SACs for ORR were also explored based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations [52]. They reported that Mn-N4/C could be an attractive candidate, which positioned near the apex of the volcano plot with a ηSHE of 0.33 V.
Li et al. reported a comprehensive theoretical study of M SA/FeOx (M = Pd, Pt, Ni, Fe, Co, Cu; Ru, Rh, Ag, Os, Ir, Au,etc.), and they found a close relationship between the catalytic activity of M SA/FeOx for CO oxidation and their coordination environments [34]. In their study, Pd SA/FeOx could be the best candidates for further applications, which even exhibited better performance than reported Pt SA/FeOx and Ni SA/FeOx.
Based on the theoretical studies, further precise characterizations such as coordination number, the second- and higher-shell coordinations were mostly performed by combining experimental XAS spectra and theoretical modelings [31, 53]. For example, Jaouen et al. reported that the identification of Fe-SA/N4C12, Fe-SA/N4C10, and Fe-SA/N4C12Ox could be indicated by experi- mental XANES and related theoretical spectrums [54]. Similarly, W-N1C3 (Fig. 1(c)) and Fe-Cl1N4 coordination could also be distinguished separately by comparing the EXAFS spectra and corresponding fitting curves in R spaces as reported by Wang et al.
[40, 55]. This strategy could also be applied to predict the higher- shell coordination of Cu-N4-C8S2, as reported by Zhang et al. [38].
Further investigation on higher-shell coordination requires more precise characterization and a deeper theoretical basis. 3  Local coordination environment of SACs In most reported SACs, metal atoms usually are chemically anchored on the support materials, which could directly influence the stability and catalytic performance of center metal atoms. In this section, we will firstly discuss the alternation of coordination components, with emphasis on the classifications of substrates. Then, we will discuss the adjustment of coordination number according to the types of coordination atoms along with dual atom coordination. Finally, we will briefly discuss the present studies on SACs with second- and higher-coordination shell and their enhanced catalytic performance.
3.1  Coordination components
The different coordinating abilities between central metal atoms and support atoms could be utilized in mediating the catalytic activity of metal atoms. Based on this, the support materials of SACs played essential roles in their catalytic performance. The direct coordination between support atoms and central metal atoms could be categorized as first-shell coordination. In this section, by view of the support materials,some common coordination components in first-shell coor- dination will be introduced, such as carbon materials (mainly N doped carbon materials with first-shell N coordinated), metal oxides (with first-shell O coordinated), metal sulfides (with first-shell S coordinated) and metallic materials (including alloys and intermetallic materials, with first-shell metal atoms coordinated).
3.1.1  SACs supported on carbon materials
Carbon materials are important supports for various catalytic reactions due to their properties of low cost, high conductivity,and easy modification. As for pure carbon materials as substrates of SACs, most active atoms are selectively embedded on the defects of carbon substrates, which exhibited as carbon coordinated SACs. For example, single metal atoms such as Ni, Pd and Pt metal atoms embedded on pure graphene or graphdiyne have been reported by Chen et al. [56], Lu et al. [57] and Lu et al. [58]. However, due to the low binding energy between C and metal atoms (the lack of lone electron pair in C atom), SACs on pure carbon substrates usually are synthesized at high annealing temperature and feature low loading amount.
To further mediate the coordination environment of SACs supported on carbon materials, doping other atoms with higher binding energy is an efficient strategy. For example, N-doped carbon materials, including N-doped graphene, C3N4, and metal-organic framework derived N-doped carbon materials,are applied as important N first-shell coordinated support for SACs with high metal loading amount. Compared to C atom, N atom features one more electron in the valence electron shell, which provides higher binding energy. For example, Li et al. reported a cocoon silk chemistry strategy to synthesize ultrathin N-doped carbon nanosheets with high nitrogen content (20.47 wt.%) and high specific surface area (2,105 m2·g1),which are ideal substrates for anchoring metal atoms (Fig. 2(a)).
The as-prepared Co SA/CN catalysts exhibited high activity on the CH bond activation [59]. Similarly, Song et al. reported a Co SA/CN by applying g-C3N4 as a substrate, which exhibited superior activity for transfer hydrogenation of nitrobenzene [60]. As for two-dimensional (2D) N-doped carbon substrates, N-doped graphene is an attractive support for high metal loading and appropriate coordination ability. Zhang et al. reported the synthesis of Pd SA/N-doped graphene, which exhibited highly selective photothermal hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene [61]. Wang et al. reported Ni SA/N-doped graphene for highly efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with 95% selection of CO [62]. Both of the two mentioned SACs on N-doped graphene could be simply achieved by wet impregnation strategy. Xiang et al. also reported a pyrolysis free pathway to
Nano Res. www.editorialmanager.com/nare/default.asp 4 synthesize Fe SA/N-doped graphene, which exhibited high ORR efficiency [63].
Based on the higher binding energy between N and metal atoms and spatial confinement effects, MOFs with N-containing coordinated links are also attractive substrates for SACs [6]. A straightforward strategy to synthesize MOFs-derived SACs on N-doped carbon substrates is by pyrolysis of metal ions based or encapsulated MOFs. SACs such as Co, W, and Bi SA/CN derived from predesigned MOFs have been investigated by Wang et al. [40], Wu et al. [64], Spendelow et al. [65] and Zhang et al. [47]. Besides, MOFs could also be applied as host to capture active metal precursors. For example, Wang et al. reported the synthesis of atomic dispersed Ru clusters within MOFs (Fig. 2(b)). The applied ZIF-8 shell could achieve regios- elective catalysis, which exhibited high selectivity in hydro- genation of acetylene to ethane [66]. To further versatile synthesis of such SACs, Li et al. reported the ionic exchange of MOFs to achieve Ni SACs, which exhibited efficient electroreduction of CO2 (Fig. 2(c)) [67]. Taking advantages of the coordination between N and metal atoms, Wang et al. reported synthesis of Co SACs anchored on hollow N-doped carbon spheres by template-assisted pyrolysis method (Fig. 2(d)) [68]. The firstly prepared SiO2 spheres were dispersed in metalloporphyrins solutions, followed by pyrolysis. Similar strategies have been applied to the synthesis of Fe, Co, Ni, Mn SA/CN (Fig. 2(e)) [26,69, 70]. However, it has to be mentioned that the examples presented above only focusing on SACs with mostly coordination number of 4. Since the further alternation of N coordination numbers and dual coordination atoms (by modified central atoms with S, Cl and P etc.) are also important factors for catalytic performance, we will systematically discuss them in Sections
3.2.1 and 3.2.2.
3.1.2  SACs supported on metal oxides
Compared to carbon substrates, metal oxide substrates such as FeOx, TiO2, SiO2, CeO2 are also widely applied in industrial catalytic fields. Their surface defects could be applied to anchor metal atoms to synthesize SACs. Liu et al. reported the Pt SA anchored on defects of FeOx substrate by wet co-precipitation [9]. The as-prepared Pt SA/FeOx catalysts exhibited high activity for both CO oxidation and preferential oxidation of CO in H2 due to the appropriate coordination environment. In their following research, they reported the Ir SA/FeOx for remarkable catalysis on water gas shift reaction [71]. Zheng et al. reported a photochemical route to synthesize Pd SA/TiO2 SACs by applying ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets with a high density of defects as substrate [72]. The ethylene glycolate and UV light irradiation supplied with a mediate reduction environment,which facilitated a high single atom loading (1.4 wt.%). Based on the surface defects engineering, Wang et al. firstly constructed oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surface, and then prepared stable and high loading Au SA/TiO2 SACs by co-precipitation (Fig. 3(a)),which exhibited a majority of AuO coordination [73]. Li et al. reported the synthesis of Pt SA/TiO2 SACs by electrostatic- induction ion exchange and two-dimensional confinement strategy (Fig. 3(b)) [74, 75]. The as-prepared Pt SA/TiO2 exhibited enhanced anti-Markovnikov alkene hydrosilylation and photo- catalytic hydrogen generation properties. Similarly, many metal oxide-based SACs were synthesized by the co-precipitation or electrostatic adsorption, such as Rh SA/TiO2 [76], Pt SA/Fe2O3 Figure 2  (a) Synthesis strategies of Co SA/CN catalyst, corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping and aberration corrected high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM image (reproduced with permission from Ref.

The charge transfer from metal oxide support to central metal atoms could facilitate the enhanced catalytic perfor- mance, which has widely utilized for industrial applications.
3.1.3  SACs supported on metal sulfides
Different from the aforementioned N-doped carbon and metal oxide substrates, metal sulfides provided with appropriate band gap and higher binding energy with metal atoms, which are important candidates for photocatalytic and electrocatalytic applications [86, 87]. Single metal atoms could be loaded on metal sulfides substrates (especially transition metal dichalcogenides),which could exhibit outstanding performance due to the catalytic activity, trapping of charge carriers and comprehensive surface modifications [8789]. For example, Suenaga et al. reported the characterization of a single atomic site doping of Re and Au on MoS2 nanosheets [49]. By analyzing the interaction between doping atoms and host, the authors proved that the single atomic doping could enhance the chemical affinity of the system, which could be utilized for further applications on nano-electronic devices. Warner et al. reported that Pt atoms could localize on S vacancies and exhibit dynamic hopping to nearby vacancy sites [90]. They further indicated that Pt atoms could influence the hydrogen evolution reactions by varying the hydrogen adsorption energy. In a related publication by Bao et al., Pt SA/MoS2 exhibited enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic abilities, which could be owing to the tuned adsorption of H atoms by Pt atoms [12]. Besides, Tsang et al. reported the synthesis of Co SA/MoS2, which exhibited superior activity, selectivity, and stability for the hydrodeoxygenation of 4-methylphenol to toluene compared with conventional CoMoS2 catalysts [91]. The enhanced activity could be achieved by the observed CoSMo interfacial sites.
Besides the deposition of single atoms on the surficial defects of metal sulfide substrates, single atomic site doping could also be applied to achieve functional modification. As reported by Zhang et al., single atomic site Ag+ or Cu+ doped CdX and ZnX (X = S, Se, Te) quantum dots were synthesized via phosphine facilitated cation exchange reactions from Ag2X QDs (Fig. 4(a)) [35, 36]. The atomic site doping was further examined by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and EXAFS [92].
The similar cation exchange reactions can also be applied to synthesize metal-semiconductor coreshell nanocrystals with stable atomic doped shell and atomic organized hetero- interface [37, 93]. In their recent publication, the semiconductor shell with the atomic dopant could be tailored from n- to p-type by cation exchange reactions [94]. The as-prepared Au@CdS coreshell nanocrystals with Cu SA dopants exhibited promising photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution property. Similarly,cation exchange reactions could be applied to achieve metal- sulfide nanocrystals (NCs) with high single atomic loadings.
Li et al. reported the synthesis of single atomic Pt sites on

3.1.4  SACs supported on metal substrates
The catalytic properties of noble metal materials could significantly differ from their size and morphologies as the size reduces to nanoscale or atomic level. Located noble single metal atoms on noble metal substrates could exhibit enhanced catalytic performance due to the synergistic effect of isolated noble metal atoms and their coupling with metal substrates [96].
Most reported single atoms are anchored on alloys, or inter- metallic nanocrystals, namely single atom alloys (SAAs),which are mostly achieved by the different surface potentials of metal atoms facilitated adsorption. Toshima et al. reported Au isolated atoms on Pd nanoclusters SAA, which exhibited enhanced catalytic activity on aerobic glucose oxidation [97].
Zhang et al. reported Pd SA on Ag nanoparticles SAA anchored on SiO2 substrates for highly selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene in excess ethylene [98]. As for morphology tailoring, Hong et al. reported the atomically dispersed Ru on ultrathin Pd nanoribbons, which exhibited enhanced property of hydro- genolysis in chemoselective hydrogenation of C=C bonds [96].
The Cu pair atoms on Pd10Te3 alloyed nanowires also exhibited efficient and selective electrochemical reduction of CO2, as reported by Chen et al. (Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)) [28]. Similarly, Wang et al. reported the anchoring of isolated Co single atoms into the lattice of Ru nanoplatelets, which exhibited accelerated water dissociation kinetics [99].Besides, some highly active atoms for H2 activation (such as Pt) suffering from inactivation by C accumulation, could be anchored on substrates with reduced binding strength for C species (such as Cu). In a publication reported by Sykes et al., Pt SA/Cu SAAs with an atomic ratio of Pt:Cu = 1:1.25 exhibited excellent CO tolerance in H2 activation [100]. In their further publication, they prepared Pt/Cu single atom alloys which exhibited efficient and highly selective CH activation catalytic property [20]. Compared to Pt nanoparticles,the Pt/Cu single atom alloys exhibited intermediate barriers for CH activation, which kept active but prevented from coking. Nearly at the same time, Gong et al. reported Pt/Cu single atom alloys could promote the desorption of surface- bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation,resulting in high propylene selectivity ( 90%) [19]. In a recent publication by Wu et al., Ru single atoms were localized on PtCu alloys [101]. The engineered electronic structure of Ru single atoms by tailoring the Cu-Pt ratio of substrates facilitated the enhancement of acidic water oxidation for electrocatalysis.
Similarly, atomic dispersed Sn in Pt3Sn intermetallic nanocrystals enhanced the activity and stability of electrochemical reactions (Fig. 5(c)) [102].
3.2  Adjustment of coordination atoms
To further optimize the catalytic performance of SACs, the coordination number of active metal single atoms were also systematically investigated, which could significantly influence the catalytic properties of SACs. The coordination number mainly depends on the valence state of metal atoms and their coordination environment. The reported adjustment of coordi- nation atoms mainly includes the N coordination, O coordination,and dual atom coordination, and we discuss them in the following sub-sections.
3.2.1  Adjustment of N coordination
The common coordination number of metal atoms with N atoms is 4, which could be attributed to the valence state and electronic structures of central atoms. For example, Bao et al.

[102], WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 2016). reported the synthesis of Fe-N4/graphene SACs for catalytic oxidation of benzene by ball milling of Fe-phthalocyanine (FePc) with graphene nanosheets [11]. The Fe-N4 coordination provided with a potential bonding of Fe=O, which was indicated as a key step to promote the conversion of benzene to phenol. In their further study, Bao et al. reported the synthesis of CuI-N sites SACs by mixing CuPc with dicyan- diamide for efficient ORR in alkaline medium [103]. By adjusting the pyrolysis temperature, Zhang et al. successfully synthesized Fe-Nx (x = 46) SACs, among which FeIII-N5 exhibited the highest selective oxidation of CH bond turnover frequency (TOF) [21]. Wang et al. also reported that Fe-N5 SACs exhibited superior performance in electrochemical CO2 reduction [104]. By similar strategies, Wu et al. reported the tailoring of Co-N2, Co-N3, and Co-N4, while Co-N2 exhibited both high selectivity and activity on electroreduction of CO2 to CO (Figs. 6(a)6(e)) [105]. Chen et al. further studied the preparation of Fe-NxCy (x + y = 4) and their catalytic sites in the benzene oxidation reaction, among which Fe-N4 exhibited the highest performance (Figs. 6(f)6(m)) [106].
Utilizing the strong coordination interaction between N and metal atoms, some metal nanoparticles or bulk materials could also be transformed into single atoms with specific N-coordination numbers during the pyrolysis process. In an impressive publication by Li et al., Cu-N4/C SACs could be achieved by the pyrolysis of Cu foam and ZIF-8 in an ammonia atmosphere (Fig. 7(a)) [107]. The defects of the nitrogen-rich carbon support could trap the Cu(NH3)x species efficiently,which could be applicable for scalable synthesis of SACs.

In an improved strategy reported by Zhang et al., Bi-N4/C SACs could be achieved by the pyrolysis of Bi-MOF precursor and dicyandiamide in Ar atmosphere,which featured enhanced performance for electrocatalysis for CO2 reduction (Fig. 7(b)) [47]. Besides, single metal atoms could also be transformed from metal nanoparticles within carbon support with high nitrogen contents. For example, Li et al. reported the synthesis of Pd-, Au-, Pt-N4/CN SACs transformed from corresponding metal nanoparticles@ZIF-8 after heating at over 900 C (Fig. 7(c)) [108]. The as-prepared Pd-N4/CN SACs exhibited high performance on the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene.
3.2.2  Adjustment of oxygen coordination
Similar to nitrogen atom, the oxygen atom is another kind of typical coordination atom, as introduced in Section 3.1.2 above. The coordination number of oxygen atoms surrounded metal atoms could also significantly influence the catalytic activity of central atoms. In a publication reported by Zhang et al., near-atomic dispersed PtOx clusters on CeO2 nanowires exhibited applicable low-temperature CO oxidation activity [109]. They investigated that 1.3% PtOx/CeO2 with low PtO coordination number (2.0  0.3) exhibited a remarkably 1/2 order higher catalytic activity than PtOx/CeO2 with high PtO coordination number (3.1  0.3). They illustrated that the increased oxygen coordination number could decrease the catalytic activity due to loss of effect active sites.
In contrast, the suitable oxygen coordination number with highly exposed Pt sites could optimize catalytic efficiency and atom utilization. Si et al. also reported that appropriate oxygen coordination numbers of Pt-O/Ce0.5Zr0.42La0.08Ox were significant for their catalytic ability of the oxidation of methane [110]. In their study, 1%Pt/Ce0.5Zr0.42La0.08Ox with appropriate PtO (4.8
0.3) and PtPt (1.6  0.7) exhibited the highest catalytic
performance. Corma et al. reported the tailoring of oxygen coordination number of Pt SA/high silica chabazite zeolite by adjusting sintering temperature and atmosphere, which were utilized to mediate their catalytic performance in the hydrogenation of ethylene and propylene [43]. In the recent publications, Zhang et al. and Hosono et al. separately reported that Pt SA/metal oxide with low PtO coordination number could achieve high hydrogenation catalytic performance [111, 112]. As for PtO2, the coordination number of PtO is around 6. In the publication by Zhang et al., they reported that the increasing synthesis temperature could lead to the gradual decrease of the coordination number of PtO in the synthesis of Pt SA/Fe2O3 [111]. The as-prepared Pt SA/Fe2O3 (600 C sintering) with low PtO coordination number (1.8) exhibited the highest TOF (3,809 molconv.·h1·molPt1) during hydrogena- tion of 3-nitrostyrene, however, Pt SA/Fe2O3 (500 C sintering) with higher PtO coordination number (3.8) exhibited relatively low TOF (491 molconv.·h1·molPt1). They concluded that the decrease in PtO coordination number could decrease the oxidation state of Pt sites and meanwhile enhance their hydrogenation activity. In the publication by Hosono et al., the Pt SA/12CaO·7Al2O3 with a low coordination number of PtO (2.52) exhibited high catalytic activity (with TOF up to 25,772 h1) in chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes [112].
By further studying the coordination state of SACs on oxide support, Qiao et al. reported that the single metal atoms could also be stabilized through a strong covalent metalsupport interaction instead of anchoring on defect sites (Figs. 8(a) and 8(b)) [15]. They proved that the reducibility of iron oxide applied in their systems was crucial for anchoring isolated metal atoms. The findings could also be utilized to synthesize further SACs supported on metal oxides with a high amount of loadings. In a recent study, Lu et al. prepared Pt single atoms anchored on Co3O4 through strong electronic metalsupport interactions, and they exhibited enhanced activity for dehydro- genation of ammonia borane [84]. In another publication by Li et al., due to the organized PtOTi3+ coordination, single Pt atoms anchored on defective TiO2 support exhibited unprecedentedly high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate [75]. By modifying hydroxyl ligands of TiO2 surface, a facile adsorption-oxidation strategy could be exploited to tune the

The Fe central atoms with low coordination number featured low spin state, which resulted in its superior performance for OER. Besides atomic dispersed noble metal atoms anchored on metal oxide support,atomic metal oxide pair anchored on metal substrates were also investigated by Li et al., which exhibited improved catalytic property on the conversion of benzyl alcohol and their selectivity to benzaldehyde (Figs. 8(c) and 8(d)) [114]. Their study illustrated that the interfacial effect could be utilized to achieve more stable and efficient SACs.
3.2.3  Adjustment of dual-atom coordination
As mentioned in previous sections, multi-coordinating atoms could be applied to mediate the catalytic activity of central metal atoms. Compared to the mentioned adjustment of coor- dination number of nitrogen or oxygen, the adjustment of dual-atom coordination is another effective strategy to optimize their catalytic activities. For example, the aforementioned Fe-NxCy SACs could also be categorized as dual atom coor- dination, which were commonly reported in C and N supported SACs [106]. Besides the C and N coordination, other dual-atom coordination could be achieved by anchoring halogens atoms on the central metal atoms of C-N based SACs. For example,in 2018, Wang et al. reported the change of the electronic structure of Fe-N4/CN SACs by one coordinated chlorine through a thermal-migrating method [55]. The obtained Fe-Cl1N4/CN SACs exhibited an exceptionally outstanding ORR activity compared to Fe-N4/CN without coordinated chlorine (Figs. 9(a) 9(c)). By post-sintering strategy, five-coordinated C1-Pt-Cl4 SACs could be transferred to four-coordinated C2-Pt-Cl2 SACs for optimized electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, as reported by Si et al. using graphdiyne as supports [58].
Support materials with modified doping or ligands could also be applied to adjust the dual-atom coordination. Elam et al. reported that the modified surface chlorine on TiO2 could facilitate the deposition of an atomic layer of Pd, which exhibited promising performance in the low-temperature water-gas-shift reaction [115]. Yang et al. also reported that the CeF3 clusters could further be deposited on Fe SA/CN supports, which enabled the surface chemical state to redistribute [116]. The demonstrated CeF3-Fe SA/CN SACs exhibited enhanced electro- catalytic performance in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.
Besides the dual atom coordination, SACs with dual metal sites,including Fe-Co/CN [117], Zn-Co/CN [118], Pt-Ru/CN [119], Co-Pt/CN [106], Co-Fe/CN [120], Ir-Zn/ZnO [121] and Co-Ni/ CN [122], etc. were also reported to mediate their catalytic performance, which could provide with new opportunities for further development of SACs.
3.3  The second- and higher-coordination shell
Compared to the aforementioned coordination of first-shell atoms, the second- and higher-shell atoms could also influence the catalytic abilities of central metal atoms. Different from the direct coordinating atoms, atoms from the second-shell exhibited less coordinated strength, but they exhibited a moderate influence on their catalytic abilities. For example, Zhang et al. reported the synthesis of low valence Cu+-N4-C8S2 SACs, which was investigated by EXAFS together with DFT calculation (Figs. 9(f)9(h)) [38]. Compared to S free Cu-N4/CN SACs,

Nano Res. www.editorialmanager.com/nare/default.asp 10 the Cu+-N4-C8S2 SACs exhibited improved ORR performance in alkaline media. Similarly, Chen et al. reported Fe-S/CN SACs with enhanced ORR performance compared to S free Fe-N4/CN SACs [55, 123]. Lee et al. also systematically inves- tigated the controlling of the electron-withdrawing/donating properties of Fe-N4/CN SACs by further tailoring S second-shell coordination to achieve comprehensive ORR catalytic properties [124]. Besides, in a recent study reported by Wang et al.,different central metal atoms might exhibit different trends in forming a complex within an N, S-containing precursor [39].
They presented that by applying 1-allyl-2-thiourea as the precursor, Fe-N4/C8S2 SACs could be achieved while Ni-N3S1 and Co-N3S1 were prepared by the same conditions (Figs. 9(d) and 9(e)). Fe-N4/C8S2 exhibited better ORR performance due to the formation of a different catalytically active structure without the metalS bonds.
Besides the S coordination, P also could work as the second- shell coordination atom. For example, Lu et al. reported the enhanced catalytic performance on hydrogenation activity of Pt-O4-P/CeO2 compared to Pt-O4/CeO2 [79]. The P doping in CeO2 support induced a considerable charge transfer from Pt to P, which featured a significant higher valence state of Pt+ in Pt-O4-P/CeO2. To further investigate the higher-shell coordination environment, Wang et al. reported the synthesis of Fe SACs embedded on a nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur co-doped hollow carbon polyhedron from a metal-organic framework-polymer composite [125]. The as-prepared Fe-N4-P-S/CN SACs exhibited remarkable performance for ORR in both alkaline and acid media, compared to Fe-N4/CN and commercial Pt/C. The com- plex coordination environment provided new opportunities for developing new SACs with enhanced catalytic performance. 4  Conclusions and perspectives The development of SACs is remarkable in recent years, and the emphasis on the coordination environment of SACs provided new opportunities for further improvement of their catalytic properties. In this review, we first discussed the characterizations of the coordination environment, mainly concerning X-ray derived techniques, in situ techniques, and theoretical predictions, which are important for the deter- mination of the coordination environment. Then, categorized by support materials and coordination atoms, the local coordination environments of recently reported SACs were systematically discussed, especially concerning the modulating of the coordination environments of central metal atoms and their corresponding influence on catalytic properties. The study on the coordination environment of SACs could help researchers to deeply investigate the structure evolution and working mechanism during the catalytic process. The current progress of enhanced catalytic performance facilitated by tailoring the coordination atoms, coordination number, and second- or higher-coordination shells confirms the great significance and opportunities of their applications. Opportunities and challenges still exist to modulate the coordination environments further and optimize the catalytic properties of SACs.
(1) The detailed characterizations of the coordination environ- ment of SACs are still not satisfactory for complicated cases,such as dual-metal sites SACs and multi-shell coordinated SACs. As mentioned in Section 2, such complicated coordination is mainly determined by the comprehensive consideration of experimental spectrums and theoretical predictions. More convincing characterized strategies could be helpful in a further determination of complicated coordination environment.To date, some specific coordination on specific supports (mainly 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides) could be directly observed by annular dark-field STEM or aberration-corrected STEM,characterizations for general support materials are still restrained due to technical limitations.
(2) To date, the characterizations of coordination environ- ments and related charge transfer during the catalytic process were mainly dependent on theoretical modelings. How to provide direct observations of the dynamic changes during the catalytic process is an attractive challenge. New in situ technologies such as in situ scanning tunneling microscopy and in situ aberration-corrected STEM could be helpful for the understanding of catalytic mechanisms and further theoretical studies.
(3) New SACs with precisely designed coordination environ- ments might exhibit novel catalytic performance. As mentioned in previous sections, the coordination atoms could significantly influence the electronic and geometric structures of central metal atoms. Though SACs exhibited high catalytic performance in many reactions, further improvement by coordination tailoring could be effective and applicable. For example,additional coordination of center atoms by some specific element at higher shells (such as S, Se, P, etc.) might increase the stability of SACs without loss of catalytic activity. A slightly mediated coordination of center atoms could increase the dynamic activity, which might increase the catalytic activity and meanwhile maintained high stability due to the structure flexibility.
(4) The strategies on modulating the coordination environ- ments of SACs could provide new opportunities to synthesize SACs on a large scale. For example, metal nanoparticles anchored on various support could be transformed to SACs due to the coordination environment by easily performed mechanical treatment as reported by many leading groups on SACs.
Meanwhile, most of the heterogeneous catalysts consisted of bulk or nano-scale metal materials. Hence, post-treatment of existing heterogeneous catalysts could be an appropriate strategy for large scale synthesis of SACs for industrial applications.
