Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, recognizing it as a crucial issue that affects commercial catalysts. Efforts have been made to understand and mitigate its detrimental effects. The structure, composition, and location of cokes are essential to inhibit coke formation, but the details of coke composition are still under debate. The kinetics of coke growth is important for coke formation, but existing models do not resolve the mechanism at the molecular level. Strategies such as cofeeding gas, metal promoter, and support modification have been verified as effective methods to prevent coke formation. Cofeeding hydrogen can remove coke precursors and weaken support acidity, while promoters like Sn can tune the catalytic properties of Pt, increasing activity and stability. However, determining the optimal kind and loading of promoter is still a challenge. Modifying conventional support alumina can facilitate coke transfer between metal and support. New catalyst designs, such as single atom/site strategies and confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, have shown excellent resistance to coke formation. Although these methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life. Lowering regeneration temperature is important for reducing costs and stabilizing activity. Collaboration between experimental and computational techniques is needed to address the complex issue of coke formation in heterogeneous catalysis.
