Coke deposition, a critical issue in Pt-based catalysts, significantly impacts their performance and longevity in various industrial applications, particularly in the petrochemical and automotive sectors. The mechanisms underlying coke formation involve the adsorption of hydrocarbons on the catalyst surface, followed by a series of reactions that lead to the formation of carbonaceous deposits. These deposits can block active sites, reducing the catalyst's efficiency and activity over time. To mitigate this issue, researchers are exploring strategies such as modifying the catalyst's structure and composition to enhance its coke resistance. This includes the use of supports with higher thermal stability and the incorporation of promoters that can alter the electronic properties of the platinum, thereby reducing coke formation. Additionally, advanced catalyst design approaches, such as the development of bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts, are being pursued to improve the catalyst's performance and longevity. These efforts aim to create more robust and efficient Pt-based catalysts that can withstand the harsh conditions of industrial processes while maintaining high activity levels.
