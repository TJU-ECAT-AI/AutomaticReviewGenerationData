The understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has significantly advanced, recognizing it as a critical issue for commercial catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\]. Efforts to comprehend and mitigate its detrimental effects have been substantial. The structure, composition, and location of cokes are pivotal in inhibiting coke formation, yet the specifics of coke composition remain a subject of debate \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\]. The kinetics of coke growth plays a crucial role in coke formation, but current models fall short of elucidating the mechanism at the molecular level \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\]. Strategies such as cofeeding gas, metal promoter, and support modification have been validated as effective in preventing coke formation \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\]. Cofeeding hydrogen can eliminate coke precursors and reduce the acidity of the support \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\], while promoters like Sn can fine-tune the catalytic properties of Pt, enhancing both activity and stability \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\]. However, determining the optimal type and loading of promoter remains a challenge \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\]. Modifying conventional support alumina facilitates coke transfer between metal and support \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\]. Novel catalyst designs, including single atom/site strategies and confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, have demonstrated remarkable resistance to coke formation \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\]. Despite these advancements, regeneration remains essential to extend catalyst life \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\]. Lowering regeneration temperature is critical for cost reduction and activity stabilization \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\]. An urgent need exists for the integration of experimental and computational techniques to tackle the complex issue of coke formation in heterogeneous catalysis \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in understanding coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts have opened new avenues for research and innovation. Future directions might focus on the development of more sophisticated models to elucidate the molecular mechanism of coke formation, leveraging advanced computational methods. The optimization of promoter selection and loading could benefit from a systematic approach, potentially guided by machine learning algorithms. Innovations in catalyst design, such as the exploration of novel supports and the precise control of Pt cluster size and distribution, hold promise for further improvements in catalyst longevity and performance. The integration of experimental and computational techniques will be crucial in addressing the remaining challenges, leading to the design of more efficient and sustainable catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

The evolution of our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has underscored its critical impact on commercial catalysts, as detailed in reference \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\]. Efforts to comprehend and mitigate the adverse effects of coke have been multifaceted, focusing on the structure, composition, and location of cokes as key factors in inhibiting formation. However, the specifics of coke composition remain a subject of debate. The kinetics of coke growth is pivotal for formation, yet existing models fall short of elucidating the mechanism at a molecular level. Strategies such as cofeeding gas, metal promoter, and support modification have been validated as effective in preventing coke formation. Cofeeding hydrogen, for instance, can eliminate coke precursors and reduce support acidity, while promoters like Sn can fine-tune the catalytic properties of Pt, enhancing both activity and stability. Yet, the determination of the optimal kind and loading of promoter remains an unresolved challenge. Modifying conventional support alumina can aid in the transfer of coke between metal and support. Innovative catalyst designs, including single atom/site strategies and confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, have demonstrated superior resistance to coke formation. Despite these advancements, regeneration remains essential to extend catalyst lifespan. Lowering regeneration temperature is crucial for cost reduction and activity stabilization. An urgent need for collaboration between experimental and computational techniques is highlighted to tackle the intricate issue of coke formation in heterogeneous catalysis.
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in understanding coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts have opened avenues for exploring novel methodologies and emerging fields. Future research should concentrate on refining the molecular-level mechanism of coke formation, developing more precise models that can predict and control coke growth. The optimization of promoter selection and loading, guided by a robust theoretical framework, is essential for enhancing catalyst performance. The design of advanced catalysts, such as those employing single atom/site strategies and confined Pt clusters, should be further pursued to minimize coke formation. Strategies for lowering regeneration temperatures without compromising catalyst activity and stability are critical for economic and operational efficiency. Collaborative efforts between experimental and computational disciplines are imperative to unravel the complexities of heterogeneous catalysis, particularly in addressing the challenge of coke formation. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning could offer new insights into catalyst design and process optimization, potentially revolutionizing the field of catalysis.
