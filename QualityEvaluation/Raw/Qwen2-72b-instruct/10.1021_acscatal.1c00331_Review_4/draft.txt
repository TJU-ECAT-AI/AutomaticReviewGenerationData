1. Coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts: Understanding mechanisms, developing mitigation strategies, and advancing catalyst design for improved performance and longevity

        Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, recognizing it as a crucial issue that affects commercial catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\]. Efforts have been made to understand and mitigate its detrimental effects. The structure, composition, and location of cokes are essential to inhibit coke formation, but the details of coke composition are still under debate \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\]. The kinetics of coke growth is important for coke formation, but existing models do not resolve the mechanism at the molecular level \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\]. Strategies such as cofeeding gas, metal promoter, and support modification have been verified as effective methods to prevent coke formation \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\]. Cofeeding hydrogen can remove coke precursors and weaken support acidity, while promoters like Sn can tune the catalytic properties of Pt, increasing activity and stability \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\]. However, determining the optimal kind and loading of promoter is still a challenge \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\]. Modifying conventional support alumina can facilitate coke transfer between metal and support \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\]. New catalyst designs, such as single atom/site strategies and confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, have shown excellent resistance to coke formation \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\]. Although these methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\]. Lowering regeneration temperature is important for reducing costs and stabilizing activity \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\]. Collaboration between experimental and computational techniques is needed to address the complex issue of coke formation in heterogeneous catalysis \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in understanding coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts have opened new avenues for research. Future directions might focus on refining models to resolve the molecular mechanism of coke formation, optimizing promoter selection and loading for enhanced stability and activity, and developing novel catalyst designs that further reduce coke formation. The integration of experimental and computational techniques holds promise for addressing the complexities of heterogeneous catalysis, particularly in the context of coke formation. Strategies to lower regeneration temperatures could significantly impact the economic viability of catalysts in industrial processes. Collaborative efforts between academia and industry could accelerate the translation of these findings into practical applications, leading to more efficient and sustainable catalytic systems.
