1.Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a crucial issue that has detrimental effects on catalyst performance. The structure, composition, and location of cokes are key factors in inhibiting coke formation, but their entangled nature and the ongoing debate about coke composition present significant challenges. The kinetics of coke growth is also important, but existing models have not been able to resolve the mechanism at the molecular level. Strategies to prevent coke formation include the use of cofeeding gases, metal promoters, and support modifications. Cofeeding hydrogen can remove coke precursors and reduce support acidity, while metal promoters like Sn can tune the catalytic properties of Pt, increasing activity and stability. Additives to conventional support alumina can modify acid/base strength and facilitate coke transfer between metal and support. Novel catalyst designs, such as single atom/site strategies and confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, have shown promise in resisting coke formation. While these methods can alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life. Lowering regeneration temperatures can reduce costs and stabilize activity. Further research is needed to address the complex issue of coke formation in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly through collaborations between experimental and computational techniques.

1.我们对Pt基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经发展到认识到这是一个关键问题，对催化剂性能有不利影响。焦炭的结构、组成和位置是抑制焦炭形成的关键因素，但它们的相互关联性质以及焦炭组成方面的持续争论构成了重大挑战。焦炭生长的反应动力学也很重要，但现有的模型还没有能够在分子水平上解决机制。防止焦炭形成的策略包括使用共进料气体、金属促进剂和支持物改性。共进料氢气可以去除焦炭前体并降低支持物的酸性，而像Sn这样的金属促进剂可以调整Pt的催化性质，同时提高活性和稳定性。向传统氧化铝支持物添加添加剂可以修改酸/碱强度并促进金属和支持物之间的焦炭转移。单原子/位点策略和在沸石中限制的亚纳米尺寸Pt簇等新型催化剂设计在抵抗焦炭形成方面显示出前景。虽然这些方法确实可以减轻焦炭形成，但再生仍然是延长催化剂寿命的必要条件。降低再生温度可以降低成本并稳定活性。需要进一步研究来解决异相催化中如焦炭形成等复杂问题，特别是通过实验和计算技术之间的合作。
