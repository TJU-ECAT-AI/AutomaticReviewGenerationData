1.Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a crucial issue, with efforts focused on understanding and mitigating its detrimental effects. The primary challenges include the entangled factors of coke structure, composition, and location, which are prerequisites for inhibiting coke formation, and the unresolved details of coke composition. The kinetics of coke growth is also a significant challenge, with existing models unable to resolve the mechanism at the molecular level. Various strategies have been developed to address these challenges, including the use of cofeeding gases, metal promoters, and support modifications to prevent coke formation. Cofeeding hydrogen can remove coke precursors and weaken support acidity, while metal promoters like Sn can tune the catalytic properties of Pt, increasing activity and stability. However, determining the optimal kind and loading of promoter remains a challenge. Additives to conventional support alumina can modify acid/base strength and facilitate coke transfer between metal and support. Novel catalyst designs, such as single atom/site strategies and confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, have shown promise in resisting coke formation. While these methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life. Strategies to lower regeneration temperatures are being explored to reduce costs and stabilize activity. Further research is needed, particularly in collaborations between experimental and computational techniques, to address the complex issue of coke formation in heterogeneous catalysis.

1.我们对Pt基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经发展到认识到这是一个关键问题，努力集中在理解和减轻其负面影响上。主要挑战包括焦炭结构、组成和位置的纠缠因素，这些是抑制焦炭形成的先决条件，以及焦炭组成细节的未解决。焦炭生长动力学也是一个重大挑战，现有模型无法在分子水平上解决机制。为了解决这些挑战，已经开发了各种策略，包括使用共喂气、金属促进剂和支持修改来防止焦炭形成。共喂氢气可以去除焦炭前体并削弱支撑酸性，而像Sn这样的金属促进剂可以调整Pt的催化性能，增加活性和稳定性。然而，确定最佳种类和负载量的促进剂仍然是一个挑战。添加到传统氧化铝支撑的添加剂可以修改酸/碱强度并促进金属和支持之间的焦炭转移。新型催化剂设计，如单原子/位点策略和在沸石中限制的亚纳米尺寸Pt簇，已显示出抵抗焦炭形成的前景。虽然这些方法可以缓解焦炭形成，但再生仍然是延长催化剂寿命的必要条件。正在探索降低再生温度的策略，以降低成本并稳定活性。需要进一步的研究，特别是在实验和计算技术之间的合作，以解决异相催化中如焦炭形成等复杂问题。
