1.Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, recognizing it as a crucial issue that affects commercial catalysts. Efforts have been made to understand and mitigate its detrimental effects. The structure, composition, and location of cokes are essential to inhibit coke formation, but the details of coke composition are still under debate. The kinetics of coke growth is important for coke formation, but existing models do not resolve the mechanism at the molecular level. Strategies such as cofeeding gas, metal promoter, and support modification have been verified as effective methods to prevent coke formation. Cofeeding hydrogen can remove coke precursors and weaken support acidity, while promoters like Sn can tune the catalytic properties of Pt, increasing activity and stability. However, determining the optimal kind and loading of promoter is still a challenge. Modifying conventional support alumina can facilitate coke transfer between metal and support. New catalyst designs, such as single atom/site strategies and confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, have shown excellent resistance to coke formation. Although these methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life. Lowering regeneration temperature is important for reducing costs and stabilizing activity. Collaboration between experimental and computational techniques is needed to address the complex issue of coke formation in heterogeneous catalysis.

1.我们对Pt基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经显著发展，认识到它是一个影响商业催化剂的关键问题。已经做出了努力来理解和减轻其不利影响。焦炭的结构、组成和位置对于抑制焦炭形成至关重要，但焦炭组成的细节仍在争论中。焦炭生长的速率对于焦炭形成具有明显的重要性，但现有的模型无法在分子水平上解决机制。已经证实，共喂气、金属促进剂和支持物改性是防止焦炭形成的有效方法。共喂氢气可以去除焦炭前体并削弱支持物的酸性，而像Sn这样的促进剂可以直接从几何和电子角度调整Pt的催化性质，同时提高活性和稳定性。然而，确定最佳种类和负载量的促进剂仍然是一个未解决的问题。修改传统的氧化铝支持物可以促进金属和支持物之间的焦炭转移。新的催化剂设计，如单原子/位点策略和在沸石中限制的亚纳米尺寸Pt簇，已经显示出对焦炭形成的出色抵抗力。尽管这些方法确实减轻了焦炭形成，但再生仍然是延长催化剂寿命的必要步骤。降低再生温度对于降低成本和稳定活性至关重要。实验和计算技术之间的合作迫切需要解决异相催化中如焦炭形成等复杂问题。
