1.Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a crucial issue, with efforts focused on understanding and mitigating its detrimental effects. The primary challenges include the entangled factors of coke structure, composition, and location, which are prerequisites for inhibiting coke formation, and the unresolved details of coke composition. The kinetics of coke growth is also a significant challenge, with existing models unable to resolve the mechanism at the molecular level. Various strategies have been developed to address these challenges, including the cofeeding of gases, metal promoters, and support modifications, which have been verified as effective methods to prevent coke formation. The cofeeding of hydrogen can remove coke precursors and weaken the acidity of the support, while metal promoters like Sn can tune the catalytic properties of Pt, increasing activity and stability. However, determining the optimal kind and loading of promoter remains a challenge. Support modifications can also facilitate coke transfer between the metal and support. Novel catalyst designs, such as single atom/site strategies and confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, have shown promise in resisting coke formation. While these methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life. Strategies to lower regeneration temperatures are being explored to reduce costs and stabilize activity.

1.我们对Pt基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经发展到认识到这是一个关键问题，努力集中在理解和减轻其不利影响上。主要挑战包括焦炭结构、组成和位置这些相互纠缠的因素，它们是抑制焦炭形成的先决条件，以及焦炭组成细节的未解之谜。焦炭生长的反应动力学也是一个重大挑战，现有的模型无法在分子水平上解析其机制。为应对这些挑战，已经开发了各种策略，包括验证为有效防止焦炭形成的气体共馈、金属促进剂和支持物改性。氢气的共馈可以去除焦炭前体并减弱支持物的酸性，而像Sn这样的金属促进剂可以调整Pt的催化性质，提高活性和稳定性。然而，确定最佳种类和负载量的促进剂仍然是一个挑战。支持物改性也可以促进金属和支持物之间的焦炭转移。新型催化剂设计，如单原子/位点策略和在沸石中限制的亚纳米尺寸Pt簇，已显示出抵抗焦炭形成的潜力。虽然这些方法确实减轻了焦炭的形成，但再生仍然是延长催化剂寿命的必要步骤。正在探索降低再生温度的策略，以降低成本并稳定活性。需要进一步的研究来解决异相催化中的复杂问题，如焦炭形成，通过实验和计算技术之间的合作。

1.Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a crucial issue that has detrimental effects on catalyst performance. The structure, composition, and location of cokes are key factors in inhibiting coke formation, but their entangled nature and the ongoing debate about coke composition present significant challenges. The kinetics of coke growth is also important, but existing models have not been able to resolve the mechanism at the molecular level. Strategies to prevent coke formation include the use of cofeeding gases, metal promoters, and support modifications. Cofeeding hydrogen can remove coke precursors and reduce support acidity, while metal promoters like Sn can tune the catalytic properties of Pt, increasing activity and stability. Additives to conventional support alumina can modify acid/base strength and facilitate coke transfer between metal and support. Novel catalyst designs, such as single atom/site strategies and confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, have shown promise in resisting coke formation. While these methods can alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life. Lowering regeneration temperatures can reduce costs and stabilize activity. Further research is needed to address the complex issue of coke formation in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly through collaborations between experimental and computational techniques.

1.对于商业Pt基催化剂而言，焦炭沉积是一个关键问题，已经做出了许多努力来理解和减轻其不利影响。焦炭的结构、组成和位置是抑制焦炭形成的先决条件，但关于焦炭组成的细节仍在争论中。焦炭生长的反应动力学对焦炭形成具有明显的重要性，尽管有几种模型可用，但没有一种模型能够解决分子水平上的机制。共喂气、金属促进剂和支持物改性是防止焦炭形成的已验证的有效方法。氢气的共喂可以去除焦炭前体并削弱支持物的酸性。促进剂，如Sn，直接从几何和电子的角度调整Pt的催化性能，同时提高活性和稳定性。对传统氧化铝支持物的添加剂可以修改酸/碱强度并促进金属和支持物之间的焦炭转移。单原子/位点策略的成功巧妙地利用了PDH中脱氢和副反应对尺寸的依赖性差异。在沸石中限制的亚纳米尺寸Pt簇可以在特定位置沉积，由于催化剂和支持物之间的独特相互作用，表现出对焦炭形成的出色抵抗力。尽管这些方法确实减轻了焦炭的形成，但再生仍然是延长催化剂寿命的必要条件。一些策略似乎有助于降低再生温度，这对于降低成本和稳定活性非常重要。最终，实验和计算技术之间的合作迫切需要解决诸如焦炭形成等在异相催化中的复杂问题。
