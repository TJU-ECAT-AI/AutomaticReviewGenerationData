1.Coke deposition is a critical issue for commercial Pt-based catalysts, and significant efforts have been made to understand and mitigate its detrimental effects. The structure, composition, and location of cokes are essential to inhibit coke formation, but the details of coke composition are still under debate. The kinetics of coke growth is important for coke formation, but existing models cannot resolve the mechanism at the molecular level. Cofeeding gas, metal promoter, and support modification are effective methods to prevent coke formation. Cofeeding hydrogen can remove coke precursors and weaken the acidity of the support. Promoters like Sn can tune the catalytic properties of Pt from both a geometric and electronic perspective, increasing activity and stability. Additives to conventional support alumina can modify acid/base strength and facilitate coke transfer between metal and support. The single atom/site strategy has been successful in exploiting the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH. Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolite exhibit excellent resistance to coke formation due to unique interactions between catalyst and support. Although these methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life. Some strategies can lower regeneration temperatures, reducing costs and stabilizing activity. Collaboration between experimental and computational techniques is urgently needed to address complex issues in heterogeneous catalysis, such as coke formation.

1.对于商业Pt基催化剂而言，焦炭沉积是一个关键问题，已经做出了许多努力来理解和减轻其不利影响。焦炭的结构、组成和位置是抑制焦炭形成的先决条件，但关于焦炭组成的细节仍在争论中。焦炭生长的反应动力学对焦炭形成具有明显的重要性，尽管有几种模型可用，但没有一种模型能够解决分子水平上的机制。共喂气、金属促进剂和支持物改性是防止焦炭形成的已验证的有效方法。氢气的共喂可以去除焦炭前体并削弱支持物的酸性。促进剂，如Sn，直接从几何和电子的角度调整Pt的催化性能，同时提高活性和稳定性。对传统氧化铝支持物的添加剂可以修改酸/碱强度并促进金属和支持物之间的焦炭转移。单原子/位点策略的成功巧妙地利用了PDH中脱氢和副反应对尺寸的依赖性差异。在沸石中限制的亚纳米尺寸Pt簇可以在特定位置沉积，由于催化剂和支持物之间的独特相互作用，表现出对焦炭形成的出色抵抗力。尽管这些方法确实减轻了焦炭的形成，但再生仍然是延长催化剂寿命的必要条件。一些策略似乎有助于降低再生温度，这对于降低成本和稳定活性非常重要。最终，实验和计算技术之间的合作迫切需要解决诸如焦炭形成等在异相催化中的复杂问题。
