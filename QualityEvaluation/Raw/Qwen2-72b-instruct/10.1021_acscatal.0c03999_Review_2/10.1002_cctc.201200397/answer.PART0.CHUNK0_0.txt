[1] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."
[2] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."
[3] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."
[4] "Therefore, the development of a suitable promoter to activate CO2 that would enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 and also maintain a stable selectivity for propylene is highly desirable."
[5] "Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."
[6] "The regenerated CrOx could act as active sites in the ODHP reaction, which leads to reduced deactivation of the catalyst."

1.Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing the oxidizing ability of CO2, which is crucial for reoxidation of the reduced CrOx. They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Unlike O2 co-feeding, which can decrease the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 significantly, promoters maintain a stable selectivity for propylene while enhancing the oxidizing ability of CO2. This leads to reduced deactivation of the catalyst and improved overall catalytic performance.

1.促进剂通过增强二氧化碳的氧化能力，解决了铬基催化体系中二氧化碳氧化潜力弱和惰性的问题，这对于还原CrOx的再氧化至关重要。与氧气共喂料等替代策略相比，它们在增强二氧化碳活化、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能方面具有特定优势。与氧气共喂料不同，氧气共喂料会显著降低C3H6反应的选择性，促进剂在增强二氧化碳氧化能力的同时，保持了对丙烯的稳定选择性，从而减少了催化剂的失活，提高了整体催化性能。
