[1] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."
[2] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."
[3] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."
[4] "Therefore, the development of a suitable promoter to activate CO2 that would enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 and also maintain a stable selectivity for propylene is highly desirable."
[5] "Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."
[6] "The chemisorbed CO2 undergoes a sequential carbonoxygen bond cleavage to generate CO and activated O (O*ads). Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction."
[7] "The regenerated CrOx could act as active sites in the ODHP reaction, which leads to reduced deactivation of the catalyst."

1.Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing the oxidizing ability of CO2, which is crucial for the reoxidation of reduced CrOx species. This is achieved through the activation of CO2, leading to its dissociation into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads). The generated O*ads plays a key role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, thereby regenerating the active sites and reducing catalyst deactivation. Promoters offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation and improving oxidizing ability without compromising the selectivity and stability of the catalytic performance. O2 co-feeding, while effective in decreasing the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts, significantly decreases the selectivity of the reaction for propylene. In contrast, promoters maintain a stable selectivity for propylene while enhancing the oxidizing ability of CO2.

1.促进剂通过增强二氧化碳的氧化能力，解决了铬基催化体系中二氧化碳氧化潜力弱和惰性的问题，这对于还原CrOx的再氧化至关重要。这是通过激活二氧化碳，使其分解为CO和活化氧（O*ads）来实现的。生成的O*ads在ODHP反应中对还原CrOx物种的再氧化中起着关键作用，从而再生活性位点，减少催化剂失活。与氧气共进料等替代策略相比，促进剂在增强二氧化碳活化和提高氧化能力方面提供了具体优势，同时保持了催化性能的选择性和稳定性。氧气共进料虽然能有效降低CrOx/硅催化剂的失活率，但会显著降低反应对丙烯的选择性。相比之下，促进剂在增强二氧化碳氧化能力的同时，保持了对丙烯的稳定选择性。
