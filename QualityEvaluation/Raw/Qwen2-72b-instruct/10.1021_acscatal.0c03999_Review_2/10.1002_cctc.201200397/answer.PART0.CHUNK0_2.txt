[1] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."
[2] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."
[3] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."
[4] "Therefore, the development of a suitable promoter to activate CO2 that would enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 and also maintain a stable selectivity for propylene is highly desirable."
[5] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions and the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction. Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."
[6] "The activation energy for the dissociation of CO2 on Ni atoms is significantly lowered than that for CO2 in the absence of Ni atoms through abinitio calculations."
[7] "The chemisorbed CO2 undergoes a sequential carbonoxygen bond cleavage to generate CO and activated O (O*ads). Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction."
[8] "The regenerated CrOx could act as active sites in the ODHP reaction, which leads to reduced deactivation of the catalyst."

1.Ni-based promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by significantly lowering the activation energy for CO2 dissociation, enhancing its oxidizing ability. This is achieved through the chemisorption of CO2 on Ni, leading to a sequential carbon-oxygen bond cleavage and the generation of CO and activated oxygen (O*ads). The O*ads generated on Ni can play a crucial role in the reoxidation of reduced CrOx species during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reaction, thereby regenerating CrOx as active sites and reducing catalyst deactivation. This strategy offers specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance, as it maintains a stable selectivity for propylene without significantly decreasing the selectivity of the reaction.

1.基于Ni的助剂通过显著降低CO2在Ni原子上的解离活化能，解决了CO2在基于铬的催化体系中氧化能力弱和惰性的局限性，从而增强了其氧化能力。这是通过CO2在Ni上的化学吸附实现的，导致碳氧键的顺序断裂和CO与活化氧(O*ads)的生成。在Ni上生成的O*ads在氧化脱氢丙烷与CO2(ODHP)反应中对还原的CrOx物种的再氧化中起着关键作用，从而再生CrOx作为活性位点，减少催化剂失活。与O2共进料等替代策略相比，该策略在增强CO2活化、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能方面具有特定优势，因为它在不显著降低反应选择性的情况下保持了对丙烯的稳定选择性。
