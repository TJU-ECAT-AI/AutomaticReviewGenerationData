[1] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."
[2] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."
[3] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."
[4] "Therefore, the development of a suitable promoter to activate CO2 that would enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 and also maintain a stable selectivity for propylene is highly desirable."
[5] "Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction."
[6] "The regenerated CrOx could act as active sites in the ODHP reaction, which leads to reduced deactivation of the catalyst."

1.Ni-based catalysts address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing the oxidizing ability of CO2, which can reoxidize the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction. This leads to reduced deactivation of the catalyst. The addition of O2 can also improve the oxidizing power, but it decreases the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 significantly. Therefore, the development of a suitable promoter like Ni to activate CO2 is highly desirable as it can enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 and maintain a stable selectivity for propylene.

1.基于镍的催化剂通过增强二氧化碳的氧化能力，解决了铬基催化体系中二氧化碳氧化能力弱和惰性的限制，可以在ODHP反应中重新氧化还原的CrOx物种，从而减少催化剂的失活。添加氧气也可以提高氧化能力，但会显著降低C3H6的反应选择性。因此，开发像Ni这样的合适促进剂来激活二氧化碳是非常理想的，因为它可以增强二氧化碳的氧化能力，并保持对丙烯的稳定选择性。
