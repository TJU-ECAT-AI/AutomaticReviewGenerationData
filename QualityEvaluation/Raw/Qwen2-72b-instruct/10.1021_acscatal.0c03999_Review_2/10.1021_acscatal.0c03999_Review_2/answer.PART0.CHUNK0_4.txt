<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1.Promoters are introduced to facilitate CO2 activation on chromium-based catalysts, improving the oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance. This strategy overcomes the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness, offering an alternative to O2 co-feeding which can result in a drop in selectivity.
