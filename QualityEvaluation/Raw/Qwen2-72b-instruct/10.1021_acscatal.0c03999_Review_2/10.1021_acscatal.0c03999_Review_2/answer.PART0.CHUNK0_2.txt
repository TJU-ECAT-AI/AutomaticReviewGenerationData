<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1.Promoters are introduced to facilitate CO2 activation on chromium-based catalysts, improving the oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance. This is an alternative strategy to overcome the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness, offering advantages over O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation and achieving selective catalytic performance.
