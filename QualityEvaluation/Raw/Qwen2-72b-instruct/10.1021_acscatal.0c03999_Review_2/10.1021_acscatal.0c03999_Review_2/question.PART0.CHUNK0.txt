3.1.1.3. Effects of Promoter
CO2 has been proposed to participate in the redox cycles of Cr2+  Cr3+ (59,64) or Cr3+  Cr6+; (56,80,91) however, its oxidation potential is rather weak. Besides, CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx. (59) The addition of O2 in the reactants as a co-feed with CO2 has been initially proposed to overcome these issues, yet the selectivity drops. (55) An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance.
Alkali Metal Oxides Because of their basic property, alkali metal oxides have been widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions. (92) Ge et al. have prepared K-promoted Cr2O3/SiO2 with various K loadings for CO2ODHP. (51) The addition of K results in the reduction of C3H8 conversion in comparison to unpromoted Cr2O3/SiO2, though a higher C3H6 selectivity is obtained (Table 2). According to characterization results, K addition modifies the Cr2O3 surface by decreasing its redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in the drop in C3H8 conversion. Similar impacts are evident on Li-/Na-promoted Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts, except that the stability of C3H6 yield can be improved by K. (93) IR results show that a substantial part of protons in hydroxyl groups on the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 are replaced by alkali metal ions, the loss of which accounts for the drop in activity on promoted catalysts.
Transition Metals (Ru and Ni) Ru is a potential promoter because of its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation. (94,95) Jin et al. have prepared Ru-promoted Cr2O3/SiO2 and clarified the Ru loading-dependent reactivity in CO2ODHP. (68) C3H8 conversion presents a volcano-like trend that maximizes at Ru = 1 wt. % with almost doubled C3H8 conversion and improved C3H6 selectivity in comparison to the unpromoted counterpart (Table 2). A proper amount of Ru plays an important role in optimizing activity and selectivity because it can balance the RWGS and C3H6 reforming.
Ni is also a potential candidate because of its activity in CO2 activation for CO2 reforming reactions (96,97) and RWGS. (98100) Yun et al. have prepared Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalysts for CO2ODHP. (56) In the calcined form, NiO and CrOx distribute in the vicinity of one another, and the presence of Ni can affect the Cr species by converting them to nickel chromate. The Ni-promoted catalyst outperforms the unpromoted counterpart in both activity and stability (Table 2). Particularly, CO2 conversion has been significantly improved. The major role of Ni is to facilitate CO2 dissociation to CO and an adsorbed O* next to the Ni site, which can subsequently regenerate Cr3+ via reoxidation.
3.1.1.4. Innovation in Preparation Methods
Dispersion and types of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts are crucial in determining the catalytic performance, and can be generally tuned by pH, ligand effect, and surfactant. Synthetic approaches include (N0Mn+)I0 pathway, (69) metal vapor synthesis method, (70) and solgel method. (71) Efforts are also devoted to improving selectivity while preserving activity of CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, as they present outstanding C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, though CH4 is dominant (section 3.1.1.2). Synthetic methods revolve around tuning the surface acidbase properties, crystalline structure, and textural properties. Developed synthetic approaches include hydrothermal methods (61) and acidbase pairs. (101) (N0Mn+)I0 Pathway Driven by Electrostatic Driving Force Dispersion of Cr6+ species and crystallite size are sensitive to pH during the synthesis. (69) At pH < 2, Cr species are present in the forms of tri- and tetrachromates (Cr3O102 and Cr4O132, respectively), which are highly polymerized and susceptible to forming inactive crystalline Î±-Cr2O3; at 2 < pH < 6, the formation of smaller Cr anions, such as dichromate (Cr2O72), is favored, leading to better Cr dispersion; at pH > 8, isolated CrO4 is stable but hardly leads to high activity for CO2ODHP. To obtain highly dispersed Cr species with desired types, Baek et al. have introduced a (N0Mn+)I0 pathway to prepare MSU-x-supported Cr catalysts at pH = 4, in which N0 is a nonionic poly(ethylene oxide) surfactant, Mn+ is the metal cation, and I0 is an electrically neutral silica precursor, and the assembly process of metal cations is driven by electrostatic control. (69) Chromium(III) acetate hydroxide ((CH3CO2)7Cr3(OH)2) is used to offer both Cr3+ cations and electrostatic driving force, as well as helping to disperse the precursor molecules through the steric effect of ligands. The as-prepared catalysts present a mesopore structure resembling 3D wormhole-like holes with high surface areas (e.g., 730903 m2 g1), pore volumes (e.g., 0.711.03 cm3 g1), and narrow pore size (e.g., 3.94.5 nm). Optimal catalytic performance is achieved at Cr = 1.27 wt. %, which also outperforms the catalyst prepared by IWI with the same Cr loading (Table 2). The H2-TPR profiles reveal the presence of isolated and polymeric Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts, which are designated as hard and soft Cr6+ species, respectively, based on their reducibility. Soft Cr6+ species are crucial to achieve high catalytic performance, while hard species have a negative impact on activity. During the reaction, these soft Cr6+ species-derived coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species promote RWGS and C3H6 formation through the redox cycle of Cr3+  Cr6+.Metal Vapor Synthesis Method The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) method enables the co-condensation of metal vapor with the vapor of weakly stabilizing organic ligands during the preparation, the well-defined organometallic species or solvent-stabilized metal clusters are formed, which is conducive to prepare supported metal catalysts on a wide range of organic and inorganic support materials. (102105) On Cr-based catalysts, this method allows high Cr dispersion even at quite high loadings, particularly useful for the support with limited surface area. Botavina et al. have prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts by the MVS method with a wide range of Cr loadings, namely, 0.2510 wt. %. (70) An optimal Cr loading is obtained at 6.0 wt. % (Table 2), at which both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield have been substantially increased by 1.8- and 1.7-fold, respectively, in comparison to Cr0.25/SiO2, while the reduction of C3H6 selectivity is merely 7.3%.SolGel Method Wang et al. have prepared CrOx-doped mesoporous silica sphere (Cr/MSS) catalysts by one-pot synthesis via a solgel method, and systematically investigated the influence of adding active precursors on the morphology, pore structure, and active species, as well as their correlation with catalytic performance. (71) Generally, all synthetic procedures entail the first step of preparing a surfactant solution (CTAB and triethanolamine, TEAH3) and the second step of adding a Si source. The catalysts are categorized into three groups, namely, MSS-1, MSS-2, and MSS-3, representing adding the Cr precursor in the first step, second step, and after the second step, respectively. For Cr/MSS-2, adding the Cr precursor concurrently with the Si source exerts well-dispersed Cr species on the micelle-silica walls with the gradual generation of silica walls, and no Cr species enter the core of the silica sphere. Such a feature results in high dispersion of Cr species with more isolated chromates, enhanced medium acid sites, and well-retained pore structure of the silica sphere. Therefore, Cr/MSS-2 exhibits the highest C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, with slightly lower C3H6 selectivity among three catalysts, and also outperforms the benchmark Cr/MSS-4, prepared by IWI (Table 2).Hydrothermal Method Oliveira et al. have prepared Cr/ZrO2 via a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, a facile, time-efficient method to prepare oxides with smaller crystallites through fast nucleation. (61) The incorporation of microwave results in the formation of smaller tetragonal t-ZrO2 crystallite. At lower Cr content (i.e., 5 wt. %), m-Cr/ZrO2, prepared by the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, displays higher activity in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield than c-Cr/ZrO2, prepared by a conventional hydrothermal method, but lower C3H6 selectivity, as well as faster deactivation (Table 2). Wu et al. have investigated the temperature effects of hydrothermal treatment on the catalytic performance on CrZr bimetallic oxides, and obtained optimal activity and selectivity on the catalyst treated at 180 C (Table 2). (72) At this temperature, more Cr6+ species, a precursor of active species Cr3+/Cr2+ species, are formed, leading to the substantially enhanced activity with well-retained high selectivity.AcidBase Pair The acidbase pair concept is a self-adjusted process that has been widely used to prepare ordered, mesoporous multimetal oxides, (101) in which the pH of the desired solgel reaction is adjusted by a self-generated reaction medium between two or more inorganic species with the correct acidity. (106) Xie et al. have prepared Cr oxide-modified mesoporous ZrO2 (Cr-ZrO2) via the acidbase pair pathway. (73) The as-prepared bimetallic oxides feature mesoporous structures resembling 3D wormholes. The crystalline structure of ZrO2 shifts from a monoclinic to tetragonal, then to disordered crystals with the increased Cr content, which in turn affects the dispersion of Cr species. 7Cr-ZrO2 presents more abundant well-dispersed Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species, which are precursors for the formation of active Cr3+/Cr2+ species during reaction, thereby leading to the highest initial activity and selectivity (Table 2).
