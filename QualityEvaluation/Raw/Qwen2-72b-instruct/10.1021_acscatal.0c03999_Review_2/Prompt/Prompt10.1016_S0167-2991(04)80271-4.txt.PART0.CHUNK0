1. INTRODUCTION
Silica or alumina supported chromium oxide was industrially used for the productions of propene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes.' CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide. Supported chromium oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes4 with oxygen. The reduction-oxidation property and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions.4 MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore size from 2 to 10 nm as well as high surface area (ca. 1000 m g"1), and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support.
Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 with oxygen, but the selectivity to C3H6 was low and the yield of C3H6 was lower than 5%.5 Recently, a SBA-15 supported chromium oxide by the impregnation method has been applied to the dehydrogenation and the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 (1) and showed good catalytic performances.6 This reaction is also interesting from the view point of CO2 utilization since CO2 can be in situ converted to useful

324 In the present paper, we report the catalytic behaviors of Cr-MCM-41 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 by CO2.
2. EXPERIMENTAL
M-MCM-41 catalysts (M=Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co) were prepared by the direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis and Cr-MCM-41 catalyst was also prepared by the template-ion exchange (TIE) method.7"11 Cr/Cab-O-Sil and Cr/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnation of nonporous Cab-O-Sil and SiO2 as the support as a comparison. The synthesized materials were analyzed by ICP and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption (77 K), diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS), and UV-Raman spectroscopic measurements.8"11 The catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 was carried out with U-shaped Pyrex reactor by using 0.4 g of the catalyst as a fixed bed at 550 C. Partial pressures of C3H8 and CO2 were 12.2 and 68.9 kPa, respectively, and a flow rate of the mixed gas was 50 ml min'1.10'11
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Structure and activity of Cr-MCM-41
Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene. It was confirmed that CO was selectively produced from

- 325 DHT in the C02 dehydrogenation of C3H8. When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1).
Cr-Cab-O-Sil showed a low surface area compared to Cr-MCM-41 and no detectable pore volume. While MCM-41 was white, the color of Cr-MCM-41 was pale green as synthesized and changed to pale yellow after the calcinations at 550 C for 6 h. XRD patterns at low diffraction angles showed four diffraction lines at 20 degrees of ca. 2.2, 3.6, 4.3, and 5.7 indexed to (100), (110), (200), and (210) of the regularity of hexagonal array of mesopores of MCM-41 for all the samples. The peak intensities for the Cr-containing MCM-41 samples were not significantly lowered as compared with those for the purely silicious MCM-41,suggesting that the long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays of mesopores of MCM-41 was sustained after the introduction of chromium up to a content of 1.7 wt% (Si/Cr=50). However, as Si/Cr ratio increased to 25 (3.4 wt% of the Cr content), these diffraction peaks significantly decreased, indicating a decrease in the structural regularity of the mesoporous structure at higher Cr content. This was clearly seen also in the drop in pore volume and surface area at Si/Cr=25 (Table 1).
We have reported that only one kind of monochromate species was observed on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method,whereas several types of chromate species Fig. 2. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra possibly including both monochromates and polychromates existed on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method by UV Raman spectroscopy.11 Moreover, the two methods resulted in different locations of the accomodated metal cations: highly dispersed metal ions on the wall surface within MCM-41 mesopores for
TIE,
and monomeric metal species incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41 for DHT.1011 The chromium species in the as-synthesized samples by both methods exist in small Cr3+ oxide clusters with octahedrally coordinated chromium, and these species are transformed to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ after the calcination.
Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of Cr-MCM-41-DHT and Fig. 3. Effects of the Cr content. 326 Cr/Cab-O-Sil samples with both Si/Cr ratios of 50 are compared in Fig. 2. UV bands at 280 and 370 nm, which could be assigned to O-Cr6+ charge transfer of chromates species,12 were mainly observed for both samples. Although a weak shoulder around 440 nm assigned to Cr6+ polychromate was observed for Cr-MCM-41, the difference between the DHT and the TIE samples was not distinct. The bands at 445 and 611 nm, characteristic for Cr/Cab-O-Sil, could be assigned to octahedral Cr3+ in Cr2O3 or CrOx clusters, while the Cr6+ species observed at 280 and 370 nm could be in tetrahedral coordination. Actually, the diffraction lines of Cr
2C>3
were clearly observed in XRD patterns of Cr/Cab-O-Sil.
The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction. Also the BET surface area and pore volume decreased largely as the Cr content increased to 3.4 wt% (Si/Cr=25), the conversion of CsH8 and the yield of CsH6 still increased with Cr content, indicating such change in the porous structure did not significantly influence the catalytic behavior. Although the dehydrogenation of C3H8 took place in the absence of CO2 to reach 10% of C3H8 conversion,the conversion of C3H8 increased remarkably with an increase in the partial pressure of CO2.
3.2. Deactivation and reactivation of catalysts
During the reaction over Cr-MCM-41 DHT and Cr/Cab-O-Sil catalysts with both Si/Cr ratios of 50, the conversion of C3H8 gradually decreased, indicating an occurring of the deactivation of catalyst (Fig. 4). The activity of Cr-MCM-41 was easily regenerated to give the original value of C3H8 conversion, but that of Cr/Cab-O-Sil was not recovered at all, by the treatment with O2. When both catalysts were again put in the reaction conditions after the O2 treatment, the conversion of C3H8 decreased almost similar way to the first reaction step.
According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction. In the results of Fourier transforms of -weighted CriC-edge EXAFS (Fig. 6, a & b), a single peak was observed before reaction and could be assigned to the bond of Cr-O, consisting of two Cr=O bonds and two Cr-0 bonds in Cr6+O4 tetrahedra. After the reaction, two distinct peaks were observed at 1.60 and 2.63 A (non-phase-shift corrected). Similar two peaks were also Fig. 4. O2 treatment of deactivated catalysts. 327 observed for Cr 2C>3 or Cr/Cab-O-Sil, and as described above in the results of diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of Cr/Cab-O-Sil sample these two peaks could be assigned to the bonds of Cr-0 in Cr3+O6 octahedra and Cr-O-Cr through edge-shared Cr3+O6 octahedra.
However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters.13 After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c).
Moreover,this Cr6+O4 Fig. 5. XANES of Cr-MCM-41-DHT. Fig. 6. EXAFS of Cr-MCM-41-DHT. a) before the reaction; b) after the reaction for 5 h; c) after the O2 treatment;d) after the 2nd reaction for 5 h. tetrahedra was again changed to the Cr3+O6 octahedra after the reaction for 5 h. The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation.
These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation. On the other hand, in the spectra of XANES and EXAFS for the Cr/Cab-O-Sil, the preedge peak was weak even before the reaction and both peaks assigned to the bonds of Cr-0 in Cr3+O6 octahedra and Cr-O-Cr through edge-shared Cr3+O6 octahedra were always observed both before and after the reaction. These results also well explained the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation of Cr/Cab-O-Sil shown in Fig. 4. According to the results of curve deconvolution of the EXAFS spectrum of Cr/Cab-O-Sil, it is estimated that the spectrum is consisted of 30 % tetrahedral and 70 % octahedral coordination. No significant change was observed in this spectrum during the reaction, even before and after the reoxidation treatment.
The results of TPR for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT (Si/Cr=50) sample are shown in Fig. 7. A peak observed between 350600 C (a) is probably due to the reduction of Cr6+,14 and disappeared in the second TPR (b). When the sample after the second TPR was treated with 328 C02 at 550 C, the reduction peak was again observed in the TPR (c) and the peak area was 71 % of that in a. A similar peak change was also observed in the TPR of Cr/Cab-O-Sil, but the reduction peak area of the fresh sample was far smaller than that of Cr-MCM-41 and moreover the peak area after the CO2 treatment was 50 % of the fresh one.
Coke amount estimated by
TPO
measurements of the catalyst after the reaction was 0.73 mg on Cr-MCM-41-DHT less than that on Cr/SiO2 (1.52 mg). Even though coke is eliminated and the catalyst can be reactivated during the reoxidation treatment with O2,contribution of the regeneration of Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra is more strongly suggested as the mechanism of activity recovering of Cr-MCM-41-DHT.
4. CONCLUSION
Fig. 7. TPR of Cr-MCM-41.
It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the CsH8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41. Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+Og octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS. It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41. 1) A.
