Oxidative DehydrogenationofPropane onRare EarthVanadates Intluence ofthe presence ofCO2 in the feed Bao Zhaorigetu, Roger Kieffer*, Jean-Paul Hindermann LERCSI EHICS 1, rue Blaise Pascal 67008 Strasbourg France 1049 Abstract The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on rare earth vanadates is always in competition with the total oxidation of the alkane which leads to the formation of C02 and CO. Addition of C02 into the feed results in an increased C3H6 selectivity together with a decreased CO formation through the total oxidation of the alkane or the formed alkene. For the tested rare earth vanadates as well as for the niobium. promoted catalysts an enhancement of the C3H6 selectivity at isoconversion and thus of the C3H6 yields is observed upon C02 addition into the feed.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rare earth vanadates are suitable catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and were more particularly tested in that reaction with propane and butane [l-S]. Further, it was shown that these definite compounds with huttonite (LaV04) or zirkon (other rare earth vanadates) structures [6] have better performances than catalysts prepared by mixing the two oxides (La203 - V20S) or the impregnation ofone of these oxides by a salt of the other component [7,8]. Even more, the definite compounds are much more stable in the high temperature range (400 to 600C) of propane dehydrogenation than the mixtures or impregnates.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is always in competition with the total oxidation of propane or of the formed propene producing CO and C02 as shown in the following scheme:1/202 -------------,l.

2 Previous mechanistic studies [9-13] on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are in accordance with a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involving the oxygen of the surface of the catalyst in the dehydrogenation reaction and molecular oxygen in the formation of CO and C02. Each reaction takes place,in fact, on a specific catalytic site [12]. 1050 In order to diminish the unavoidable total oxidation, most of the authors working on various catalytic systems propose to modify the reaction conditions: decrease of the 02/CaHs ratio, of the contact time and/or the reaction temperature [la]. In most of the experiments an increase of selectivity and a decrease of activity were observed, but the selectivity at isoconversion remains constant and the CaH6 yield is never significantly enhanced.
It was found, in our laboratory, that the formation of CaH6 at a given conversion can be improved by two different means for rare earth vanadates 1- by blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface (e.g. rare earth oxide sites) by promotion of the catalyst with another oxide like Nb205, MoOa or Bi20a which reacts with the rare earth oxide not involved in the structure [S] 2- by the addition of C02 into the feed, the absorption - desorption equilibrium of C02 on the surface, probably on the basic oxidation sites,decreasing thus the amount of molecular oxygen which is believed to be responsible for the total oxidation of propane.
The aim of the present work is to study the second possibility and to optimize the feed composition of the oxidative propane dehydrogenation on rare earth vanadates.
2. EXPERIMENTAL
LnV04 (Ln = rare earth) catalysts were prepared by a sol-gel process by precipitation of the precursor from aqueous solutions of rare earth nitrates and ammonium vanadates. The dried precipitate was annealed in air at T =600C during 2 hours. The calcination process was followed by TG and TPD. The BET surface areas of the prepared vanadates, measured by N2 physisoption are listed below Catalysts BET m2 g-1 LaV04

How do promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, and what specific advantages do they offer over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
