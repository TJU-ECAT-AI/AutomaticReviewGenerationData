Enhancing CO2 activation and oxidation in chromium-based catalytic systems presents a significant challenge due to CO2's kinetic and thermodynamic stability. To overcome this, researchers have employed various strategies, including the modification of the catalyst's electronic and geometric properties. The introduction of promoters, such as alkali or alkaline earth metals, has proven effective in enhancing the catalytic performance and selectivity. These promoters facilitate the adsorption of CO2 and promote its activation by altering the electronic structure of the chromium center. Additionally, the use of bimetallic systems and the control of the catalyst's morphology have also shown promise in improving the catalytic activity. Through these approaches, the efficiency of CO2 conversion into value-added products can be significantly increased, making chromium-based catalysts more viable for industrial applications in CO2 utilization and valorization.
