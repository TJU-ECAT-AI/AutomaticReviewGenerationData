The utilization of promoters in chromium-based catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation is pivotal in addressing the inherent limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness \[10.1002/cctc.201200397\]. These promoters significantly enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2, which is essential for the reoxidation of reduced CrOx species. Alternative strategies, such as O2 co-feeding, can decrease the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts, but they come with a significant drawback: a decrease in the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 \[10.1002/cctc.201200397\]. In contrast, promoters, particularly Ni-based catalysts, offer a distinct advantage by activating CO2 under harsh reaction conditions, lowering the activation energy for CO2 dissociation, and generating activated oxygen (O*ads) that can reoxidize reduced CrOx species without compromising the selectivity and stability of the catalytic performance \[10.1002/cctc.201200397\].
                ※※※
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The role of promoters in enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation is a promising avenue for future research. Building on the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there is an opportunity to explore the development of novel promoters that can further improve the catalytic performance under even more challenging conditions. Future research endeavors might focus on the design of multifunctional promoters that not only enhance CO2 activation but also improve the selectivity and stability of the catalytic systems. Additionally, the integration of computational methods with experimental approaches could provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of CO2 activation and the role of promoters in these processes, guiding the rational design of next-generation catalysts.
