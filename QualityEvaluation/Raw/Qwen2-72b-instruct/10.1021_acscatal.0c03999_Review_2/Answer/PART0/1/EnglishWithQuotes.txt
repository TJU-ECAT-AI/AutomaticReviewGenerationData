Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction.\"\n          [10] \"The regenerated CrOx could act as active sites in the ODHP reaction, which leads to reduced deactivation of the catalyst.\"", "English": "Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing the oxidizing ability of CO2, which is crucial for the reoxidation of reduced CrOx species. Alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding can decrease the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts, but they significantly decrease the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6. Promoters, particularly Ni-based catalysts, offer the advantage of activating CO2 under harsh reaction conditions, lowering the activation energy for CO2 dissociation, and generating activated oxygen (O*ads) that can reoxidize reduced CrOx species without compromising the selectivity and stability of the catalytic performance.", "Doi": "10.1002/cctc.201200397"},
