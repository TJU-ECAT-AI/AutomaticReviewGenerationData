Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing the oxidizing ability of CO2, which is crucial for the reoxidation of reduced CrOx species. Alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding can decrease the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts, but they significantly decrease the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6. Promoters, particularly Ni-based catalysts, offer the advantage of activating CO2 under harsh reaction conditions, lowering the activation energy for CO2 dissociation, and generating activated oxygen (O*ads) that can reoxidize reduced CrOx species without compromising the selectivity and stability of the catalytic performance.

Promoters are introduced to facilitate CO2 activation on chromium-based catalysts, improving the oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance. This strategy overcomes the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness, offering an alternative to O2 co-feeding which can result in a drop in selectivity.
