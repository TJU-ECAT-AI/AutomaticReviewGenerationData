          [1] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."
          [2] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."
          [3] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."
          [4] "Therefore, the development of a suitable promoter to activate CO2 that would enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 and also maintain a stable selectivity for propylene is highly desirable."
          [5] "Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."
          [6] "The regenerated CrOx could act as active sites in the ODHP reaction, which leads to reduced deactivation of the catalyst."
          [7] "Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction."
          [8] "The activation energy for the dissociation of CO2 on Ni atoms is significantly lowered than that for CO2 in the absence of Ni atoms through abinitio calculations."
          [9] "The chemisorbed CO2 undergoes a sequential carbonoxygen bond cleavage to generate CO and activated O (O*ads). Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction."
          [10] "The regenerated CrOx could act as active sites in the ODHP reaction, which leads to reduced deactivation of the catalyst."

          Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing the oxidizing ability of CO2, which is crucial for the reoxidation of reduced CrOx species. Alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding can decrease the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts, but they significantly decrease the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6. Promoters, particularly Ni-based catalysts, offer the advantage of activating CO2 under harsh reaction conditions, lowering the activation energy for CO2 dissociation, and generating activated oxygen (O*ads) that can reoxidize reduced CrOx species without compromising the selectivity and stability of the catalytic performance.

          促进剂通过增强二氧化碳的氧化能力，解决了铬基催化体系中二氧化碳氧化潜力弱和惰性的问题，这对于还原CrOx物种的再氧化至关重要。像O2共进料这样的替代策略虽然可以降低CrOx/硅催化剂的失活率，但会显著降低反应对C3H6的选择性。特别是Ni基催化剂，促进剂具有在苛刻反应条件下活化二氧化碳、降低二氧化碳解离的活化能和生成活性氧（O*ads）的优势，可以在不损害选择性和催化性能稳定性的情况下，再氧化还原的CrOx物种。
