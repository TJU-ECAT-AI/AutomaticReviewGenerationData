Many heterogeneous catalytic reactions occur at high temperatures, which may cause large
energy costs, poor safety, and thermal degradation of catalysts. Here, we propose a light-
assisted surface reaction, which catalyze the surface reaction using both light and heat as an
energy source. Conventional metal catalysts such as ruthenium, rhodium, platinum, nickel,
and copper were tested for CO2 hydrogenation, and ruthenium showed the most distinct
change upon light irradiation. CO2 was strongly adsorbed onto ruthenium surface, forming
hybrid orbitals. The band gap energy was reduced signiﬁcantly upon hybridization, enhancing
CO2 dissociation. The light-assisted CO2 hydrogenation used only 37% of the total energy
with which the CO2 hydrogenation occurred using only thermal energy. The CO2 conversion
could be turned on and off completely with a response time of only 3 min, whereas con-
ventional thermal reaction required hours. These unique features can be potentially used for
on-demand fuel production with minimal energy input.

etal nanoparticles loaded onto supports have been
typically used as heterogeneous catalysts for surface
reactions such as hydrogenation, oxidation, reforming,
and coupling reactions1–5. Surface reactions often require high
temperatures to overcome the activation energy barrier. Operat-
ing the reactor at a high temperature may demand excessive
energy and stringent safety controls. Recently, light-assisted sur-
face reactions have been reported6–11. Using heat and light
together as two different energy sources might minimize the
overall energy usage and provide unique features, which cannot
be provided by conventional thermal catalytic reactions.
Enhancing the catalytic activity under light irradiation has
been reported for heterogeneous reactions including ethylene
epoxidation

shift
reaction on Al@Cu2O, ethanol dehydrogenation on Ag–Ni
nanosnowmans6–8. Light is absorbed on the catalyst and then
transferred to reactant molecules on the surface by heat or hot
electrons. The photothermal effect, in which absorbed light
energy is relaxed as heat, would occur only with a very strong
light that is orders of magnitude higher than the intensity of
sunlight12–15.
Hot electrons are generated on metal nanoparticles by an
intraband or interband transition upon light absorption. Loca-
lized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is a typical intraband
transition that can be derived from metals with high electron
mobility in sp-band. Group IB metals such as Au, Ag, and Cu are
representative plasmonic metals and other transition metals also
can
have
LSPR
occasionally8,9,16–18.
Non-plasmonic
metal
nanoparticles can produce hot electrons by interband transition,
in which electrons are excited from d-band to unoccupied con-
duction band19–22. However, light absorption by the interband
transition is usually weak, and it is effective only under UV
light. When the hot electrons contribute to the surface reaction,
the catalytic activity for various wavelengths of incident light
typically follows the trend of their light absorption spectra.
With
an
increase
in
the
light
absorption,
more
hot
electrons are produced, thereby enhancing the catalytic reaction
further.
However, this analogy might not be applicable when light is
absorbed by direct excitation of the electrons located at the
hybrid orbitals of a reactant adsorbed on a metal surface. When
a reactant molecule is strongly adsorbed on a metal, the energy
levels of electronic orbitals are rearranged. If the energy gap
between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is reduced,
then the incident light can excite the electrons on the hybrid
orbitals promoting the surface reaction10,23–25. Christopher
et al. reported that CO oxidation in a H2-rich stream can be
promoted by direct photoexcitation of adsorbate (CO)–metal
(Pt) bonds10. Zhu et al. also observed selective oxidation of
aliphatic alcohols on Pt or Pd nanoparticles under visible light
irradiation11.
Here, we show that CO2 hydrogenation is enhanced on the Ru
surface under light irradiation. The effects of the metal type, Ru
domain size, and Ru oxidation state are evaluated. The DFT
calculation is performed to investigate the changes in the energy
gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels for various metals.
Light irradiation reduces the reaction temperature signiﬁcantly
minimizing the total energy usage for CO2 hydrogenation.
Additionally, the reaction can be turned on or off in a moment,
unlike the conventional thermal reaction.
Results
Enhancement in activity upon light irradiation. Various metals
(i.e., Ru, Rh, Pt, Ni, and Cu) were deposited on silica supports
using a wet impregnation method. The TEM images of the
catalysts were shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The size of the
metal nanoparticles was controlled to be between 5 and 7 nm by
changing the weight percentages of the metals as shown in
Supplementary Table 1. The powder catalysts containing 10 mg
of metal were loaded into the custom-made photoreactor. A
schematic of the reactor set-up and its photograph are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 2. CO2 hydrogenation was performed by
ﬂowing CO2 and H2 together after reducing the catalysts at
300 °C for 3 h. Figure 1 shows the CO2 conversion data of
various metals with and without light irradiation (Supplemen-
tary Table 2 for the full data). Ru and Rh produced CH4 only,
whereas Pt and Cu produced CO only. Ni produced 89% CO
and 11% CH4. The CO2 conversion increased upon light irra-
diation for Ru and Rh, while the conversion did not change for
Pt, Ni, and Cu. Especially, the Ru catalyst showed remarkable
enhancements. At 150 °C, the CO2 conversion was 1.6% with-
out light, but it increased to 32.6% with light. This conversion
was obtained at 230 °C without light. By simply shining light,
the
reaction
temperature
for
CO2
hydrogenation
was
lowered signiﬁcantly. When a higher concentration of CO2 was
used with CO2/N2/H2 ﬂow rates of 5/30/15 sccm, the CO2
conversion was also signiﬁcantly enhanced from 1.1 to 10.9%
at 150 °C upon light irradiation as shown in Supplementary
Fig. 3. Supplementary Table 3 shows the comparison of the-
production

for

irradiation13,26–29.
The light intensity during the CO2 hydrogenation was 35 mW
cm−2, which is too weak to induce any photothermal effect. The
photothermal effect has been observed in a light intensity range of
1–106 W cm−2, regardless of the metal type12–15,30. The intensity
of sunlight is ~100 mW cm-2. A linear relation between the
photocatalytic activity and light intensity has been well known as
a ﬁngerprint for hot electron-driven chemical reactions7,8,31,32.
Figure 2a and b shows that the CO2 conversion increased linearly
as the light intensity increased on the Ru or Rh catalysts. Clearly,
the light-enhanced CO2 hydrogenation results from the hot
electrons.
The silica support is photochemically inert; thus, Ru or Rh
should provide hot electrons. The extent of the surface oxide
was changed to observe the effect of the surface oxide for the
light enhancement. While the as-made Ru/SiO2 catalyst with a
Ru size of 5.6 nm has 89% of metallic Ru and 11% of Ru oxide
at the surface, the percentages of Ru oxide increased to 44 and
61% after annealing the catalyst at 500 °C in air for 1 and
60 min, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4). Supplementary
Fig. 5 shows the CO2 conversion data for these samples having
different
amounts
of
Ru
oxide
with
and
without
light
irradiation.
The
enhancement
from
the
light
decreased
drastically as the amount of Ru oxide increased, and the
sample annealed for 60 min showed little enhancement upon
light irradiation. This indicates that metallic Ru is responsible
for the enhancement by light.
The effect of the Ru nanoparticle size was estimated.
Different sizes (2.6, 5.6, and 17.1 nm) of Ru nanoparticles were
obtained by changing the weight percentages of Ru on the Ru/
SiO2 catalyst, and their TEM images are shown in Supplemen-
tary Fig. 6. The nanoparticle sizes were checked using both
powder XRD and the H2 uptakes as shown in Supplementary
Table 4. The fraction of metallic Ru on the surface was the same
as ~90%. Supplementary Fig. 7 shows that the enhancement by
light was much smaller in the 2.6 nm Ru nanoparticles, while
both the 5.6 and 17.1 nm Ru nanoparticles had a distinct
enhancement. It was reported that larger Ru nanoparticles (e.g.,
≥5 nm) exhibit a higher CO2 conversion than smaller ones for

conventional CO2 hydrogenation because CO2 dissociation
requires
higher
activation
barrier
on
smaller
Ru
nanoparticles33–35. Thus, we hypothesized that the enhance-
ment by light may be related to the interaction between the Ru
surface and the CO2 molecule.
Hot electrons can be produced on a metal surface by an
intraband or interband transition8,9,16–22. Among Ru, Rh, Pt, Ni,
and Cu, only Cu can have an intraband transition; however, the
Cu catalyst did not show any enhancement for CO2 hydrogena-
tion under light. If hot electrons produced by the interband
transition promote CO2 hydrogenation, all the metals, not just Ru
or Rh, should show an enhancement. Additionally, the interband
transition is usually observed in the ultraviolet (UV) range, and
the enhancement by the interband transition decreases abruptly
as the wavelength of the incident light increases20,22. In-situ
UV–Vis spectroscopy was performed in CO2 ﬂow as shown in
Fig. 2c, d (black lines). While UV-DRS data (Supplementary
Fig. 8) obtained without CO2 showed no peak, the peaks were
observed at 528 nm for Ru/SiO2 and 410 nm for Rh/SiO2. When
the content of Ru/SiO2 catalyst in KBr mixture increased, the
absorbance also increased without the change in peak position as
shown in Supplementary Fig. 9. Interestingly, these spectra from
in-situ UV–Vis measurements (black lines) agree well with the
photoaction spectra, which are the plots of quantum yield (QY)
vs. wavelength (red or blue dots in Fig. 2c, d). The QY was
estimated from the CO2 hydrogenation reaction data at each
wavelength using a monochromator. Brieﬂy, QY was calculated
by dividing the number of converted CO2 molecules with the
number of incident photons at each wavelength (Supplementary
Fig. 10). The detailed procedure is explained in Methods. The
photoaction spectra also presented peaks at 520 nm for Ru/SiO2
and 420 nm for Rh/SiO2. This result indicates that the hot
electrons originate from light absorption by CO2 adsorbed on the
metallic
Ru
or
Rh
surface
and
they
promote
the
CO2
hydrogenation.
Mechanism study. The CO2 binding energy on various metal
surfaces was estimated using density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, as shown in Fig. 3a. (111) surface was used for the
face-centered cubic metals of Rh, Pt, Ni, and Cu, while (0001)
surface was used for the hexagonal close packed metal of Ru.
Various CO2 positions were tested to obtain the minimum energy
conﬁguration as shown in Supplementary Fig. 11. Figure 3a
shows the values of the lowest CO2 binding energy. Supple-
mentary Fig. 12 shows the state of CO2 with the lowest energy
conﬁgurations. Ru and Rh have a negative binding energy, while
Pt, Ni, Cu have a positive binding energy, indicating that CO2
binds onto the Ru or Rh surface strongly while it does not bind to
the other metal surfaces. This trend in CO2 binding energy on
various metal catalyst agrees well with CO2 chemisorption results
shown in Supplementary Table 5 and other previous report36.
The strong adsorption of CO2 onto the Ru or Rh surface may
change the electronic structure of the CO2. The electronic
structure of free CO2 and CO2 adsorbed on the metal surface
were calculated, and their HOMO (5σ bonding)–LUMO (2π anti-
bonding) gaps are shown in Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 11c.
The gap decreased signiﬁcantly from 8.5 eV for free CO2 to 2.4 eV
for CO2 adsorbed on the Ru surface. The energy gap of the CO2
adsorbed on the Rh surface was 2.8 eV. These gaps are small
enough for the electrons to jump under visible light irradiation.
The gap was much larger as 4.5 eV for Ni, 3.8 eV for Pt, and
3.5 eV for Cu. In Fig. 2c and d, Ru had the absorption peak in the
presence of CO2 at 528 nm (~2.3 eV) and Rh had the peak at
410 nm (~3.0 eV). The calculated energy gaps of 2.4 eV for Ru
and 2.8 eV for Rh are in good agreement with the experimentally
obtained values.

The diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT)
spectra for CO2 adsorbed on the Ru surface are shown in Fig. 3c.
The spectra obtained with and without light were compared.
Whereas no peak appeared up to 200 °C without light, two
distinct peaks were observed at 1950 and 1800 cm−1 even at
100 °C with light. The peak at 1950 cm−1 resulted from CO
linearly adsorbed on Ru, and the peak at 1800 cm−1 indicated
that CO was adsorbed on Ru through a bridge mode37,38. Upon
light irradiation, CO2 would be cleaved to COad and Oad on the
Ru surface. Supplementary Fig. 13 shows the DRIFT spectra
obtained when H2 was additionally ﬂowed after the CO2 was
adsorbed on the Ru surface. The two peaks appeared at 150 °C
without light, indicating that H2 assists in CO2 dissociation.
However, the peaks were much larger with light, conﬁrming that
light irradiation clearly promoted CO2 dissociation.
The effect of light on CO hydrogenation was also investi-
gated. Supplementary Fig. 14a shows the CO conversion data
with and without light. The CO conversion was slightly higher
under light irradiation, but the differences in the conversion
with and without light were rather small. Supplementary
Fig. 14b shows the DRIFT spectra when CO was adsorbed on
the Ru surface, and Supplementary Fig. 14c shows the DRIFT
spectra when H2 was additionally ﬂowed after adsorbing CO
onto the Ru surface. The spectra were almost identical,
regardless of the light irradiation. CO hydrogenation was
hardly
affected
by
light
irradiation,
indicating
that
the
enhanced activity upon light irradiation for CO2 hydrogenation
is related to the CO2 dissociation. When CO2 is strongly
adsorbed on the Ru surface, hybrid orbitals are formed with a
much shorter energy gap. If the light can easily excite the
electrons in the bonding orbitals to anti-bonding orbitals, then
CO2 can be dissociated to CO. Further hydrogenation would
produce CH4.
Kinetic analysis of light-assisted CO2 hydrogenation was
performed with various CO2 partial pressures and temperatures.
Supplementary Fig. 15a shows the dependences of CO2 conver-
sion rates on the partial pressure of CO2. The CO2 conversion
rate increased as the CO2 partial pressure increased, and reached
a plateau at 4 kPa of CO2. The CO2 conversion rate followed the
identical saturation behaviors under light irradiation, reaching the
plateau at the same CO2 partial pressure. It indicates that the light
irradiation did not change CO2 coverage on Ru surface, but
interfere with the adsorbed CO2 species. The temperature
dependence of CO2 hydrogenation around 150 °C was investi-
gated as shown in Supplementary Fig. 15b. Without light, the
effective energy barrier (Ea) of Ru catalyst was 70.4 kJ mol−1,
which agrees well with previous studies39,40. However, the Ea
decreased signiﬁcantly to 36.2 kJ mol−1 with light irradiation. The
incident light lowers the effective energy barrier on Ru catalyst for
CO2 hydrogenation.

Comparing energy usage for thermal vs. light-assisted reac-
tions. The same CO2 conversion can be achieved at a lower
temperature with light. If the power required to shine light is
less than the power required to heat the reactor, the overall
energy consumption would be reduced. Figure 4a shows the
total energy consumption for CO2 hydrogenation with and
without light. The reactor temperature was set to be 180 °C for
the case without light, and 150 °C for the case with light. The
CO2 conversion was maintained at ~15% for both cases. The
total electric power consumed was measured by an online
power meter. To minimize the energy consumption for shining
a light, a compact laser with a wavelength of 532 nm was used
with a beam expander instead of a Xe lamp. For a CO2
hydrogenation reaction for 8 h, the total energy consumption
was 5411 kJ for the case without light, and 2020 kJ for the case
with light. Only 37% of the energy was consumed when light
was irradiated together. Clearly, the energy required for cata-
lytic reactions in a continuous ﬂow reactor can be signiﬁcantly
reduced by light irradiation.
In a thermally heated reactor, controlling the temperature
instantaneously is nearly impossible. Figure 4b shows the
response in CO2 conversion for turning on or off the heater or
light source. When the heater was turned on at t = 0, it took
52 min to reach the target temperature of 250 °C and the
highest conversion. More importantly, cooling down the
reactor took much longer time. After the heater was turned
off at t = 3.8 h, CO2 conversion was still observed with a long
tail due to the residual heat in the reactor. However, the
response became much faster with light irradiation. The highest
conversion was immediately obtained after turning on the
lamp. The CO2 conversion dropped to 0% within 3 min after
turning off the lamp. The instantaneous control of CO2
conversion cannot be achieved with a conventional thermal
reactor. This unique feature might be useful for on-demand
CH4 production.
Discussion
CO2 hydrogenation was performed on metallic catalysts of Ru,
Rh, Pt, Ni, and Cu with and without light irradiation. The CO2
conversion was enhanced signiﬁcantly on a Ru catalyst by light
irradiation. The CO2 conversion was 1.6% at 150 °C without
light on Ru, but the conversion increased to 32.6% at 150 °C
with light. The effects of the Ru surface oxidation state and Ru
nanoparticle
size
were
evaluated.
The
light-enhancement
appeared only at the metallic Ru surface, and larger nano-
particles exhibited more enhancement. Hot electrons generated
upon light irradiation enhanced the CO2 conversion; however,
the enhancement was not related to the light absorption on the
metal surface. Rather, it was related to the HOMO-LUMO
energy gap of the CO2 adsorbed on the metal surface. DFT
calculations showed that CO2 is strongly bound to the Ru
surface, and the energy gap is reduced from 8.5 eV in free CO2
to 2.4 eV in CO2 adsorbed on the Ru surface. Especially, light
promotes CO2 dissociation to CO as conﬁrmed by the DRIFTS
data. Light irradiation could lower the reaction temperature for
CO2 hydrogenation. When total energy consumption was
compared at a CO2 conversion rate of 15%, the energy required
for the case with light irradiation was only 37% of that for the
case without light irradiation. Furthermore, the CO2 conversion
could be instantaneously turned on and off by light irradiation
unlike a conventional thermal reaction. This light-assisted
heterogeneous reaction can contribute to lowering energy
consumption in chemical production, with a much faster
response for the changes in the reaction condition.
Methods
Catalyst synthesis. Metal nanoparticle catalysts supported on silica (M/SiO2, M
= Pt, Ni, Cu, Ru, and Rh) were prepared using a wet impregnation method. Dif-
ferent amounts of metal precursors, (metal acetylacetonates; details in Supple-
mentary Table 1) were dissolved in acetone (10 mL, Sigma-Aldrich) and added to
silica nanopowder (1 g, Sigma-Aldrich). The slurry mixture was dried at 80 °C for
30 min, and it was placed into the furnace and heated up to 300 °C with a ramping
rate of 10 °C min-1 in 10 vol% H2/N2 (200 sccm). Then, catalysts were reduced at
300 °C for 3 h. The extent of the surface oxidation on Ru/SiO2 was controlled by
oxidizing the catalyst at 500 °C under static air for various treatment times (1 or
60 min).
CO2 hydrogenation. The M/SiO2 (M = Pt, Ni, Cu, Ru, and Rh) catalysts were
placed in a cylindrical quartz sample holder (2 cm of diameter). Metal 10 mg was
loaded for all the reactions. The sample holder was placed in a customized pho-
toreactor equipped with a sapphire glass window (a thickness of 23 mm) as shown
in Supplementary Fig. 2. It should be noted that a water circulating ﬁlter was
located in front of the Xe lamp (300 W, Newport) to exclude the effect of thermal
radiation from the lamp. The catalysts were reduced prior to the CO2 hydro-
genation for 3 h at 300 °C under 10 vol% H2/N2 ﬂow. In a typical CO2 hydro-
genation, a mixture of 0.5 vol% CO2/N2 (50 sccm) and H2 (1.5 sccm) was fed into
the reactor through a static mixer with or without light irradiation at atmospheric
pressure. The CO2 conversion was monitored by an online gas chromatograph
(YL6100 GC, YL Instrument) equipped with molesieve/PORAPAK N columns
(Sigma-Aldrich), a thermal conductivity detector (for H2 and N2 detection), and a
ﬂame ionization detector (for CH4, CO, and CO2 detection) with a methanizer.
Quantitative analysis was performed using N2 as an internal standard. The
dependency on the light intensity or light wavelength was measured at 150 °C for
Ru and 200 °C for Rh. The light intensity was varied by changing the electric
power of the lamp and measured by a spectroradiometer (CS2000, KONICA
MINOLTA). The transmittances of the liquid ﬁlter and the sapphire glass window
are shown in Supplementary Fig. 16a,b. The light intensity was corrected excluding
the effect of the liquid ﬁlter and the sapphire glass window. The photoaction
spectra were obtained using a monochromator (MonoRa151i, Dongwoo
Optron) with wavelengths shown in Supplementary Fig. 16c. A 532 nm laser
(100 mW, CNI laser) was used as the light source for the energy consumption
test.
Estimation of the QY. The energy of the irradiated light for a given time is:
E ¼ n hc
λ ¼ IAs;
ð1Þ
where n is a number of incident photon, λ is a wavelength of incident photon, h is
Planck constant, c is a speed of light, I is the light intensity, A is the area of
irradiation, and s is irradiation time. Then incident photon ﬂux is deﬁned as:
n
s ¼ E
s
λ
hc ¼ IA λ
hc :
ð2Þ
The QY can be estimated as:
QY ¼
nCO2=s
n=s
;
ð3Þ
where nCO2 is the number of the converted CO2 molecules. The wavelength-
dependent measurement was performed using a monochromator (MonoRa151i,
Dongwoo Optron). In prior to the measurement, the monochromatic light was
calibrated with a spectrometer (Maya 2000 Pro, Ocean Optics) as shown in
Supplementary Fig. 16c. The intensity of the monochromatic light was measured
with an optical power meter (PM204, Thorlab) after the monochromatic light
passed through a sapphire window of the reactor. The catalytic activity under the
monochromatic light irradiation was measured at steady state for CO2
hydrogenation. The rate of the CO2 molecules converted by the incident photon
was estimated excluding the CO2 conversion from thermal reaction.
Characterizations. The morphology of prepared catalysts was observed using HR-
TEM (TECNAI). A powder X-ray diffractometer (SmartLab, RIGAKU) was used to
determine the crystalline size of the metal nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo VG Scientiﬁc) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα
X-ray source was used to measure the surface properties of metal nanoparticles.
The binding energies were calibrated with adventitious C 1 s signal at 285 eV as a
reference. The absorption spectra of the metal catalysts were obtained using an
UV-diffuse reﬂectance spectrometer (UV-DRS) (UV3600, Shimadzu). Elemental
analysis was conducted using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometer (ICP-OES 720, Agilent) to conﬁrm the actual metal content in the M/
SiO2 catalysts. In situ diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy
(DRIFTS) measurements were performed using a FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo,

Nicolet 6700) equipped with a MCT detector. In situ UV–Vis spectroscopy was
performed using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, lambda 1050)
equipped with diffuse reﬂectance accessory (PIKE, DiffuseIR) enabling gas ﬂow
and temperature control. The power consumption during the CO2 hydrogenation
was monitored using a 2-channel power meter (WT500, YOKOGAWA) which
contacted both furnace and light sources. The energy consumption by the standby
power was excluded for both cases.
Theoretical calculation using DFT. All of the quantum chemical calculations were
performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package41. We used the projector
augmented wave pseudopotentials with Perdew–Burke Ernzerhof42 exchange
correlation functional. The energy cutoff was set as 500 eV, while a 5 × 5 × 1 k-
point grid was used for energy relaxation, and 20 × 20 × 1 for the density of states
calculation using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme43. Five metal catalysts (Cu, Ni, Pt,
Rh, and Ru) were modeled using four layered slabs with the surfaces of (111) used
for Cu, Ni, Pt, and Rh, and (0001) for Ru with a 15 Å vacuum region. Only the
atoms from the top layer could relax during the DFT simulations. The CO2
molecules were initialized on different atomic sites (Supplementary Fig. 11), and
the binding energy was determined by the lowest energy conﬁgurations (Supple-
mentary Fig. 12). The angles of the CO2 molecules are slightly bent due to the
strong interaction between the metal surfaces and the CO2 molecule. The CO2
binding energy was deﬁned as follows:
Ebind ¼ EcatalystþCO2  ðEcatalyst þ ECO2Þ;
ð4Þ
where Ebind is the binding energy of CO2 on the metal catalyst, and EcatalystþCO2 is
the total energy of the metal catalyst with a single CO2 molecule. Ecatalyst and ECO2
are the total energy of free metal catalyst and CO2 molecule, respectively.
