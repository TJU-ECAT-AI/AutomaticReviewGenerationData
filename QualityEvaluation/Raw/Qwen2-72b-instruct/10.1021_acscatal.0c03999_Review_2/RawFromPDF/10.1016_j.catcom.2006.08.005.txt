Abstract
Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with
X-ray diﬀraction, diﬀuse reﬂectance UV–vis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques. Excellent results in dehydrogena-
tion of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selec-
tivity, were obtained. Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to
bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting eﬀect of mesoporous MSU-x
as support were also discussed.

1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the important and basic chemicals
used in industrial processes, such as synthesis of polypro-
pylene, crylic acid, acrylonitrile, and cumene. Recently,
the demand for propylene has increased signiﬁcantly; how-
ever, to this day, most propylene (>90%) is produced as a
byproduct from steam cracking and ﬂuid catalytic cracking
(FCC) processes in reﬁnery in industries worldwide. Many
eﬀorts have been made to catalyze oxidehydrogenation
(ODH) of propane using oxygen; unfortunately, no break-
through has been made [1–4]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has
been thought to be a possible substitute for oxygen. The
introduction of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation of
propane has many potential advantages. First, thermody-
namic equilibrium limitation is overcome and propylene
yield is improved by removal of hydrogen (CO2 + H2 !
CO + H2O); second, deep oxidation that occurred as a
result of using oxygen as oxidant is avoided; third, it realizes
the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2 when used as a soft oxi-
dant. Many researchers have investigated the dehydrogena-
tion of propane in the presence of CO2, suggesting that
chromium and gallium oxide are active components for this
reaction [5–11].
Mesoporous silicate materials, which possess unparal-
leled high surface area and uniform nanoporous channels,
are expected to be new promising catalyst support [12]. In
this paper, mesoporous silica supported chromium catalyst
was prepared and designated as Cr/MSU-x. MSU-x is an
important family of mesoporous material, which holds 3D
wormlike channels favoring diﬀusion of molecular objects
[13]. Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibited good activity in the
ODH of ethane with CO2 according to our previous study
[14]. The catalysts exhibit excellent activity in the dehydro-
genation of propane with CO2. X-ray diﬀraction (XRD),
diﬀuse reﬂectance (DR) UV–vis, and H2-temperature

programmed reduction (H2-TPR) techniques were used to
study the structure and active sites of catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis
The MSU-x support was synthesized as follows: 110 g/L
Na2SiO3 Æ 9H2O aqueous solution was mixed with 0.1 mol/
L fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (A(EO)9) aqueous
solution with molar ratio 1Si:0.1 A(EO)9 under vigorous
stirring. The silicate polycondensation to a white precipi-
tate occurred by adding 1 mol/L aqueous HCl to adjust
pH value of the mixed solution from 12–13 to 2–3. After
being stirred for 24 h, the resulting solid gel was separated
by ﬁltration, washed with deionized water, and dried at
60 C overnight. The as-synthesized MSU-x was calcined
under static air at 600 C for 4 h to remove template. The
calcined MSU-x was impregnated with desired Cr(NO3)3
aqueous solution to prepare Cr/MSU-x catalysts. Cr/
MSU-x catalyst was also calcined at 600 C for 4 h before
reaction. Four catalysts with diﬀerent Cr loading (calcu-
lated by Cr2O3) of 1 wt%, 5 wt%, 12 wt%, and 20 wt%,
respectively, were prepared.
2.2. Characterizations
The reaction of CO2 and C3H8 was performed at atmo-
spheric pressure in a ﬁxed bed quartz reactor (5.0 mm i.d.,
44.0 cm long). The reactants consisted of V(CO2) = 9 ml/
min and V(C3H8) = 3 ml/min. Catalyst loading was 0.2 g.
The products were analyzed online by a gas chromatograph
equipped with paropark-QS column (3 m, U1/4) and a ther-
mal conductivity detector (Shimadzu GC 14B). The pro-
pane conversion and products selectivity were calculated
based on Eqs. (1) and (2) [6]. The conversion of propane
to coke was neglected because the instantaneous formation
of coke is time dependent and diﬃcult to estimate.

X-ray diﬀraction measurements were performed on
X’pert Pro MPD X-ray diﬀractmeter from PANalytical
with CuKa radiation (k = 0.154187 nm), Generator Set-
tings 40 kV, 30 mA, scanning step size 0.008 and step time
10.075 s for regions at 0.5–6.0, scanning step size 0.017
and step time 5.08 s for regions at 10–90. Diﬀuse reﬂec-
tance UV–vis spectroscopic measurements were recorded
on a UV2100 spectrometer. The spectra were collected at
230–700 nm referenced to BaSO4. H2-TPR of catalysts
was performed on CHEMBET3000 chemical adsorption
apparatus from Quantachrome by using a mixture of
5 vol% H2/Ar as reducing gas with a total ﬂow rate
20 ml/min. A 50 mg sample was heated from room temper-
ature to 700 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min after pre-
treatment at 300 C for 30 min in helium gas ﬂow. The
reduction signal was recorded by a thermal conductivity
detector (TCD). The reducing gas was cooled by mixture
of n-octane and liquid nitrogen to condense the water gen-
erated from reduction of the catalyst.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Meso-structure and activities of catalysts
The blank MSU-x gives one broad peak at low angle
region corresponding to d1 0 0 reﬂection in XRD pattern
(Fig.1a), indicating that the presence of uniform mesopor-
ous channels [15]. Chromium supported Cr/MSU-x show
one

MSU-x
at
about
2h = 2. Moreover, the surface area and pore diameter of
blank MSU-x and 5 wt% Cr/MSU-x that have been mea-
sured though N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms as
963.6, 964.6 m2/g and 2.57, 2.64 nm in our previous study
show no obvious diﬀerence [14]. These results suggest that
meso-structure of MSU-x is preserved after loading of
chromium oxide (Cr2O3). It is noticed that the reﬂection
intensity of Cr/MSU-x reduces with the increasing of
Cr2O3 loading (Fig. 1b–e). More Cr2O3 introduction into
the material results in losing integrity and order of meso-
structure. Similar result was observed on Co-MCM-41 by
Li et al. [16].
The catalytic behaviors of 5 wt% Cr2O3/MSU-x in pro-
pane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2 are shown in
Table 1. Reaction network of propane dehydrogenation
with CO2 is very complicated. However, due to the higher
selectivity of C3H6 in product, the following reactions are
considered as main reactions [5,6,11]:

The dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with CO2 is
similar as the results of propane and will not be discussed.
Conversion of propane increased as the reaction tempera-
ture was raised, whereas selectivity of propylene, the object
product, decreased. The main byproduct, methane, was
generated from hydrocracking reaction (8) with selectivities
of 5.9–9.5%. Ethane and ethylene are two other byproducts
resulting from cracking or dehydrogenation reactions with
selectivities of less than 5% always.
The catalytic activities of Cr/MSU-x that varied with
Cr2O3 loading are shown in Fig. 2. The conversion of pro-
pane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst
before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%. Although selectivity
to propylene shows decrease in this region, yield of propyl-
ene still acquire elevation. Maximum propane conversions
and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and
12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly. Selectivity
to propylene declines from 95.3% to a minimum of about
89%. Table 2 summarizes the activities of some typical cat-
alysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, includ-
ing catalysts cited from literatures and the 12 wt% Cr/
MSU-x prepared for this study. Although reaction condi-
tions are diﬀerent, Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher pro-
pane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table.
The results show that Cr/MSU-x is a very active catalyst
for this reaction. Fig. 3 exhibits the catalytic activities of
5 wt% Cr/MSU-x as a function of reaction time. Conver-
sion of propane and CO2 decreased gradually with time

from 37% to 25% in 3 h. However, selectivity to propylene
increased with respect to reaction time.
3.2. State of oxidation and coordination of supported
chromium
Diﬀuse reﬂectance UV–vis spectra of Cr/MSU-x with
diﬀerent Cr2O3 loading are shown in Fig. 4. It is generally
well known that two bands centered at k = 260–280 nm
and 370–380 nm in the charge transfer region are charac-
teristic of the presence of Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordina-
tion, whereas bands at 450–465 nm and 580–600 nm
relate to the A2g ! T1g and A2g ! T2g transitions of
Cr(III) in octahedral symmetry respectively [17,18]. From
Fig. 4, two bands at 260–270 nm and 360–370 nm appear
apparently on 1 wt% and 5 wt% Cr/MSU-x, indicating
the presence of Cr(VI) in Td coordination. But absorption
band at 600 nm characteristic of Cr(III) in Oh coordination
is not detectable on both samples with lower chromic oxide
loading. A weak shoulder at k = 450–470 nm ascribes to
Cr(VI) in chromate ions on these two samples. The appear-
ance of band at 600 nm and weakening of band at 260 and
370 nm demonstrate that part of Cr species form to Cr(III)
in Oh coordination on 12 wt% and 20 wt% Cr2O3 loading
samples. The O ! Cr(III) charge transfer also contributes
to absorption bands at 450–465 nm overshadowed that of
Cr(VI) chromate. These results reveal that most Cr species
form to Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination at low Cr2O3
loading and the increase of chromium loading causes for-
mation of Cr(III) in octahedral coordination on Cr/
MSU-x catalysts. The results are similar with other investi-
gations on chromic oxide that supported catalysts well
[17,18].
The formation of crystal Cr2O3 on Cr/MSU-x with the
increased Cr loading is further proved by powder XRD
method. The XRD patterns of Cr/MSU-x with diﬀerent
Cr2O3 loading are presented in Fig. 5. Cr/MSU-x with
1 wt% Cr2O3 loading does not show any XRD peaks of
metal oxide. However, two weak peaks at 2h = 44.5 and
54.8 corresponding to diﬀraction of crystal Cr2O3 are
observed on XRD pattern of Cr/MSU-x with 5 wt%
Cr2O3 loading. When Cr2O3 content grows up to 12 wt%
and 20 wt%, clear diﬀraction peaks of rhombohedral
Cr2O3 crystal appear. Twenty wt% Cr/MSU-x shows more
intense reﬂection than 12 wt% Cr/MSU-x. These results
correspond to the observation from DR UV–vis that
higher Cr2O3 loading leads to formation of Cr(III) species
on Cr/MSU-x. Yim conﬁrmed that mono- and polychro-
mate species of Cr(VI) and crystalline a-Cr2O3 were grad-
ually formed on the surface of Al2O3 with increase in the
Cr content from 1 wt% to 17 wt% [19]. It resembles the
results on Cr/MSU-x catalyst.
H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) pat-
terns of Cr/MSU-x with diﬀerent Cr2O3 loading are shown
in Fig. 6. One intense peak at about 500 C with a shoulder
at 400–450 C are observed for each sample. These H2 con-
sumption peaks are assigned to the reduction of Cr(VI) !
Cr(III) [18]. Based on the results of Cavani et al. [20], two
kinds of Cr(VI) species, the grafted and the soluble Cr(VI),

are expected to form on Cr/MSU-x. The grafted Cr(VI)
oﬀers greater interaction with silica support and is harder
to be reduced than the soluble Cr(VI), which presents as
isolated chromates on the surface of catalyst. Thus the
intense peak at higher temperature corresponds to the
reduction of grafted Cr(VI) species and the weak shoulder
at lower temperature may result from reduction of soluble
Cr(VI).
For investigating the reduction behavior of Cr(VI) on
Cr/MSU-x with diﬀerent chromium loading, Gaussian ﬁt-
ting with binary peaks for the H2-TPR proﬁles was per-
formed. The ﬁtting results are listed in Table 3. The
corresponding temperatures for both reduction peaks (PL
and PH in the table) move to low values with the increase
of chromium loading. This result can be explained thus:
the percentage of grafted Cr(VI), which is diﬃcultly
reduced, decreases in total Cr(VI) species. Cr/MSU-x with
5 wt% Cr2O3 load gives the biggest H2 consumption. The
H2 consumption reduced apparently on 12 wt% and
20 wt% Cr2O3 load catalysts, suggesting that large numbers
of Cr2O3 instead of Cr(VI) are formed on Cr/MSU-x with
high Cr loading.
3.3. Discussions of active sites on Cr/MSU-x and promoting
eﬀect of support
At low Cr2O3 loading, typically less than 1 wt%, only
Cr(VI) species corresponding to monochromate were
detected. With the increase of Cr2O3 loading, Cr(VI) corre-
sponding to di-, trichromates, and Cr(III) corresponding to
amorphous or crystalline Cr2O3 are formed gradually on
the catalyst surface [19–23]. The active species in alkane
dehydrogenation have been considered to be coordinatively
unsaturated Cr(III) ions, whereas the bulk Cr(III) ions with
a perfect and stable octahedral surrounding are inactive for
alkane dehydrogenation [21,22]. The results show that
Cr(III) ions are an active species on the surface of Cr/
MSU-x for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The
active Cr(III) species are formed from two pathways. One
is the initial presentation as amorphous or well-dispersed
Cr(III) in the fresh catalyst. The other is reduction of sur-
face Cr(VI) in reaction. Cr/MSU-x with 12 wt% and
20 wt% Cr2O3 loadings had less percentage of Cr(VI) than
Cr/MSU-x with 5 wt% Cr2O3 loading, but they showed
equal activities. The results suggest that Cr(VI) species
are not very active sites for the reaction and Cr(III) species
should be responsible for catalytic reactivity. Moreover,
the reduction of Cr(VI) species in reactions is proved by
H2-TPR study, because the reduction curve disappeared
for reacted Cr/MSU-x with 5 wt% Cr2O3 loading. So
Cr(III) species resulting from reduction of Cr(VI) have a
big contribution to the activity of Cr/MSU-x with 5 wt%
Cr2O3 loading. However, the bulk Cr2O3 crystals are not
an active species for this reaction because Cr/MSU-x with
20 wt% Cr2O3 loading does not present evident higher
activity than Cr/MSU-x with 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading
despite its more crystalline Cr2O3 (XRD result).
Besides the main contribution of the active chromium
component, mesoporous MSU-x possesses many advanta-
geous characteristics as support compared with conven-
tional silica and alumina support. Firstly, it exhibits a big
surface area, which leads to high dispersion of chromium
species and provides more accessible and active centers
for the reaction. Liu and his coworkers have found that
vanadium oxide supported on mesoporous SBA-15 catalyst
exhibited much higher propane conversion and selectivity
to oleﬁns than those of amorphous SiO2 supported–vana-
dium oxide catalyst. 23.8% and 13.9% propylene yield were
produced, respectively. The results have been attributed to
the high surface area and large pore size of SBA-15 [24].
Secondly, the wormlike and cross-link channels with a nar-
row pore size distribution in MSU-x favor diﬀusion of
reactant molecules and improve reaction velocity. Thirdly,
chromium silicates present special adsorption properties
that beneﬁt reactions over them. Katoh and coworkers
reported that Cr in chromium silicate could decrease
adsorption interaction with CO2 [25]. Adsorption and
desorption ability of reactant molecules on catalysts sur-
face is a key factor to inﬂuence their reactivity. These
favorable characteristics of mesoporous MSU-x should
contribute to the higher propane conversion and propylene
yield
over
Cr/MSU-x
than
Cr/SiO2
and
Cr/Al2O3
catalysts.
4. Conclusions
Novel mesoporous catalyst Cr/MSU-x was synthesized
with diﬀerent Cr2O3 loading and exhibited excellent activi-
ties in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. X-ray
diﬀraction, DR UV–vis and H2-TPR characterizations
demonstrate that Cr2O3 content in Cr/MSU-x has signiﬁ-
cant eﬀect on oxidation state and coordination of chro-
mium species. Cr(VI) species corresponding to chromate
form the main local structure of chromium at low Cr load-
ing. The percentage of Cr(VI) decrease and crystal Cr2O3
appear with an increase of Cr loading. Two kinds of Cr(VI)
with diﬀerent reduced abilities are diﬀerentiated by H2-
TPR method. Cr(III) species serve as active sites for pro-
pane dehydrogenation. The result showed Cr/MSU-x is a
potential dehydrogenation catalyst.
