SUMMARY
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene produc-
tion technology that has received much attention, but high reaction
temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and cata-
lyst stability. This paper describes a single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by
assembling atomically ordered intermetallic alloy (IMA) as a selec-
tive and ultrastable PDH catalyst. The catalyst enables more than
95% of propylene selectivity from 520C to 620C. No obvious deac-
tivation is observed within the 160-h test, superior to PtSn/Al2O3
and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts. Based on in situ X-ray ab-
sorption ﬁne structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measure-
ments, and density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the
surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site
structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1
site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the ﬁrst and second C–
H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of sur-
face-bounded propylene. This signiﬁcantly improves the selectivity
and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions.
INTRODUCTION
A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale
gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing develop-
ment of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies.1–3 PDH is an
extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of
the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,4–6
which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability.7 Espe-
cially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sen-
sitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the
production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke.8
To tackle these challenges, the ‘‘active site isolation’’ strategy has been proved to be
effective.9–11 Isolating the active metal components into the single-atom site and the
resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reac-
tions.2,9,12–15 For example, the isolated Pt1 site in Pt/Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) can
only interact with a single Pt atom for the deep dehydrogenated C3H5, a model pre-
cursor of coke formation, instead of three more stable Pt–C interactions on a 3-fold
Pt3 hollow site over Pt (111), leading to less carbon deposition. However, the long-
term stability of Pt/Cu SAAs is disillusionary due to its thermal and chemical instabil-
ities.9,16,17 Although single-site Zn(II),18 Co(II),19 Ni(II),20 and Ga(III)21 on silica have
been developed, these active sites suffer from low intrinsic activity and reduction
The Bigger Picture
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH)
is a commercial propylene
production technology, but high
reaction temperatures result in
cracking and coking. Isolating
active metal components into
single atoms can maximize atomic
efﬁciency, and the resulting
single-atom catalysts (SACs) could
inhibit structure-sensitive side
reactions with unprecedented
selectivity.
Herein, we report a single-site
[PtZn4] catalyst by assembling
atomically ordered PtZn
intermetallic alloys, which enables
more than 95% selectivity of
propylene over a broad
temperature range of 520C to
620C. No obvious deactivation is
observed within the 160-h
industrial PDH test. We reveal that
the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in
PtZn IMAs serve as the stable
active site structures, wherein the
geometry-isolated and electron-
rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily
promotes desorption of surface-
bounded propylene and improves
the stability by prohibiting coke
side reactions.

deactivation. The development of highly efﬁcient and stable SACs, therefore, re-
mains grand challenges in the ﬁeld of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated
temperatures.
Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains
one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active
sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms.11,22,23 Additionally,
this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal sta-
bility compared with conventional single-atom alloys.11 For example, PtZn IMA has
been reported in ethane dehydrogenation.24 However, the loading of Pt is relatively
high with about 9.53 wt %, which is far higher than that of the industrial Pt-based cat-
alysts with the Pt loading of about 0.3 wt % in PtSn/Al2O3. This induces low oleﬁn
productivity and atom utilization. Recently, novel preparation methods have been
developed to improve the propylene productivity by constructing ultrasmall PtZn
bimetal nanoclusters by embedding them inside S-1 zeolites.25,26 However, due
to the very complex coordination structures in zeolites, e.g., the coexistence of
Pt–O, Pt–Pt, and Pt–Zn coordinations, it is very difﬁcult to identify the active site
structures, regardless of experimental and theoretical simulations. Therefore,
further revealing the unclear active site structures and promoting propylene produc-
tivity is highly desired.
This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assem-
bling atomically ordered PtZn IMA with trace Pt loadings of 0.1 wt %, which enables
more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to
620C and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt
1 h1. No
obvious deactivation was observed within 160-h under industrial operating condi-
tions, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts. Based on in
situ X-ray absorption ﬁne-structure spectroscopy measurements, X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculations, it is
further revealed that surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110) serve as the stable
active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4]
ensembles readily promote desorption of the surface-bounded propylene and
improve the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn
atoms via structural ordering.
RESULTS
Formation of Single-Atom Pt1 Sites in PtZn IMAs
By direct H2 temperature-programmed reduction strategy (see Experimental Pro-
cedures), we successfully constructed PtZn IMAs (molar ratio of Pt:Zn = 1) supported
on SiO2, where the H2-rich atmosphere at high temperatures (HT) of 600C contrib-
utes to the transformation of disordered PtZn nanoparticles (NPs) into structurally or-
dered PtZn IMAs (Figure 1A).27 We monitored the formation and transformation
from Pt to PtZn IMAs by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns at different reduction tem-
peratures (Figure S1). After 600C reduction, a set of new diffraction peaks (31.1,
40.8, and 44.8) appeared, which are ascribed to (110), (111), and (200), respec-
tively, corresponding well with the standard PXRD patterns (PDF#06-0604) of inter-
metallic Pt1Zn1 (P4/mmm) (Figure 1C).24,27 This is deﬁnitely different from the diffrac-
tion peaks (39.8, 46.2), which are ascribed to (111) and (200) of Pt (Fm3m) (PDF#04-
0802). Notably, the crystalline phase has been transformed from the face-centered
cubic (fcc) of Pt to body-centered tetragonal (bct) Pt1Zn1 IMA (Figure 1B). The
average particle sizes of 0.1Pt0.17Zn alloy (additions of 0.1 wt % Pt and 0.17 wt %
Zn) supported on SiO2 signiﬁcantly decreased from 2.1 nm (0.1Pt/SiO2, additions

ure S2). Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-ﬁeld scanning transmission
electron microscope (AC-HAADF-STEM) imaging (Figure 1E and S3) revealed the
formation of atomically ordered PtZn IMAs, featuring the alternating bright Pt col-
umn and dark Zn column contrast on [110] planes (Figure 1E). Energy dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) elemental mappings of the PtZn nanoparticle indicated the ho-
mogeneous distribution of Pt and Zn atoms (Figure 1G) with an approximately 1:1
ratio. Considering that the Zn content in this PtZn nanoparticle is lower than those
fed in the catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 1.7 wt % Zn), a part of Zn may present on SiO2 sup-
port. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) image of the PtZn nanoparticle in Figure 1E
shows the superlattice diffraction patterns, which further implies the formation of

ordered Pt1Zn1 IMAs (Figure 1F). The atomic plane distances were measured as
0.286 nm, agreeing with a lattice spacing of intermetallic Pt1Zn1 along with the
[110] directions, which implies the highly exposed (110) facets in these PtZn IMAs.
At the surface of PtZn (110), the [PtZn4] ensembles (rectangle-framed motif) period-
ically formed, in which Pt atom was isolated by 4 neighboring Zn atoms, leading to
the formation of single-atom Pt1 site. Comparatively, for Pt/SiO2, AC-HAADF-STEM
imaging (Figure S4) showed that two atomic plane distances were measured as
0.229 and 0.199 nm (Figure 1H), which were in agreement with the lattice spacing
along the [111] and [200] directions. On the surface of Pt (111), the [Pt3] ensembles
(triangle-framed motif) periodically formed (Figure 1J), indicating the formation of
surface Pt3 sites over Pt/SiO2.
To further obtain information about different surface Pt ensembles over Pt/SiO2 and
PtZn/SiO2, we performed Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with CO
adsorption. For Pt/SiO2, one CO adsorption peak appeared in CO-diffuse reﬂec-
tance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) (Figure S5) at 2,075 cm1,
which was assigned to stretching vibration of CO adsorbed on Pt ensembles with
on-top modes. Comparatively, for PtZn/SiO2, upon the increase of reduction
temperatures,
the
CO
adsorption
band
corresponding
to
Pt
ensembles
(2,075 cm1) disappeared with an appearance of a new band feature at around
2,047 cm1 (Figure S6). Noticeably, no position changes of this band was observed
with the decrease of CO coverage during the 60 min purge (Figure 1D), indicating
that the band at 2,047 cm1 might have been assigned to the on-top CO adsorbed
on the single-atom Pt1 site.28,29 These results clearly demonstrate the formation of a
single-atom Pt1 site in PtZn IMAs supported on SiO2.
Catalytic Performance and Stability
Kinetic studies of the catalysts showed that H2 response in terms of the rate-deter-
mining initial C–H cleavage in C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction
(TPSR) starts at about 181C on Pt/SiO2, 214C on PtZn/SiO2, and 500C on Zn/
SiO2, respectively (Figure S7), revealing that the Pt atom might serve as the active
component and Zn functions as the promoter, which slightly increases the C–H acti-
vation temperature. The formation of CH4 as a result of cracking and coke side reac-
tions at HT was signiﬁcantly inhibited with the addition of Zn over PtZn/SiO2, which
might signify the higher propylene selectivity and anti-coke resistance. According to
Pt dispersions (Figure S8) and speciﬁc activity at 600C, the calculated turnover fre-
quency (TOF)C3H6 (6.8 s1) over PtZn/SiO2 was much higher than that over Pt/SiO2
(4.6 s1) (Table S1), suggesting the superior ability of propylene production over
PtZn/SiO2 than Pt/SiO2.
When testing for PDH, we evaluated the inﬂuence of Pt and Zn additions, H2 pres-
sures, weight hourly velocity (WHSV) of propane, and reaction temperatures on pro-
pane conversion and propylene selectivity. As a result, increasing Zn additions and
H2 pressures contribute to the improvement of propylene selectivity (Figures S9 and
S10). Increasing Pt loadings (Figure S11) and reaction temperatures (Figure S12) in-
creases the conversion of propane, while higher WHSV of propane (Figure S13) leads
to the loss of conversion. Optimally, the PtZn/SiO2 with a low loading of 0.1 wt % Pt
and 0.17 wt % Zn obtained about 48% of propane conversion and 96% of propylene
selectivity at 600C and WHSV of propane = 4 h1 (C3H8/H2 = 1/1), which is signif-
icantly higher than that over Pt/SiO2 (42% conversion, 67% selectivity) (Figure 2A)
and Zn/SiO2 (4% conversion, 60% selectivity) (Figure S14). In addition, supports
could inﬂuence the structures of PtZn alloys and thus dehydrogenation performance.
We found that PtZn supported on SiO2 exhibited better both propane conversion

and propylene selectivity than Al2O3 (Figure S15), despite the similar sizes of PtZn
particles (Figure S16). The reason may be that SiO2 interacts weakly with the metals,
allowing for a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn,
which may be the signiﬁcant support effect for the IMA formation.22,30 Conse-
quently, there was a lower CO adsorption band position (2,047 cm1) over PtZn/
SiO2 than that over PtZn/Al2O3 (2,069 cm1) (Figure S5). Additionally, the stronger
acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 (Figure S17A) would lead to coking and catalyst
deactivation. Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further
indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/
IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was signiﬁcantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3. Therefore, the
weak acid SiO2 in this work was selected as a support to promote the formation of
highly alloying PtZn IMA and suppress the inﬂuence of support acidity on coking
behaviors.
Consequently, SiO2-supported PtZn IMAs showed ascendant temperature tolerance
ranging from 520C to 620C, enabling over 95% selectivity of C3H6 (Figure 2B), indi-
cating superior selectivity of this PtZn IMA during the wide range of HTs. Moreover,
the PtZn IMA catalysts ran more than 160 and 100 h of continuous operation with lit-
tle deactivation at 520C (Figure S18) and 575C (Figure S19), respectively. To
further evaluate the stability of this PtZn IMA catalyst, we performed the long-term
test under industrial operating conditions (600C, WHSV of C3H8=11 h1, C3H8/

H2 = 2, no inert gas dilution) and compared with the representative PtSn/Al2O3 cat-
alysts (see Experimental Procedures). After 160 h, dehydrogenation reaction
showed a very slight decrease in the conversion of 0.04% per hour, suggesting
that only slight deactivation had occurred. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity
was as high as 97.2% after a 160-h test (Figure 2C). In contrast, for the PtSn/Al2O3
reference catalyst, propane conversion dramatically dropped from an initial 34.8%
to 11.7% after 100 h. A ﬁrst-order deactivation model was used to evaluate the cata-
lyst stability (for details, see Experimental Procedures).28 A comparatively lower
deactivation rate of 0.002 h1 and a catalyst lifetime of 160 h for the PtZn/SiO2
IMA quantitatively demonstrate its high stability compared with the PtSn/Al2O3
catalyst (0.01 h1, 100 h). The highest productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt
1 h1,
more than 5 times of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, at the lowest deactivation rate (0.002
h1) clearly demonstrates the superior reactivity and stability of the PtZn/SiO2 IMA
catalyst in the PDH reaction, which is superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and those of state-of-
the-art Pt-based catalysts (Figure 2D; Table S2). Additionally, during 4 successive
regeneration cycles, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity remained
slightly changed as compared with the initial run (Figure S20), further indicating
the good regenerability of this PtZn IMA.
PtZn IMAs under PDH Conditions
To further investigate the stability of PtZn IMA catalysts under PDH reaction condi-
tions, in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra and Fourier
transforms (FTs) of the extended X-ray absorption ﬁne-structure (EXAFS) spectra
were collected.
As shown in Figure 3A, after H2 reduction, all Pt atoms were in their metallic states, as
evidenced by the white line intensity relative to that of the Pt foil. The edge energy of
the PtZn/SiO2 was shifted to 11,565 eV, indicating the formation of bimetallic PtZn
particles. Additionally, in situ Pt LIII EXAFS revealed a single broad peak in R space
centered around 2.2 Ǻ in PtZn/SiO2, whereas Pt/SiO2 showed three peaks in R space,
characteristic of Pt–Pt scattering (Figures 3B and S21). For PtZn/SiO2 catalysts, the
model gave high quality ﬁts with the crystal structure of the b1-Pt1Zn1 IMA. The FT
peak at 2.57 A
˚ could be unambiguously ascribed to Pt–Zn coordination whose num-
ber (CN) was determined to be about 4 (Table S3) lower than the values (8 zinc neigh-
bors and 4 Pt neighbors) in bulk PtZn IMA. This is consistent with the consensus that
intrinsically stable single-atom site is usually formed by 4 coordinate complexes con-
taining a metal with tetrahedral or square-planar coordination geometry. Consid-
ering the under coordinated surface atoms in this sub-1 nm PtZn IMA particle, the
surface coordination of Pt–Zn ensembles could be approximately identiﬁed as this
obtained coordination environment of [PtZn4] ensembles.17,31 Therefore, as the il-
lustrations shown in Figure S22, the [PtZn4] coordination structure exists on the sur-
face of PtZn IMAs, wherein single-atom Pt1 site forms and it is isolated by 4 neigh-
boring Zn atoms in [PtZn4] ensembles. Notably, the XANES and EXAFS spectra of
PtZn/SiO2 under PDH reaction conditions are similar with H2 reduction (Figures 3C
and S23), and the calculated CN of Pt–Zn remained about 4 (Table S3), indicating
the superior stability of PtZn coordination ensembles in PtZn IMAs under PDH reac-
tion conditions.
In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further employed to monitor the
electronic states of this PtZn ensembles. After H2 reduction, for PtZn/SiO2, Pt was
reduced to metallic Pt0 and the binding energy (BE) of Pt0 in Pt 4f7/2 peak was
71.1 eV (Figures 3D and S24), which was lower than that over Pt/SiO2 (71.3 eV) (Fig-
ure S25), indicating the electron transfers from Zn to the 5d band of Pt and formation

of electron-rich Pt in PtZn ensembles.24,32 Combining spectra of Zn 2p and Zn LMM
Auger (Figures 3E and S26), it was found that Zn2+ species (985.9 eV) were partially
reduced to metallic Zn0 (991.9 eV) and some nonreducible ZnOx. Therefore, we infer
that partial Zn species are alloyed with Pt to form PtZn alloys, while some nonredu-
cible ZnOx species strongly interact with SiO2 supports to form ZnOx-Si (ZnOx
bridging with SiO2 support, 986.9 eV). Through peak ﬁtting, the percent of surface
composition of Zn0 and ZnOx-Si were calculated to be 30.3% and 69.7%, respec-
tively. Based on atomic concentration quantitative analysis (Table S4) and the
peak ﬁtting of Zn0 and ZnOx-Si, the molar ratio of Zn0/Pt0 in this PtZn IMA catalyst
was accordingly determined to be 1.4, which is close to the ratio of Pt and Zn atoms
in Pt1Zn1 IMA (molar ratio of Pt:Zn = 1:1). Under PDH conditions, there was a slightly

negative shift of Pt 4f7/2 peaks over PtZn/SiO2 (from 71.1 to 70.7 eV) (Figure 3D) and
Pt/SiO2 (from 71.3 to 70.9 eV) (Figure S25), which may be induced by the afﬁnity of
coke deposition on the surface of Pt0 sites. Comparatively, there was no obvious po-
sition change of the Zn0 peak in Zn LMM. Additionally, both the intensities of Pt0 and
Zn0 was slightly decreased due to the cover of coke on the surface of PtZn alloys.
Therefore, Pt0 in PtZn ensembles may be the main coking site. Consequently, for
Pt/SiO2, a more pronounced intensity of coke deposition (283.9 eV) in XPS C 1s
peak (Figure S27) than that over PtZn/SiO2 (Figure 3F) was observed. Therefore,
the above results clearly imply that the electron-rich Pt in PtZn ensembles effectively
inhibits the coke formation under PDH reaction conditions.
To further shed light on the reason for the inhibited coke over PtZn ensembles, C3H6-
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and C3H6-IR were operated to investi-
gate the relationship between C3H6 intermediate adsorption, which determines the
coke formation. As C3H6-TPD proﬁles shown in Figure S28A, there was a very weak
desorption peak at 261C for PtZn/SiO2 compared with the strong desorption peak
at 287C for Pt/SiO2, indicating that the interaction between C3H6 molecules and Pt
sites was weaker over PtZn/SiO2 than that over Pt/SiO2. This weak interaction mini-
mizes the adsorption of C3H6 on the electron-rich Pt sites in PtZn ensembles, which
therefore accounts for higher propylene selectivity and less coke formation over
PtZn/SiO2. For C3H6-IR (Figure S28B), it is was also obviously indicated that the
C3H6 adsorption was weakened on the surface of PtZn/SiO2, since a lower uptake
of propylene was presented, which suggests that PtZn ensembles effectively facili-
tate propylene desorption. As a result, DRIFTS of CO on PtZn/SiO2 with an increase
in reaction time showed that there were no obvious position and intensity changes of
CO adsorption band, indicating its superior ability of propylene desorption and anti-
coking resistance (Figure S29A). In contrast, for Pt/SiO2, the peak position of CO
adsorption gradually shifted to the lower wavenumber, from 2,076 to 2,047 cm1
at 10 h (Figure S29B). Also, the intensity of CO adsorption gradually decreased
with reaction time, which may be caused by the much severe coke depositing on
the highly unsaturated corner or steps sites of Pt atoms in Pt/SiO2, leading to the
red-shift and weakening of CO adsorption band.28 Additionally, the coking amount
on the spent PtZn/SiO2 (2.1%) was much lower than that on Pt/SiO2 (Figure S30),
which corresponds to the less coke formation on PtZn/SiO2 than that over Pt/SiO2,
as shown in temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) proﬁles (Figure S31). Raman
spectra further detected the difference of coke type in addition to the coke amount.
With reaction time, two distinct Raman bands at around 1,602 and 1,321 cm1 were
observed (Figure S32A), ascribed to coke G (graphite) and D (disorder) modes,
respectively. The calculated ratio of ID/IG from spent PtZn/SiO2 was determined to
be 1.3, much higher than that overspent Pt/SiO2 (ID/IG =0.6) (Figure S32B), indi-
cating the lower graphitization degree of coke deposited on this PtZn ensemble
than Pt, in addition to less coke amount.
Besides coke deposition, particle sintering and component loss are other main rea-
sons for catalyst deactivation.9 Transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis
showed that the size of spent PtZn/SiO2 (1.0 nm) had undergone negligible changes
(Figure S33), indicating that the PtZn particles show superior anti-sintering resistance
during PDH reactions due to the intrinsically high thermal stability of PtZn IMAs.
Additionally, the crystalline structure of PtZn alloys is almost unchanged even after
long-term stability tests (Figure S34). Furthermore, inductively coupled plasma op-
tical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) component analysis as a function of time on
stream implies very slight loss rates of Zn and Pt in PtZn/SiO2 (Table S5; Figure S35),
far lower than that over Zn/SiO2, Pt/SiO2, and other Zn promoted Pt-based

catalysts.32,33 In addition, after continuous regeneration processes, the PtZn IMAs
maintained its initial crystalline structure, pore distribution, and particle size
(1.1 nm) (Figure S36; Table S6), indicating the good regenerability of this PtZn
IMA catalyst.
Therefore, by analyzing the coke, particle sintering, and component loss, as shown in
Figure 3G, we reasonably consider that the PtZn ensembles in PtZn IMAs exhibit su-
perior anti-coking capacity and stability under PDH reactions conditions.
[PtZn4] Ensembles as the Key Active Site Structures
The above experimental characterizations have evidenced the formation of single-atom
Pt1 sites inside [PtZn4] ensembles, which keep stable under PDH conditions.24,27 To
further investigate the surface-active structures, we have quantiﬁed the mole amounts
of surface [PtZn4] species over different PtZn IMAs (0.1Pt0.17Zn/SiO2, 0.3Pt0.51Zn/
SiO2, 0.5Pt0.85Zn/SiO2, and 1Pt1.7Zn/SiO2) with different particle sizes by altering the
additionsofPtandZnwithﬁxedmolarratiosofPtandZn.TheHADDF-STEMimages(Fig-
ure S37) showed that as the Pt loadings increased from 0.1 to 1 wt %, the mean sizes of
PtZn particles have gradually increased from 0.9 to 2.2 nm. In situ EXAFS spectra (Figures
4A and S38) showed that the different PtZn/SiO2 samples exhibit the same single broad
peak in R space centered around 2.2 Ǻ and the model gave high quality ﬁts to the Pt1Zn1
IMA phase. The Pt–Zn and Pt–Pt coordination numbers were lower than the bulk values
due to the large fraction of under coordinated surface atoms (Table S3). For the same
reason, the Pt–Pt, and Pt–Zn bond distances were contracted from that of the bulk value
for Pt1Zn1, with the contraction becoming more pronounced as the Pt loadings
decreased. This is consistent with the particle size decreasing with the Pt loadings. There-
fore, the different PtZn/SiO2 samples exhibit the same crystalline structures of interme-
tallic Pt1Zn1. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the comparison of surface
energies of low-index surfaces of (110), (111), and (200) shows that (110) surface has the
lowest surface energy, which indicates that the (110) surface is the most stable (Table S7).
Considering the facet of (110) as the most stable plane, it would prefer to expose on the
surface of Pt1Zn1 IMAs. On the surface of (110), each Pt atom is coordinated with 4 neigh-
boring Zn atoms and forms the [PtZn4] ensembles (Figure S22). Therefore, the amount of
[PtZn4] species are approximately equal the amount of surface-exposed Pt atoms, which
can be determined by the dispersion of Pt atoms. As shown in Figure S39, with the
increasing of Pt loadings from 0.1 to 1 wt % and particle sizes from 0.9 to 2.2 nm, the
dispersion of Pt atoms correspondingly decreases from 88.3% to 36.1%. Notably, under
PDH reactions,wefound that these different PtZn/SiO2 samples exhibited veryclose pro-
pyleneselectivity ofabout96% (Figure4B), furtherdemonstratingthe similar surface PtZn
ensemble of [PtZn4] in these PtZn IMAs. When correlating C3H6 formation rates with the
amounts of [PtZn4] species, a linear relationship between them was observed (Figure 4C).
Also, when the C3H6 formation rates werenormalized byper mole [PtZn4],PtZnIMAswith
different Pt loadings showed a very similar C3H6 formation rate (mol C3H6/mmol [PtZn4]/
h) (Figure S40). Therefore, the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs may be the key
active site structures for PDH to propylene.
To further demonstrate the unique geometric and electronic structures of the single-
atom Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles, we further compared different [PtZnd] (d = 0–4)
ensembles in other PtZn alloys and [PtM4] ensembles in other Pt1M1 (M = Fe, Co,
Ni) IMAs. First, from the perspective of geometric structure, we prepared different
PtZn alloys by exposing different [PtZnd] (d = 0–4) surface ensembles. As XRD pat-
terns shown in Figure S41, the samples of Pt/SiO2, Pt3Zn/SiO2, and Pt1Zn1/SiO2
were successfully prepared, corresponding to the standard Pt (PDF#04-0802),
Pt3Zn alloy (PDF#06-0584), and Pt1Zn1 IMA (PDF#06-0604), respectively. On the

surface of these samples, different [PtZnd] (d = 0–4) ensembles formed, such as [Pt3]
on the surface of Pt (111) (Figures 4D and 4E), [Pt3Zn] on the surface of Pt3Zn (111)
(Figures 4F and 4G), and [PtZn4] on the surface of Pt1Zn1 (110) (Figures 4H and 4I).
When testing for PDH reaction, we found that [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110)
IMA exhibited highest propylene selectivity among different [PtZnd] (d = 0–4) ensem-
bles ([Pt3] < [Pt3Zn] < [PtZn4]) (Figure 4J). This may be because of the fact that the
geometry-isolated Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles weaken the interaction between pro-
pylene intermediate and its surface through a single bond instead of more stable
three Pt–C interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over [Pt3] in Pt (111) and [Pt3Zn] in
Pt3Zn (111). Additionally, to illustrate the unique electronic structures of this
[PtZn4] ensemble, we further compared the [PtZn4] ensemble with other [PtM4] en-
sembles in intermetallic Pt1M1 (M =F e, Co, Ni). As shown in Figure S42A, although
their geometric structures were similar to that of [PtM4] (M = Zn, Fe, Co, Ni) ensem-
bles, where Pt atom is isolated by 4 neighboring M atoms on the surface of Pt1M1
IMAs, the electronic states signiﬁcantly varied. Among them, Pt atoms in Pt1Zn1
IMAs exhibited higher electronic density due to more electron transfer from the
neighboring Zn atoms than other atoms in the ensembles of [PtM4] (M = Zn, Fe,

Co, Ni). As shown in Table S10, although the adsorption conﬁguration of C3H6 on the
top site of isolated Pt atom was similar, the adsorption energies of C3H6 signiﬁcantly
vary, where the adsorption strength of C3H6 were weakened in the order of [PtNi4] >
[PtCo4] > [PtFe4] > [PtZn4]. Consequently, the C3H6 selectivity increased in the order
of [PtNi4] < [PtCo4] < [PtFe4] < [PtZn4] (Figure S42B). Therefore, the isolated Pt atom
in [PtM4] ensembles is active for propane activation, but the neighboring coordina-
tion atoms signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the electronic states of isolated Pt atom, wherein
electron-richer single-atom Pt1 site in [PtZn4] coordination ensembles accounts for
higher propylene selectivity.
Therefore, by correlating the concentrations of [PtZn4] species with propylene for-
mation rates and comparing [PtZn4] with different [PtZnd] (d = 0–4) ensembles in
PtZn alloys and [PtM4] (M = Fe, Co, Ni) in Pt1M1 IMAs, we reasonably prove that
[PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110) IMAs serve as the key active site structures. The
induced geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles could weaken
the propylene adsorption and inhibit the structure-sensitive further dehydrogena-
tion of propylene, leading to increased propylene selectivity and stability.
Density Functional Theory Calculations
We further carried out ﬁrst-principle calculations to investigate the geometric and
electronic promotions of this [PtZn4] ensembles for PDH. First, a DFT-based genetic
algorithm (GA) was used to determine the global minimum (GM) structure of PtZn
alloys, which indicated the atomically ordered IMA was the most stable phase
among all the studied structures with a molar ratio of Pt:Zn = 1:1 (Figures S43–
S45). DFT calculations further indicated that Pt1Zn1 (110) IMAs exhibited superior
structural stability evaluated by surface segregation with the stabilization energy
of <1.0 eV compared with Pt (111) (0 eV), Pt3Zn (111) (0.12 eV), and the previously
reported Pt/Cu SAC (0.15 eV) (Figure 5A).7 The crystal orbital Hamilton population
(COHP) analysis showed that there was the nonexistence of antibonding interaction
in the region of 2 to 0 eV, below the Fermi level, which states the origin of structural
steadiness of [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110) IMAs (Figure 5B).

A simpliﬁed reaction network was used to describe the dehydrogenation behavior
(Figure S46). The ﬁrst dehydrogenation step, considered to be the rate-determining
step, measured the activity, and the difference between the third dehydrogenation
step and propylene desorption barriers denotes the selectivity.34 The transforma-
tion of adsorption geometries of dehydrogenated intermediates C3Hx (x = 7, 6, 5)
illustrates the critical discrepancy between [Pt3], [Pt3Zn], and [PtZn4] ensembles (Fig-
ures 5D and S47). Speciﬁcally, owing to the site-isolated Pt1 in [PtZn4] ensembles,
C3H5, a model precursor of coke formation, can only contact with its surface through
a single bond instead of more stable three Pt–C interactions on a 3-fold hollow site
over Pt3 sites in Pt (111) and Pt3Zn (111). The calculated charge transfer from the
neighboring Zn to Pt (Table S8) further reveals the feature of electron enrichment
of site-isolated Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles (Figure 5C), which is beneﬁcial to lower
adsorption energy of propylene (Table S9). Consequently, compared with Pt (111)
(< 0.1 eV), PtZn (110) IMA shows a larger difference between the third dehydrogena-
tion step and propylene desorption barriers (> 1.0 eV), which leads to a much higher
propylene selectivity and less coking favorability (Figures 5E and S48).
DISCUSSION
In conclusion, all the above simulations and experiments, taken together, persua-
sively evidence that atomically ordered PtZn IMAs are highly efﬁcient for PDH.
The unique geometric and electronic structures of surface [PtZn4] ensembles
effectively activate the ﬁrst and second C–H bonds of propane but prohibit the struc-
ture-sensitive coke side reaction. The site-isolated Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles can only
contact with C3H5 through a single bond instead of more stable three Pt–C interac-
tions in [Pt3] ensembles, and the electron-rich Pt further promotes the desorption of
propylene. Additionally, the atomically ordered IMA structure particularly guaran-
tees the superior anti-segregation and anti-sintering resistance. The resulting sin-
gle-site [PtZn4] intermetallic catalysts bring the highest propylene productivity at a
lowest deactivation rate under the industrial conditions. These ﬁndings provide a
promising route to prepare efﬁcient Pt-based bimetal dehydrogenation catalysts
by isolating Pt atoms into single-site catalysts via assembling atomically ordered
IMAs. We also expect that the reported discovery will open the exploitation of sin-
gle-site IMAs as robust active sites for the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions as
well as processing CO2, N2, and other carbonaceous fuels.

Catalytic Reaction Test
Catalytic tests were performed in a quartz ﬁxed-bed reactor with an 8 mm inner diameter
and 24 cm length at atmosphere pressure. 250 mg of the calcined catalyst with a particle
size of 20 to 40 meshes was packed inside the quartz tubular reactor. The sample was ﬁrst
heatedto600Catarateof10Cmin1andretainedat600Cfor1.5h inﬂowing18vol%
H2/N2. During the activity test, a mixture of C3H8 (Air Liquide, 99.9%), H2 (Air Liquide,
99.9%) and N2 (Air Liquide, 99.9%) (16:16:68 vol %) was fed at a rate of 50 mL min1
over 0.25 g catalysts. The WHSV of propane was around 4 h1. The stability test was per-
formed under industrial operating conditions at 600C, where a mixture of C3H8 (Air
Liquide, 99.9%) and H2 (Air Liquide, 99.9%) (67:33 vol %, no inert gas dilution) was fed
at a rate of 12 mL min1 over 0.1 g catalysts. The WHSV of propane was around 11
h1. The gas products were analyzed by an online GC (2060) equipped with a ﬂame ioni-
zationdetector(chromosorb 102column) andathermalconductivitydetector(Al2O3plot

Equation 1 and 2, respectively. The propylene productivity is deﬁned as the moles of

A ﬁrst-order deactivation model was used to evaluate the catalyst stability:
kd = (ln [(1  Xﬁnal)/Xﬁnal] –ln [(1 – Xinitial)/Xintial])/t
(Equation 4)
where Xintial and Xﬁanal, respectively, represent the conversion measured at the initial
and ﬁnal period of an experiment, and t represents the reaction time (h), kd is the
deactivation rate constant (h1). High kd value means rapid deactivation, that is,
low stability.
Methods for Characterization
The elemental composition of the catalysts was analyzed by inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (VISTA-MPX, Varian). Before mea-
surements, the catalysts were digested in the mixed solutions of hydroﬂuoric acid
and aqua regia.
The XRD measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 diffractometer operating at
200 mA and 40 kV, employing the graphite ﬁltered Cu Ka as the radiation source.
The data points were collected by step scanning with a rate of 6 min1 from 2q =
10 to 80. The crystallite size (d) of copper was calculated by X-ray broadening tech-
nique using the Scherrer’s equation:
d = 0.89 l/(B cosq)
(Equation 5)
Here, l is the wavelength of the radiation source (0.15418 nm); B is the half-width of
the strongest diffraction peak in the radian unit; and q is its diffraction angle.
H2-O2 titration method was used to determine the dispersion of Pt with a Micromer-
itics AutoChem II 2920 apparatus with a thermal conductive detector based on our
prior works. For every test, 100 mg of sample was reduced at 600C with a ﬂow rate
of 30 mL min1 of 10 vol % H2/Ar for 1h, and then cooled down to 50C under Ar
purging. Subsequently, 10 vol % O2/He was introduced to the sample by injection
pulses until the consumption peaks became stable. Finally, H2 chemisorption was
performed by injection pulses of 10 vol % H2/Ar. It can be presumed that the adsorp-
tion stoichiometry factor of Pt/H2 was equal to 2/3. The platinum dispersion is calcu-
lated by the following equation:
Dispersion (%) = 100 3 VH2 3 2/3 3 MWPt/(WPt 3 22414)
(Equation 6)
where VH2 is the volume of adsorbed H2 (mL), MWPt is the atomic weight of Pt
(g$mol1), and WPt is the weight of Pt supported on the sample (g).
TOF was calculated as moles of propane converted and propylene formed per mole
of exposed Pt per second:
TOF = RC3H8 (C3H6)/DPt
(Equation 7)
where RC3H8 (C3H6) is the speciﬁc activity of propane converted and propylene forma-
tion (s1); and DPt is the dispersion of Pt.

The diffused reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (CO-DRIFTS) of the
catalysts were obtained by Nicolet 6700 spectrometer with a stainless-steel cell con-

pressed into in situ cell equipped with ZnSe windows. Prior to CO adsorption, the
sample was reduced in H2 with the ﬂow rate is 30 mL/min at 600C for 1.5 h. After
that, the catalysts were purged under a ﬂow of Ar (20 mL/min) for 0.5 h to remove
the chemisorbed other impurity species and then cooled to 30C under He to collect
the background spectrum. Then the catalysts were exposed to a ﬂow of a gas
mixture of CO 3 mL/min, Ar 20 mL/min at 30C for 0.5 h to adsorb CO, and then
purging Ar (20 mL/min) for 20 min. The IR spectra can be collected with a resolution

284.0–284.8 eV. Reduction of samples was performed in an UHV connected high-
pressure gas cell. The samples were heated in 10% hydrogen diluted in Ar (1 mL/
min H2 and 9 mL/min Ar, total pressure 1 bar) ﬂow to 600C for 60 min for reducing
and then switch to 10% C3H8 diluted in He with 40 mL/min. The photoelectron
spectra were recorded after UHV transfer of the samples to the analyzer chamber
without contact with the atmosphere.
In situ Platinum L3 edge and zinc K edge, X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) was
measured at 10-BM (MRCAT) of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National
Laboratory. Samples measured in transmission mode were ground into a ﬁne pow-
der and pressed into a stainless-steel sample holder and treated inside of a quartz
tube reactor ﬁtted with valves for gas ﬂow and X-ray transparent Kapton windows.
Samples were heated to 600C in 3.5% H2 (balance He) for 30 min. For the reaction
condition treatments, samples were treated at 600C with 3.5% H2 and 3.5% C3H8
(balance He). The reactor was purged with helium at high temperature for 5 min
before cooling to room temperature in helium for analysis. Helium used was ultra-
high purity grade and was passed through an oxygen trap prior to use. Samples
for ﬂuorescence were ground into a ﬁne powder and pressed into a stainless-steel
sample holder with the catalyst wafer oriented 45 relative to the X-ray beam. The
cell used for ﬂuorescence measurement consists of a water-cooled stage ﬁtted
with Kapton windows for ﬂuorescence and transmission measurement. For treat-
ments, the cell is equipped with water cooling and ceramic heaters for temperature
control and valves for gas ﬂow.
For the Pt and Pt–Zn samples ﬂuorescence was measured using a standard 3.3 cm
Lytle detector with a Zn foil used to reduce background ﬂuorescence. Fluorescence
X-rays diffract through the logarithmically bent crystal and are angularly dispersed
downstream of the crystal. By choosing the correct detector angle relative to the
bent crystal, the Pt La ﬂuorescence line was selectively collected. Data analysis

and ﬁtting of the EXAFS was performed using WinXAS 3.1 software. XANES edge
energy was taken as the ﬁrst zero crossing of the second derivative of the normalized
spectra. For the Pt–Zn samples data was Fourier transformed over k range of 2.7–
10 A
˚ 1 and ﬁt using from 1.3–3 A
˚ in R space. Monometallic Pt samples were Fourier
transformed over a k range of 2.7–14 A
˚ 1 and ﬁt in R space from 1.9–3.1 A
˚ . Pt–Pt
phase and amplitude functions were extracted from Pt foil (12 neighbors 2.77 Ǻ).
Pt–Zn phase and amplitude functions were constructed using FEFF with the ampli-
tude reduction factor, Debye-Waller factor, and E0 correction for the reference ﬁxed
at the value used to ﬁt the platinum foil so that ﬁt values of the Debye-Waller factor
and E0 correction are relative to the platinum foil. The Pt–Zn bond distance was
taken from ICSD data for the Pt1Zn1 phase with a Pt–Zn bond distance of 2.66 A
˚ .
Fitting was accomplished by ﬁrst ﬁxing the Debye-Waller factor and reﬁning the co-
ordination number, bond distance, and E0 correction in R space. The bond distance
and E0 were then ﬁxed and the ﬁrst shell scattering was isolated and back Fourier
transformed into k space. The Debye-Waller factor and coordination number were
then reﬁned simultaneously on in R space and the isolated k space ﬁrst shell scat-
tering. For Pt–Zn samples, a model of the Pt1Zn1 phase was constructed by con-
straining the coordination number ratio of Pt–Zn: Pt–Pt neighbors to match that
found in bulk Pt1Zn1 which has 8 zinc neighbors and 4 Pt neighbors giving a coordi-
nation number ratio of 2.
Temperature-programmed experiments were all carried out with a Micromeritics
AutoChem 2920 apparatus. For O2-TPO tests, 100 mg of samples after 10 h test
at 600C was heated at 300C for 1 h and cooled down to 50C in a ﬂow of Ar
(30 mL/min) and then heated in a stream of 10 vol % O2/He (30 mL/min) with 10C
min1 up to 800C. For C3H8-TPSR tests, 100 mg of sample was heated at 300C
for 1 h and cooled down to 50C in a ﬂow of Ar (30 mL/min) and then reduced in a
stream of C3H8 (5 mL/min) at a heating rate of 10C min1 up to 650C. The output
products (C3H8, C3H6, CH4, and H2, m/e equals 29, 41, 16, and 2, respectively) for
both C3H8-TPSR were measured via mass spectrometer (MS) instantaneously. For
C3H6-TPD experiments, 100 mg of sample was ﬁrst reduced in ﬂowing 10 vol %
H2/Ar at 600C for 1 h. Then, the sample was cooled down to 50C and the gas
was switched to ﬂowing Ar to ﬂush the apparatus. Subsequently, the adsorption
of C3H6 was achieved by the introduction of ﬂowing C3H6 for 45 min, and then the
system was purged with ﬂowing He for 30 min. After that, the sample was raised
at a rate of 10C/min up to 600C in ﬂowing He.
DFT Calculations
All periodic boundary calculations were carried out with the Vienna ab initio Simula-
tion Package (VASP) using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method and the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of the Bayesian error estima-
tion functional with van der Waals corrections (BEEF-vdW). The plane-wave basis set
was converged at a cutoff energy of 400 eV for each slab model, of which the bottom
two layers were ﬁxed. A four-layer 4 3 4 unit cell and a ﬁve-layer 2 3 2 unit cell were
used for Pt (111) and PtZn (110), respectively. The k-points mesh of 3 3 3 3 1 was
used. All structures were allowed to relax until the force on each atom was less
than 0.02 eV/A
˚ . Transition states (TSs) were determined with the climbing-image
nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method or the dimer method. The computational
method is the same as Chen et al.,36 in order to make reliable contrast.
Entropic contributions and zero-point energy (ZPE) were taken into account, con-
verting DFT calculated energy into free energy. According to Campbell’s method,37
the entropy of adsorbate was calculated with the equation as follows:

Sads = 0.7Sgas  3.3R
(Equation 8)
where Sads is the entropy of adsorbate; Sgas is the entropy of the corresponding gas-
phase species, which can be generally obtained from a standard thermodynamic
database, using the heat capacity to extrapolate to unlisted temperatures; and R
is the ideal gas constant. No entropy change is assumed for surface reaction as
the harmonic approximation is poor at determining entropy in low-frequency vibra-
tional modes. All the kinetic and thermodynamic analyses were carried out at 873 K
with 0.28, 0.15, and 0.04 atm partial pressures for H2, C3H8 and C3H6, respectively,
which kept pace with the experimental conditions.
The adsorption energy is deﬁned as Etotal  Eslab  EC3H8 + [(8  x)/2]EH2, where Etotal
is the total energy of the slab with C3Hx adsorbed, Eslab is the energy of clean slab
while EC3H8 and EH2 refer to the energy of C3H8 and H2 in the gas phase, respectively.
The alloy formation energy, 1.1 eV for PtZn IMA, is characterized by bulk energy of
alloy and pure metal with the same number of atoms, namely, DE = EPtZn  EPt  EZn.
Here, a negative value indicates that alloy formation is energetically favorable, in
accordance with the large miscibility of Pt with Zn to experimentally examine alloys.
The surface energy, g, is calculated with the following formula:

Moreover,asZnwiththe lowersurface energymanifestsstrongersegregation propensity
thanPt, the surface segregation ofZnisfurther investigatedtoelucidate the stability ofZn
in PtZn IMA. The stabilization energyof Zn is 0.66 eV, which states the segregation ofZn
is unfavorable in PtZn. In addition, based on the nearest-neighbor approximation and
calculated cohesive energies,37 one estimates the following bond energies: EZn–Zn =
0.18 eV, EPt–Pt = 0.46 eV and EPt–Zn = 0.49 eV. The energy change due to the forma-
tion of one Pt–Zn bond from Pt–Pt and Zn–Zn bonds is: 0.49 – [(0.18) + (0.46)]/2 =
0.17 eV. This negative energy change implies that the formation of Pt–Zn bond is
exothermic, which can opposeZnsegregation inanalloy through releasing energy.How-
ever, it is still necessary to clarify whether the exothermic alloy formation is able to over-
comethe surface segregation ofZn. For alloy (A+B),surface enrichmenttakes place inthe
component B with lower surface energy38 while its segregation can be overcome by the
formation of AB alloy when the inequality EAA > EAB holds, where EAA and EAB are the
bond energy between atoms of component A or between atoms of different compo-
nents. For PtZn alloy, A = Pt and B = Zn. Based on the calculated bond energies, one
can see that EPt–Pt > EPt–Zn, demonstrating that the energy gain by forming Pt–Zn bonds
is sufﬁcient to overcome the surface segregation of Zn in PtZn IMA.
