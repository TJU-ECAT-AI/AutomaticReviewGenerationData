A versatile pore network model is used to study deactivation by coking in a single catalyst particle. This approach allows
to gain detailed insights into the progression of deactivation from active site, to pore, and to particle—providing valuable
information for catalyst design. The model is applied to investigate deactivation by coking during propane dehydrogenation
in a Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst particle. We ﬁnd that the deactivation process can be separated into two stages when there exist
severe diffusion limitation and pore blockage, and the toxicity of coke formed in the later stage is much stronger than of
coke formed in the early stage. The reaction temperature and composition change the coking rate and apparent reaction
rate, informed by the kinetics, but, remarkably, they do not change the capacity for a catalyst particle to accommodate
coke. Conversely, the pore network structure signiﬁcantly affects the capacity to contain coke. © 2018 The Authors. AIChE

Introduction
Propylene is a key feedstock in the petrochemical industry,
which is widely used in the production of many important che-
micals (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and
cumene).1,2 Propylene is traditionally produced as a byproduct
from steam cracking and ﬂuid catalytic cracking, but these
processes cannot satisfy the ever-growing demand for propyl-
ene in recent years.3 Hence, techniques for the purposeful pro-
duction of propylene (including propane dehydrogenation,
Fischer-Tropsch-to-oleﬁns, and methanol-to-oleﬁns) have been
developed and commercialized.4 Among these, propane dehy-
drogenation is currently one of the most economical, due to
the large price gap between propane and propylene.1
A major problem during propane dehydrogenation is the
fast catalyst deactivation by coke formation. This problem per-
sists in industrial processes. For example, the Pt-Sn/ZnAl2O3
catalyst used in the Uhde STAR process is signiﬁcantly deacti-
vated by coke after 7 h on stream; the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst
used in the Catoﬁn process should be regenerated after only
12 min.1,5,6 Hence, it is of great importance to design robust
catalysts against deactivation by coke formation for propane
dehydrogenation. To achieve such robust catalysts, it is essen-
tial to understand coking and deactivation at different length
scales.
Froment7-9 classiﬁed catalyst deactivation phenomena asso-
ciated with coke deposition into three levels: micro-level,
meso-level, and macro-level. At the micro-level or the active
site level, coke covers active sites and isolates these sites from
reactants. At this level, it is essential to understand chemical
pathways leading to coke precursors, as well as the interaction
of these precursors with active sites. At the meso-level or the
particle level, coke narrows and even blocks pores, leading to
reduced active sites and enhanced diffusion resistance. Hence,
at this level, the effect of the pore network structure on coking
and deactivation must be accounted for. Finally, at the macro-
level or the reactor level, ﬂow and heat transfer affect coking
and deactivation of catalysts packed in the reactor, resulting in
transient behavior.
For propane dehydrogenation, coking and deactivation at
the active site level and the reactor level were extensively
investigated. Many density functional theory calculations10-13
were performed to probe pathways and mechanisms of coke
formation over active sites; some kinetic experiments14-18 were
also conducted to correlate deactivation with coking in a quan-
titative way. Such studies can guide the rational design of cat-
alysts at the active site level, to screen promoters and tailor

active sites. Fixed bed, moving bed, and ﬂuidized bed reactors
have been successfully applied in commercial processes for
propane dehydrogenation, and much effort19-23 has been
devoted to exploring coking and deactivation in these reactors.
This work has contributed to novel reactor designs, such as
two-zone ﬂuidized bed reactors.20-22
However, up to now, coking and deactivation at the particle
or meso-level during propane dehydrogenation has not been
reported in the literature, although the knowledge of this is
essential to design the catalyst particle, which includes its pore
network structure and active site distribution.24-26 The process
of coking and deactivation in a catalyst particle is very com-
plex. Coke can be nonuniformly distributed through the cata-
lyst particle, and the distribution of coke is largely affected by
the pore network structure and reaction conditions.27-30 Coke
narrows and eventually plugs pores during reaction, leading to
signiﬁcant changes in pore network structure.31-33 Some large
pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become
inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity
of the coking process. In addition, a percolation phenomenon
occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops
below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected,
particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes discon-
nected.24,30,34,35
In
this
case,
macroscopic
properties
(e.g., effective diffusivity and the observed reaction rates)
would experience a sudden change.24,30,34 This critical fraction
of open pores is known as the percolation threshold.35 Finally,
coke deactivates catalyst particles in several ways, not just by
covering active sites; a signiﬁcant loss in activity can also be
caused by the increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible
active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores.27,28,33 Con-
sidering the above complications, a proper mathematical
model is needed to probe coking and deactivation at the parti-
cle level, which is what this article sets out to do.
Continuum and discrete models34,36 can be used to simulate
coking and deactivation in a catalyst particle. Continuum models
are characterized by a pseudo-homogeneous description of diffu-
sivities, reaction rates, tortuosity factors, and many other macro-
scopic properties at a length scale much larger than the
dimension of individual pores.29,30,34 Due to this characteristic,
continuum models cannot describe percolation phenomena and
their associated impacts on catalyst performance. Zhang and
Seaton37 compared continuum models with discrete models, and
they proved that continuum models break down when the pore
network is close to a percolation threshold. Examples of discrete
models are the Bethe lattice38 and various pore network
models39,40 to describe both morphology and topology of the
pore space in catalyst particles. Moreover, pore network models
have been successfully used to describe percolation phenomena
in some reaction systems, such as hydrodemetallation,24,29,30
hydrodesulphurization,41,42
benzene
hydrogenation,43,44
and
deactivation of immobilized glucose isomerase.40,45,46 Therefore,
a pore network model should be used to probe coking and deac-
tivation during propane dehydrogenation in a catalyst particle.
In this work, a pore network model is ﬁrst proposed to
describe the coupled diffusion, reaction, coking, and deactiva-
tion processes in a catalyst particle for propane dehydrogena-
tion. With this pore network model, we obtain and analyze
representative distributions of coke in the catalyst particle,
concentration proﬁles of reactant and products, and the
relation between coke content and apparent reaction rate.
Eventually, we probe the effects of coking kinetics, reaction
conditions, and pore network structure on coking and deacti-
vation processes in the catalyst particle.
Model Formulation
The proposed pore network model can be divided into three
interconnected parts, namely, the pore network, diffusion and
reaction, and coking and deactivation. Before introducing
these parts, the following important assumptions are made. Pt-
Sn/Al2O3 is taken as the model catalyst, as it is a widely used
catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in industry. The gradi-
ents of temperature and total pressure in the catalyst particle
are neglected, which is proven to be reasonable in Supporting
Information Figure S1. Only the main reaction and coke for-
mation reaction are considered, as other side reactions, like
propane cracking, can be neglected under the relevant reaction
conditions for propane dehydrogenation.1 Coke is assumed to
be noncatalytic and its formation is irreversible; the density of
coke is set to 1200 kg/m3, which is within the range reported
in the literature.47,48 Finally, at 1 bar, the gas mixture follows
the ideal gas law.
Pore network
The pore space of a catalyst particle is represented by the
pore network within a two-dimensional disc domain, as
illustrated in Figure 1. Two-dimensional pore networks should
be adequate to describe the primary features of the pore struc-
ture in real catalyst particles and to investigate the effects of
the pore structure on deactivation by coke formation, although
the dimensionality of the pore network would quantitatively,
but not qualitatively, inﬂuence the results.29 Using two-
dimensional pore networks reduces the computational time to
within a reasonable limit: it takes several hours to conduct a
simulation when using a two-dimensional pore network in this
work, while the computational time for the same simulation is
about 25 times longer (this is, several days) when using a
three-dimensional pore network.
The method for generating the pore network is adopted
from the work by Ye et al.,40 in which more details of this

method are given. The nodes in the pore network are treated
as zero-volume intersections, while the bonds are assumed to
be cylindrical pores. The pore connectivity (Z) is kept the
same for all inner nodes to simplify the pore network. The
original pore radius (ro) for the fresh catalyst particle is ran-
domly assigned, but follows a log-normal distribution44:

Here, Vt is the total pore volume of the catalyst particle, ra
is the volume-averaged pore radius, and σ is the standard devi-
ation of the natural logarithm of the pore radius. The above
structural parameters can be obtained from nitrogen sorption
and mercury porosimetry measurements.49
Diffusion and reaction
In the pore network, the process of diffusion and main reac-
tion can be mathematically described using different equations
in pore channels and nodes; the solution of these equations
yields concentration proﬁles of reactant and products. In a
pore channel, the diffusion–reaction equation for compo-
nent i is:
∂Ci
∂t ¼ −∂Ji
∂l + 2roRi

ð2Þ
where Ci is the concentration of component i, l and r are the
length and radius of the pore, Ji is the diffusion ﬂux of compo-
nent i, and Ri is the reaction rate of component i per unit pore
surface area. As, the coking rate is much slower than the rate of
diffusion and reaction in this reaction system,1 the quasi-steady-
state condition is satisﬁed, and Eq. 2 can be simpliﬁed to:
0 ¼ −dJi

The diffusion ﬂux (Ji) is described by Fick’s law with an

from the kinetic theory of gases,50 Di,j is the binary diffusivity
of component i in a mixture of i and j that can be calculated
from the Chapman–Enskog equation,51 and xi is the mole frac-
tion of component i. The Wilke–Bosanquet model is a very
good approximation of the Dusty Gas model in this case, as
proven in Supporting Information Figure S2. Besides, the
Wilke–Bosanquet model is computationally less demanding. It
should be noted that coke deposition can narrow pores signiﬁ-
cantly, so that restricted, “conﬁgurational” diffusion becomes
important. To account for this restricted diffusion, the equation
for the effective diffusivity, Eq. 5, is modiﬁed24,25,32:

namic parameters (k1, K, K2, and K3), which are functions of

where Ci,b is the bulk concentration of component i.
Coking and deactivation
In the pore network, coking and deactivation occur simulta-
neously; they affect each other in three ways, namely, through
site coverage, pore narrowing, and pore blockage,7-9 as shown
in Figure 2. First, coke causes deactivation by covering active
sites, which is reﬂected by the catalyst activity (a) in Eq. 8.
Then, coke narrows pores and, subsequently, reduces the
effective diffusivity (Di,e) in Eq. 7. Finally, coke plugs pores,
and some open pores become isolated from the bulk phase;
meanwhile, active sites in these pores become inaccessible to
reactant and products. The coke formation reaction also deacti-
vates itself in the same three ways.
The coking rate per unit pore surface area (Rc) is adopted
from the literature16:
Rc ¼ dCc
dt ¼ ac

where Cc (g/m2) is the loading of coke in a pore channel per
unit surface area; ac is the catalyst activity for coke formation,
which is described by Eqs. 12 and 13; and kc is the reaction
rate constant of the coking reaction. When assuming that the
coke formation reaction and main reaction occur by a single
site mechanism on the same active sites, and coke uniformly
deactivates these active sites, the relation between coke load-
ing and activity can be described by8,32,52:
a ¼ ac ¼ Ccm −Cc
Ccm
ð12Þ
where Ccm is the maximum loading of coke required to
completely deactivate the active sites on the catalyst surface,
which is constant for a speciﬁc catalyst. Equation 12 is a good

approximation to describe the relation between coke loading
and activity, as proven by Li et al.16 Combining Eqs. 11 and

where the deactivation rate constant (kd) is a function of

The loading of coke at time t + Δt is calculated by:
Cc t + Δt
ð
Þ ¼ Cc t
ð Þ + Rc t
ð ÞΔt
ð14Þ
where Δt is the time step. As coking proceeds, the pore net-
work structure changes accordingly. The coke can accumulate
on both metal sites (Pt-Sn) and support (Al2O3), due to the
shift of the coke from metal sites to support, especially in the
presence of Sn in the catalyst.53 Thus, we assume that coke
uniformly covers the pore surface, and the pore radius can be
determined for a given coke loading32:

where ρc is the density of coke. If r is less than the molecu-
lar radius of propane (0.215 nm),54 the pore is considered
plugged by coke. Some open pores can become inaccessible
to reactant and products when they are surrounded by these
plugged pores (see Figure 2c). In our work, the extended
Hoshen–Kopelman algorithm55 is used to identify these inac-
cessible pores.
Implementation
The algorithm to solve the pore network model consists of
three tightly coupled steps (see Figure 3); the details of these
steps are given in the previous three subsections. In step 1, the
pore network is constructed according to predeﬁned topologi-
cal and morphological parameters, and an initial guess for the
concentrations is assigned to the pore network. In step 2, equa-
tions for diffusion and reaction in the pore network are solved
by iteration to yield concentration proﬁles of reactant and
products at time t, and the parameters for the pore network
and catalyst activities used in this step are adopted from step
3. In step 3, equations for coking and deactivation are solved
to update the pore network structure and catalyst activities at
time t + Δt, in which the concentration proﬁles calculated in
step 2 are used. If time t + Δt does not reach the maximum
time for reaction (tm), the process returns to step 2; if time
t + Δt exceeds tm, the results are output and the process is
ended. The above algorithm is implemented in MATLAB
2010b, however, using a newer version of MATLAB can
increase the computational speed. Some data are visualized
using Rhinoceros 4.0.
The solution of the pore network model yields concentration
proﬁles of reactant, products, and coke in the pore network, as
well as distributions of reaction rates for propane dehydroge-
nation and coke formation. With these results, the dimension-
less coke content in the catalyst particle (Wc) can be
calculated by32:

where N is the total number of pores in the pore network.
As coking proceeds, Wc increases with time and the value of
Wc at the end of reaction (or at the ﬁnal reaction time) reﬂects
the capacity for a catalyst particle to accommodate coke. The
apparent reaction rate for propane dehydrogenation (Rapp) can
be calculated using a scaling rule24,36:

where RPN is the overall reaction rate in the pore network,
f is the thus-deﬁned scaling factor, RC3H6,n is the formation rate
of propylene in pore n, and S is the internal surface area of the
catalyst particle. The decrease of Rapp with time directly
reﬂects the deactivation process. Meanwhile, Rapp can also
correlate with Wc, which gives the relationship between deacti-
vation and coking.
The parameters used in the simulations are presented in
Table 1. The number of nodes, 1393, is adequate and reason-
able, because adding more nodes does not change the simula-
tion results, but increases computational cost signiﬁcantly (see
Supporting Information Figure S3). The time step is set to
100 s to obtain accurate results and also reduce computational
cost (see Supporting Information Figure S4).
Results and Discussion
Fundamental features of the coking and deactivation
An archetypical simulation is performed to probe the funda-
mental features of coking and deactivation in the catalyst parti-
cle for propane dehydrogenation, and the results are presented
in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows that the dimensionless coke
content (Wc) increases quickly at short times, but only changes

slightly after reaching 0.40 at 2100 s, which is consistent with
the trend observed in experiments.14,15 Besides, Wc at 8000 s
(i.e., 0.46) is much smaller than the maximum value (i.e., 1),
indicating that the catalyst particle exhibits a poor capacity to
contain coke. In Figure 4b, the apparent reaction rate (Rapp) is
correlated with Wc, and the deactivation process can be sepa-
rated into two stages. Rapp during stage 2 decreases more rap-
idly than during stage 1 (see Figure 4b), indicating that any
additional coke formed during stage 2 has a stronger detrimen-
tal effect on the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
To explain the results in Figure 4, distributions of coke-
plugged pores, as well as concentration proﬁles of propane
and propylene are calculated (see Figure 5). When t ≤1900 s,
the plugged and inaccessible pores do not form a large cluster
and many pores in the central zone of the particle are still
available to contain more coke; when t ≥2100 s, a large clus-
ter of plugged and inaccessible pores occupies the central zone
of the particle and the number of pores available to contain
coke drops sharply. This percolation phenomenon could
explain the signiﬁcant change in coking rate after 2100 s (see
Figure 4a).
In Figure 5, the concentration gradients of propane and pro-
pylene at t = 100 s are very steep, indicating strong diffusion
resistance in the catalyst particle. Due to diffusion limitations,
the reaction rate in each pore is largely dependent on the radial
position of the pore. Based on this understanding, we can infer
that the coke deposited in different zones of the catalyst parti-
cle exhibits distinct toxicities to propane dehydrogenation.
Speciﬁcally, if coke is preferentially deposited in the outer
zone of the catalyst particle, the catalyst deactivates more
quickly, because the reaction rate in this zone is much higher.
When t ≥2100 s, almost all the pores in the central zone of
the catalyst particle become plugged or inaccessible (see

Figure 5), which is identiﬁed by the extended Hoshen–
Kopelman algorithm,55 and then fresh coke only poisons the
pores in the outer zone of the particle. This explains the stron-
ger toxicity of the coke formed at stage 2 (see Figure 4b).
Effects of coking kinetics
The maximum loading of coke (Ccm) reﬂects the maximum
capacity of a catalyst to contain coke, and this parameter is
independent on the pore network structure. Figure 6a shows
that the dimensionless coke content (Wc) at the ﬁnal reaction
time increases from 0.24 to 0.97 when changing Ccm from
8 × 10−3 to 1 × 10−3 g/m2. A smaller Ccm indicates that less
coke is produced, and hence the effect of pore blockage is less
important, leading to a higher Wc. In Figure 6b, the apparent
reaction rate (Rapp) drops more rapidly with a larger Ccm,
which is anticipated because a larger Ccm means a quicker
coking rate according to Eq. 11, causing faster deactivation.
Figure 6c shows that no obvious transition points in the curves
are observed with Ccm ≤2 × 10−3 g/m2. In such cases, the
catalyst particle is close to complete deactivation before form-
ing a large cluster of plugged and inaccessible pores, which
results in no obvious transition points. It is worth mentioning
that the pore network cannot even reach the percolation
threshold when Ccm is small enough (≤1 × 10−3 g/m2), as
shown in Supporting Information Figure S5, which explains
this result.
Effects of reaction conditions
The effects of reaction temperature (T), ratio between bulk
pressure of propane and hydrogen (PC3H8,b=PH2,b), and ratio
between
bulk
pressure
of
propane
and
propylene
(PC3H8,b=PC3H6,b) on coking and deactivation in the catalyst
particle are presented in Figures 7–9, respectively. In Fig-
ures 7a and 8a, the initial coking rate is different when varying
T andPC3H8,b=PH2,b; in Figures 7b, 8b, and 9b, the initial
apparent reaction rate (Rapp) is also distinct when changing the
reaction conditions. These results can be well explained by the
kinetics of coke formation and the main reaction, which are
given in Eqs. 8, 11, and 12. As seen from Figure 9a, the initial
coking rate is independent of PC3H8,b=PC3H6,b. This is because
propane can be quickly dehydrogenated to propylene when
compared to coke formation rate and, hence, the concentration
of propylene (which is the coke precursor) in the central zone
of the catalyst particle changes very little (see Supporting
Information Figure S8 and Figure 5). As seen from Figures 7a,
8a, and 9a, the dimensionless coke content at the ﬁnal reaction
time remains almost unchanged (Wc = 0.45–0.48). This is
because reaction conditions do not change the effect of pore
blockage in the catalyst particle, which is related to the perco-
lation threshold, a geometric property. Besides, in Figure 7c,
8c, and 9c, the transition point in the curve becomes less obvi-
ous
when
T ≤818 K,
PC3H8,b=PH2,b ≤6/3,
and
PC3H8,b=PC3H6,b ≤6/3. Under these reaction conditions, the
concentration gradients of reactant and product are small (see
Supporting Information Figures S6–S8) and the reaction rates
in all the pores are very close to each other, which leads to
close toxicities of the coke deposited in different zones of the
catalyst particle.
Effects of pore network structure
Pore connectivity (Z) is a principal characteristic for the
topology of pore networks. The effects of Z on coking and
deactivation are displayed in Figure 10. Figure 10a shows that
the dimensionless coke content (Wc) at the ﬁnal reaction time
increases from 0.40 to 0.52 with Z changing from 3 to 6, indi-
cating that catalysts with a smaller Z have a lower capacity to
contain coke. This result is expected, because open pores in
pore networks with a smaller Z are more likely to be sur-
rounded by plugged pores and become unavailable to accom-
modate coke. Figure 10b shows that the initial apparent
reaction rate increases when Z changes from 3 to 6, which can
be attributed to the reduced diffusion resistance. As seen from
Figure 10c, the transition point moves toward a higher value
of Wc when increasing Z, implying that more coke is required
to form a large cluster where plugged and inaccessible pores
occupy the central zone of the catalyst particle.
Pore-size distribution is described by two parameters (see
Eq. 1), namely, volume-averaged pore radius (ra) and standard
deviation of the natural logarithm of the pore radius (σ). In
Figure 11a, the dimensionless coke content (Wc) at the ﬁnal
reaction time increases from 0.34 to 0.72 with ra changing
from 3.5 to 8.0 nm. Obviously, a larger ra means that more

pore volume is available to contain coke. As seen from
Figure 11b, the apparent reaction rate increases with ra, due to
the reduced diffusion resistance. In Figure 11c, the transition
point moves toward higher Wc when increasing ra. More coke
is needed to plug large pores, and, therefore, more coke is
required to form a large cluster of plugged and inaccessible
pores.
Figure 12 displays the effect of standard deviation of the
natural logarithm of the pore radius (σ) on coking and deacti-
vation. In Figure 12a, the dimensionless coke content (Wc) at
the ﬁnal reaction time decreases from 0.72 to 0.36 with σ
increasing from 0.1 to 0.7. A higher σ means a broader distri-
bution of pore radii and also implies a larger percentage of
small pores. In this case, large pores are more likely to be sur-
rounded by plugged small pores and subsequently become
inaccessible, resulting in the decreased Wc. Figure 12b shows
that the apparent reaction rate decreases with the increase of σ
from 0.1 to 0.7, which is anticipated, because the diffusion
resistance is larger for a broader pore-size distribution.
Figure 12c shows that the transition point moves toward low
Wc when increasing σ. This is because less coke is needed to
form a large cluster of plugged and inaccessible pores when
the pore-size distribution is broader.
Figure 13 presents the effects of particle radius (R) on
coking and deactivation. As seen from Figure 13a, the initial
coking rate increases with R changing from 0.5 to 4.0 mm.

The concentrations of propylene (coke precursor) in the pores
are lower for smaller catalyst particles (see Supporting Infor-
mation Figure S9 and Figure 5), and, therefore, the coking rate
is reduced according to Eq. 11. Besides, Figure 13a also
shows that the dimensionless coke content at the ﬁnal reaction
time does not change with the particle radius, which indicates
that the pore radius does not affect the capacity for a catalyst
particle to contain coke. In Figure 13b, the apparent reaction
rate decreases with the increase of R from 0.5 to 4.0 mm,
which is expected, because the diffusion path is lengthened.
Figure 13c shows that the transition point becomes less obvi-
ous when R < 0.5 mm. The concentration gradients of reactant
and product are small when R = 0.5 mm (see Supporting
Information Figure S9), leading to very close toxicities of coke
deposited along different radial zones of the catalyst particle.
Conclusions
A pore network model is proposed to simulate coupled dif-
fusion, reaction, coking, and deactivation in the Pt-Sn/Al2O3

catalyst particle for propane dehydrogenation. Three deactiva-
tion mechanisms are accounted for, namely, site coverage,
pore narrowing, and pore blockage. The general features of
coking and deactivation for propane dehydrogenation are
obtained by analyzing an archetypical simulation. Then, the
effects of coking kinetics (maximum loading of coke), reaction
conditions (temperature, PC3H8,b=PH2,b, andPC3H8,b=PC3H6,b),
and pore network structure (connectivity, pore-size distribu-
tion, and particle radius) on coking and deactivation are
investigated.
The deactivation process in the catalyst particle for propane
dehydrogenation can be divided into two stages where the tox-
icity of coke in the later stage is much stronger than of coke in
the early stage. This difference in coke toxicity is attributed to
pore blockage and diffusion limitations, as explained by ana-
lyzing distributions of coke, as well as concentration proﬁles
of propane and propylene. The maximum loading of coke in
the coking kinetics affects coke formation rate and, subse-
quently, inﬂuences the deactivation process in the catalyst par-
ticle. The reaction conditions signiﬁcantly affect coking rate

and the apparent rate of the main reaction, but they do not
change the capacity for a catalyst particle to contain coke. The
pore network structure inﬂuences the apparent reaction rate
considerably by changing the diffusion resistance and diffu-
sion path length. A catalyst particle with higher connectivity,
larger volume-averaged pore radius, and narrower pore-size
distribution has a higher capacity to contain coke. However,
the particle radius does not affect the capacity of a catalyst
particle to accommodate coke. These results should be used to
guide the rational design of robust catalysts against deactiva-
tion by coke formation.
