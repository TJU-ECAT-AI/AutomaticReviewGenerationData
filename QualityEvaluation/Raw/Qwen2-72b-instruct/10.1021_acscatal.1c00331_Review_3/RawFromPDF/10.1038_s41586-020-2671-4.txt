Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed 
with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1â€“5. Such 
catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on 
porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds 
under a H2 flow at high temperatures6. The method works well when using easily 
reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements 
through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical 
potential of rare-earth element oxides6. Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite 
that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called â€˜silanol nestsâ€™) and show 
that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements. We find 
that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species 
with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, 
making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt. High-resolution transmission electron 
microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant 
bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic 
compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the 
propane dehydrogenation reaction. When used with late transition metals, the same 
preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large 
amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic 
activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2.
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petro-
chemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene 
production3. This process is currently attracting interest in the area of 
heterogeneous catalysis owing to a sudden increase in propane supply 
from the shale gas revolution. The industrial PDH process has been 
using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly 
three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7. The Pt metal 
alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as 
a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface. The coke deposition also 
causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene. 
To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt 
nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms 
and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles. But coke deposition still 
occurs, and currently used PtSn/alumina catalysts still require frequent 
and cumbersome regeneration steps to restore their catalytic activity.
Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has 
focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/
mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. 
This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a 
structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced 
catalyst support8â€“13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises 
ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected 
mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals 
by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal 
nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13. We incorporated 
La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt 
catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known 
for their strong metalâ€“support interactions with Pt that stabilize the 
latter in the form of small nanoparticles14,15. Whereas we expected that 
addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite 
catalyst owing to the strong metalâ€“support interaction effect, to our 
surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with 
the addition of La and Y. Investigation by atomic-resolution electron 
microscopy showed that some La and Y existed in an alloyed form with 
Pt nanoparticles, supported on the mesoporous zeolite. Systematic 
exploration allowed us to increase the catalytic lifetime 700-fold by 
ensuring that supported Pt nanoparticles are all present as intermetal-
lic compounds with La.

sion electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig.Â 1a, b) show metal

measurements indicating that Pt and Y coexist in the same particle 
(Fig.Â 1c). To determine the detailed atomic structure of the bimetallic 
nanoparticles, atomic-resolution (AR) HAADF-STEM images and the 
corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) images were taken along 
different zone axes, [100] and [110]. The AR-HAADF-STEM image taken 
along [100] displays a regular array of bright and dark regions, which 
correspond to two different types of atomic column aligned perpen-
dicularly to the image (Fig.Â 1d). The image contrast can be confirmed 
by the line scan profile shown in Fig.Â 1f. Considering the Z-contrast of 
the HAADF detector, the bright parts can be regarded as columns of 
heavy Pt atoms, whereas the dark parts are assigned to columns of 
relatively lighter Y atoms. As shown in the inset of Fig.Â 1d, when pro-
jected along [100], every column of Y atoms is neighboured by eight 
columns of Pt. This ordered atomic arrangement is identical to the L12 
superlattice with an atomic composition of Pt3Y found in bulk metal 
alloys, except for the slight difference in the atomic distance due to 
nanocrystallinity. The Pt3Y L12 structure can be described as the replace-
ment of corner Pt atoms in the unit cell of face-centred cubic Pt metal 
with bulkier Y atoms. The inter-planar distances and angles shown in 
the AR-HAADF-STEM image are consistent with the Pt3Y L12 structure. 
The (010) and (001) reflection spots marked in yellow in the FFT image 
(Fig.Â 1e) are characteristic of the L12 superlattice. The L12 arrangement 
of Pt and Y atoms can also be confirmed when viewed along the [110] 
zone axis (Fig.Â 1g, h). On the basis of the STEM investigation, a structural 
model of the Pt3Y nanoparticle is proposed in Fig.Â 1i. The same L12 super-
lattice structure was also observed in the case of PtLa nanoparticles 
supported on mesoporous zeolite. A detailed structural analysis of 
the Pt3La nanoparticle is provided in Extended Data Fig.Â 1.
The Ptâ€“REE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted 
by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either 
La(NO3)3Â·6H2O or Y(NO3)3Â·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 
350â€‰Â°C and subsequently under H2 at 700â€‰Â°C (seeÂ Methods). However, 
the formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y intermetallic nanoparticles that exhib-
ited long catalytic lifetime critically depended on the zeolite synthesis 
procedures, even when the obtained zeolites were all siliceous and had 
similar mesoporosity. When the zeolite was prepared following a typical

synthesis procedure using sodium silicate, the impregnated REEs in the 
zeolite existed as oxide nanoparticles, without forming intermetallic 
alloy nanoparticles with Pt. The Pt nanoparticles in separation from the 
REEs exhibited an extremely short PDH catalytic lifetime, identical to 
that obtained without REE incorporation. Alternatively, when zeolites 
synthesized under a sodium-free condition were used, there was a small 
but distinct increase in the catalytic lifetime. Our curiosity about this 
phenomenon led us to carry out an AR-HAADF-STEM investigation of 
the Ptâ€“REE/zeolite, in which we observed a tiny portion of supported 
nanoparticles existing in alloy forms. From this unexpected observa-
tion, we speculated that the Ptâ€“REE alloy formation could occur by 
incorporating the REEs in the form of single atomic species with high 
chemical potential. Such single atomic REEs could be converted to 
metallic REEs with H2 more easily than bulk REE oxides. We further 
speculated that the formation of atomically dispersed REEs could be 
assisted by framework defect sites in the zeolite, where multiple silanol 
groups are adjacently positioned to form a cluster of silanol groups 
(silanol nest). In fact, silanol nests are often detected by Fourier trans-
form infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy in mesoporous zeolite synthesized 
under sodium-free conditions. We believe that the silanol nests could 
stabilize the single atomic REE species by forming coordination bonds16. 
In that case, it would be possible to control the formation of Ptâ€“REE 
alloy nanoparticles by the concentration of silanol nests in the zeolite.
With these assumptions, we intentionally generated silanol nests 
by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequently 
removing the framework Ga atoms using nitric acid (seeÂ Methods and 
Extended Data Figs.Â 2, 3). Each of the degallated sites corresponded to 
a generated silanol nest. The increase in the silanol nest concentration 
in the zeolite was supported by FTâ€“IR measurements (Extended Data 
Fig.Â 4). In accordance with our hypothesis, the REEs incorporated in this 
zeolite were indeed atomically dispersed, as shown in a video taken by 
AR-HAADF-STEM (see Supplementary VideoÂ 1). In this video, the single 
atomic species of La exhibited rapid and random translational motions 
on the zeolite surface, which we interpret as a single atomic REE species 
hopping from one silanol nest to another. We believe that the atomistic 
diffusion enables the formation of Ptâ€“REE intermetallic nanoparticles 
when the zeolite is heated under H2 at 700â€‰Â°C after impregnation of the 
metal precursors. In fact, the Ptâ€“REE/zeolite sample shown in Fig.Â 1 
was prepared using a degallated zeolite containing a large number of 
silanol nest sites. The Ptâ€“REE/zeolite showed formation of Pt3La and 
Pt3Y nanoparticles throughout the zeolite support. The Pt3La and Pt3Y 
nanoparticles generated in this manner exhibited a distinctive H2 sorp-
tion behaviour (see Extended Data TableÂ 1). The alloy nanoparticles 
chemisorbed 0.5 H atoms per total Pt in the sample in a fully reversible 
manner, given that all hydrogen completely desorbed upon evacuation 
for 1Â h at room temperature. Monometallic Pt nanoparticles, by con-
trast, chemisorbed 1.0 H atoms per total Pt, with 64% of this amount 
strongly and irreversibly bonded. This indicates that the electronic state 
of the intermetallic compound nanoparticles was markedly different 
from that of monometallic Pt, as further confirmed by X-ray absorption 
near-edge structure (XANES) analysis (see Extended Data Fig.Â 5), which 
indicated a noticeable shift in edge energy and in the white-line region 
upon the formation of Ptâ€“REE intermetallic compounds.
The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated 
zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH cata-
lytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as 
shown in Fig.Â 2. The catalytic reaction was performed at 580â€‰Â°C using 
a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (seeÂ Methods), and these 
harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina 
catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactiva-
tion within 1Â d. In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles 
supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where 
mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane con-
version of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent 
extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 
days of reaction. In a control using a catalyst with the same amounts 
of Pt and La supported on the mesoporous zeolite synthesized from 
sodium silicate (denoted as PtLa/mz), propane conversion was 22% 
initially and dropped very rapidly to below 5% within 1.5Â h. Even though 
both catalysts used zeolites with the same MFI framework structure 
and the same mesoporosity as the support (Extended Data Fig.Â 6), 
their catalytic lifetimes differed by three orders of magnitude. The 
rapid deactivation behaviour of the PtLa/mz catalyst was similar to 
that of the monometallic Pt catalyst supported on mesoporous zeo-
lite (Pt/mz), consistent with the hydrogen chemisorption property of 
the PtLa/mz sample, indicating that the supported Pt existed entirely 
as monometallic nanoparticles and that no alloy with La was present 
(Extended Data TableÂ 1). These comparisons suggest that the differ-
ences in catalyst performance between PtLa/mz-deGa and PtLa/mz 
are largely due to formation of the intermetallic alloy. Nevertheless, 
it is worth noting that the PtLa/mz-deGa catalyst contained a small 
amount of Ga (Si/GaÂ =Â 598) even after the degallation, and that this may

participate in the catalytic function17,18. The effect of the remaining Ga 
was examined from the differences in PDH performance of mz-deGa, 
La/mz-deGa and Pt/mz-deGa, as shown in Extended Data Fig.Â 7. A simple 
comparison of the catalytic result suggested that the Ga effect was not 
as dramatic as the alloying effect, but there are still possibilities of Ga 
acting somehow as a promotor to enhance the catalytic function and/
or the alloy formation in PtLa/mz-deGa. Moreover, in a similar manner 
to PtLa/mz-deGa, PtY/mz-deGa also exhibited high initial propane 
conversion and propylene selectivity, and slow catalyst deactivation. 
This appears to be attributable to the difference in atomic size and elec-
tron negativity. Because La has a larger atomic size and lower electron 
negativity than Y, the geometric and electronic properties of Pt were 
modified to a greater extent. As this result shows, zeolites can be an 
effective support for the development of PDH catalysts. In recent years, 
efficient conversion of propane to propylene was reported with PtZn 
and PtSn catalysts supported on zeolites19â€“21. For industrial application 
of the zeolite-supported catalysts, it would be important to establish 
an efficient regeneration method, such as the oxychlorination pro-
cess employed for PtSn/alumina. However, the regenerability of these 
 
catalysts has not yet been fully demonstrated.
The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/
mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests 
that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles. This 
approach can be extended to produce other metal alloys composed of 
Pt-group metals and REEs, as suggested in the case of the PtCe inter-
metallic alloy nanoparticle catalyst shown in Fig.Â 2 and Extended Data 
Fig.Â 8. The silanol nests in the mesoporous zeolite can effectively acti-
vate the hard-to-reduce REEs (that is, REEs with low reduction potential) 
to overcome the energy hurdle by putting them into single atomic 
species, which facilitates the formation of alloy nanoparticles. For the 
PtLa and PtY bimetallic catalysts, the reduction potential of the REEs is 
so low that the role of silanol nests is decisive for the formation of the 
metal alloys. In many other transition metal elements with higher reduc-
tion potential (for example, Co, Fe and Zn), alloy formation is known 
to occur spontaneously when the incorporated metal precursors are 
heated under H2. But even in this case, the atomistic diffusivity of the 
activated species via silanol nests is expected to facilitate access of the 
transition metal elements to nearby Pt nanoparticles, on which these 
species are reduced to the metallic state by reacting with chemisorbed 
hydrogen. This process can promote metal incorporation into the Pt 
nanoparticle. In fact, the promoting effect has been confirmed in the 
case of PtCo bimetallic alloy catalysts for the preferential CO oxidation 
(PROX) reaction. The PtCo catalysts were prepared on two zeolite sup-
ports, mz and mz-deGa, and on an alumina support. All the resultant 
catalyst samples showed PtCo nanoparticles with randomly distributed 
Pt and Co atoms, but the Co/Pt atomic ratio was considerably different, 
increasing in the order of aluminaÂ â‰ªÂ mzÂ <Â mz-deGa. The difference in 
the alloy composition resulted in a remarkable change in the catalytic 
performance for PROX in a H2-rich stream containing 1.4% CO (catalytic 
efficiency: PtCo/aluminaÂ â‰ªÂ PtCo/mzÂ <Â PtCo/mz-deGa; see Extended 
Data Fig.Â 9). On the basis of these results, we believe that the use of the 
present mesoporous zeolite as a support would allow the discovery of 
not only REE-based alloy catalysts, but also other transition metal-based 
alloy catalysts with various compositions and structures, opening up 
new opportunities for catalytic applications.

Preparation of zeolites
The mz-deGa zeolite was prepared by the post-synthetic degalla-
tion of mesoporous MFI gallosilicate zeolite, which was prepared 
using [C18H37â€“N+(Me)2â€“C6H12â€“N+(Me)2â€“C4H9]Brâˆ’
2 (denoted as â€˜C18-6-4â€™) 
as a micro-/mesoporous structure-directing agent. For the synthesis 
of mesoporous MFI gallosilicate, sodium silicate (29Â wt% SiO2, Si/
NaÂ =Â 1.75; Shinheung Silicate) and gallium nitrate were used as silica 
and gallium oxide sources, respectively. In the typical synthesis of 
mesoporous MFI gallosilicate, 20Â g of sodium silicate solution was 
diluted with 24Â g of distilled water. The diluted sodium silicate solu-
tion was mixed with a clear solution consisting of 36Â g of water and 
4.7Â g of C18-6-4. After ageing under magnetic stirring for 30Â min, the 
clear solution containing 0.52Â g of gallium nitrate and 15.4Â g of water 
was poured at once into the solution containing sodium silicate and 
C18-6-4. The resultant gel was aged at 60â€‰Â°C for 6Â h under magnetic 
stirring. After cooling to the ambient temperature, 18.7Â g of 0.86Â M 
H2SO4 was added dropwise with vigorous stirring to adjust the pH 
of the zeolite synthesis gel. Again, the resultant gel was aged under 
magnetic stirring at 60â€‰Â°C for 12Â h. The final molar gel composition was 
SiO2:Ga2O3:C18-6-4:Na2O:H2SO4:H2OÂ =Â 100:1:7.5:30: 16:6,000. The result-
ant gel was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave 
and then heated by tumbling at 150â€‰Â°C for 3Â d in a convection oven. 
The product was collected as a white powder by filtration, washing 
with distilled water and drying at 100â€‰Â°C. Finally, mesoporous MFI 
gallosilicate was obtained after the calcination at 580â€‰Â°C to remove 
the structure-directing agent.
The framework Ga species in the mesoporous MFI gallosilicate was 
removed by HNO3 treatments. In a typical Ga-removal procedure, 1Â g of 
mesoporous MFI gallosilicate was poured into 100Â ml of the 13Â M HNO3. 
The resultant mixture was heated at 100â€‰Â°C for 12Â h under magnetic 
stirring. After filtration, the resultant sample was thoroughly washed 
with distilled water until the pH of the filtrate water reached 7. The 
HNO3 treatment and H2O washing were repeated two more times, and 
then the mz-deGa was collected after drying at 100â€‰Â°C.
The mz zeolite was synthesized by a procedure similar to that 
described for the mesoporous MFI gallosilicate. In a typical synthesis 
of mz, 20Â g of sodium silicate (29Â wt% SiO2, Si/NaÂ =Â 1.75; Shinheung 
Silicate) was diluted with 24Â g of distilled water. To this silicate solution, 
a clear aqueous solution containing 4.7Â g of C18-6-4 and 67Â g of distilled 
water was poured at once and strongly shaken manually for 10Â min. The 
resultant gel was aged at 60â€‰Â°C for 6Â h under magnetic stirring. The final 
molar gel composition was SiO2:C18-6-4:Na2O:H2OÂ =Â 100:7.5:10:6,000. 
The final synthesis gel was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel 
autoclave and heated by tumbling at 150â€‰Â°C for 2.5Â d. Then, the same 
procedure was used as for the mesoporous MFI gallosilicate.
Preparation of supported metal catalysts
The Pt and REEs were supported on the mz and mz-deGa zeolites 
by the incipient wetness impregnation technique. Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2, 
La(NO3)3Â·6H2O, Y(NO3)3Â·6H2O and Ce(NO3)3Â·6H2O were purchased 
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received as metal precursors. Typi-
cally, Pt and REE precursors were dissolved in an appropriate volume 
of distilled water, and their amounts were determined so as to yield 
metal contents of 1Â wt% Pt and 1Â wt% REE in the final supported cata-
lyst. The Ptâ€“REE-impregnated zeolites were dried at 60â€‰Â°C overnight. 
The dried samples were treated under an O2 flow at 350â€‰Â°C for 2Â h 
(ramping rate,Â 0.8â€‰Â°CÂ minâˆ’1; flow rate,Â 500Â cm3Â minâˆ’1Â gcat
âˆ’1, where gcat 
denotes grams of catalyst). Subsequently, the resultant samples were 
treated under a H2 flow at 700â€‰Â°C for 2Â h, except for the case of PtCe/
mz-deGa, which was treated at 580â€‰Â°C (ramping rate,Â 0.3â€‰Â°CÂ minâˆ’1, 
H2 flow rate,Â 300Â cm3Â minâˆ’1Â gcat
âˆ’1). These zeolite-supported Ptâ€“REE 
samples were used as catalysts for the PDH reaction tests and for vari-
ous characterizations, except for the AR-HAADF-STEM investigation. 
For the AR-HAADF-STEM investigation, the Ptâ€“REE/zeolite samples 
were prepared following the aforementioned co-impregnation pro-
cedure, except that the Pt and REE loading amounts were changed 
to 4Â wt% and 4Â wt%, respectively, in order to increase the average 
size of supported nanoparticles to obtain clearer images. In addi-
tion, Pt/mz and PtSn/alumina were prepared as described in the 
legend of Extended Data Fig.Â 10 and tested as catalysts for the PDH 
reaction. The Ptâ€“Co catalysts were supported onto the mz-deGa, 
mz and alumina supports following a similar procedure to that 
for the supported Ptâ€“REE catalysts for the PROX tests. In a typi-
cal PtCo loading process, Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and Co(NO3)2 precursors 
were co-incorporated onto the supports via the incipient wetness 
impregnation technique, and the amounts of metal precursors were 
determined to yield 2Â wt% and 1Â wt% of Pt and Co, respectively, in the 
final supported PtCo samples. The metal precursor-incorporated 
samples were heated under an O2 flow at 350â€‰Â°C for 2Â h (ramping rate 
of 1.5â€‰Â°CÂ minâˆ’1) and subsequently treated under a H2 flow at 300â€‰Â°C 
for 2Â h (ramping rate of 1.3â€‰Â°CÂ minâˆ’1).
Characterizations
The HAADF-STEM images were taken with a Titan cubed G2, a Titan 
Themis Z and a Titan ETEM G2 instrument at 300Â kV acceleration 
voltage. EDS analysis was carried out with four integrated silicon-drift 
EDS detectors (Super-X) at a collection solid angle of 0.7Â srad. The 
FT-IR spectra were collected using a JASCO FT-IR 6100 spectrometer 
under vacuum at room temperature after self-supporting wafers 
of mesoporous zeolites were degassed at 400â€‰Â°C. The hydrogen 
chemisorption was measured using a laboratory-made volumet-
ric apparatus. Prior to the hydrogen chemisorption measurement, 
supported-metal samples were reduced under a H2 flow at the appro-
priate temperature for 2Â h. Subsequently, the H2-treated samples 
were heated at 400â€‰Â°C under vacuum for the desorption of hydro-
gen. After cooling to room temperature, the first hydrogen chem-
isorption measurement was performed with the degassed sample at 
room temperature. After degassing the sample again by evacuation 
at room temperature for 1Â h, the second hydrogen chemisorption 
measurement was carried out. The hydrogen per metal atom in the 
chemisorption measurement was calculated by extrapolation of 
the adsorption isotherm to zero pressure. The elemental contents 
were determined by inductively coupled plasmaâ€“atomic emission 
spectroscopy using an OPTIMA 4300 DV instrument (PerkinElmer). 
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were collected by a Rigaku 
Multiflex diffractometer using a nickel-filtered Cu KÎ± radiation beam 
(40Â kV, 30Â mA). Nitrogen adsorptionâ€“desorption isotherms were 
measured at liquid-nitrogen temperature with a Micromeritics 
Tristar instrument. The specific surface area was calculated using 
the Brunauerâ€“Emmettâ€“Teller (BET) equation with the adsorption 
isotherm data in the relative-pressure range P/P0Â =Â 0.05â€“0.2. The pore 
size distribution was determined using the Barretâ€“Joynerâ€“Halenda 
(BJH) method from the adsorption branch of the isotherm. The total 
pore volume was obtained at P/P0Â =Â 0.95 from the adsorption branch 
of the isotherm. The XANES spectra were measured at the Pt L3 edge 
and the Y K edge in transmission mode at Pohang Accelerator Labora-
tory (10C-Wide XAFS beamline). For the XANES measurement, each 
metal precursor-impregnated sample was treated by O2 at 350â€‰Â°C 
and then pressed into a round-shaped pellet (diameter,Â 10Â mm). The 
O2-treated pellet was loaded inside a laboratory-made Pyrex glass 
apparatus and heated under a H2 flow at the appropriate temperature. 
After the H2 treatment, the catalyst pellet was sealed under a H2 flow 
inside the Pyrex glass with polyimide windows by melting the glass 
with a propane torch. The XANES spectra were measured by passing 
the beam through the glass-sealed catalyst pellets. All the XANES 
spectra were calibrated using Pt and Y metal foil references, which 
were purchased from Alfa Aesar. All the analysis of XANES data was 
performed using ATHENA software22.

PDH reaction tests
PDH reaction tests were carried out using a fixed-bed reactor made 
of a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 8Â mm. Prior to the catalyst 
loading, the supported metal catalysts were shaped into particles 
with diameters of 150â€“350Â Î¼m by pressing the powder form of the 
catalysts and subsequently sieving with a mesh network. 50Â mg of the 
shaped catalyst was loaded in the quartz tube reactor, and the residual 
space in the reactor was also filled with quartz sand to minimize the 
contribution of the thermal reaction. After the loading, the catalysts 
were activated by inÂ situ reduction under a H2 flow at the appropriate 
temperatures for the metal elements (700â€‰Â°C for PtLa and PtY; 580â€‰Â°C 
for Pt and PtCe) for 2Â h at a ramping rate of 0.3â€‰Â°CÂ minâˆ’1 and a flow 
rate of 200Â cm3Â minâˆ’1Â gcat
âˆ’1. The reduced catalyst bed was then purged 
with a N2 gas flow (200Â cm3Â minâˆ’1Â gcat
âˆ’1) for 1Â h at 580â€‰Â°C to completely 
remove the chemisorbed hydrogens. After the N2 purging, the PDH 
reaction test was performed with the following reaction conditions: 
50Â mg catalyst, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV; based on the total 
weight of catalyst) ofÂ 11Â hâˆ’1 with pure propane gas flow and temperature 
ofÂ 580â€‰Â°C. The products were analysed by an on-line gas chromatogra-
phy instrument equipped with a flame-ionization detector (FID) and a 
GS-Gaspro column. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity 
were calculated on a carbon basis, which were determined by the FID 
peak areas of the outlet product streamâ€”that is, propane conversion 
(%)Â =Â 100Â Ã—Â (1Â âˆ’Â carbons of propane/total carbons); propylene selectivity 
(%)Â =Â 100Â Ã—Â carbons of propylene/(total carbonsÂ âˆ’Â carbons of propane). 
After the PDH test, the quartz sands and catalyst particles loaded in the 
reactor were collected and investigated by thermogravimetric analysis 
to determine the amount of coke deposit. The result indicated that the 
coke formation was negligible, and the product distribution could be 
entirely determined from the FID peaks.
PROX tests
The PROX tests were performed using a gas-flow fixed-bed reactor 
made of a quartz tube with 8Â mm inner diameter. Prior to the catalyst 
loading, the PtCo catalysts were shaped in the same manner as in the 
PDH reaction tests. The shaped catalyst (50Â mg) was loaded into the 
quartz reactor and reduced under a H2 flow (600Â cm3Â minâˆ’1Â gcat
âˆ’1) at 
300â€‰Â°C for 2Â h. After cooling the reactor to room temperature under an 
inert gas flow (600Â cm3Â minâˆ’1Â gcat
âˆ’1), the PROX test was performed with 
the following reaction conditions: 50Â mg catalyst; molar gas composi-
tion CO:O2:H2:He:N2Â =Â 1.4:1.4:56.8:39.0:1.4; GHSVÂ =Â 36,000Â cm3Â hâˆ’1; and 
reaction temperatureÂ =Â room temperatureâ€“225Â Â°C. The products were 
analysed with an on-line gas chromatography instrument equipped 
with an FID and a thermal conductivity detector using a Porapak Q 
column and a Molecular Sieve 5A column, respectively.

Extended Data Fig. 4 | Atomically dispersed La on mesoporous zeolite with 
silanol nests. a, FT-IR spectra of mz, mz-deGa and mz-Ga. The mz-Ga sample 
shows the FT-IR absorbance band corresponding to isolated Siâ€“OH (about 
3,750Â cmâˆ’1) and Gaâ€“OH (3,600Â cmâˆ’1). The mz-deGa sample displays increased 
broad FT-IR adsorption at around 3,500Â cmâˆ’1, which is assigned to the silanol 
nests. The mz sample shows one sharp FT-IR peak corresponding to the 
isolated silanols. b, HAADF-STEM image of LaOx-supported mz-deGa showing 
no noticeable white dots on the grey zeolite matrix, which can be regarded as 
LaOx nanoparticles. c, AR-HAADF-STEM image of LaOx/mz-deGa magnified

white dots. d, HAADF-STEM image of LaOx-supported mz, showing the

images and FT-IR spectra, La species can be single-atom-dispersed only if the 
mesoporous MFI zeolite has sufficient silanol nests. e, FT-IR spectra of 
La-supported mz-deGa samples with various La loadings. The samples were 
prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of La nitrate and subsequent heat 
treatment at 350â€‰Â°C under an O2 flow. The absorption band corresponding to 
the silanol nest (~3,500Â cmâˆ’1; marked with an arrow) was gradually weakened 
with increasing La loading, indicating that the incorporated La species resulted 
in the formation of bonds with the silanol nests present in the mz-deGa 
support.
Extended Data Fig. 5 | XANES analysis of PtY/mz-deGa. a, XANES spectra at 
the Pt L3 edge. The XANES spectrum of PtY/mz-deGa at the Pt L3 edge is 
compared with two reference samples of Pt metal foil and Pt/mz. PtY/mz-deGa 
showed a notable shift in edge energy and white-line region to higher energy 
compared to the monometallic Pt reference samples. This indicates that 
electron donation occurred from less electronegative adjacent Y metals to Pt 
metals in the bimetallic alloy nanoparticles of PtY/mz-deGa. b, XANES spectra 
at the Y K edge. The PtY/mz-deGa sample is compared with PtY/mz-deGa before 
H2 reduction and an Y foil as reference samples. The Y XANES spectrum of PtY/
mz-deGa exhibited a noticeable shift in edge energy to lower energy after the 
reduction. This indicates that a sizable portion of oxidic Y was reduced to 
metallic Y. câ€“j, Linear-fit analysis of the Y K-edge XANES spectra of PtY/mz-deGa

Extended Data Fig. 7 | Propane dehydrogenation performance of catalysts 
using mz-deGa support. a, Propane conversionÂ as a function of time on 
stream. b, Propylene selectivityÂ as a function of time on stream. The supported 
catalysts are composed of either 1Â wt% Pt or 1Â wt% La. The PDH reaction 
conditions were as follows: 50Â mg catalyst, WHSVÂ =Â 11 hâˆ’1 with pure propane gas 
flow, and temperatureÂ ofÂ 580â€‰Â°C. To determine the effect of remaining Ga 
species in mz-deGa on PDH performance, Pt/mz-deGa, La/mz-deGa and 
mz-deGa catalysts were tested. The mz-deGa catalyst showed negligible 
propane conversion, indicating that the remaining Ga species in the zeolite 
framework were not effective for PDH. Moreover, the La/mz-deGa sample 
showed negligible propane conversion, implying that the single atomic La 
species do not have PDH activity. Both mz-deGa and La/mz-deGa showed much 
poorer propylene selectivity compared to the Ptâ€“REE/mz-deGa samples in 
Fig.Â 2. In the case of the Pt/mz-deGa sample, the initial propane conversion is 
slightly higher than that of Pt/mz shown in Fig.Â 2. In addition, the Pt/mz-deGa 
gave a noticeably lower deactivation rate than the Pt/mz sample. However, the 
improvement of Pt/mz-deGa in catalytic lifetime was almost insignificant when 
compared to that of the Ptâ€“REE/mz-deGa catalysts. On the basis of these 
catalytic results, we can conclude that the remaining Ga species in mz-deGa 
could somehow promote the PDH performance of the supported Pt catalyst. 
However, this Ga contribution would be almost insignificant compared to that 
of Ptâ€“REE alloy formation in the case of the Ptâ€“REE/mz-deGa catalysts.

f, Amounts of Co species incorporated in Pt alloy nanoparticles supported on 
various supports measured with STEM-EDS. Depending on the support,  
there was a remarkable difference in the amounts of reduced Co species 
incorporated into the Pt alloy nanoparticles. As shown in f, the average  
Co/Pt molar ratio increased in the order PtCo/alumina (0.32)Â â‰ªÂ PtCo/mz 
(0.45)Â <Â PtCo/mz-deGa (0.50). The distinctively low Co/Pt of PtCo/alumina 
appears to be the result of the stronger interaction between the cationic Co 
species and the alumina support, which makes the reduction of Co more 
difficult than when using siliceous zeolite supports. Of the two siliceous 
zeolites, mz-deGa exhibited a larger degree of Co incorporation into the Pt 
nanoparticles. We believe that the silanol nests in mz-deGa could be beneficial 
to homogeneously distribute the Co species into atomic cations on the zeolite, 
thereby providing mobility to help atomistic diffusion. Such a benefit might 
enable better Co incorporation in the case of mz-deGa than in mz with no 
silanol nests. This difference in Co incorporation led to a variation in the 
catalytic performance for PROX in a H2-rich stream containing 1.4% CO. The 
PtCo/mz-deGa catalyst exhibited complete CO conversion over a wide range of 
operating temperatures (60â€“120Â Â°C). On the other hand, for the PtCo/mz 
catalyst complete CO conversion was achieved only above 90Â Â°C. In the case of 
the PtCo/alumina catalyst, complete CO removal was not achievable, even at 
high temperatures.

Extended Data Fig. 10 | HAADF-STEM images. a, Pt/mz. b, PtLa/mz. c, PtSn/
alumina. All three samples had uniformly dispersed Pt nanoparticles without 
any bulky sintered particles. These catalysts were tested for the PDH reaction, 
as shown in Fig.Â 2. For the preparation of Pt/mz, Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 was loaded to 
mz using the incipient wetness impregnation technique. The Pt 
precursor-loaded mz was heated under an O2 flow at 350â€‰Â°C for 2Â h (ramping 
rate,Â 0.8â€‰Â°CÂ minâˆ’1; flow rate,Â 500Â cm3Â minâˆ’1Â gcat
âˆ’1) and subsequently treated 
under a H2 flow at 580â€‰Â°C for 2Â h (ramping rate,Â 0.3â€‰Â°CÂ minâˆ’1; H2 flow 
rate,Â 300Â cm3Â minâˆ’1Â gcat
âˆ’1). The obtained Pt/mz contained 1Â wt% Pt. For the 
preparation of PtSn/alumina, the alumina support was purchased from Sasol 
(PURALOX Î³-Al2O3, 98%, BET surface area ofÂ 170Â m2Â gâˆ’1). The alumina was 
prepared by the same procedure as the Pt/mz except for the co-incorporation 
of H2PtCl6 and SnCl2Â·2H2O as metal precursors. The PtSn/alumina contained 
1Â wt% Pt and 1Â wt% Sn.
Extended Data Table 1 | Hydrogen chemisorption results on various supported metal catalysts
This table shows hydrogen sorption results obtained at room temperature for various Ptâ€“REE-supported zeolite and alumina samples. Except for PtLa/deGa and PtY/deGa, all the samples listed 
in the table showed that a substantial portion (60â€“70%) of initially adsorbed hydrogen was not desorbed upon evacuation for 1Â h at room temperature, thereby resulting in considerably lowered 
H/Pt2nd values compared to those of H/Ptini. The irreversible hydrogen sorption could be explained by the formation of a strong chemisorption bond of Ptâ€“H. By contrast, the PtLa/mz-deGa 
and PtY/mz-deGa samples showed totally reversible hydrogen chemisorption behaviour, where the initial hydrogen uptakes were identical to those of the second hydrogen uptakes, which 
were taken after evacuation of the initially hydrogen sorption-measured samples for 1Â h at room temperature. The completely reversible hydrogen sorption behaviours could indicate that the 
PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa samples contained all the Pt nanoparticles as intermetallic compounds of Pt3La and Pt3Y. Therefore, all of the Pt portions in PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa 
appeared to be alloyed with La or Y metal, forming Pt3La or Pt3Y intermetallic compounds. Considering this, ~70Â mol% of La and ~80Â mol% of Y would exist in PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa, 
respectively, as isolated from Pt. The remaining REEs appeared as single atomic species on the zeolite supports.
