1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature that directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, the literature does emphasize the importance of encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters within silicalite-1 zeolite for improved stability and catalytic efficiency in PDH reactions. The confinement of metal species within the zeolite channels is shown to significantly enhance the hydrogen generation rates from formic acid decomposition and improve the stability of the catalysts after calcination in various industrial oxidation-reduction conditions. The literature also highlights the role of Cs+ ions in improving the regeneration stability of the catalysts, with the catalytic activity remaining unchanged after four continuous cycles.

1.在文献中没有找到直接说明催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次排列，如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的相关引文。然而，文献确实强调了将亚纳米PtZn簇封装在硅酸锂-1沸石中对PDH反应的稳定性和催化效率的提高的重要性。将金属物种限制在沸石通道内被证明可以显著提高从甲酸分解中生成氢的速率，并在各种工业氧化还原条件下提高催化剂在煅烧后的稳定性。文献还强调了Cs+离子在提高催化剂再生稳定性方面的作用，催化剂的活性在连续四个周期后保持不变。
