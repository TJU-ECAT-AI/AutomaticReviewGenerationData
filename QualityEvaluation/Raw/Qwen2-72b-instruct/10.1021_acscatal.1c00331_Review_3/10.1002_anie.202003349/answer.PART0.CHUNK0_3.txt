1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature that directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, the literature does highlight the importance of encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters inside silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite for PDH reactions, which suggests that the pore structure of the zeolite plays a critical role in stabilizing the metal clusters and preventing their aggregation during the reaction. The literature also mentions that the introduction of Cs+ ions can improve the regeneration stability of the catalysts, which may be related to the pore structure's ability to accommodate and stabilize the metal clusters during regeneration cycles.

1.在文献中没有找到直接说明催化剂载体孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次排列，如何影响丙烷脱氢反应(PDH)中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的相关引用。然而，文献确实强调了将亚纳米PtZn簇封装在丝光沸石(S-1)中的PDH反应的重要性，这表明沸石的孔结构在稳定金属簇和防止反应过程中金属簇的聚集中起着关键作用。文献还提到，引入Cs+离子可以提高催化剂的再生稳定性，这可能与孔结构在再生循环中容纳和稳定金属簇的能力有关。
