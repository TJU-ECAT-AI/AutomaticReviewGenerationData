1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature that directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, the literature does emphasize the importance of encapsulating subnanometer bimetallic PtZn clusters inside silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite via a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method to improve the stability of the Pt clusters and achieve high propylene selectivity and specific activity of propylene formation in PDH reactions. The literature also highlights the role of zeolites with ordered microporous structures and outstanding thermal stability as ideal supports for anchoring small metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and preventing their sintering during PDH conversions at high temperatures. The introduction of Zn species into the catalysts is shown to significantly enhance the stability of the subnanometer Pt clusters and improve the catalytic performance and stability of the catalysts for PDH conversions. The literature also discusses the importance of controlling the size and distribution of metal species within the zeolite channels to prevent their aggregation and improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite is shown to improve the regeneration stability of the catalysts and maintain their catalytic activity after several regeneration cycles. These findings suggest that the design of optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions requires careful consideration of the pore structure of the catalyst support, the size and distribution of metal species within the support, and the introduction of additional elements to improve the stability and regeneration performance of the catalysts.

1.在文献中没有找到直接说明催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次排列，如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的相关引用。但是，文献强调了通过配体保护直接氢还原方法将亚纳米级双金属PtZn簇封装在S-1沸石中，以提高Pt簇的稳定性并实现高丙烯选择性和PDH反应中丙烯形成的特定活性的重要性。文献还强调了具有有序微孔结构和优异热稳定性的沸石作为锚定小金属纳米颗粒(MNPs)的理想支撑物的重要性，以及防止PDH转化在高温下MNPs的烧结。将Zn物种引入催化剂中被证明可以显著提高亚纳米级Pt簇的稳定性，并提高催化剂在PDH转化中的催化性能和稳定性。文献还讨论了控制金属物种在沸石通道中的大小和分布，以防止其聚集并提高催化剂的催化活性和稳定性的必要性。将Cs+离子引入沸石中被证明可以提高催化剂的再生稳定性，并在多次再生循环后保持其催化活性。这些发现表明，设计PDH反应的最优和有效催化剂需要仔细考虑催化剂支撑的孔结构、支撑物中金属物种的大小和分布，以及引入额外元素以提高催化剂的稳定性和再生性能。
