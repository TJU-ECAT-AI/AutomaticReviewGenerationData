1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature that directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, the literature does highlight the importance of encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters within silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite for improved stability and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions. The confinement of metal species within the zeolite channels is shown to significantly enhance the hydrogen generation rates from formic acid decomposition and improve the stability of the catalysts after calcination in various industrial oxidation-reduction conditions. The literature also mentions that the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability of the catalysts, and the catalytic activity remained unchanged after four continuous cycles. These findings suggest that the pore structure of the catalyst support plays a crucial role in the performance of the catalysts for PDH reactions.

1.在文献中没有找到直接说明催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性（如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次排列）如何影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的相关引用。然而，文献确实强调了将亚纳米PtZn簇封装在S-1沸石中的重要性，以提高PDH反应中的稳定性和丙烯选择性。将金属物种限制在沸石通道内被证明可以显著提高从甲酸分解中生成氢的速率，并在各种工业氧化还原条件下改善催化剂的稳定性。文献还提到，将Cs+离子引入沸石可以提高催化剂的再生稳定性，连续四次循环后催化活性保持不变。这些发现表明，催化剂支撑的孔结构在PDH反应中催化剂的性能中起着关键作用。
