[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor by analyzing reaction products and mass changes simultaneously."
[2] "The characterization results indicate that catalysts contain Pt within the pores and Pt nanoparticles of more or less similar sizes however stabilized on markedly different pore geometries (structure and size)."
[3] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."
[4] "TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed dur- ing DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."
[5] "Among Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15, the former shows better selec- tivity and stability than the latter despite higher coke content."
[6] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA- 15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."

1.The pore geometry of the catalyst supports, including pore size, connectivity, and uniformity, significantly influences the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene, and the degree of coke formation. The study evaluated micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor. The catalysts contain Pt within the pores and Pt nanoparticles of similar sizes, but stabilized on markedly different pore geometries. Pt-ZSM-5 exhibits the highest propane conversion, followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15, indicating that activity decreases with increasing pore size. The amount of coke formed during DHP is highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and lowest on Pt-Beta, demonstrating that Pt-Beta has better catalytic stability. Despite higher coke content, Pt-ZSM-5 shows better selectivity and stability than Pt-SBA-15. These observations suggest that three-dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than mesoporous SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites.

1.催化剂载体的孔结构特性，包括孔尺寸、连通性和均匀性，对丙烷脱氢（DHP）活性、丙烯选择性和焦炭形成程度有显著影响。研究使用锥形元件振荡微平衡（TEOM）反应器评估了微孔（Pt-ZSM-5和Pt-Beta）和介孔（Pt-SBA-15）材料。催化剂在孔内含有Pt，并且具有大小相似的Pt纳米颗粒，但它们稳定在明显不同的孔几何结构上。Pt-ZSM-5表现出最高的丙烷转化率，其次是Pt-Beta和Pt-SBA-15，表明活性随着孔尺寸的增加而降低。DHP期间形成的焦炭量在Pt-ZSM-5上最高，在Pt-Beta上最低，这表明Pt-Beta具有更好的催化稳定性。尽管焦炭含量较高，但Pt-ZSM-5的丙烯选择性和稳定性优于Pt-SBA-15。这些观察结果表明，三维微孔材料作为DHP的催化载体优于介孔SBA-15，因为它们的固有性质可能诱导Pt位点的最优催化性能。
