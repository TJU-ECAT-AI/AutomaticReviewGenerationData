          [1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor by analyzing reaction products and mass changes simultaneously."
          [2] "The characterization results indicate that catalysts contain Pt within the pores and Pt nanoparticles of more or less similar sizes however stabilized on markedly different pore geometries (structure and size)."
          [3] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."
          [4] "TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed dur- ing DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."
          [5] "Among Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15, the former shows better selec- tivity and stability than the latter despite higher coke content."
          [6] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA- 15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."
          [7] "The contradictory observations on DHP performance of different framework zeolites could be ascribed to different catalyst compo- sitions, Si/Al ratios, feed compositions, etc."
          [8] "However, re- cently we have demonstrated that the size of Pt particle is crucial in determining the DHP activity, selectivity, the degree of coke formation and thus the stability of the catalyst."
          [9] "Accordingly, the size of pores in the supports increases in the fol- lowing order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15."
          [10] "Therefore, ZSM-5, Beta and SBA-15 which provide distinct pore geometries were employed for this study."
          [11] "This allows us to principally and systematically assess the intrinsic influence of pore geometry of the support materials on DHP."
          [12] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites could originate from the active sites that are associated with cation ex- changesites and might be complemented by theirthree dimensional pore geometry."
          [13] "On the other hand, large cylindrical pores which may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites located within the pores (that means a low degree of propane adsorption), and a lack of cation exchange sites in Pt-SBA-15 may haveleadtoits lowercatalyticperformance."
          [14] "This suggests thatthepore geometry of the support materials plays an important role in deriving the optimum catalytic properties of a supported active metal."
          [15] "Accordingly, it appears that on support ZSM-5 and SBA-15 the undesired side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, etc.,which could produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydro- genation reaction."
          [16] "The above results evidence that despite identical Pt content and virtually the same particle size in the catalysts, Pt supported on the zeolites are more active, selective and stable than that on the meso- porous SBA-15."

          The pore geometry of the catalyst supports, including pore size, structure, and connectivity, has a significant impact on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene, and the degree of coke formation. The study evaluated this influence on micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor. The results showed that the activity decreases with increasing pore size, with Pt-ZSM-5 exhibiting the highest propane conversion, followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15. The amount of coke formed during DHP is highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and lowest on Pt-Beta, indicating that Pt-Beta has better catalytic stability. Despite higher coke content, Pt-ZSM-5 shows better selectivity and stability than Pt-SBA-15. These findings suggest that three-dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than mesoporous SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites. The contradictory observations on DHP performance of different framework zeolites can be attributed to various factors such as catalyst compositions, Si/Al ratios, and feed compositions. The size of Pt particles is crucial in determining DHP activity, selectivity, coke formation, and catalyst stability. The pore size in the supports increases in the order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15. The study employs ZSM-5, Beta, and SBA-15 with distinct pore geometries to systematically assess the intrinsic influence of pore geometry on DHP. The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites may originate from active sites associated with cation exchange sites and complemented by their three-dimensional pore geometry. In contrast, large cylindrical pores in Pt-SBA-15 may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites, leading to lower catalytic performance. This indicates that the pore geometry of the support materials plays a crucial role in deriving the optimum catalytic properties of a supported active metal. On supports ZSM-5 and SBA-15, undesired side reactions like cracking and oligomerization, which produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydrogenation reaction. Despite identical Pt content and similar particle size, Pt supported on zeolites exhibits superior catalytic performance compared to mesoporous SBA-15.

          催化剂载体的孔几何结构，包括孔尺寸、结构和连通性，对丙烷脱氢(DHP)活性、丙烯选择性和焦炭形成程度有显著影响。该研究使用锥形元件振荡微平衡(TEOM)反应器评估了这种影响在微孔(Pt-ZSM-5和Pt-Beta)和介孔(Pt-SBA-15)材料上的表现。结果表明，随着孔尺寸的增加，活性降低，Pt-ZSM-5的丙烷转化率最高，其次是Pt-Beta和Pt-SBA-15。DHP过程中形成的焦炭量在Pt-ZSM-5上最高，在Pt-Beta上最低，表明Pt-Beta具有更好的催化稳定性。尽管焦炭含量较高，但Pt-ZSM-5的丙烯选择性和稳定性优于Pt-SBA-15。这些发现表明，三维微孔材料是DHP更好的催化载体，优于介孔SBA-15，因为它们的固有性质可能诱导Pt位点的最优催化性能。不同框架沸石的DHP性能的矛盾观察结果可归因于催化剂组成、Si/Al比和进料组成等因素。Pt颗粒的尺寸对于确定DHP活性、选择性、焦炭形成程度和催化剂稳定性至关重要。载体中的孔尺寸按以下顺序增加：ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15。本研究采用ZSM-5、Beta和SBA-15，它们具有不同的孔几何特性，以系统地评估孔几何特性对DHP的内在影响。Pt支撑沸石的优异催化性能可能源于与阳离子交换位点相关的活性位点，并可能由其三维孔几何特性补充。相比之下，Pt-SBA-15中的大圆柱形孔可能无法在反应物和孔内活性位点之间提供所需的接触，导致催化性能较低。这表明载体材料的孔几何特性在衍生支撑活性金属的最优催化性能中起着关键作用。在ZSM-5和SBA-15载体上，如裂解和聚合作用等不希望的副反应，会产生焦炭前体，与脱氢反应竞争。尽管Pt含量相同，颗粒尺寸相似，但Pt在沸石上的支撑表现出比介孔SBA-15更优越的催化性能。
