[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor by analyzing reaction products and mass changes simultaneously."
[2] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."
[3] "TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed during DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."
[4] "Among Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15, the former shows better selectivity and stability than the latter despite higher coke content."
[5] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA- 15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."

1.The pore geometry of the catalyst supports has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene, and the degree of coke formation. The activity decreases with increasing pore size, as evidenced by the highest propane conversion on Pt-ZSM-5, followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15. The amount of coke formed during DHP is highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and lowest on Pt-Beta, indicating better catalytic stability of Pt-Beta compared to Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15. Despite higher coke content, Pt-ZSM-5 shows better selectivity and stability than Pt-SBA-15. These observations suggest that three-dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than mesoporous SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites.

1.催化剂载体的孔结构几何特性对丙烷脱氢(DHP)活性、丙烯选择性和焦炭形成程度有显著影响。随着孔径的增大，活性降低，这在Pt-ZSM-5、Pt-Beta和Pt-SBA-15上得到了体现，其中Pt-ZSM-5的丙烷转化率最高。DHP过程中形成的焦炭量在Pt-ZSM-5上最高，在Pt-Beta上最低，这表明Pt-Beta的催化稳定性优于Pt-ZSM-5和Pt-SBA-15。尽管焦炭含量较高，但Pt-ZSM-5的选择性和稳定性优于Pt-SBA-15。这些观察结果表明，三维微孔材料作为DHP的催化载体优于介孔SBA-15，因为它们的固有特性可能诱导Pt位点的最优催化性能。
