[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor by analyzing reaction products and mass changes simultaneously."
[2] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."
[3] "TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed dur- ing DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."
[4] "Among Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15, the former shows better selec- tivity and stability than the latter despite higher coke content."
[5] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA- 15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."
[6] "The contradictory observations on DHP performance of different framework zeolites could be ascribed to different catalyst compo- sitions, Si/Al ratios, feed compositions, etc."
[7] "However, re- cently we have demonstrated that the size of Pt particle is crucial in determining the DHP activity, selectivity, the degree of coke formation and thus the stability of the catalyst."
[8] "Accordingly, the size of pores in the supports increases in the fol- lowing order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15."
[9] "Therefore, ZSM-5, Beta and SBA-15 which provide distinct pore geometries were employed for this study."
[10] "This allows us to principally and systematically assess the intrinsic influence of pore geometry of the support materials on DHP."
[11] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites could originate from the active sites that are associated with cation ex- changesites and might be complemented by theirthree dimensional pore geometry."
[12] "On the other hand, large cylindrical pores which may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites located within the pores (that means a low degree of propane adsorption), and a lack of cation exchange sites in Pt-SBA-15 may haveleadtoits lowercatalyticperformance."
[13] "This suggests thatthepore geometry of the support materials plays an important role in deriving the optimum catalytic properties of a supported active metal."

1.The pore geometry of the catalyst supports, including pore size, connectivity, and uniformity, has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene, and the degree of coke formation. The activity decreases with increasing pore size, as evidenced by the highest propane conversion on Pt-ZSM-5, followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15. The amount of coke formed during DHP is highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and lowest on Pt-Beta, indicating better catalytic stability on Pt-Beta compared to Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15. Despite higher coke content, Pt-ZSM-5 shows better selectivity and stability than Pt-SBA-15. These observations suggest that three-dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than mesoporous SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature that induces optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites. The contradictory observations on DHP performance of different framework zeolites can be attributed to various factors such as catalyst compositions, Si/Al ratios, and feed compositions. The size of Pt particles is crucial in determining DHP activity, selectivity, coke formation, and catalyst stability. The pore size in the supports increases in the order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15. The study employs ZSM-5, Beta, and SBA-15 with distinct pore geometries to systematically assess the intrinsic influence of pore geometry on DHP. The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites may originate from active sites associated with cation exchange sites and complemented by their three-dimensional pore geometry. In contrast, large cylindrical pores in Pt-SBA-15 may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites, leading to lower catalytic performance. This indicates that the pore geometry of the support materials plays a crucial role in deriving the optimum catalytic properties of a supported active metal.

1.催化剂载体的孔几何特性，包括孔尺寸、连通性和均匀性，对丙烷脱氢(DHP)活性、丙烯选择性和焦炭形成程度有显著影响。随着孔尺寸的增加，活性降低，这在Pt-ZSM-5、Pt-Beta和Pt-SBA-15上的丙烷转化率最高，其次是Pt-Beta和Pt-SBA-15。DHP过程中形成的焦炭量在Pt-ZSM-5上最高，在Pt-Beta上最低，表明Pt-Beta的催化稳定性优于Pt-ZSM-5和Pt-SBA-15。尽管焦炭含量较高，但Pt-ZSM-5的选择性和稳定性优于Pt-SBA-15。这些观察结果表明，三维微孔材料是DHP更好的催化载体，比介孔SBA-15更优，因为它们的内在性质诱导了Pt位点的最优催化性能。不同框架沸石的DHP性能的矛盾观察结果可归因于催化剂组成、Si/Al比和进料组成等因素。Pt颗粒的尺寸对于确定DHP活性、选择性、焦炭形成程度和催化剂稳定性至关重要。载体中的孔尺寸按以下顺序增加：ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15。本研究采用ZSM-5、Beta和SBA-15，它们具有不同的孔几何特性，以系统地评估孔几何特性对DHP的内在影响。Pt支撑沸石的优异催化性能可能源于与阳离子交换位点相关的活性位点，并可能由其三维孔几何特性补充。相比之下，Pt-SBA-15中的大圆柱形孔可能无法在反应物和孔内活性位点之间提供所需的接触，导致催化性能较低。这表明载体材料的孔几何特性在衍生支撑活性金属的最优催化性能中起着关键作用。
