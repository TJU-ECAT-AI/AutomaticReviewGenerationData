[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor by analyzing reaction products and mass changes simultaneously."
[2] "The characterization results indicate that catalysts contain Pt within the pores and Pt nanoparticles of more or less similar sizes however stabilized on markedly different pore geometries (structure and size)."
[3] "This allowed to (i) largely marginalize the effect of the sizes of Pt parti- cles on DHP and (ii) evaluate exclusively the vital role of pore geometry of the supports, where a fraction of Pt is located within the pores, on the catalytic performance."
[4] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."
[5] "TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed dur- ing DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."
[6] "Among Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15, the former shows better selec- tivity and stability than the latter despite higher coke content."
[7] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA- 15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."

1.The pore geometry of the catalyst supports, including pore size, structure, and connectivity, has a significant impact on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene, and the degree of coke formation. The study evaluated this influence on micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor. The results showed that the activity decreases with increasing pore size, with Pt-ZSM-5 exhibiting the highest propane conversion, followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15. The amount of coke formed during DHP is highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and lowest on Pt-Beta, indicating that Pt-Beta has better catalytic stability. Despite higher coke content, Pt-ZSM-5 shows better selectivity and stability than Pt-SBA-15. These findings suggest that three-dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than mesoporous SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites.

1.催化剂载体的孔几何结构，包括孔尺寸、结构和连通性，对丙烷脱氢(DHP)活性、丙烯选择性和焦炭形成程度有显著影响。该研究使用锥形元件振荡微平衡(TEOM)反应器评估了这种影响在微孔(Pt-ZSM-5和Pt-Beta)和介孔(Pt-SBA-15)材料上的表现。结果表明，随着孔尺寸的增加，活性降低，Pt-ZSM-5的丙烷转化率最高，其次是Pt-Beta和Pt-SBA-15。DHP过程中形成的焦炭量在Pt-ZSM-5上最高，在Pt-Beta上最低，表明Pt-Beta具有更好的催化稳定性。尽管焦炭含量较高，但Pt-ZSM-5的丙烯选择性和稳定性优于Pt-SBA-15。这些发现表明，三维微孔材料是DHP更好的催化载体，优于介孔SBA-15，因为它们的固有性质可能诱导Pt位点的最优催化性能。
