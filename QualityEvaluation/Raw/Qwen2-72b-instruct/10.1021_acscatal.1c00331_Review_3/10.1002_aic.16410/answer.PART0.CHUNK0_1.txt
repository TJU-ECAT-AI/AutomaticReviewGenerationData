[1] "The pore network structure significantly affects the capacity to contain coke."

[2] "Coke can be nonuniformly distributed through the catalyst particle, and the distribution of coke is largely affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions."

[3] "Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."

[4] "In this case,macroscopic properties (e.g., effective diffusivity and the observed reaction rates) would experience a sudden change."

[5] "Finally,coke deactivates catalyst particles in several ways, not just by covering active sites; a significant loss in activity can also be caused by the increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores."

[6] "The pore network structure significantly affects the capacity to contain coke."

1.The pore network structure of the catalyst support significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The distribution of coke is affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions. Some large pores can become inaccessible to reactants when surrounded by plugged pores, adding to the complexity of the coking process. This can lead to a sudden change in macroscopic properties such as effective diffusivity and observed reaction rates. Coke deactivates catalyst particles in multiple ways, including by covering active sites, increasing diffusion resistance, and making active sites inaccessible when pores are narrowed or plugged. The pore network structure significantly affects the capacity of the catalyst particle to contain coke.

1.催化剂载体的孔网络结构对丙烷脱氢反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有重大影响。焦炭的分布受孔网络结构和反应条件的影响。当被堵塞的孔包围时，一些大孔可能变得对反应物不可访问，这增加了焦炭过程的复杂性。这可能导致宏观属性如有效扩散性和观察到的反应速率的突然变化。焦炭以多种方式使催化剂颗粒失活，包括覆盖活性位点，增加扩散阻力，以及当孔被缩小或堵塞时使活性位点变得不可访问。孔网络结构对催化剂颗粒容纳焦炭的能力有重大影响。
