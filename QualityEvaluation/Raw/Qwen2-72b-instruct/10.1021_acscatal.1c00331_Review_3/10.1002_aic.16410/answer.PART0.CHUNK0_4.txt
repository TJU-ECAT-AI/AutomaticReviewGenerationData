[1] "The pore network structure significantly affects the capacity to contain coke."

[2] "Coke narrows and eventually plugs pores during reaction, leading to significant changes in pore network structure."

[3] "Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."

[4] "A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected, particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes disconnected."

[5] "Coke deactivates catalyst particles in several ways, not just by covering active sites; a significant loss in activity can also be caused by the increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores."

1.The pore network structure significantly influences the capacity of the catalyst to accommodate coke. As coke forms, it narrows and eventually blocks pores, leading to changes in the pore network structure. This can result in some large pores becoming inaccessible to reactants, adding complexity to the coking process. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, causing a significant loss in activity due to increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores.

1.催化剂支持的孔结构，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和分级排列，对焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能在丙烷脱氢反应中的影响显著。焦炭形成时，会逐渐缩小并最终堵塞孔隙，导致孔网络结构发生变化。这可能导致一些大孔对反应物变得不可接近，增加了焦炭形成过程的复杂性。当开放孔隙的分数降至临界阈值以下时，会发生渗流现象，导致活性显著降低，因为焦炭缩小和堵塞孔隙时，扩散阻力增加，活性位点变得不可接近。
