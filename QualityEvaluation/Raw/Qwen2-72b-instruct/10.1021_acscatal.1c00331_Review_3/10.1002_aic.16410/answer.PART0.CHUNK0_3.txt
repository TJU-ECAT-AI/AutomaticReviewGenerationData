[1] "The pore network structure significantly affects the capacity to contain coke."

[2] "Coke narrows and eventually plugs pores during reaction, leading to significant changes in pore network structure."

[3] "Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."

[4] "In this case,macroscopic properties (e.g., effective diffusivity and the observed reaction rates) would experience a sudden change."

[5] "Finally,coke deactivates catalyst particles in several ways, not just by covering active sites; a significant loss in activity can also be caused by the increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores."

1.The pore network structure of the catalyst support significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The structure affects the capacity of the catalyst to contain coke, with coke formation leading to changes in the pore network structure as it narrows and eventually plugs pores. This process can render some large pores inaccessible to reactants, increasing the complexity of coking. The macroscopic properties, such as effective diffusivity and reaction rates, can experience sudden changes due to pore blockage. Coke deactivates catalyst particles not only by covering active sites but also by increasing diffusion resistance and making active sites inaccessible when pores are narrowed or plugged.

1.催化剂载体的孔网络结构对丙烷脱氢反应中的焦炭形成、容纳以及整体催化剂性能有重大影响。结构影响催化剂容纳焦炭的能力，焦炭形成导致孔网络结构变化，因为焦炭会逐渐缩小孔径并最终堵塞孔隙。这一过程可能使一些大孔对反应物变得不可接近，增加了焦炭形成的复杂性。由于孔隙堵塞，宏观性质如有效扩散率和反应速率可能会突然变化。焦炭不仅通过覆盖活性位点使催化剂颗粒失活，而且通过增加扩散阻力和在孔隙变窄或堵塞时使活性位点变得不可接近，也会导致活性显著降低。
