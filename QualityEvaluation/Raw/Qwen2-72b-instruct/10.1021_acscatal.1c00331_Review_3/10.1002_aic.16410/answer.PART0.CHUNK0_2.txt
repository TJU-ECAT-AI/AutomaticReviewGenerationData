1.The pore network structure of the catalyst support significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Coke narrows and eventually plugs pores during the reaction, leading to significant changes in the pore network structure. This can make some large pores inaccessible to reactants, adding to the complexity of the coking process. When the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops below a critical threshold, macroscopic properties such as effective diffusivity and observed reaction rates experience a sudden change. Coke deactivates catalyst particles in multiple ways, not just by covering active sites, but also by increasing diffusion resistance and making active sites inaccessible when coke narrows and plugs pores. The pore network structure significantly affects the capacity of the catalyst particle to contain coke.

1.催化剂载体的孔网络结构对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有重大影响。在反应过程中，焦炭会逐渐缩小并最终堵塞孔隙，导致孔网络结构发生显著变化。这会使一些大孔被堵塞的孔包围，从而无法接触反应物，增加了焦炭过程的复杂性。当未堵塞或开放孔的分数降至临界阈值以下时，宏观属性，如有效扩散率和观察到的反应速率，会经历突然的变化。焦炭以多种方式使催化剂颗粒失活，不仅通过覆盖活性位点，还通过增加扩散阻力和在焦炭缩小和堵塞孔隙时使活性位点无法接触。孔网络结构对催化剂颗粒容纳焦炭的能力有重大影响。
