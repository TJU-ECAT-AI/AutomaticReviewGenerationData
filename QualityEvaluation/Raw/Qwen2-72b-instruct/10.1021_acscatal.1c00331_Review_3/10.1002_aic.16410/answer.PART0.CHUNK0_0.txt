1.The pore network structure of the catalyst support significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The distribution of coke is affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions, leading to non-uniform distribution of coke through the catalyst particle. Some large pores can become inaccessible to reactants when surrounded by plugged pores, adding to the complexity of the coking process. This can cause a sudden change in macroscopic properties such as effective diffusivity and observed reaction rates. Coke deactivates catalyst particles in multiple ways, including covering active sites, increasing diffusion resistance, and making active sites inaccessible when pores are narrowed and plugged. The pore network structure significantly affects the capacity of the catalyst particle to contain coke.

1.催化剂载体的孔网络结构对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有重大影响。焦炭的分布受孔网络结构和反应条件的影响，导致催化剂颗粒中焦炭分布不均匀。当被堵塞的孔包围时，一些大孔可能变得无法接触反应物，增加了焦炭形成过程的复杂性。这可能导致宏观属性如有效扩散率和观察到的反应速率的突然变化。焦炭以多种方式使催化剂颗粒失活，包括覆盖活性位点，增加扩散阻力，以及当孔被缩小和堵塞时使活性位点无法接触。孔网络结构对催化剂颗粒容纳焦炭的能力有重大影响。
