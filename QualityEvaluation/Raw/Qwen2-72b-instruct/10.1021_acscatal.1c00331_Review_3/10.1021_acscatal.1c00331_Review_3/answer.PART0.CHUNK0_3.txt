[1] "The pore structure of the support is another factor which has a significant role in coke formation."
[2] "The acidity of the support was decreased after the modification of the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical-pores, (96) which inhibits the formation of coke on the metal and improves the capacity of the support for coke."
[3] "Moreover, the pore size has a direct effect on performance of PDH. The Pt catalysts on the microporous support show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amount than the counterpart on the mesoporous support."
[4] "A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores could accommodate more cokes."
[5] "The transfer of coke from metal to support is accountable for the unexpected good performance when the total cokes are increased."

1.The pore structure of the support plays a significant role in coke formation. Modifying the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical pores decreases the acidity of the support, which inhibits coke formation on the metal and improves the support's capacity for coke. The pore size has a direct effect on the performance of PDH, with Pt catalysts on microporous supports showing better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amounts compared to those on mesoporous supports. A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more cokes. The transfer of coke from metal to support contributes to the unexpectedly good performance when the total amount of cokes increases.

1.催化剂载体的孔结构在焦炭形成中起着重要作用。通过引入分级孔来修改ZSM-5的孔结构，可以降低载体的酸性，从而抑制金属上的焦炭形成，并提高载体的焦炭容量。孔径大小直接影响PDH的性能，与介孔载体上的Pt催化剂相比，微孔载体上的Pt催化剂显示出更好的选择性、稳定性和更低的焦炭量。具有更均匀、连接性更高和孔径更大的载体可以容纳更多的焦炭。金属向载体转移焦炭是当总焦炭量增加时，意外良好性能的原因。
