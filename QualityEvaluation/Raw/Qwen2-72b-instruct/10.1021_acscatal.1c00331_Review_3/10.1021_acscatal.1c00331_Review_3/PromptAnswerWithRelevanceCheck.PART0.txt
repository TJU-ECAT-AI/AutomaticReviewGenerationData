Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<quotes>

[1] "The pore structure of the support is another factor which has a significant role in coke formation."
[2] "The acidity of the support was decreased after the modification of the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical-pores, (96) which inhibits the formation of coke on the metal and improves the capacity of the support for coke."
[3] "Moreover, the pore size has a direct effect on performance of PDH. The Pt catalysts on the microporous support show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amount than the counterpart on the mesoporous support."
[4] "A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores could accommodate more cokes."
[5] "The transfer of coke from metal to support is accountable for the unexpected good performance when the total cokes are increased."

1.The pore structure of the support plays a significant role in coke formation. Modifying the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical pores decreases the acidity of the support, which inhibits coke formation on the metal and improves the support's capacity for coke. The pore size has a direct effect on the performance of PDH, with Pt catalysts on microporous supports showing better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amounts compared to those on mesoporous supports. A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more cokes. The transfer of coke from metal to support contributes to the unexpectedly good performance when the total cokes are increased.

1.载体的孔结构在焦炭形成中起着重要作用。通过引入分级孔修改ZSM-5的孔结构，降低了载体的酸性，这抑制了金属上的焦炭形成，并提高了载体的焦炭容量。孔径大小直接影响PDH的性能，与介孔载体上的Pt催化剂相比，微孔载体上的Pt催化剂显示出更好的选择性、稳定性和更低的焦炭量。具有更均匀、连接性更高和孔径更大的载体可以容纳更多的焦炭。金属向载体转移焦炭在总焦炭增加时，对意外的良好性能负有责任。
