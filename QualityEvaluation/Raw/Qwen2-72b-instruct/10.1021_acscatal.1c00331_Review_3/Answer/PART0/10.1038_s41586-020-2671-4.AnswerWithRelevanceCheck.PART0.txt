          [1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
          [2] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7. The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
          [3] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
          [4] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles14,15."
          [5] "Whereas we expected that addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst owing to the strong metalsupport interaction effect, to our surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y."
          [6] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH cata- lytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig.2."
          [7] "The Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane con- version of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [8] "In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane con- version of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [9] "The PtLa/mz-deGa catalyst contained a small amount of Ga (Si/Ga=598) even after the degallation, and that this may participate in the catalytic function17,18."
          [10] "The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/ mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles."

          The pore structure of the catalyst support, particularly the hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of the siliceous MFI zeolite, plays a critical role in enhancing the catalytic performance of supported metals by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion. The ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores boost the catalytic performance. The use of this zeolite as a replacement for alumina support in the PDH process has led to a significant improvement in the durability and selectivity of the catalyst, as evidenced by the formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles throughout the zeolite support, which exhibit distinctive H2 sorption behavior and a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. The industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has traditionally used PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina. While Pt alone shows high initial catalytic activity, it rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, leading to a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. The use of a mesoporous zeolite as a catalyst support, with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores, can enhance the catalytic performance of supported metals by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite significantly improves PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability.

          催化剂载体的孔结构，特别是硅酸盐MFI沸石的分级微/介孔结构，在增强支撑金属的催化性能方面起着关键作用，通过促进反应物和产物的扩散以及提供高金属纳米粒子分散度来实现。超薄沸石框架和三维互连介孔提高了催化性能。使用这种沸石代替PDH过程中的氧化铝载体，显著提高了催化剂的耐久性和选择性，这从整个沸石支撑上形成的Pt3La和Pt3Y纳米粒子，以及它们表现出的独特的H2吸附行为和PDH催化性能所有方面的显著增强，包括活性、选择性和耐久性，可以看出。工业丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程传统上使用负载在多孔氧化铝上的PtSn双金属催化剂。虽然Pt单独表现出高初始催化活性，但由于Pt表面的焦炭沉积，它会迅速失活，导致对丙烯的催化选择性损失。使用具有超薄沸石框架和三维互连介孔的介孔沸石作为催化剂载体，可以增强负载金属的催化性能，通过促进反应物和产物的扩散以及提供高金属纳米粒子分散度来实现。在脱镓沸石上形成Pt3La和Pt3Y纳米粒子显著提高了PDH催化性能，包括活性、选择性和耐久性。
