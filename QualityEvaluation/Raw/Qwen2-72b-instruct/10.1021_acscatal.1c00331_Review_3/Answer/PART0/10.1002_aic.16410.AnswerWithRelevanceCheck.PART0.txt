          [1] "The pore network structure significantly affects the capacity to contain coke."
          [2] "Coke can be nonuniformly distributed through the catalyst particle, and the distribution of coke is largely affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions."
          [3] "Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."
          [4] "In this case,macroscopic properties (e.g., effective diffusivity and the observed reaction rates) would experience a sudden change."
          [5] "Finally,coke deactivates catalyst particles in several ways, not just by covering active sites; a significant loss in activity can also be caused by the increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores."

          The pore network structure of the catalyst support significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The distribution of coke is affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions, leading to non-uniform distribution of coke through the catalyst particle. Some large pores can become inaccessible to reactants when surrounded by plugged pores, adding to the complexity of the coking process. This can cause a sudden change in macroscopic properties such as effective diffusivity and observed reaction rates. Coke deactivates catalyst particles in multiple ways, including covering active sites, increasing diffusion resistance, and making active sites inaccessible when pores are narrowed and plugged. The pore network structure significantly affects the capacity of the catalyst particle to contain coke. Coke narrows and eventually plugs pores during the reaction, leading to significant changes in the pore network structure. This process can render some large pores inaccessible to reactants, increasing the complexity of coking. The macroscopic properties, such as effective diffusivity and reaction rates, can experience sudden changes due to pore blockage. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, causing a significant loss in activity due to increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores.

          催化剂载体的孔网络结构对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有重大影响。焦炭的分布受孔网络结构和反应条件的影响，导致催化剂颗粒中焦炭分布不均匀。当被堵塞的孔包围时，一些大孔可能变得无法接触反应物，增加了焦炭形成过程的复杂性。这可能导致宏观属性如有效扩散率和观察到的反应速率的突然变化。焦炭以多种方式使催化剂颗粒失活，包括覆盖活性位点，增加扩散阻力，以及当孔被缩小和堵塞时使活性位点无法接触。孔网络结构对催化剂颗粒容纳焦炭的能力有重大影响。在反应过程中，焦炭会逐渐缩小并最终堵塞孔隙，导致孔网络结构发生显著变化。这会使一些大孔被堵塞的孔包围，从而无法接触反应物，增加了焦炭过程的复杂性。由于孔隙堵塞，宏观性质如有效扩散率和反应速率可能会突然变化。当开放孔隙的分数降至临界阈值以下时，会发生渗流现象，导致活性显著降低，因为焦炭缩小和堵塞孔隙时，扩散阻力增加，活性位点变得不可接近。
