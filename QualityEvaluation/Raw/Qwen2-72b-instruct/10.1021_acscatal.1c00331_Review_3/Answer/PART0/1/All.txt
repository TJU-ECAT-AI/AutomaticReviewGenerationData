Additionally, the subnanometric PtSn clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period of time (>6h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to the platinum clusters. The structural features of platinumtin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magnitude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity.", "Chinese": "文献没有提供具体信息，说明催化剂支撑孔结构的孔径、连通性、均匀性和分层排列如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。然而，它确实提到，限制在纯硅MFI沸石的10R螺旋通道中的亚纳米PtSn簇表现出高稳定性和坚固性，即使在高温和长时间内也是如此。这表明MFI沸石的独特孔结构可能在适应PDH反应过程中PtSn簇的结构变化中发挥作用，这可能会影响焦炭形成和催化剂性能。文献还表明，PtSn簇的稳定性和选择性对于抑制PDH反应中的催化剂失活和焦炭形成至关重要。因此，设计PDH反应的最优和有效催化剂可能涉及精心选择和工程催化剂支撑孔结构，这些结构可以容纳活性物种的结构变化，同时最小化焦炭形成，最大化选择性和稳定性。此外，亚纳米PtSn簇在H2中能稳定超过6小时，即使在高温（例如600C）下，这仅需在铂簇中添加少量锡原子。铂锡簇的结构特征虽然不能立即通过常规表征技术看到，但可以通过原位扩展X射线吸收精细结构、高角环形暗场扫描透射电子显微镜和CO红外数据的组合来确定，这些特征对于在保持高初始催化活性的同时，使丙烷脱氢反应的失活率降低一个数量级至关重要。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7"},

The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ zeolite changes the pore structure, decreases the acid content, and promotes surface properties, greatly improving the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke.

The high acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite, a common support for PtSn-based catalysts in PDH reactions, leads to unsatisfactory coke accommodation and catalyst stability. The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ zeolite changes the pore structure, decreases the acid content, and promotes surface properties, greatly improving the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke. The coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrates from active metal to the support, and the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst are significantly promoted. The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enables better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. The spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and stabilize the active sites of the catalyst in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction. The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, and the deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke. The presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal, promoting the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support. The coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites. The large pores on the surface of the catalyst are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside, while the particles of platinum could be located in the hierarchical-pores of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. More Sn species existed in oxide states, which facilitate the anchoring of Pt particles on the catalysts, inhibiting further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process and leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. By the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly, making the hydrocarbon unable to readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, and the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support.

Coke narrows and eventually plugs pores during the reaction, leading to significant changes in the pore network structure. This process can render some large pores inaccessible to reactants, increasing the complexity of coking. The macroscopic properties, such as effective diffusivity and reaction rates, can experience sudden changes due to pore blockage. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, causing a significant loss in activity due to increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores.", "Chinese": "催化剂载体的孔网络结构对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有重大影响。焦炭的分布受孔网络结构和反应条件的影响，导致催化剂颗粒中焦炭分布不均匀。当被堵塞的孔包围时，一些大孔可能变得无法接触反应物，增加了焦炭形成过程的复杂性。这可能导致宏观属性如有效扩散率和观察到的反应速率的突然变化。焦炭以多种方式使催化剂颗粒失活，包括覆盖活性位点，增加扩散阻力，以及当孔被缩小和堵塞时使活性位点无法接触。孔网络结构对催化剂颗粒容纳焦炭的能力有重大影响。在反应过程中，焦炭会逐渐缩小并最终堵塞孔隙，导致孔网络结构发生显著变化。这会使一些大孔被堵塞的孔包围，从而无法接触反应物，增加了焦炭过程的复杂性。由于孔隙堵塞，宏观性质如有效扩散率和反应速率可能会突然变化。当开放孔隙的分数降至临界阈值以下时，会发生渗流现象，导致活性显著降低，因为焦炭缩小和堵塞孔隙时，扩散阻力增加，活性位点变得不可接近。", "Doi": "10.1002/aic.16410"},

The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ zeolite changes the pore structure, decreases the acid content, and promotes surface properties, greatly improving the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke.

The large pores on the surface of the catalyst are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside, while the particles of platinum could be located in the hierarchical-pores of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst.

The high acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite, a common support for PtSn-based catalysts in PDH reactions, leads to unsatisfactory coke accommodation and catalyst stability. The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ zeolite changes the pore structure, decreases the acid content, and promotes surface properties, greatly improving the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke. The coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrates from active metal to the support, and the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst are significantly promoted. The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enables better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. The spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and stabilize the active sites of the catalyst in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction. The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, and the deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke. The presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal, promoting the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support. The coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites. The large pores on the surface of the catalyst are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside, while the particles of platinum could be located in the hierarchical-pores of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. More Sn species existed in oxide states, which facilitate the anchoring of Pt particles on the catalysts, inhibiting further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process and leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. By the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly, making the hydrocarbon unable to readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, and the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support.

The high acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite, a common support for PtSn-based catalysts in PDH reactions, leads to unsatisfactory coke accommodation and catalyst stability. The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ zeolite changes the pore structure, decreases the acid content, and promotes surface properties, greatly improving the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke. The coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrates from active metal to the support, and the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst are significantly promoted. The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enables better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. The spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and stabilize the active sites of the catalyst in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction. The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, and the deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke. The presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal, promoting the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support. The coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites. The large pores on the surface of the catalyst are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside, while the particles of platinum could be located in the hierarchical-pores of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. More Sn species existed in oxide states, which facilitate the anchoring of Pt particles on the catalysts, inhibiting further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process and leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. By the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly, making the hydrocarbon unable to readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, and the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support. Consequently, PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke.", "Chinese": "催化剂载体孔结构的特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次排列，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。ZSM-5沸石，作为PDH反应中PtSn基催化剂的常用载体，由于其高酸性，导致焦炭容纳和催化剂稳定性不佳。在ZQ沸石中引入层次孔改变了孔结构，降低了酸含量，促进了表面性质，极大地提高了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力。PtSnNa/ZQ上的焦炭沉积从活性金属迁移到支撑物上，丙烷脱氢到丙烯的催化性能和催化剂的稳定性得到显著提高。新的层次多孔ZSM-5载体（ZQ）具有增强的焦炭容纳能力，而PtSnNa/ZQ使丙烷转化率提高，催化剂稳定性改善。溢流氢可以促进Pt氧化物的还原，并在PtSnNa/ZQ中稳定催化剂的活性位点，这对丙烷脱氢反应过程有利。PtSnNa/ZQ的转化率和选择性都比PtSnNa/ZSM-5高，PtSnNa/ZQ的失活参数远低于PtSnNa/ZSM-5。ZQ的分级孔隙负责增强ZQ容纳焦炭的能力。Pt催化剂中Sn氧化物的存在削弱了烃类与金属之间的结合能，促进了焦炭前体从金属表面向支撑物外表面的迁移。在金属上形成的焦炭前体可能会迁移到支撑物和酸位点上。另一方面，对于催化剂表面的大孔，这些孔足够大，可以锚定铂粒子。因此，在PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂上，所有的金属粒子都分散在支撑物的外表面，而铂粒子可以位于PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂的分级孔隙中。此外，在这种情况下，更多的Sn物种以氧化态存在，这有利于铂粒子在催化剂上的锚定。根据这些影响，在反应过程中进一步聚结的Pt粒子被抑制，导致催化剂稳定性的提高。此外，通过引入这些分级孔隙，ZQ材料的酸性被显著改变。因此，在反应过程中，烃类不能轻易形成多个碳-金属键，吸附的物种更易移动，更容易迁移到支撑物上。因此，这表明PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂具有更好的容纳焦炭的能力和更好的抵抗焦炭形成的能力。", "Doi": "10.1002/jctb.4686"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The literature does not provide specific information on how pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the subnanometric PtSn clusters confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite exhibit high stability and robustness, even at high temperatures and over extended periods of time. This suggests that the unique pore structure of the MFI zeolite may play a role in accommodating the structural changes of the PtSn clusters during the reaction, which could potentially influence coke formation and catalyst performance. The literature also indicates that the stability and selectivity of the PtSn clusters are crucial for suppressing catalyst deactivation and coke formation in PDH reactions. Therefore, the design of optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions may involve the careful selection and engineering of catalyst support pore structures that can accommodate the structural changes of the active species while minimizing coke formation and maximizing selectivity and stability. Additionally, the subnanometric PtSn clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period of time (>6h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to the platinum clusters. The structural features of platinumtin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magnitude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity.", "Chinese": "文献没有提供具体信息，说明催化剂支撑孔结构的孔径、连通性、均匀性和分层排列如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。然而，它确实提到，限制在纯硅MFI沸石的10R螺旋通道中的亚纳米PtSn簇表现出高稳定性和坚固性，即使在高温和长时间内也是如此。这表明MFI沸石的独特孔结构可能在适应PDH反应过程中PtSn簇的结构变化中发挥作用，这可能会影响焦炭形成和催化剂性能。文献还表明，PtSn簇的稳定性和选择性对于抑制PDH反应中的催化剂失活和焦炭形成至关重要。因此，设计PDH反应的最优和有效催化剂可能涉及精心选择和工程催化剂支撑孔结构，这些结构可以容纳活性物种的结构变化，同时最小化焦炭形成，最大化选择性和稳定性。此外，亚纳米PtSn簇在H2中能稳定超过6小时，即使在高温（例如600C）下，这仅需在铂簇中添加少量锡原子。铂锡簇的结构特征虽然不能立即通过常规表征技术看到，但可以通过原位扩展X射线吸收精细结构、高角环形暗场扫描透射电子显微镜和CO红外数据的组合来确定，这些特征对于在保持高初始催化活性的同时，使丙烷脱氢反应的失活率降低一个数量级至关重要。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7"},
