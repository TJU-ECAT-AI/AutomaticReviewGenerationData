The pore structure of the catalyst support, particularly the hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of the siliceous MFI zeolite, plays a critical role in enhancing the catalytic performance of supported metals by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion. The ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores boost the catalytic performance. The use of this zeolite as a replacement for alumina support in the PDH process has led to a significant improvement in the durability and selectivity of the catalyst, as evidenced by the formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles throughout the zeolite support, which exhibit distinctive H2 sorption behavior and a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. The industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has traditionally used PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina. While Pt alone shows high initial catalytic activity, it rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, leading to a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. The use of a mesoporous zeolite as a catalyst support, with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores, can enhance the catalytic performance of supported metals by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite significantly improves PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability.

The pore network structure of the catalyst support significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The distribution of coke is affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions, leading to non-uniform distribution of coke through the catalyst particle. Some large pores can become inaccessible to reactants when surrounded by plugged pores, adding to the complexity of the coking process. This can cause a sudden change in macroscopic properties such as effective diffusivity and observed reaction rates. Coke deactivates catalyst particles in multiple ways, including covering active sites, increasing diffusion resistance, and making active sites inaccessible when pores are narrowed and plugged. The pore network structure significantly affects the capacity of the catalyst particle to contain coke. Coke narrows and eventually plugs pores during the reaction, leading to significant changes in the pore network structure. This process can render some large pores inaccessible to reactants, increasing the complexity of coking. The macroscopic properties, such as effective diffusivity and reaction rates, can experience sudden changes due to pore blockage. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, causing a significant loss in activity due to increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores.

Although no direct quotes were found addressing the specific influence of catalyst support pore structures on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature emphasizes the importance of encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters within silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite for improved stability and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions. The confinement of metal species within the zeolite channels significantly enhances hydrogen generation rates from formic acid decomposition and improves catalyst stability after calcination in various industrial oxidation-reduction conditions. The introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite improves regeneration stability, with catalytic activity remaining unchanged after four continuous cycles. These findings suggest that the pore structure of the catalyst support plays a critical role in the performance of PDH catalysts, and the design of optimal and effective catalysts should consider the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the support.

The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the use of non-acidic supports leads to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports, which can help in reducing coke formation. The study also found that the addition of tin to the platinum catalyst leads to a transfer of coke from the metal to the support, which can improve the catalyst's tolerance to coke and enhance its performance. The text also discusses the role of tin in modifying the electronic properties of platinum, which allows for better coke tolerance and catalytic performance. The literature does not delve into the implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts in detail.

The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the pore size affected mainly on coke yield when the coke amount (%wt/wt at TOS = 160 min) decreases in the following orders: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5). The influence of acidity is not easy to verify because the coke amount is limited by pore size.

The pore geometry of the catalyst supports, including pore size, structure, and connectivity, has a significant impact on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene, and the degree of coke formation. The study evaluated this influence on micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor. The results showed that the activity decreases with increasing pore size, with Pt-ZSM-5 exhibiting the highest propane conversion, followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15. The amount of coke formed during DHP is highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and lowest on Pt-Beta, indicating that Pt-Beta has better catalytic stability. Despite higher coke content, Pt-ZSM-5 shows better selectivity and stability than Pt-SBA-15. These findings suggest that three-dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than mesoporous SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites. The contradictory observations on DHP performance of different framework zeolites can be attributed to various factors such as catalyst compositions, Si/Al ratios, and feed compositions. The size of Pt particles is crucial in determining DHP activity, selectivity, coke formation, and catalyst stability. The pore size in the supports increases in the order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15. The study employs ZSM-5, Beta, and SBA-15 with distinct pore geometries to systematically assess the intrinsic influence of pore geometry on DHP. The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites may originate from active sites associated with cation exchange sites and complemented by their three-dimensional pore geometry. In contrast, large cylindrical pores in Pt-SBA-15 may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites, leading to lower catalytic performance. This indicates that the pore geometry of the support materials plays a crucial role in deriving the optimum catalytic properties of a supported active metal. On supports ZSM-5 and SBA-15, undesired side reactions like cracking and oligomerization, which produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydrogenation reaction. Despite identical Pt content and similar particle size, Pt supported on zeolites exhibits superior catalytic performance compared to mesoporous SBA-15.

The pore structure of the support plays a significant role in coke formation. Modifying the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical pores decreases the acidity of the support, which inhibits coke formation on the metal and improves the support's capacity for coke. The pore size has a direct effect on the performance of PDH, with Pt catalysts on microporous supports showing better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amounts compared to those on mesoporous supports. A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more cokes. Most appropriate modification methods increase activity and selectivity while decreasing the amount of coke. The transfer of coke from metal to support contributes to unexpectedly good performance when total cokes are increased.

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, have a significant influence on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The high acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite, a common support for PtSn-based catalysts in PDH reactions, leads to unsatisfactory coke accommodation and catalyst stability. The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ zeolite changes the pore structure, decreases the acid content, and promotes surface properties, greatly improving the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke. The coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrates from active metal to the support, and the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst are significantly promoted. The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enables better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. The spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and stabilize the active sites of the catalyst in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction. The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, and the deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke. The presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal, promoting the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support. The coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites. The large pores on the surface of the catalyst are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside, while the particles of platinum could be located in the hierarchical-pores of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. More Sn species existed in oxide states, which facilitate the anchoring of Pt particles on the catalysts, inhibiting further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process and leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. By the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly, making the hydrocarbon unable to readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, and the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support. Consequently, PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke.

The literature does not provide specific information on how pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the subnanometric PtSn clusters confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite exhibit high stability and robustness, even at high temperatures and over extended periods of time. This suggests that the unique pore structure of the MFI zeolite may play a role in accommodating the structural changes of the PtSn clusters during the reaction, which could potentially influence coke formation and catalyst performance. The literature also indicates that the stability and selectivity of the PtSn clusters are crucial for suppressing catalyst deactivation and coke formation in PDH reactions. Therefore, the design of optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions may involve the careful selection and engineering of catalyst support pore structures that can accommodate the structural changes of the active species while minimizing coke formation and maximizing selectivity and stability. Additionally, the subnanometric PtSn clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period of time (>6h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to the platinum clusters. The structural features of platinumtin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magnitude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity.

The use of this zeolite as a replacement for alumina support in the PDH process has led to a significant improvement in the durability and selectivity of the catalyst, as evidenced by the formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles throughout the zeolite support, which exhibit distinctive H2 sorption behavior and a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. The industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has traditionally used PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina. While Pt alone shows high initial catalytic activity, it rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, leading to a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. The use of a mesoporous zeolite as a catalyst support, with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores, can enhance the catalytic performance of supported metals by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite significantly improves PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability.

The pore network structure of the catalyst support significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The distribution of coke is affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions, leading to non-uniform distribution of coke through the catalyst particle. Some large pores can become inaccessible to reactants when surrounded by plugged pores, adding to the complexity of the coking process. This can cause a sudden change in macroscopic properties such as effective diffusivity and observed reaction rates. Coke deactivates catalyst particles in multiple ways, including covering active sites, increasing diffusion resistance, and making active sites inaccessible when pores are narrowed and plugged. The pore network structure significantly affects the capacity of the catalyst particle to contain coke. Coke narrows and eventually plugs pores during the reaction, leading to significant changes in the pore network structure. This process can render some large pores inaccessible to reactants, increasing the complexity of coking. The macroscopic properties, such as effective diffusivity and reaction rates, can experience sudden changes due to pore blockage. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, causing a significant loss in activity due to increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores.

Although no direct quotes were found addressing the specific influence of catalyst support pore structures on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature emphasizes the importance of encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters within silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite for improved stability and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions. The confinement of metal species within the zeolite channels significantly enhances hydrogen generation rates from formic acid decomposition and improves catalyst stability after calcination in various industrial oxidation-reduction conditions. The introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite improves regeneration stability, with catalytic activity remaining unchanged after four continuous cycles. These findings suggest that the pore structure of the catalyst support plays a critical role in the performance of PDH catalysts, and the design of optimal and effective catalysts should consider the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the support.

The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the use of non-acidic supports leads to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports, which can help in reducing coke formation. The study also found that the addition of tin to the platinum catalyst leads to a transfer of coke from the metal to the support, which can improve the catalyst's tolerance to coke and enhance its performance. The text also discusses the role of tin in modifying the electronic properties of platinum, which allows for better coke tolerance and catalytic performance. The literature does not delve into the implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts in detail.

The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the pore size affected mainly on coke yield when the coke amount (%wt/wt at TOS = 160 min) decreases in the following orders: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5). The influence of acidity is not easy to verify because the coke amount is limited by pore size.

The pore geometry of the catalyst supports, including pore size, structure, and connectivity, has a significant impact on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene, and the degree of coke formation. The study evaluated this influence on micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor. The results showed that the activity decreases with increasing pore size, with Pt-ZSM-5 exhibiting the highest propane conversion, followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15. The amount of coke formed during DHP is highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and lowest on Pt-Beta, indicating that Pt-Beta has better catalytic stability. Despite higher coke content, Pt-ZSM-5 shows better selectivity and stability than Pt-SBA-15. These findings suggest that three-dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than mesoporous SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites. The contradictory observations on DHP performance of different framework zeolites can be attributed to various factors such as catalyst compositions, Si/Al ratios, and feed compositions. The size of Pt particles is crucial in determining DHP activity, selectivity, coke formation, and catalyst stability. The pore size in the supports increases in the order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15. The study employs ZSM-5, Beta, and SBA-15 with distinct pore geometries to systematically assess the intrinsic influence of pore geometry on DHP. The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites may originate from active sites associated with cation exchange sites and complemented by their three-dimensional pore geometry. In contrast, large cylindrical pores in Pt-SBA-15 may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites, leading to lower catalytic performance. This indicates that the pore geometry of the support materials plays a crucial role in deriving the optimum catalytic properties of a supported active metal. On supports ZSM-5 and SBA-15, undesired side reactions like cracking and oligomerization, which produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydrogenation reaction. Despite identical Pt content and similar particle size, Pt supported on zeolites exhibits superior catalytic performance compared to mesoporous SBA-15.

The pore structure of the support plays a significant role in coke formation. Modifying the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical pores decreases the acidity of the support, which inhibits coke formation on the metal and improves the support's capacity for coke. The pore size has a direct effect on the performance of PDH, with Pt catalysts on microporous supports showing better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amounts compared to those on mesoporous supports. A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more cokes. Most appropriate modification methods increase activity and selectivity while decreasing the amount of coke. The transfer of coke from metal to support contributes to unexpectedly good performance when total cokes are increased.

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, have a significant influence on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The high acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite, a common support for PtSn-based catalysts in PDH reactions, leads to unsatisfactory coke accommodation and catalyst stability. The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ zeolite changes the pore structure, decreases the acid content, and promotes surface properties, greatly improving the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke. The coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrates from active metal to the support, and the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst are significantly promoted. The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enables better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. The spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and stabilize the active sites of the catalyst in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction. The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, and the deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke. The presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal, promoting the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support. The coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites. The large pores on the surface of the catalyst are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside, while the particles of platinum could be located in the hierarchical-pores of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. More Sn species existed in oxide states, which facilitate the anchoring of Pt particles on the catalysts, inhibiting further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process and leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. By the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly, making the hydrocarbon unable to readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, and the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support. Consequently, PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke.

The literature does not provide specific information on how pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the subnanometric PtSn clusters confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite exhibit high stability and robustness, even at high temperatures and over extended periods of time. This suggests that the unique pore structure of the MFI zeolite may play a role in accommodating the structural changes of the PtSn clusters during the reaction, which could potentially influence coke formation and catalyst performance. The literature also indicates that the stability and selectivity of the PtSn clusters are crucial for suppressing catalyst deactivation and coke formation in PDH reactions. Therefore, the design of optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions may involve the careful selection and engineering of catalyst support pore structures that can accommodate the structural changes of the active species while minimizing coke formation and maximizing selectivity and stability. Additionally, the subnanometric PtSn clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period of time (>6h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to the platinum clusters. The structural features of platinumtin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magnitude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity.

The use of this zeolite as a replacement for alumina support in the PDH process has led to a significant improvement in the durability and selectivity of the catalyst, as evidenced by the formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles throughout the zeolite support, which exhibit distinctive H2 sorption behavior and a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. The industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has traditionally used PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina. While Pt alone shows high initial catalytic activity, it rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, leading to a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. The use of a mesoporous zeolite as a catalyst support, with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores, can enhance the catalytic performance of supported metals by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite significantly improves PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability.

The pore network structure of the catalyst support significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The distribution of coke is affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions, leading to non-uniform distribution of coke through the catalyst particle. Some large pores can become inaccessible to reactants when surrounded by plugged pores, adding to the complexity of the coking process. This can cause a sudden change in macroscopic properties such as effective diffusivity and observed reaction rates. Coke deactivates catalyst particles in multiple ways, including covering active sites, increasing diffusion resistance, and making active sites inaccessible when pores are narrowed and plugged. The pore network structure significantly affects the capacity of the catalyst particle to contain coke. Coke narrows and eventually plugs pores during the reaction, leading to significant changes in the pore network structure. This process can render some large pores inaccessible to reactants, increasing the complexity of coking. The macroscopic properties, such as effective diffusivity and reaction rates, can experience sudden changes due to pore blockage. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, causing a significant loss in activity due to increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores.

Although no direct quotes were found addressing the specific influence of catalyst support pore structures on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature emphasizes the importance of encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters within silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite for improved stability and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions. The confinement of metal species within the zeolite channels significantly enhances hydrogen generation rates from formic acid decomposition and improves catalyst stability after calcination in various industrial oxidation-reduction conditions. The introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite improves regeneration stability, with catalytic activity remaining unchanged after four continuous cycles. These findings suggest that the pore structure of the catalyst support plays a critical role in the performance of PDH catalysts, and the design of optimal and effective catalysts should consider the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the support.

The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the use of non-acidic supports leads to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports, which can help in reducing coke formation. The study also found that the addition of tin to the platinum catalyst leads to a transfer of coke from the metal to the support, which can improve the catalyst's tolerance to coke and enhance its performance. The text also discusses the role of tin in modifying the electronic properties of platinum, which allows for better coke tolerance and catalytic performance. The literature does not delve into the implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts in detail.

The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the pore size affected mainly on coke yield when the coke amount (%wt/wt at TOS = 160 min) decreases in the following orders: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5). The influence of acidity is not easy to verify because the coke amount is limited by pore size.

The pore geometry of the catalyst supports, including pore size, structure, and connectivity, has a significant impact on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene, and the degree of coke formation. The study evaluated this influence on micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor. The results showed that the activity decreases with increasing pore size, with Pt-ZSM-5 exhibiting the highest propane conversion, followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15. The amount of coke formed during DHP is highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and lowest on Pt-Beta, indicating that Pt-Beta has better catalytic stability. Despite higher coke content, Pt-ZSM-5 shows better selectivity and stability than Pt-SBA-15. These findings suggest that three-dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than mesoporous SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites. The contradictory observations on DHP performance of different framework zeolites can be attributed to various factors such as catalyst compositions, Si/Al ratios, and feed compositions. The size of Pt particles is crucial in determining DHP activity, selectivity, coke formation, and catalyst stability. The pore size in the supports increases in the order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15. The study employs ZSM-5, Beta, and SBA-15 with distinct pore geometries to systematically assess the intrinsic influence of pore geometry on DHP. The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites may originate from active sites associated with cation exchange sites and complemented by their three-dimensional pore geometry. In contrast, large cylindrical pores in Pt-SBA-15 may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites, leading to lower catalytic performance. This indicates that the pore geometry of the support materials plays a crucial role in deriving the optimum catalytic properties of a supported active metal. On supports ZSM-5 and SBA-15, undesired side reactions like cracking and oligomerization, which produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydrogenation reaction. Despite identical Pt content and similar particle size, Pt supported on zeolites exhibits superior catalytic performance compared to mesoporous SBA-15.

The pore structure of the support plays a significant role in coke formation. Modifying the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical pores decreases the acidity of the support, which inhibits coke formation on the metal and improves the support's capacity for coke. The pore size has a direct effect on the performance of PDH, with Pt catalysts on microporous supports showing better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amounts compared to those on mesoporous supports. A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more cokes. Most appropriate modification methods increase activity and selectivity while decreasing the amount of coke. The transfer of coke from metal to support contributes to unexpectedly good performance when total cokes are increased.

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, have a significant influence on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The high acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite, a common support for PtSn-based catalysts in PDH reactions, leads to unsatisfactory coke accommodation and catalyst stability. The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ zeolite changes the pore structure, decreases the acid content, and promotes surface properties, greatly improving the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke. The coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrates from active metal to the support, and the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst are significantly promoted. The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enables better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. The spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and stabilize the active sites of the catalyst in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction. The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, and the deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke. The presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal, promoting the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support. The coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites. The large pores on the surface of the catalyst are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside, while the particles of platinum could be located in the hierarchical-pores of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. More Sn species existed in oxide states, which facilitate the anchoring of Pt particles on the catalysts, inhibiting further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process and leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. By the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly, making the hydrocarbon unable to readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, and the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support. Consequently, PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke.

The literature does not provide specific information on how pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the subnanometric PtSn clusters confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite exhibit high stability and robustness, even at high temperatures and over extended periods of time. This suggests that the unique pore structure of the MFI zeolite may play a role in accommodating the structural changes of the PtSn clusters during the reaction, which could potentially influence coke formation and catalyst performance. The literature also indicates that the stability and selectivity of the PtSn clusters are crucial for suppressing catalyst deactivation and coke formation in PDH reactions. Therefore, the design of optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions may involve the careful selection and engineering of catalyst support pore structures that can accommodate the structural changes of the active species while minimizing coke formation and maximizing selectivity and stability. Additionally, the subnanometric PtSn clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period of time (>6h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to the platinum clusters. The structural features of platinumtin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magnitude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity.

The use of this zeolite as a replacement for alumina support in the PDH process has led to a significant improvement in the durability and selectivity of the catalyst, as evidenced by the formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles throughout the zeolite support, which exhibit distinctive H2 sorption behavior and a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. The industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has traditionally used PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina. While Pt alone shows high initial catalytic activity, it rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, leading to a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. The use of a mesoporous zeolite as a catalyst support, with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores, can enhance the catalytic performance of supported metals by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite significantly improves PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability.

The pore network structure of the catalyst support significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The distribution of coke is affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions, leading to non-uniform distribution of coke through the catalyst particle. Some large pores can become inaccessible to reactants when surrounded by plugged pores, adding to the complexity of the coking process. This can cause a sudden change in macroscopic properties such as effective diffusivity and observed reaction rates. Coke deactivates catalyst particles in multiple ways, including covering active sites, increasing diffusion resistance, and making active sites inaccessible when pores are narrowed and plugged. The pore network structure significantly affects the capacity of the catalyst particle to contain coke. Coke narrows and eventually plugs pores during the reaction, leading to significant changes in the pore network structure. This process can render some large pores inaccessible to reactants, increasing the complexity of coking. The macroscopic properties, such as effective diffusivity and reaction rates, can experience sudden changes due to pore blockage. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, causing a significant loss in activity due to increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores.

Although no direct quotes were found addressing the specific influence of catalyst support pore structures on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature emphasizes the importance of encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters within silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite for improved stability and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions. The confinement of metal species within the zeolite channels significantly enhances hydrogen generation rates from formic acid decomposition and improves catalyst stability after calcination in various industrial oxidation-reduction conditions. The introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite improves regeneration stability, with catalytic activity remaining unchanged after four continuous cycles. These findings suggest that the pore structure of the catalyst support plays a critical role in the performance of PDH catalysts, and the design of optimal and effective catalysts should consider the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the support.

The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the use of non-acidic supports leads to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports, which can help in reducing coke formation. The study also found that the addition of tin to the platinum catalyst leads to a transfer of coke from the metal to the support, which can improve the catalyst's tolerance to coke and enhance its performance. The text also discusses the role of tin in modifying the electronic properties of platinum, which allows for better coke tolerance and catalytic performance. The literature does not delve into the implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts in detail.

The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the pore size affected mainly on coke yield when the coke amount (%wt/wt at TOS = 160 min) decreases in the following orders: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5). The influence of acidity is not easy to verify because the coke amount is limited by pore size.

The pore geometry of the catalyst supports, including pore size, structure, and connectivity, has a significant impact on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene, and the degree of coke formation. The study evaluated this influence on micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor. The results showed that the activity decreases with increasing pore size, with Pt-ZSM-5 exhibiting the highest propane conversion, followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15. The amount of coke formed during DHP is highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and lowest on Pt-Beta, indicating that Pt-Beta has better catalytic stability. Despite higher coke content, Pt-ZSM-5 shows better selectivity and stability than Pt-SBA-15. These findings suggest that three-dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than mesoporous SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites. The contradictory observations on DHP performance of different framework zeolites can be attributed to various factors such as catalyst compositions, Si/Al ratios, and feed compositions. The size of Pt particles is crucial in determining DHP activity, selectivity, coke formation, and catalyst stability. The pore size in the supports increases in the order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15. The study employs ZSM-5, Beta, and SBA-15 with distinct pore geometries to systematically assess the intrinsic influence of pore geometry on DHP. The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites may originate from active sites associated with cation exchange sites and complemented by their three-dimensional pore geometry. In contrast, large cylindrical pores in Pt-SBA-15 may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites, leading to lower catalytic performance. This indicates that the pore geometry of the support materials plays a crucial role in deriving the optimum catalytic properties of a supported active metal. On supports ZSM-5 and SBA-15, undesired side reactions like cracking and oligomerization, which produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydrogenation reaction. Despite identical Pt content and similar particle size, Pt supported on zeolites exhibits superior catalytic performance compared to mesoporous SBA-15.

The pore structure of the support plays a significant role in coke formation. Modifying the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical pores decreases the acidity of the support, which inhibits coke formation on the metal and improves the support's capacity for coke. The pore size has a direct effect on the performance of PDH, with Pt catalysts on microporous supports showing better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amounts compared to those on mesoporous supports. A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more cokes. Most appropriate modification methods increase activity and selectivity while decreasing the amount of coke. The transfer of coke from metal to support contributes to unexpectedly good performance when total cokes are increased.

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, have a significant influence on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The high acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite, a common support for PtSn-based catalysts in PDH reactions, leads to unsatisfactory coke accommodation and catalyst stability. The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ zeolite changes the pore structure, decreases the acid content, and promotes surface properties, greatly improving the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke. The coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrates from active metal to the support, and the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst are significantly promoted. The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enables better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. The spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and stabilize the active sites of the catalyst in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction. The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, and the deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke. The presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal, promoting the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support. The coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites. The large pores on the surface of the catalyst are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside, while the particles of platinum could be located in the hierarchical-pores of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. More Sn species existed in oxide states, which facilitate the anchoring of Pt particles on the catalysts, inhibiting further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process and leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. By the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly, making the hydrocarbon unable to readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, and the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support. Consequently, PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke.

The literature does not provide specific information on how pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the subnanometric PtSn clusters confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite exhibit high stability and robustness, even at high temperatures and over extended periods of time. This suggests that the unique pore structure of the MFI zeolite may play a role in accommodating the structural changes of the PtSn clusters during the reaction, which could potentially influence coke formation and catalyst performance. The literature also indicates that the stability and selectivity of the PtSn clusters are crucial for suppressing catalyst deactivation and coke formation in PDH reactions. Therefore, the design of optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions may involve the careful selection and engineering of catalyst support pore structures that can accommodate the structural changes of the active species while minimizing coke formation and maximizing selectivity and stability. Additionally, the subnanometric PtSn clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period of time (>6h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to the platinum clusters. The structural features of platinumtin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magnitude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity.
