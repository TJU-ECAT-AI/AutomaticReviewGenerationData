[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor by analyzing reaction products and mass changes simultaneously."
          [2] "The characterization results indicate that catalysts contain Pt within the pores and Pt nanoparticles of more or less similar sizes however stabilized on markedly different pore geometries (structure and size)."
          [3] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."
          [4] "TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed dur- ing DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."

          [9] "Accordingly, the size of pores in the supports increases in the fol- lowing order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15."
          [10] "Therefore, ZSM-5, Beta and SBA-15 which provide distinct pore geometries were employed for this study."
          [11] "This allows us to principally and systematically assess the intrinsic influence of pore geometry of the support materials on DHP."
          [12] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites could originate from the active sites that are associated with cation ex- changesites and might be complemented by theirthree dimensional pore geometry."
          [13] "On the other hand, large cylindrical pores which may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites located within the pores (that means a low degree of propane adsorption), and a lack of cation exchange sites in Pt-SBA-15 may haveleadtoits lowercatalyticperformance."

          [15] "Accordingly, it appears that on support ZSM-5 and SBA-15 the undesired side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, etc.,which could produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydro- genation reaction."
          [16] "The above results evidence that despite identical Pt content and virtually the same particle size in the catalysts, Pt supported on the zeolites are more active, selective and stable than that on the meso- porous SBA-15."

The pore structure of the support is another factor which has a significant role in coke formation.
          The acidity of the support was decreased after the modification of the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical-pores, (96) which inhibits the formation of coke on the metal and improves the capacity of the support for coke.
          Moreover, the pore size has a direct effect on performance of PDH. The Pt catalysts on the microporous support show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amount than the counterpart on the mesoporous support.
          A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores could accommodate more cokes.
          The transfer of coke from metal to support is accountable for the unexpected good performance when the total cokes are increased.
          most of the appropriate modification methods increase the activity and selectivity and decrease the amount of coke.

          [3] "Moreover, the coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrated from active metal to the support."
          [4] "As expected, by using the catalyst PtSnNa/ZQ, the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst were significantly promoted."
          [5] "The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enabled better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability."
          [6] "In this circumstance, hydrogen can be dissociated to H atoms at the surface of Pt active sites and they may overflow to the surface of adjacent Pt oxides or the other Pt oxides that interact strongly with the carrier. In this way, the spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and the active sites of the catalyst can be stabilized in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [7] "The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5."
          [8] "The deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ (12.8%) is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (17.4%)."
          [9] "The total amount of coke deposits on PtSnNa/ZQ is much less than that on PtSnNa/ZSM-5, especially for the coke deposits on the external surface of the support."

          [12] "Based on the above results (NH3-TPD and XPS analysis), the coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites."
          [13] "Therefore, during the reaction, the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support."
          [14] "Consequently, this implies that PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke."

[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."

[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor by analyzing reaction products and mass changes simultaneously."
          [2] "The characterization results indicate that catalysts contain Pt within the pores and Pt nanoparticles of more or less similar sizes however stabilized on markedly different pore geometries (structure and size)."
          [3] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."
          [4] "TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed dur- ing DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."

          [8] "However, re- cently we have demonstrated that the size of Pt particle is crucial in determining the DHP activity, selectivity, the degree of coke formation and thus the stability of the catalyst."
          [9] "Accordingly, the size of pores in the supports increases in the fol- lowing order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15."
          [10] "Therefore, ZSM-5, Beta and SBA-15 which provide distinct pore geometries were employed for this study."
          [11] "This allows us to principally and systematically assess the intrinsic influence of pore geometry of the support materials on DHP."
          [12] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites could originate from the active sites that are associated with cation ex- changesites and might be complemented by theirthree dimensional pore geometry."
          [13] "On the other hand, large cylindrical pores which may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites located within the pores (that means a low degree of propane adsorption), and a lack of cation exchange sites in Pt-SBA-15 may haveleadtoits lowercatalyticperformance."
          [14] "This suggests thatthepore geometry of the support materials plays an important role in deriving the optimum catalytic properties of a supported active metal."
          [15] "Accordingly, it appears that on support ZSM-5 and SBA-15 the undesired side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, etc.,which could produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydro- genation reaction."
          [16] "The above results evidence that despite identical Pt content and virtually the same particle size in the catalysts, Pt supported on the zeolites are more active, selective and stable than that on the meso- porous SBA-15."

The pore structure of the support is another factor which has a significant role in coke formation.
          The acidity of the support was decreased after the modification of the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical-pores, (96) which inhibits the formation of coke on the metal and improves the capacity of the support for coke.
          Moreover, the pore size has a direct effect on performance of PDH. The Pt catalysts on the microporous support show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amount than the counterpart on the mesoporous support.
          A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores could accommodate more cokes.
          The transfer of coke from metal to support is accountable for the unexpected good performance when the total cokes are increased.
          most of the appropriate modification methods increase the activity and selectivity and decrease the amount of coke.

          [14] "This suggests thatthepore geometry of the support materials plays an important role in deriving the optimum catalytic properties of a supported active metal."
          [15] "Accordingly, it appears that on support ZSM-5 and SBA-15 the undesired side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, etc.,which could produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydro- genation reaction."
          [16] "The above results evidence that despite identical Pt content and virtually the same particle size in the catalysts, Pt supported on the zeolites are more active, selective and stable than that on the meso- porous SBA-15."

The pore structure of the support is another factor which has a significant role in coke formation.
          The acidity of the support was decreased after the modification of the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical-pores, (96) which inhibits the formation of coke on the metal and improves the capacity of the support for coke.
          Moreover, the pore size has a direct effect on performance of PDH. The Pt catalysts on the microporous support show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amount than the counterpart on the mesoporous support.
          A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores could accommodate more cokes.
          The transfer of coke from metal to support is accountable for the unexpected good performance when the total cokes are increased.
          most of the appropriate modification methods increase the activity and selectivity and decrease the amount of coke.

[1] "ZSM-5 zeolite has been used as a common support for PtSn-based catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. But owing to its high acidy, coke accommodation and stability of the catalyst are not satisfactory."
          [2] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."
          [3] "Moreover, the coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrated from active metal to the support."
          [4] "As expected, by using the catalyst PtSnNa/ZQ, the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst were significantly promoted."
          [5] "The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enabled better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability."
          [6] "In this circumstance, hydrogen can be dissociated to H atoms at the surface of Pt active sites and they may overflow to the surface of adjacent Pt oxides or the other Pt oxides that interact strongly with the carrier. In this way, the spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and the active sites of the catalyst can be stabilized in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction."

          [12] "Based on the above results (NH3-TPD and XPS analysis), the coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites."
          [13] "Therefore, during the reaction, the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support."
          [14] "Consequently, this implies that PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke."



[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."

          [2] "The characterization results indicate that catalysts contain Pt within the pores and Pt nanoparticles of more or less similar sizes however stabilized on markedly different pore geometries (structure and size)."
          [3] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."
          [4] "TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed dur- ing DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."
          [5] "Among Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15, the former shows better selec- tivity and stability than the latter despite higher coke content."
          [6] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA- 15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."

          [8] "However, re- cently we have demonstrated that the size of Pt particle is crucial in determining the DHP activity, selectivity, the degree of coke formation and thus the stability of the catalyst."
          [9] "Accordingly, the size of pores in the supports increases in the fol- lowing order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15."
          [10] "Therefore, ZSM-5, Beta and SBA-15 which provide distinct pore geometries were employed for this study."
          [11] "This allows us to principally and systematically assess the intrinsic influence of pore geometry of the support materials on DHP."
          [12] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites could originate from the active sites that are associated with cation ex- changesites and might be complemented by theirthree dimensional pore geometry."
          [13] "On the other hand, large cylindrical pores which may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites located within the pores (that means a low degree of propane adsorption), and a lack of cation exchange sites in Pt-SBA-15 may haveleadtoits lowercatalyticperformance."

          [16] "The above results evidence that despite identical Pt content and virtually the same particle size in the catalysts, Pt supported on the zeolites are more active, selective and stable than that on the meso- porous SBA-15."

The pore structure of the support is another factor which has a significant role in coke formation.
          The acidity of the support was decreased after the modification of the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical-pores, (96) which inhibits the formation of coke on the metal and improves the capacity of the support for coke.
          Moreover, the pore size has a direct effect on performance of PDH. The Pt catalysts on the microporous support show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amount than the counterpart on the mesoporous support.
          A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores could accommodate more cokes.
          The transfer of coke from metal to support is accountable for the unexpected good performance when the total cokes are increased.
          most of the appropriate modification methods increase the activity and selectivity and decrease the amount of coke.

[1] "ZSM-5 zeolite has been used as a common support for PtSn-based catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. But owing to its high acidy, coke accommodation and stability of the catalyst are not satisfactory."
          [2] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."
          [3] "Moreover, the coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrated from active metal to the support."
          [4] "As expected, by using the catalyst PtSnNa/ZQ, the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst were significantly promoted."
          [5] "The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enabled better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability."
          [6] "In this circumstance, hydrogen can be dissociated to H atoms at the surface of Pt active sites and they may overflow to the surface of adjacent Pt oxides or the other Pt oxides that interact strongly with the carrier. In this way, the spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and the active sites of the catalyst can be stabilized in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [7] "The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5."
          [8] "The deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ (12.8%) is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (17.4%)."

          [12] "Based on the above results (NH3-TPD and XPS analysis), the coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites."
          [13] "Therefore, during the reaction, the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support."
          [14] "Consequently, this implies that PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke."



[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
          [2] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7.

          [3] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
          [4] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles14,15."
          [5] "Whereas we expected that addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst owing to the strong metalsupport interaction effect, to our surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y."
          [6] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH cata- lytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig.2."
          [7] "The Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane con- version of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."

          [5] "Finally,coke deactivates catalyst particles in several ways, not just by covering active sites; a significant loss in activity can also be caused by the increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores."
