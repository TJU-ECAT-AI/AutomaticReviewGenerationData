          The pore structure of the support is another factor which has a significant role in coke formation.
          The acidity of the support was decreased after the modification of the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical-pores, (96) which inhibits the formation of coke on the metal and improves the capacity of the support for coke.
          Moreover, the pore size has a direct effect on performance of PDH. The Pt catalysts on the microporous support show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amount than the counterpart on the mesoporous support.
          A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores could accommodate more cokes.
          The transfer of coke from metal to support is accountable for the unexpected good performance when the total cokes are increased.
          most of the appropriate modification methods increase the activity and selectivity and decrease the amount of coke.

          催化剂载体的孔结构在焦炭形成中起着重要作用。通过引入分级孔来修改ZSM-5的孔结构，可以降低载体的酸性，从而抑制金属上的焦炭形成，并提高载体的焦炭容量。孔径大小直接影响PDH的性能，与介孔载体上的Pt催化剂相比，微孔载体上的Pt催化剂显示出更好的选择性、稳定性和更低的焦炭量。具有更均匀、连接性更高和孔径更大的载体可以容纳更多的焦炭。大多数适当的修改方法可以增加活性和选择性，同时减少焦炭量。当总焦炭量增加时，焦炭从金属转移到载体是导致意外良好性能的原因。
