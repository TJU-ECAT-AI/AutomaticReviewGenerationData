          Although no direct quotes were found addressing the specific influence of catalyst support pore structures on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature emphasizes the importance of encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters within silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite for improved stability and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions. The confinement of metal species within the zeolite channels significantly enhances hydrogen generation rates from formic acid decomposition and improves catalyst stability after calcination in various industrial oxidation-reduction conditions. The introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite improves regeneration stability, with catalytic activity remaining unchanged after four continuous cycles. These findings suggest that the pore structure of the catalyst support plays a critical role in the performance of PDH catalysts, and the design of optimal and effective catalysts should consider the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the support.

          尽管没有找到直接说明催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的相关引文，但文献确实强调了将亚纳米PtZn簇封装在S-1沸石中的重要性，以提高PDH反应中的稳定性和丙烯选择性。金属物种在沸石通道内的限制显著提高了从甲酸分解中生成氢的速率，并在各种工业氧化还原条件下提高了催化剂在煅烧后的稳定性。将Cs+离子引入沸石可以提高催化剂的再生稳定性，连续四次循环后催化活性保持不变。这些发现表明，催化剂支撑的孔结构在PDH催化剂的性能中起着关键作用，设计最佳和有效的催化剂应考虑支撑的孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次排列。
