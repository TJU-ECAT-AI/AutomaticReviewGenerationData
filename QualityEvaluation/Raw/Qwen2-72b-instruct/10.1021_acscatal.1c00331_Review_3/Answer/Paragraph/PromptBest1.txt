The comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is multifaceted and critical. In PDH reactions, the hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of zeolite catalyst supports significantly boosts catalytic performance by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. This is a marked improvement over traditional PtSn bimetallic catalysts on porous alumina, which suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition, leading to a loss of selectivity to propylene \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. Incorporating La and Y with Pt into the mesoporous zeolite enhances the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles, leading to a tenfold increase in catalytic lifetime \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite significantly improves PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. The critical role of surface silanol nests in enabling atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles contributes to the high PDH catalytic performance \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. The pore network structure of catalyst supports significantly influences coke formation and accommodation, affecting overall catalyst performance \[10.1002/aic.16410\]. Coke distribution is non-uniform, influenced by pore structure and reaction conditions. Large pores can become inaccessible when surrounded by plugged pores, complicating the coking process. This leads to sudden changes in macroscopic properties like effective diffusivity and reaction rates. Coke deactivation occurs through covering active sites, increasing diffusion resistance, and blocking pores, rendering active sites inaccessible. The pore network's capacity to contain coke is crucial. During reactions, coke narrows and plugs pores, altering the pore network structure. When the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, a percolation phenomenon occurs, causing significant activity loss due to increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites \[10.1002/aic.16410\]. In PDH reactions, the pore structure of catalyst supports significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall performance. Encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters within S-1 zeolite enhances stability and propylene selectivity \[10.1002/anie.202003349\]. The confinement of metal species boosts hydrogen generation and improves catalyst stability. Incorporating Cs+ ions into the zeolite maintains catalytic activity after multiple cycles, highlighting the critical role of pore structure in PDH catalysts and its implications for optimal design \[10.1002/anie.202003349\]. Non-acidic supports in catalysts reduce coke formation by minimizing cracking and polymerization reactions \[10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011\]. Adding tin to platinum catalysts enhances coke tolerance and performance by transferring coke from the metal to the support \[10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011\]. These insights suggest strategies for designing effective catalysts in PDH reactions \[10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011\]. In PDH reactions, pore size significantly influences coke formation and yield, with smaller pores leading to lower coke amounts \[10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4\]. The impact of acidity on coke formation is less clear, as pore size appears to limit coke accumulation \[10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The intricate relationship between catalyst support pore structure characteristics and their impact on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach to catalyst design. The hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of zeolite catalyst supports, which facilitates reactant and product diffusion and provides high metal nanoparticle dispersion, is a key factor in enhancing catalytic performance \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. The role of surface silanol nests in enabling atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles, contributing to high PDH catalytic performance, highlights the importance of understanding the atomic-level interactions within catalysts \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. The non-uniform distribution of coke, influenced by pore structure and reaction conditions, and the percolation phenomenon that occurs when the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, leading to significant activity loss, emphasize the need for advanced characterization techniques to monitor pore structure changes in real-time \[10.1002/aic.16410\]. The encapsulation of subnanometer PtZn clusters within S-1 zeolite, which enhances stability and propylene selectivity, and the role of Cs+ ions in maintaining catalytic activity after multiple cycles, suggest that the design of PDH catalysts should consider the synergistic effects of pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements \[10.1002/anie.202003349\]. The reduction of coke formation by non-acidic supports and the enhancement of coke tolerance and performance by transferring coke from the metal to the support, facilitated by the addition of tin to platinum catalysts, point to the potential of modifying electronic properties for improved catalytic efficiency \[10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011\]. The significant influence of pore size on coke yield, with smaller pores leading to lower coke amounts, indicates that pore size optimization is a critical parameter for designing effective PDH catalysts \[10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4\]. Future research endeavors might focus on developing advanced characterization techniques for real-time monitoring of pore structure changes, exploring the synergistic effects of pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements on PDH catalyst performance, and modifying electronic properties for improved coke tolerance and catalytic efficiency. Additionally, the development of non-acidic supports and the optimization of pore size for minimizing coke formation and maximizing selectivity and stability are promising avenues for the design of optimal PDH catalysts.

Incorporating La and Y into a mesoporous zeolite support improves Pt dispersion, resulting in Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles that exhibit enhanced PDH performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. These nanoparticles, formed throughout the zeolite support, show slow deactivation, retaining high conversion rates over extended periods. The pore network structure of catalyst supports significantly influences coke formation and accommodation, affecting overall catalyst performance \[10.1002/aic.16410\]. Coke distribution is non-uniform, influenced by pore structure and reaction conditions. Large pores can become inaccessible when surrounded by plugged pores, complicating the coking process. This leads to sudden changes in macroscopic properties like effective diffusivity and reaction rates. Coke deactivation occurs through covering active sites, increasing diffusion resistance, and blocking pores, rendering active sites inaccessible. Encapsulating PtZn clusters within S-1 zeolite enhances stability and propylene selectivity, highlighting the critical role of pore structure in catalyst performance \[10.1002/anie.202003349\]. The introduction of Cs+ ions further improves regeneration stability, underscoring the importance of pore characteristics in optimal catalyst design. Non-acidic supports reduce coke formation by minimizing cracking and polymerization reactions, while the addition of tin to platinum catalysts enhances coke tolerance and performance by transferring coke from the metal to the support \[10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011\]. These findings have implications for designing effective catalysts with improved coke accommodation and overall performance.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The insights gained from the comprehensive analysis of catalyst support pore structure characteristics in PDH reactions open up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel hierarchical pore structures that can further enhance coke accommodation and resistance to deactivation. The exploration of advanced characterization techniques could provide deeper insights into the structural changes of active species within the pore structures, guiding the engineering of optimal pore geometries. Additionally, the integration of computational modeling and machine learning algorithms could accelerate the discovery of new catalysts with tailored pore structures for enhanced PDH performance. The optimization of pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements will remain critical for the design of next-generation PDH catalysts that can achieve higher activity, selectivity, and durability under industrial conditions.

The comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is multifaceted and critical. Hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structures, such as those found in siliceous MFI zeolites, significantly enhance catalytic performance by facilitating diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. These structures improve durability and selectivity, as evidenced by the formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles, which exhibit enhanced PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. The addition of La and Y to the mesoporous zeolite increases the catalytic lifetime more than tenfold, and the PtLa/mz-deGa catalyst shows a high initial propane conversion of 40% and slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion after 30 days of reaction \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. The pore network structure of catalyst supports significantly influences coke formation and accommodation, affecting overall catalyst performance. Coke distribution is non-uniform, influenced by pore structure and reaction conditions \[10.1002/aic.16410\]. Large pores can become inaccessible when surrounded by plugged pores, complicating the coking process. This leads to sudden changes in macroscopic properties like diffusivity and reaction rates. Coke deactivation occurs through covering active sites, increasing diffusion resistance, and blocking pores, impacting catalyst activity. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores falls below a critical level, further reducing activity \[10.1002/aic.16410\]. Encapsulating PtZn clusters within S-1 zeolite enhances hydrogen generation rates and improves catalyst stability under industrial conditions, highlighting the critical role of pore structure in PDH catalyst performance \[10.1002/anie.202003349\]. The introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite maintains catalytic activity through multiple cycles, underscoring the importance of pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements in designing effective PDH catalysts \[10.1002/anie.202003349\]. Non-acidic supports minimize coke formation by reducing cracking and polymerization reactions, unlike acidic supports. Adding tin to platinum catalysts facilitates coke transfer from metal to support, enhancing coke tolerance and performance \[10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011\]. Smaller pore sizes lead to reduced coke yield, as evidenced by the comparison of different catalysts: 3% Pt-SiO2 exhibits the least coke formation compared to other catalysts like 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 \[10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4\]. This relationship is crucial for designing effective catalysts with controlled pore structures to minimize coke formation and enhance PDH performance.
