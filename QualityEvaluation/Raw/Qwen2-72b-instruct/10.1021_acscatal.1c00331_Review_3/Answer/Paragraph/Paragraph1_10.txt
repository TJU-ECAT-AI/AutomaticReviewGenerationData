The pore structure characteristics of catalyst supports play a pivotal role in determining the efficiency and longevity of catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These characteristics significantly influence the formation and accommodation of coke, a carbonaceous deposit that can lead to catalyst deactivation. Catalysts with well-defined pore structures can mitigate coke formation by providing accessible pathways for reactants and products, thus preventing the accumulation of intermediates that could form coke. Moreover, the pore size and shape can affect the diffusion of reactants and products, impacting the overall reaction kinetics and selectivity. Optimal pore structures can enhance the catalyst's performance by maximizing active site utilization and minimizing coke formation, leading to higher yields of desired products. Therefore, understanding and tailoring the pore structure of catalyst supports is crucial for the design of high-performance catalysts in PDH processes, aiming to achieve a balance between activity, selectivity, and stability.
