By the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly, making the hydrocarbon unable to readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, and the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support.

The large pores on the surface of the catalyst are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside, while the particles of platinum could be located in the hierarchical-pores of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. More Sn species existed in oxide states, which facilitate the anchoring of Pt particles on the catalysts, inhibiting further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process and leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. By the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly, making the hydrocarbon unable to readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, and the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support.

By the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly, making the hydrocarbon unable to readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, and the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support.

By the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly, making the hydrocarbon unable to readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, and the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support.

The study evaluated this influence on micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor. The results showed that the activity decreases with increasing pore size, with Pt-ZSM-5 exhibiting the highest propane conversion, followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15. The amount of coke formed during DHP is highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and lowest on Pt-Beta, indicating that Pt-Beta has better catalytic stability. Despite higher coke content, Pt-ZSM-5 shows better selectivity and stability than Pt-SBA-15. These findings suggest that three-dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than mesoporous SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites. The contradictory observations on DHP performance of different framework zeolites can be attributed to various factors such as catalyst compositions, Si/Al ratios, and feed compositions. The size of Pt particles is crucial in determining DHP activity, selectivity, coke formation, and catalyst stability. The pore size in the supports increases in the order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15. The study employs ZSM-5, Beta, and SBA-15 with distinct pore geometries to systematically assess the intrinsic influence of pore geometry on DHP. The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites may originate from active sites associated with cation exchange sites and complemented by their three-dimensional pore geometry. In contrast, large cylindrical pores in Pt-SBA-15 may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites, leading to lower catalytic performance. This indicates that the pore geometry of the support materials plays a crucial role in deriving the optimum catalytic properties of a supported active metal. On supports ZSM-5 and SBA-15, undesired side reactions like cracking and oligomerization, which produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydrogenation reaction.

The high acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite, a common support for PtSn-based catalysts in PDH reactions, leads to unsatisfactory coke accommodation and catalyst stability. The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ zeolite changes the pore structure, decreases the acid content, and promotes surface properties, greatly improving the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke. The coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrates from active metal to the support, and the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst are significantly promoted. The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enables better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. The spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and stabilize the active sites of the catalyst in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction. The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, and the deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke. The presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal, promoting the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support. The coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites. The large pores on the surface of the catalyst are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside, while the particles of platinum could be located in the hierarchical-pores of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. More Sn species existed in oxide states, which facilitate the anchoring of Pt particles on the catalysts, inhibiting further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process and leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. By the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly, making the hydrocarbon unable to readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, and the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support. Consequently, PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke.", "Doi": "10.1002/jctb.4686"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The literature does not provide specific information on how pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the subnanometric PtSn clusters confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite exhibit high stability and robustness, even at high temperatures and over extended periods of time. This suggests that the unique pore structure of the MFI zeolite may play a role in accommodating the structural changes of the PtSn clusters during the reaction, which could potentially influence coke formation and catalyst performance. The literature also indicates that the stability and selectivity of the PtSn clusters are crucial for suppressing catalyst deactivation and coke formation in PDH reactions. Therefore, the design of optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions may involve the careful selection and engineering of catalyst support pore structures that can accommodate the structural changes of the active species while minimizing coke formation and maximizing selectivity and stability. Additionally, the subnanometric PtSn clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period of time (>6h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to the platinum clusters. The structural features of platinumtin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magnitude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7"}
