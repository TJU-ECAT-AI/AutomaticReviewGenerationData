The comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is multifaceted and critical \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. Hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structures in siliceous MFI zeolites significantly enhance catalytic performance by facilitating diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. Traditionally, PtSn bimetallic catalysts on alumina have been used in PDH, but Pt alone rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition, reducing selectivity to propylene \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. Incorporating La and Y into a mesoporous zeolite support improves Pt dispersion, forming Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles that exhibit enhanced PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. The pore network structure's characteristics significantly influence coke formation and accommodation, affecting catalyst performance \[10.1002/aic.16410\]. Coke distribution is non-uniform, influenced by pore structure and reaction conditions, leading to sudden changes in macroscopic properties like effective diffusivity and reaction rates \[10.1002/aic.16410\]. Encapsulating PtZn clusters within S-1 zeolite enhances stability and propylene selectivity, with pore structure playing a critical role \[10.1002/anie.202003349\]. Incorporating Cs+ ions maintains catalytic activity through multiple cycles, underscoring the importance of pore structure in PDH catalysts and its implications for optimal design \[10.1002/anie.202003349\]. Non-acidic supports reduce coke formation by minimizing cracking and polymerization reactions \[10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011\]. Adding tin to platinum catalysts enhances coke tolerance and performance by transferring coke from the metal to the support \[10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011\]. Pore size significantly impacts coke formation and yield, with smaller pores leading to lower coke amounts \[10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4\]. The pore geometry of catalyst supports significantly influences PDH activity, selectivity, and coke formation \[10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031\]. Hierarchical pore modifications in ZSM-5 reduce acidity, inhibiting coke formation and enhancing coke accommodation \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_3\]. Hierarchical-pore structures in ZQ zeolite significantly improve coke accommodation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions compared to ZSM-5 \[10.1002/jctb.4686\]. The pore structure of MFI zeolite supports the stability and robustness of subnanometric PtSn clusters, even at high temperatures, suggesting its role in accommodating structural changes that influence coke formation and catalyst performance \[10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The insights gained from the study of catalyst support pore structure characteristics in PDH reactions underscore the pivotal role of pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance. These findings suggest that optimal catalyst design should focus on engineering hierarchical pore structures that balance high metal dispersion, facilitate diffusion, and minimize coke formation while maximizing selectivity and stability. Future research endeavors might concentrate on developing advanced characterization techniques to better understand the atomic-level interactions within these complex pore structures. Additionally, exploring the synthesis of novel catalyst supports with tailored pore architectures could lead to the discovery of materials with enhanced coke accommodation and resistance, thereby improving the longevity and efficiency of PDH catalysts. The integration of computational modeling with experimental studies could also provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between pore structure and catalytic performance, guiding the rational design of next-generation PDH catalysts.
