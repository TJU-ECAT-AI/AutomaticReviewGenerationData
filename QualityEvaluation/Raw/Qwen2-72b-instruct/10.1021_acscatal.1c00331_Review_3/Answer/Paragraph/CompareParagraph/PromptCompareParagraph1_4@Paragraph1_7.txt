The comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is multifaceted and critical. In PDH reactions, the hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of siliceous MFI zeolites significantly enhances catalytic performance by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. Traditionally, PtSn bimetallic catalysts on porous alumina have been used, but Pt alone deactivates rapidly due to coke deposition, reducing selectivity to propylene \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. Incorporating La and Y with Pt into a mesoporous zeolite improves catalyst dispersion and catalytic lifetime by over tenfold \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. The Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on degallated zeolite (PtLa/mz-deGa) exhibit enhanced PDH performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability, with high initial propane conversion and slow deactivation \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. Surface silanol nests play a critical role in enabling atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles, contributing to the high PDH catalytic performance \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\].

                    The pore network structure of catalyst supports significantly influences coke formation and accommodation, affecting overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions \[10.1002/aic.16410\]. Coke distribution is non-uniform, influenced by pore structure and reaction conditions. Some large pores become inaccessible when surrounded by plugged pores, complicating the coking process. This leads to sudden changes in macroscopic properties like effective diffusivity and reaction rates. Coke deactivation occurs through covering active sites, increasing diffusion resistance, and blocking pores. The pore network's capacity to contain coke is crucial. During reactions, coke narrows and plugs pores, altering the pore network structure. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores falls below a critical level, causing significant activity loss due to inaccessible active sites and increased diffusion resistance \[10.1002/aic.16410\].

                    Encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters within S-1 zeolite enhances stability and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions, with hydrogen generation rates from formic acid decomposition and catalyst stability after calcination significantly improved \[10.1002/anie.202003349\]. The addition of Cs+ ions boosts regeneration stability without affecting catalytic activity, highlighting the critical role of pore structure in PDH catalyst performance \[10.1002/anie.202003349\]. These findings underscore the importance of pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements in designing optimal catalysts for PDH reactions \[10.1002/anie.202003349\].

                    In PDH reactions, non-acidic supports minimize coke formation by reducing cracking and polymerization reactions \[10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011\]. Adding tin to platinum catalysts shifts coke from the metal to the support, enhancing coke tolerance and performance \[10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011\]. This insight suggests that modifying pore structures can optimize catalysts for better coke accommodation and efficiency \[10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011\].

                    Pore size significantly impacts coke formation and accommodation, affecting catalyst performance in PDH reactions \[10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4\]. Smaller pore sizes lead to lower coke yields, as seen in the comparison: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5) \[10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4\]. This relationship is crucial for designing optimal catalysts, as it highlights the role of pore structure in managing coke formation and enhancing overall performance \[10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The insights gained from the study of catalyst support pore structure characteristics in PDH reactions underscore the pivotal role of pore structure in managing coke formation and accommodation, thereby influencing overall catalyst performance. The hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of siliceous MFI zeolites, the pore network's capacity to contain coke, and the encapsulation of subnanometer metal clusters within zeolites are key factors in enhancing PDH catalytic performance. The addition of elements like La, Y, and Cs+ ions, and the modification of pore structures to optimize coke accommodation, offer promising strategies for designing more efficient and durable catalysts. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with tailored pore structures that can further minimize coke formation while maximizing selectivity and stability. Additionally, exploring the role of surface silanol nests in enabling atomistic alloying and the impact of hierarchical pore modifications on acidity and coke accommodation could lead to breakthroughs in PDH catalyst design. The potential for integrating multiple strategies, such as non-acidic supports and the addition of tin to platinum catalysts, to enhance coke tolerance and performance also warrants further investigation. Ultimately, these advancements could pave the way for the development of next-generation PDH catalysts with improved efficiency and longevity.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The detailed analysis of the influence of catalyst support pore structure on PDH reactions reveals the pivotal role of pore characteristics in managing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance. The hierarchical pore structure of zeolites, particularly MFI zeolites, offers significant advantages in enhancing catalytic performance and durability. The encapsulation of metal clusters within zeolite pores and the modification of pore structures to reduce acidity and enhance surface properties have shown promising results in improving coke accommodation and catalytic stability. The transfer of coke from metal to support, facilitated by hierarchical pore structures, unexpectedly boosts performance. These findings suggest that future research should focus on the development of catalysts with optimized pore structures that can better accommodate cokes while minimizing their formation. The exploration of non-acidic supports and the addition of elements like tin to modify electronic properties and enhance coke tolerance presents a promising avenue for designing more effective catalysts. The role of pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements in PDH catalysts should be further investigated to derive optimal catalytic properties. Advanced characterization techniques can provide deeper insights into the structural features of active species and their interactions with pore structures, guiding the design of catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity. The integration of these strategies could lead to the development of next-generation PDH catalysts with improved performance and longevity.
