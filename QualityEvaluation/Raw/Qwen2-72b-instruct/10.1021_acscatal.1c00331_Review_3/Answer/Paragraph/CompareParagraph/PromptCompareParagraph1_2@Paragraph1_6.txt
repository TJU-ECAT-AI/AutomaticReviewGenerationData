The comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions has been extensively studied \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4, 10.1002/aic.16410, 10.1002/anie.202003349, 10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011, 10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4, 10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031, 10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_3, 10.1002/jctb.4686, 10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7\]. In PDH reactions, the hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of siliceous MFI zeolite supports boosts catalytic performance by facilitating diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion. Traditionally, PtSn bimetallic catalysts on alumina have been used, but Pt alone rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition, reducing selectivity to propylene. Incorporating La and Y with Pt into a mesoporous zeolite significantly improves PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. The pore network structure significantly influences coke formation and accommodation, affecting overall catalyst performance. Coke distribution is non-uniform, influenced by pore structure and reaction conditions. Large pores can become inaccessible when surrounded by plugged pores, complicating the coking process. This leads to sudden changes in macroscopic properties like effective diffusivity and reaction rates. Encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters within S-1 zeolite enhances stability and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions, highlighting the critical role of pore structure in catalyst performance. Adding tin to platinum catalysts enhances coke tolerance and performance by transferring coke from the metal to the support. Pore size significantly impacts coke formation and accommodation, influencing catalyst performance. Smaller pore sizes lead to lower coke yields, as evidenced by the comparison of different catalysts. These insights are crucial for designing optimal catalysts with controlled pore structures to manage coke formation and enhance PDH reaction efficiency.
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive analysis of the influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions reveals the pivotal role of pore structure in determining catalyst efficiency. The hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of siliceous MFI zeolite supports, encapsulation of subnanometer PtZn clusters within S-1 zeolite, and the addition of tin to platinum catalysts are among the strategies that significantly enhance PDH catalytic performance. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalyst supports with tailored pore structures that can further optimize coke accommodation and minimize deactivation. The exploration of advanced characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the dynamic interactions between pore structure, metal dispersion, and coke formation mechanisms will be crucial. Additionally, the integration of computational modeling and machine learning algorithms could aid in the rational design of catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity. The pursuit of sustainable and efficient PDH catalysts that can operate under milder conditions and have extended lifetimes will be a priority, potentially leading to significant advancements in the chemical industry.

The comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is multifaceted and critical. Hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structures, such as those found in siliceous MFI zeolites, significantly enhance catalytic performance by facilitating diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. These structures improve durability and selectivity, as evidenced by the formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles, which exhibit enhanced PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. The addition of La and Y to the mesoporous zeolite increases the catalytic lifetime more than tenfold, and the PtLa/mz-deGa catalyst shows a high initial propane conversion of 40% and slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion after 30 days of reaction \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. The pore network structure of catalyst supports significantly influences coke formation and accommodation, affecting overall catalyst performance. Coke distribution is non-uniform, influenced by pore structure and reaction conditions \[10.1002/aic.16410\]. Large pores can become inaccessible when surrounded by plugged pores, complicating the coking process. This leads to sudden changes in macroscopic properties like diffusivity and reaction rates. Coke deactivation occurs through covering active sites, increasing diffusion resistance, and blocking pores, impacting catalyst activity. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores falls below a critical level, further reducing activity \[10.1002/aic.16410\]. Encapsulating PtZn clusters within S-1 zeolite enhances hydrogen generation rates and improves catalyst stability under industrial conditions, highlighting the critical role of pore structure in PDH catalyst performance \[10.1002/anie.202003349\]. The introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite maintains catalytic activity through multiple cycles, underscoring the importance of pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements in designing effective PDH catalysts \[10.1002/anie.202003349\]. Non-acidic supports minimize coke formation by reducing cracking and polymerization reactions, unlike acidic supports. Adding tin to platinum catalysts facilitates coke transfer from metal to support, enhancing coke tolerance and performance \[10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011\]. Smaller pore sizes lead to reduced coke yield, as evidenced by the comparison of different catalysts: 3% Pt-SiO2 exhibits the least coke formation compared to other catalysts like 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 \[10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4\]. This relationship is crucial for designing effective catalysts with controlled pore structures to minimize coke formation and enhance PDH performance.
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalyst supports with tailored hierarchical pore structures that can further enhance coke accommodation and resistance to deactivation. The integration of advanced characterization techniques could provide deeper insights into the dynamic interactions between pore structure, metal dispersion, and coke formation mechanisms. Moreover, the exploration of non-conventional supports, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), could offer new avenues for designing catalysts with exceptional stability and selectivity in PDH reactions. The optimization of pore size, connectivity, and uniformity, along with the hierarchical arrangement, will remain a critical aspect of catalyst design. Additionally, the incorporation of multi-functional additives, such as La, Y, and Cs+, could be systematically investigated to enhance the catalytic lifetime and performance of PDH catalysts. The development of predictive models and computational simulations could also aid in the rational design of catalysts, allowing for the precise control of pore structure and metal dispersion. These forward-thinking suggestions advocate for innovative angles and burgeoning domains that might take center stage in future explorations, while rooted in the file's details.
