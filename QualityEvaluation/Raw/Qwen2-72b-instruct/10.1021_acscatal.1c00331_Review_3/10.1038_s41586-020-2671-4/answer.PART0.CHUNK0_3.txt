[1] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7. The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface. The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
[2] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
[3] "The PtREE/zeolite showed formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles throughout the zeolite support. The Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles generated in this manner exhibited a distinctive H2 sorp- tion behaviour (see Extended Data Table1)."
[4] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH cata- lytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig.2."

1.The industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has traditionally used PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina. While Pt alone shows high initial catalytic activity, it rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, leading to a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. The use of a mesoporous zeolite as a catalyst support, with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores, can enhance the catalytic performance of supported metals by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite significantly improves PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability.

1.工业丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程传统上使用负载在多孔氧化铝上的PtSn双金属催化剂。虽然Pt单独表现出高初始催化活性，但由于Pt表面的焦炭沉积，它会迅速失活，导致对丙烯的催化选择性损失。使用具有超薄沸石框架和三维互连介孔的介孔沸石作为催化剂载体，可以增强负载金属的催化性能，通过促进反应物和产物的扩散以及提供高金属纳米粒子分散度来实现。在脱镓沸石上形成Pt3La和Pt3Y纳米粒子显著提高了PDH催化性能，包括活性、选择性和耐久性。
