[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."

[2] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7. The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."

[3] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."

[4] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles14,15."

[5] "Whereas we expected that addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst owing to the strong metalsupport interaction effect, to our surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y."

[6] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH cata- lytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig.2."

[7] "The Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane con- version of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."

[8] "In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane con- version of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."

[9] "The PtLa/mz-deGa catalyst contained a small amount of Ga (Si/Ga=598) even after the degallation, and that this may participate in the catalytic function17,18."

[10] "The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/ mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles."

1.使用多铵表面活性剂作为结构导向剂合成的介孔沸石具有独特的结构，包括超薄沸石框架和三维互连的介孔。这种结构通过提供反应物和产物的易扩散以及介孔内金属纳米粒子的高分散性，提高了支撑金属的催化性能。工业丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程近三十年来一直使用支撑在多孔氧化铝上的PtSn双金属催化剂。Pt金属本身具有高初始催化活性，但由于Pt表面的焦炭沉积，催化活性迅速下降。焦炭沉积还会导致催化选择性向丙烯的不期望损失。将稀土元素(REEs)如La和Y添加到介孔沸石中，可以改善Pt催化剂的分散性，并将Pt稳定成小纳米粒子的形式。添加La和Y后，催化寿命提高了十倍以上。Pt3La和Pt3Y纳米粒子在脱镓沸石上的形成在PDH催化性能的所有方面都带来了显著的增强，包括活性、选择性和耐久性。支撑在脱镓沸石上的Pt3La间金属纳米粒子显示出40%的初始丙烷转化率(接近平衡转化率)，并且在30天的反应后，转化率极慢地降低，保持在8%。PtLa/mz-deGa催化剂含有少量的Ga，这可能参与催化功能。PtLa/mz-deGa和PtY/mz-deGa的高PDH催化性能可归因于表面硅醇巢在原子尺度上将La和Y合金化到Pt纳米粒子中的关键作用。
