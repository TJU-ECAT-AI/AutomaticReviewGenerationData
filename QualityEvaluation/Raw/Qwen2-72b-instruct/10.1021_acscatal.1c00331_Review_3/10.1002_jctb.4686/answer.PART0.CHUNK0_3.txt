[1] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."
[2] "Moreover, the coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrated from active metal to the support."
[3] "As expected, by using the catalyst PtSnNa/ZQ, the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst were significantly promoted."
[4] "The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enabled better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability."
[5] "In this circumstance, hydrogen can be dissociated to H atoms at the surface of Pt active sites and they may overflow to the surface of adjacent Pt oxides or the other Pt oxides that interact strongly with the carrier. In this way, the spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and the active sites of the catalyst can be stabilized in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[6] "The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5."
[7] "The deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ (12.8%) is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (17.4%)."
[8] "The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke."
[9] "In addition, the presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal. Thus, significant amounts of Sn oxides in the catalyst will promote the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support."
[10] "The coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites."
[11] "Compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the peak area of low temperature in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst is increased, while the area of high temperature is reduced significantly."
[12] "Consequently, this implies that PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke."

1.The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ not only changed the pore structure and decreased the acid content, but also promoted the surface properties of the zeolite, greatly improving the capacity of the catalyst to accommodate coke. The coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrated from the active metal to the support, and the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst were significantly promoted by using the catalyst PtSnNa/ZQ.

1.在ZQ中引入分级孔不仅改变了孔结构，降低了酸含量，还促进了沸石的表面性质，大大提高了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力。PtSnNa/ZQ上的焦炭沉积从活性金属迁移到支撑物上，使用PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂时，丙烷脱氢至丙烯的催化性能和催化剂稳定性得到显著提高。新的分级多孔ZSM-5支撑物（ZQ）具有增强的容纳焦炭的能力，PtSnNa/ZQ使丙烷转化率提高，催化剂稳定性增强。溢流氢可以促进Pt氧化物的还原，并在PtSnNa/ZQ中稳定催化剂的活性位点，这对丙烷脱氢反应过程有利。与PtSnNa/ZSM-5相比，PtSnNa/ZQ的转化率和选择性都有所提高，PtSnNa/ZQ的失活参数远低于PtSnNa/ZSM-5。ZQ的分级孔对增强ZQ容纳焦炭的能力负有责任。Pt催化剂中Sn氧化物的存在削弱了烃类和金属之间的结合能，促进了焦炭前体从金属表面迁移到支撑物的外表面。在金属上形成的焦炭前体可能会迁移到支撑物和酸位点上。与PtSnNa/ZSM-5相比，PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂低温峰面积增加，而高温峰面积显著降低。因此，这表明PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂具有更好的焦炭容纳能力和更好的抗焦炭形成能力。
