          [1] "ZSM-5 zeolite has been used as a common support for PtSn-based catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. But owing to its high acidy, coke accommodation and stability of the catalyst are not satisfactory."
          [2] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."
          [3] "Moreover, the coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrated from active metal to the support."
          [4] "As expected, by using the catalyst PtSnNa/ZQ, the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst were significantly promoted."
          [5] "The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enabled better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability."
          [6] "In this circumstance, hydrogen can be dissociated to H atoms at the surface of Pt active sites and they may overflow to the surface of adjacent Pt oxides or the other Pt oxides that interact strongly with the carrier. In this way, the spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and the active sites of the catalyst can be stabilized in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [7] "The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5."
          [8] "The deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ (12.8%) is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (17.4%)."
          [9] "The total amount of coke deposits on PtSnNa/ZQ is much less than that on PtSnNa/ZSM-5, especially for the coke deposits on the external surface of the support."
          [10] "The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke."
          [11] "In addition, the presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal."
          [12] "Based on the above results (NH3-TPD and XPS analysis), the coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites."
          [13] "Therefore, during the reaction, the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support."
          [14] "Consequently, this implies that PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke."

          The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, have a significant influence on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The high acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite, a common support for PtSn-based catalysts in PDH reactions, leads to unsatisfactory coke accommodation and catalyst stability. The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ zeolite changes the pore structure, decreases the acid content, and promotes surface properties, greatly improving the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke. The coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrates from active metal to the support, and the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst are significantly promoted. The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enables better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. The spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and stabilize the active sites of the catalyst in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction. The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, and the deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke. The presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal, promoting the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support. The coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites. The large pores on the surface of the catalyst are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside, while the particles of platinum could be located in the hierarchical-pores of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. More Sn species existed in oxide states, which facilitate the anchoring of Pt particles on the catalysts, inhibiting further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process and leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. By the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly, making the hydrocarbon unable to readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, and the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support. Consequently, PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke.

          催化剂载体孔结构的特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次排列，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。ZSM-5沸石，作为PDH反应中PtSn基催化剂的常用载体，由于其高酸性，导致焦炭容纳和催化剂稳定性不佳。在ZQ沸石中引入层次孔改变了孔结构，降低了酸含量，促进了表面性质，极大地提高了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力。PtSnNa/ZQ上的焦炭沉积从活性金属迁移到支撑物上，丙烷脱氢到丙烯的催化性能和催化剂的稳定性得到显著提高。新的层次多孔ZSM-5载体（ZQ）具有增强的焦炭容纳能力，而PtSnNa/ZQ使丙烷转化率提高，催化剂稳定性改善。溢流氢可以促进Pt氧化物的还原，并在PtSnNa/ZQ中稳定催化剂的活性位点，这对丙烷脱氢反应过程有利。PtSnNa/ZQ的转化率和选择性都比PtSnNa/ZSM-5高，PtSnNa/ZQ的失活参数远低于PtSnNa/ZSM-5。ZQ的分级孔隙负责增强ZQ容纳焦炭的能力。Pt催化剂中Sn氧化物的存在削弱了烃类与金属之间的结合能，促进了焦炭前体从金属表面向支撑物外表面的迁移。在金属上形成的焦炭前体可能会迁移到支撑物和酸位点上。另一方面，对于催化剂表面的大孔，这些孔足够大，可以锚定铂粒子。因此，在PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂上，所有的金属粒子都分散在支撑物的外表面，而铂粒子可以位于PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂的分级孔隙中。此外，在这种情况下，更多的Sn物种以氧化态存在，这有利于铂粒子在催化剂上的锚定。根据这些影响，在反应过程中进一步聚结的Pt粒子被抑制，导致催化剂稳定性的提高。此外，通过引入这些分级孔隙，ZQ材料的酸性被显著改变。因此，在反应过程中，烃类不能轻易形成多个碳-金属键，吸附的物种更易移动，更容易迁移到支撑物上。因此，这表明PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂具有更好的容纳焦炭的能力和更好的抵抗焦炭形成的能力。
