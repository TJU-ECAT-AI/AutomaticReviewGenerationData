[1] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."
[2] "Moreover, the coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrated from active metal to the support."
[3] "As expected, by using the catalyst PtSnNa/ZQ, the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst were significantly promoted."
[4] "The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enabled better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability."
[5] "In this circumstance, hydrogen can be dissociated to H atoms at the surface of Pt active sites and they may overflow to the surface of adjacent Pt oxides or the other Pt oxides that interact strongly with the carrier. In this way, the spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and the active sites of the catalyst can be stabilized in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[6] "The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5."
[7] "The deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ (12.8%) is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (17.4%)."
[8] "The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke."
[9] "In addition, the presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal. Thus, significant amounts of Sn oxides in the catalyst will promote the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support."

[11] "On the other hand, for the large pores on the surface of the catalyst, these pores are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside.

[12] "Moreover, in this case, more Sn species existed in oxide states, which facilitate the anchoring of Pt particles on the catalysts."

[14] "Moreover, by the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly."
[15] "Therefore, during the reaction, the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbonmetal bonds, the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support."
[16] "In these circumstances, carbon deposits on the active metal are reduced during the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."
[17] "Consequently, this implies that PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke."

1.在ZQ中引入分级孔隙改变了孔结构，降低了酸含量，促进了表面性质，极大地提高了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力。PtSnNa/ZQ上的焦炭沉积从活性金属迁移到支撑物上。使用PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂，丙烷脱氢至丙烯的催化性能和催化剂的稳定性显著提高。新的分级多孔ZSM-5支撑物（ZQ）具有增强的容纳焦炭的能力，使丙烷转化率提高，催化剂稳定性提高。溢流氢可以促进Pt氧化物的还原，稳定PtSnNa/ZQ中的催化剂活性位点，这对丙烷脱氢反应过程有利。PtSnNa/ZQ的转化率和选择性都比PtSnNa/ZSM-5高。PtSnNa/ZQ的失活参数远低于PtSnNa/ZSM-5。ZQ的分级孔隙负责增强ZQ容纳焦炭的能力。Pt催化剂中Sn氧化物的存在削弱了烃类和金属之间的结合能，促进了焦炭前体从金属表面向支撑物外表面的迁移。在金属上形成的焦炭前体可能会迁移到支撑物和酸位点上。催化剂表面的大孔足以锚定铂粒子。在PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂上，所有金属粒子都分散在支撑物的外表面，而铂粒子可以位于PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂的分级孔隙中。更多的Sn物种以氧化态存在，这有利于Pt粒子在催化剂上的锚定。在反应过程中，Pt粒子的进一步聚结受到抑制，导致催化剂稳定性的提高。通过引入这些分级孔隙，ZQ材料的酸性得到显著修改。在反应过程中，烃类不易形成多个碳金属键，吸附物种更易移动，更容易迁移到支撑物上。在这种情况下，活性金属上的碳沉积在丙烷脱氢反应中减少。因此，PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂具有更好的容纳焦炭的能力和更好的抵抗焦炭形成的能力。
