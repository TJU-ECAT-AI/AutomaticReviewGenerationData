[1] "ZSM-5 zeolite has been used as a common support for PtSn-based catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. But owing to its high acidy, coke accommodation and stability of the catalyst are not satisfactory."
[2] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."
[3] "Moreover, the coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrated from active metal to the support."
[4] "As expected, by using the catalyst PtSnNa/ZQ, the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst were significantly promoted."
[5] "The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enabled better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability."
[6] "In order to resolve these coke problems, Lu's group23 developed a coking- and sintering-resistant palladium catalyst using an atomic layer deposition method."
[7] "In our present work, instead of using atomic layer deposition, hierarchical-pores are directly introduced into ZSM-5 zeolite."
[8] "The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke."
[9] "In addition, the presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal."
[10] "Thus, significant amounts of Sn oxides in the catalyst will promote the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support."
[11] "Besides, the weakened acidity of the support will help to convert Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and lead to a reduced coke formation rate during the reaction."
[12] "Based on the above results (NH3-TPD and XPS analysis), the coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites."
[13] "As reflected in Table 5, compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the peak area of low temperature in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst is increased, while the area of high temperature is reduced significantly."
[14] "This indicates that, on PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst, the coke precursor formed on the metal was highly suppressed and even migrated to the external surface of the support."

1.The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, have a significant influence on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The high acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite, a common support for PtSn-based catalysts in PDH reactions, leads to unsatisfactory coke accommodation and catalyst stability. The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ zeolite changes the pore structure, decreases the acid content, and promotes surface properties, greatly improving the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke. The coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrates from active metal to the support, and the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst are significantly promoted. The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enables better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke. The presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal, promoting the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support. The weakened acidity of the support helps to convert Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites, leading to a reduced coke formation rate during the reaction. The coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites. Compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the peak area of low temperature in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst is increased, while the area of high temperature is reduced significantly, indicating that the coke precursor formed on the metal was highly suppressed and even migrated to the external surface of the support. These relationships have implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts by controlling the pore size distribution of the hierarchical-pores in zeolite.

1.催化剂载体孔结构的特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次排列，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。ZSM-5沸石，作为PDH反应中PtSn基催化剂的常用载体，由于其高酸性，导致焦炭容纳和催化剂稳定性不佳。在ZQ沸石中引入层次孔改变了孔结构，降低了酸含量，促进了表面性质，极大地提高了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力。PtSnNa/ZQ上的焦炭沉积从活性金属迁移到载体上，丙烷脱氢到丙烯的催化性能和催化剂的稳定性得到显著提高。新的层次多孔ZSM-5载体（ZQ）具有增强的焦炭容纳能力，PtSnNa/ZQ使丙烷转化率提高，催化剂稳定性改善。ZQ的层次孔对ZQ容纳焦炭的能力有增强作用。Pt催化剂中Sn氧化物的存在削弱了烃类和金属之间的结合能，促进了焦炭前体从金属表面迁移到载体的外表面。载体酸性的减弱有助于将布伦斯特酸位转化为路易斯酸位，从而在反应过程中降低焦炭的形成速率。形成在金属上的焦炭前体可能会迁移到载体和酸位上。与PtSnNa/ZSM-5相比，PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂的低温峰面积增加，而高温峰面积显著减少，表明形成在金属上的焦炭前体被高度抑制，甚至迁移到载体的外表面。这些关系对通过控制沸石中层次孔的孔径分布来设计最优和有效的催化剂有启示作用。
