[1] "ZSM-5 zeolite has been used as a common support for PtSn-based catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. But owing to its high acidy, coke accommodation and stability of the catalyst are not satisfactory."
[2] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."
[3] "Moreover, the coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrated from active metal to the support."
[4] "As expected, by using the catalyst PtSnNa/ZQ, the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst were significantly promoted."
[5] "The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enabled better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability."
[6] "In this circumstance, hydrogen can be dissociated to H atoms at the surface of Pt active sites and they may overflow to the surface of adjacent Pt oxides or the other Pt oxides that interact strongly with the carrier. In this way, the spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and the active sites of the catalyst can be stabilized in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[7] "The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5."
[8] "The deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ (12.8%) is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (17.4%)."
[9] "The total amount of coke deposits on PtSnNa/ZQ is much less than that on PtSnNa/ZSM-5, especially for the coke deposits on the external surface of the support."
[10] "The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke."
[11] "In addition, the presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal."
[12] "Based on the above results (NH3-TPD and XPS analysis), the coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites."
[13] "Therefore, during the reaction, the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds, the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support."

1.The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, have a significant influence on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The high acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite, a common support for PtSn-based catalysts in PDH reactions, leads to unsatisfactory coke accommodation and catalyst stability. The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ zeolite changes the pore structure, decreases the acid content, and promotes surface properties, greatly improving the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke. The coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrates from active metal to the support, and the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst are significantly promoted. The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enables better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. The presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal, promoting the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support. The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke. Consequently, PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke. These relationships have implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts by controlling the pore size distribution of the hierarchical-pores in zeolite.

1.催化剂载体孔结构的特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次排列，对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。ZSM-5沸石，作为PDH反应中PtSn基催化剂的常用载体，由于其高酸性，导致焦炭容纳和催化剂稳定性不佳。在ZQ沸石中引入层次孔改变了孔结构，降低了酸含量，促进了表面性能，大大提高了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力。PtSnNa/ZQ上的焦炭沉积从活性金属迁移到载体上，丙烷脱氢至丙烯的催化性能和催化剂稳定性得到显著提高。新的层次多孔ZSM-5载体(ZQ)具有增强的焦炭容纳能力，PtSnNa/ZQ使丙烷转化率提高，催化剂稳定性提高。Pt催化剂中Sn氧化物的存在削弱了烃类和金属之间的结合能，促进了焦炭前体从金属表面向载体外部表面的迁移。ZQ的层次孔对ZQ容纳焦炭的能力增强负有责任。因此，PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂具有更好的焦炭容纳能力和更好的抗焦炭形成能力。这些关系对通过控制沸石中层次孔的孔径分布来设计最优和有效催化剂具有启示意义。

1.在ZQ中引入分级孔隙改变了孔结构，降低了酸含量，促进了表面性质，极大地提高了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力。PtSnNa/ZQ上的焦炭沉积从活性金属迁移到支撑物上。使用PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂，丙烷脱氢至丙烯的催化性能和催化剂的稳定性显著提高。新的分级多孔ZSM-5支撑物（ZQ）具有增强的容纳焦炭的能力，使丙烷转化率提高，催化剂稳定性提高。溢流氢可以促进Pt氧化物的还原，稳定PtSnNa/ZQ中的催化剂活性位点，这对丙烷脱氢反应过程有利。PtSnNa/ZQ的转化率和选择性都比PtSnNa/ZSM-5高。PtSnNa/ZQ的失活参数远低于PtSnNa/ZSM-5。ZQ的分级孔隙负责增强ZQ容纳焦炭的能力。Pt催化剂中Sn氧化物的存在削弱了烃类和金属之间的结合能，促进了焦炭前体从金属表面向支撑物外表面的迁移。在金属上形成的焦炭前体可能会迁移到支撑物和酸位点上。催化剂表面的大孔足以锚定铂粒子。在PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂上，所有金属粒子都分散在支撑物的外表面，而铂粒子可以位于PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂的分级孔隙中。更多的Sn物种以氧化态存在，这有利于Pt粒子在催化剂上的锚定。在反应过程中，Pt粒子的进一步聚结受到抑制，导致催化剂稳定性的提高。通过引入这些分级孔隙，ZQ材料的酸性得到显著修改。在反应过程中，烃类不易形成多个碳金属键，吸附物种更易移动，更容易迁移到支撑物上。在这种情况下，活性金属上的碳沉积在丙烷脱氢反应中减少。因此，PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂具有更好的容纳焦炭的能力和更好的抵抗焦炭形成的能力。
