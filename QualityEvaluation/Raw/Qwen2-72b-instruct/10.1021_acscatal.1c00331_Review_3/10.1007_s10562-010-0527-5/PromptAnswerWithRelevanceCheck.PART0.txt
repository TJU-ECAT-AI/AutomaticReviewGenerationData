Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the surface area and pore size of the catalysts can affect the initial propane conversion. Catalysts with high surface area, such as Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15, showed a high initial propane conversion greater than 40%, while catalysts with low surface area, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO, had low initial propane conversion less than 20%. This suggests that the pore structure of the support can influence the accessibility of the reactants to the active sites and the diffusion of products, which can affect the overall performance of the catalyst.

1.文献没有提供关于催化剂支撑体孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次性排列，如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到催化剂的表面积和孔径可以影响初始丙烷转化率。高表面积的催化剂，如Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SBA-15，显示出大于40%的高初始丙烷转化率，而低表面积的催化剂，如Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2、Pt/CeO2和Pt/MgO，初始丙烷转化率低于20%。这表明支撑体的孔结构可以影响反应物到达活性位点的可及性和产物的扩散，从而影响催化剂的整体性能。
