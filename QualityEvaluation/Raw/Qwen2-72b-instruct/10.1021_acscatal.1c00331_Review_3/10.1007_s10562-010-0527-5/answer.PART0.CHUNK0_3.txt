1.The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the surface area and pore size of the catalysts can affect the initial propane conversion. Catalysts with high surface area, such as Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15, showed a high initial propane conversion greater than 40%, while catalysts with low surface area, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO, had low initial propane conversion less than 20%. This suggests that the pore structure of the support can influence the accessibility of the reactants to the active sites and the diffusion of products, which can affect the overall performance of the catalyst.

1.文献没有提供关于催化剂支撑体孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次性排列，如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到催化剂的表面积和孔径可以影响初始丙烷转化率。高表面积的催化剂，如Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SBA-15，显示出大于40%的高初始丙烷转化率，而低表面积的催化剂，如Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2、Pt/CeO2和Pt/MgO，初始丙烷转化率低于20%。这表明支撑体的孔结构可以影响反应物到达活性位点的可及性和产物的扩散，从而影响催化剂的整体性能。
