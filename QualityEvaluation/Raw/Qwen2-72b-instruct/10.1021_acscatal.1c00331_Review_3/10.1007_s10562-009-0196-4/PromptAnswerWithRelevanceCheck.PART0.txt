Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the pore size affected mainly on coke yield when the coke amount (%wt/wt at TOS = 160 min) decreases in the following orders: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5). The influence of acidity is not easy to verify because the coke amount is limited by pore size.

1.文献没有提供关于催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径大小、连通性、均匀性和层次化排列，如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到孔径大小主要影响焦炭产量，当焦炭量（%wt/wt，在TOS=160分钟时）按以下顺序递减：3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6)和3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5)。由于焦炭量受孔径大小的限制，因此不容易验证酸性的影响。
