1.The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the pore size of the catalyst affects the yield of coke, with the amount of coke decreasing as the pore size decreases. The influence of acidity on coke formation is not easily verified because the amount of coke is limited by pore size.

1.文献没有提供关于催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径大小、连通性、均匀性和层次性排列，如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到催化剂的孔径大小会影响焦炭的产量，随着孔径大小的减小，焦炭的量会减少。由于焦炭的量受孔径大小的限制，因此不容易验证酸性对焦炭形成的影响。
