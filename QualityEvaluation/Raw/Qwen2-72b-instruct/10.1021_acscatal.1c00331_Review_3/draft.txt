1. The comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, with implications for optimal catalyst design.

The comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions has been extensively studied \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4, 10.1002/aic.16410, 10.1002/anie.202003349, 10.1016/j.jiec.2010.10.011, 10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4, 10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031, 10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_3, 10.1002/jctb.4686, 10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7\]. In PDH reactions, the hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of siliceous MFI zeolite supports boosts catalytic performance by facilitating diffusion and providing high metal nanoparticle dispersion. Traditionally, PtSn bimetallic catalysts on alumina have been used, but Pt alone rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition, reducing selectivity to propylene. Incorporating La and Y with Pt into a mesoporous zeolite significantly improves PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. The pore network structure significantly influences coke formation and accommodation, affecting overall catalyst performance. Coke distribution is non-uniform, influenced by pore structure and reaction conditions. Large pores can become inaccessible when surrounded by plugged pores, complicating the coking process. This leads to sudden changes in macroscopic properties like effective diffusivity and reaction rates. Encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters within S-1 zeolite enhances stability and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions, highlighting the critical role of pore structure in catalyst performance. Adding tin to platinum catalysts enhances coke tolerance and performance by transferring coke from the metal to the support. Pore size significantly impacts coke formation and accommodation, influencing catalyst performance. Smaller pore sizes lead to lower coke yields, as evidenced by the comparison of different catalysts. These insights are crucial for designing optimal catalysts with controlled pore structures to manage coke formation and enhance PDH reaction efficiency.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive analysis of the influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions reveals the pivotal role of pore structure in determining catalyst efficiency. The hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of siliceous MFI zeolite supports, encapsulation of subnanometer PtZn clusters within S-1 zeolite, and the addition of tin to platinum catalysts are among the strategies that significantly enhance PDH catalytic performance. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalyst supports with tailored pore structures that can further optimize coke accommodation and minimize deactivation. The exploration of advanced characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the dynamic interactions between pore structure, metal dispersion, and coke formation mechanisms will be crucial. Additionally, the integration of computational modeling and machine learning algorithms could aid in the rational design of catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity. The pursuit of sustainable and efficient PDH catalysts that can operate under milder conditions and have extended lifetimes will be a priority, potentially leading to significant advancements in the chemical industry.
