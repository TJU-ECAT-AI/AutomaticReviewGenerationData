1.The literature does not provide specific information on how pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the subnanometric PtSn clusters confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite exhibit high stability and robustness, even at high temperatures and over extended periods of time. This suggests that the unique pore structure of the MFI zeolite may play a role in accommodating the structural changes of the PtSn clusters during the reaction, which could potentially influence coke formation and catalyst performance. The literature also indicates that the stability and selectivity of the PtSn clusters are crucial for suppressing catalyst deactivation and coke formation in PDH reactions. Therefore, the design of optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions may involve the careful selection and engineering of catalyst support pore structures that can accommodate the structural changes of the active species while minimizing coke formation and maximizing selectivity and stability.

1.文献没有提供具体信息，说明催化剂支撑孔结构的孔径、连通性、均匀性和分层排列如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。然而，它确实提到，限制在纯硅MFI沸石的10R螺旋通道中的亚纳米PtSn簇表现出高稳定性和坚固性，即使在高温和长时间内也是如此。这表明MFI沸石的独特孔结构可能在适应PDH反应过程中PtSn簇的结构变化中发挥作用，这可能会影响焦炭形成和催化剂性能。文献还表明，PtSn簇的稳定性和选择性对于抑制PDH反应中的催化剂失活和焦炭形成至关重要。因此，设计PDH反应的最优和有效催化剂可能涉及精心选择和工程催化剂支撑孔结构，这些结构可以容纳活性物种的结构变化，同时最小化焦炭形成，最大化选择性和稳定性。

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the subnanometric PtSn clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period of time (>6h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to the platinum clusters. The structural features of platinumtin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magnitude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity.

1.文献没有提供关于催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性（如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次化排列）如何影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到，即使在高温（例如600C）下，仅需在铂簇中添加少量锡原子，亚纳米PtSn簇在H2中就能稳定超过6小时。铂锡簇的结构特征虽然不能立即通过常规表征技术看到，但可以通过原位扩展X射线吸收精细结构、高角环形暗场扫描透射电子显微镜和CO红外数据的组合来确定，这些特征对于在保持高初始催化活性的同时，使丙烷脱氢反应的失活率降低一个数量级至关重要。
