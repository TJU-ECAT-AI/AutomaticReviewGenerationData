1.The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the subnanometric PtSn clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period of time (>6h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to the platinum clusters. The structural features of platinumtin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magnitude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity.

1.文献没有提供关于催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性（如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次化排列）如何影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到，即使在高温（例如600C）下，仅需在铂簇中添加少量锡原子，亚纳米PtSn簇在H2中就能稳定超过6小时。铂锡簇的结构特征虽然不能立即通过常规表征技术看到，但可以通过原位扩展X射线吸收精细结构、高角环形暗场扫描透射电子显微镜和CO红外数据的组合来确定，这些特征对于在保持高初始催化活性的同时，使丙烷脱氢反应的失活率降低一个数量级至关重要。
