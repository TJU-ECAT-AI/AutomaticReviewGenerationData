1.The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the use of non-acidic supports leads to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports, which can help in reducing coke formation. The text also discusses the role of tin in modifying the electronic properties of platinum, which allows for better coke tolerance and catalytic performance. The literature does not delve into the implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts in detail.

1.文献没有提供关于催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次化排列，如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的具体信息。然而，它确实提到使用非酸性支撑物与酸性支撑物相比，会导致更少的裂解和聚合反应，这有助于减少焦炭的形成。文中还讨论了锡在修改铂的电子性质方面的作用，这使得催化剂具有更好的焦炭耐受性和催化性能。文献没有详细探讨这些关系对设计最优和有效催化剂的影响。
