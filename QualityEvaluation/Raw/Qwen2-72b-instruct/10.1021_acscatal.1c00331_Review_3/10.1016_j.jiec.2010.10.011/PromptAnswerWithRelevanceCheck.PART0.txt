Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the use of non-acidic supports leads to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports, which can help in reducing coke formation. The study also found that the addition of tin to the platinum catalyst leads to a transfer of coke from the metal to the support, which can improve the catalyst's tolerance to coke and enhance its performance.

1.文献没有提供关于催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次化排列，如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的具体信息。然而，它确实提到使用非酸性支撑物与酸性支撑物相比，会导致更少的裂解和聚合反应，这有助于减少焦炭的形成。研究还发现，向铂催化剂中添加锡会导致焦炭从金属转移到支撑物上，这可以提高催化剂对焦炭的耐受性，增强其性能。
