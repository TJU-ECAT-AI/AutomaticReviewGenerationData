t has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduc- tion of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can substantially modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals and further influence their catalytic behaviour1. Furthermore, the electronic structures and surface properties of bimetallic nanopar- ticles are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the two elements. By tuning the procedure for preparing the bimetallic nanoparticles or by post-synthetic treatments, the spatial distri- bution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be modified and, thus, their reactivity24. Under reaction conditions,structural transformation and reconstruction of the metal ensem- bles may also occur, which may result in further changes of the cata- lytic behaviour with time on stream.
Platinum-based materials are widely used for reforming, hydro- genation and dehydrogenation catalysts in numerous industrial processes due to their excellent properties for the activation of CH bonds while limiting the extent of CC bond cleavage through hydrogenolysis5. Nonetheless, a second metal is typically incor- porated together with Pt to further improve the selectivity and/or stability of the process, particularly when the reaction temperature needs to be high (for example, endothermic reactions). For instance,tin is introduced as a second metal for propane dehydrogenation to propylene in the UOP Oleflex process6,7. Pt and the second metal (in this work, Sn) can be found in bimetallic catalysts as multiple struc- tures that range from completely segregated phases of each metal to perfectly mixed (Pt/Sn) alloys8. The optimal catalyst is achieved when CC bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of the active sites responsible for the reaction of interest (for example,dehydrogenation). Although PtSn alloys notably promote the selec- tivity to propylene in propane dehydrogenation, they also reduce and/or modulate the active Pt sites, decreasing the catalytic activity5.
The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In, Sn) have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). High Sn content and high activa- tion temperature favour the formation of alloyed structures that substantially promote catalyst selectivity and stability in dehydro- genation reactions8. However, the resulting large alloyed PtM par- ticles are suboptimal from an activity standpoint, and there is an interest in designing more active, selective and stable subnanomet- ric bimetallic catalysts912. In this respect, taking advantage of the confinement effect of zeolite structures, subnanometric metal spe- cies (single atoms and clusters with a few atoms) can be generated and stabilized in the porous structures within zeolite crystallites1317.
In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R chan- nels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance. To understand the interaction between the subnano- metric Pt and Sn species, we have employed several characteriza- tion techniques, including XAS, quasi in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CO infrared (CO-IR) spectroscopy. It will be shown that subtle changes in the structural features of the sub- nanometric PtSn clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional spectroscopic techniques, can drastically affect their performance for propane dehydrogenation.
Results Characterization of PtSn clusters in MFI zeolite. Initially, a K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample (containing 0.4wt% Pt, 0.9wt% Sn and
0.6wt% K) was prepared by a one-pot synthesis according to our
previously reported method and then calcined in air, giving rise to atomically dispersed Pt and Sn species in pure silica MFI zeolite17.

Modulating the structures of subnanometric metal clusters at the atomic level is a great synthetic and characterization chal- lenge in catalysis. Here, we show how the catalytic properties of subnanometric platinum clusters (0.50.6nm) confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite are modulated upon introduction of partially reduced tin species that interact with the noble metal at the metal/support interface. The platinumtin clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period of time (>6h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to the platinum clusters. The structural features of platinumtin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional char- acterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magni- tude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity.
Nature Catalysis  www.nature.com/natcatal Articles Nature Catalysis As shown in Fig. 1ad and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, the location of the singly dispersed Pt atoms in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample was determined by a combination of high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-HAADF-STEM) and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) imaging, which can simultaneously provide infor- mation on the location of heavy elements (Pt in this work) and the structure of the zeolite, respectively, under low-dose conditions18,19.
To ensure the presence of atomically dispersed Pt atoms in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample, a reference K-MFI sample (without Sn or Pt) was analysed and compared. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, and considering the image simulation results from our previous work, the bright dots appearing in the HR-HAADF-STEM images can be ascribed to Pt atoms17. a b c d h g f e i j k l p o q r s t n m 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm 1 nm

Nature Catalysis  www.nature.com/natcatal Articles Nature Catalysis The chemical states of Pt in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample during H2 reduction at 600C were investigated by in situ
XAS. It was found that, regardless of the reduction time, the Pt
species in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample were completely reduced to metallic Pt at 600C (ref. 14), as inferred by the intensity of the white line in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra compared with a Pt foil reference (Fig. 2a) and the appear- ance of PtPt contributions in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Fig. 2b and Table 1). The STEM images show that the majority of the metal reassembles as subnanometric clusters of 0.50.6nm during the H2 treatment (Fig. 1). The size of the Pt clusters remains virtually unaltered regardless of the reduc- tion time from 0 to 22h, indicating high structural robustness (Supplementary Figs. 49). The average size of the Pt species in the K-PtSn@MFI samples after reduction at 600C for 022h was also analysed by EXAFS (see fitting details for the Pt-edge EXAFS results in Supplementary Fig. 10). As shown in Table 1, the PtPt coordi- nation number remains unchanged at around 67 for all reduction times. We note that a small fraction of larger particles coexist with the very small clusters in all these samples, leading to an average EXAFS coordination number slightly larger than that one would expect for Pt clusters of 0.50.6nm. However, the vast majority of Pt ensembles observed by electron microscopy have a size below
0.6nm and remain stable regardless of the reduction time at 600C.
Analysis of the STEM-iDPC (combination of HR-HAADF-STEM and iDPC) images indicates that the Pt clusters in these reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples are in the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless of the H2 reduction time at 600C (Fig. 1et and Supplementary Figs. 1116) The nature of the Sn species and their coordination environ- ments in the K-PtSn@MFI samples were also studied by Sn K-edge
XAS. Sn is inferred to be Sn(iv) in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air
sample, as indicated by the pronounced white line in the XANES spectra (Fig. 2c). Analysis of the EXAFS region (Fig. 2d, Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 17) shows the virtual lack of heavy backscatter- ing in this sample (for example, the absence of SnOSn ensembles,which are observed in the bulk SnO2 standard), which indicates that Sn is atomically dispersed inside the MFI. Furthermore, the 31P magic-angle-spinning NMR data for trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) adsorbed on Sn species within Pt-free K-Sn-MFI (pre- pared by the same procedure as the K-PtSn@MFI sample but with- out the addition of the Pt precursor) show resonances below 50ppm (Supplementary Fig. 18), which indicates that the vast majority of the Sn species are present as extra-framework species in the unre- duced catalyst rather than as framework Sn species, for which 31P resonances at 5060 ppm would be observed20.
After treatment with H2 at 600C, the Sn(iv) species are reduced to Sn species with an average of approximately three SnO bonds,according to the EXAFS data (Table 1), and a white line intensity that matches that of Sn(ii) in a bulk SnO standard.

Nature Catalysis  www.nature.com/natcatal Articles Nature Catalysis labile oxygen in the unreduced K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample reacts with H2 to form Sn(ii) species covalently bonded to oxygen atoms in the support. The 31P NMR spectrum of adsorbed TMPO confirms this observation, as new bands at 5060ppm grow in the presence of H2 that can be attributed to coordinatively unsaturated SnO2x that have adsorbed TMPO and exhibit a 31P NMR signal in the same region as framework-type Sn species (Supplementary Fig. 18)20.
Within the sensitivity limits of XANES, the chemical states of Sn remain unchanged when the reduction time at 600C is extended from 0 to 22h. Fitting of the EXAFS spectra also shows almost the same SnO coordination number regardless of the reduction time (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 17). However, and interestingly,we observed drastic changes in the catalytic performance for pro- pane dehydrogenation as a function of reduction time (vide infra),which indicates some structural changes on prolonged exposure to
H2. The fraction of Sn responsible for tuning the Pt catalytic proper-
ties appears to be too small to detect using an averaging technique such as EXAFS, in which SnO contributions clearly dominate (see Supplementary Discussion).
In summary, neither the Pt LIII-edge nor the Sn K-edge EXAFS spectra show evidence of any kind of bimetallic interactions in this series of samples, in contrast to literature reports in which the two metals form well-established alloys2123. Nevertheless, the presence of Sn in these catalysts has a strong effect on the catalytic proper- ties of Pt, which will be discussed later in this report. Interestingly,these properties can be controlled by varying the reduction time,following a change in structure that is too subtle to be detected
by EXAFS24.
Direct measurement of PtSn clusters by quasi in situ TEM. To avoid the oxidation of PtSn clusters in air, TEM experiments were carried out using a vacuum transfer TEM holder when trans- ferring the reduced sample into the microscope (see details in Supplementary Fig. 19)25,26. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 2023,
these quasi in situ TEM experiments revealed well-distributed subnanometric Pt clusters that are located in the 10R sinusoidal channels, according to the STEM-iDPC images (Supplementary
Figs. 2431). Due to the very small size of the PtSn clusters and the relatively low stability of the zeolite support under the elec- tron beam, it was extremely difficult to obtain information on the distribution of Pt and Sn by conventional X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, although this technique has been used to provide information on other bimetallic nanoparticles27,28. To quantitatively describe the spatial distribution of subnanometric Pt and Sn in the various K-PtSn@MFI samples, the HR-HAADF-STEM images were analysed by a modified K-means clustering method (an unsuper- vised machine learning algorithm for signal processing, as explained in Supplementary Figs. 32 and 33)17. As can be seen in Fig. 3, only Pt and Sn species that can be identified by the K-means cluster- ing analysis based on the different Z contrast of Pt and Sn species in the HR-HAADF-STEM image can be considered. We should note that only small Sn clusters adjacent to small Pt clusters can be detected by this analysis method because of the lack of sensitivity to locate single Sn atoms, as discussed in our previous work17. As shown in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 3437, we have found that as the reduction time increases, the percentage of bimetallic PtSn clusters in the K-PtSn@MFI sample also increases, reaching >40% in both the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2- 22h samples. We note that this analysis is only semi-quantitative as HAADF-STEM does not provide sufficient Z contrast to detect iso- lated Sn atoms that may be contacting the Pt clusters and also part of the three-dimensional information on the zeolite is lost in the two-dimensional image processing. However, our K-means cluster- ing analysis identifies a gradually greater contact between Pt and Sn on increasing the reduction time. Independent observations of the Pt performance in CO chemisorption and propane dehydrogena- tion experiments suggest that the number of Pt clusters that contain Sn is actually much greater than 40% at the longest reduction times Table 1  Fitting results for the Pt LIII-edge and Sn K-edge EXAFS data for the various reduced K-PtSn@MFI catalysts Sample NPtPt RPtPt (Å) σ2 (Å2) ΔE0 (eV) Rfactor Pt foila 12

Nature Catalysis  www.nature.com/natcatal Articles Nature Catalysis (vide infra). Considering the size of the metal clusters confined in the sinusoidal channels of MFI (Fig. 1), the lack of PtSn interac- tions detectable by EXAFS and the clear presence of SnO and PtPt bonds (Table 1), we speculate that a representative reduced bimetallic PtSn cluster in this sample comprises a Pt core of 810 atoms and a few Sn atoms that make direct contact with the oxygen
atoms of the support. Nevertheless, a notable fraction of the Sn seems to exist as partially reduced SnO2x clusters that do not directly interact with the Pt, appearing as strong SnO signals in the EXAFS spectra.
For comparison, we also carried out the same K-means cluster- ing analysis on the HR-HAADF-STEM images of samples that were exposed to atmospheric air after H2 treatment and prior to introduc- tion into the microscope (see Fig. 3eh). When the reduced samples were exposed to atmospheric air, the number of Sn in close prox- imity to Pt decayed markedly (Fig. 4). At very low reduction times (K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h), the percentage of Pt clusters interacting with Sn is very low (15%). That value initially increases to 27% and then decreases to 20% as the reduction time is prolonged for the next 22h (Supplementary Figs. 3843). We infer that the two metals segregate as the oxophilic Sn is mobilized on contact with air, as has been widely reported for bimetallic nanoparticles in the literature2931.
As noted above, the K-means clustering analysis is based on two-dimensional projection images, whereas the K-PtSn@MFI zeolite is a three-dimensional material. Moreover, the complicated structure of K-PtSn@MFI also makes it difficult to distinguish the Pt and Sn species, which has already been explained in our pre- vious work17. Despite the artifacts that may be introduced by the above factors, the percentages of PtSn contacts in K-PtSn@MFI samples measured under quasi in situ conditions are clearly higher than the values obtained in the corresponding ex situ experiments,confirming the influence of the reduction on the spatial relationship between Pt and Sn species, and stressing the need to protect the reduced sample from air to obtain reliable results.
Subnanometric Pt clusters seem to show a higher probability of interacting with subnanometric Sn species during long reduction times. Such a characteristic indicates that Pt clusters are probably reduced first by H2, consistent with previous work showing full Pt reduction at <200C (ref. 14), followed by reduction of the Sn(iv) species and subsequent migration to meet the Pt clusters, which is also consistent with the time-resolved Pt LIII-edge and Sn K-edge XANES spectra of the pristine K-PtSn@MFI in H2 reported here (Supplementary Figs. 44 and 45).Characterization of PtSn clusters by CO adsorption.

As shown in Fig. 5a, the bimetallic K-PtSn@MFI samples show a band at 1,887cm1 that the monometallic K-Pt@MFI does not. This band is slightly blue-shifted relative to that observed in the K-Sn@MFI sample, which can be attributed to CO adsorbed on PtSnOx sites.Interestingly, the contribution of this band decreases on increasing the pre-reduction time, as reduction of Sn(iv) species occurs. The Sn-edge XANES and EXAFS spectra show, in contrast, that the Sn species exist as highly dispersed SnOx and that the averaged oxida- tion state of the Sn species in the whole sample is close to Sn(ii),regardless of the reduction time (Fig. 2 and Table 1). We believe that the reduced Sn species in contact with Pt clusters represent a frac- tion of the total Sn species in the whole material, which is too small to be captured by an averaging technique such as EXAFS24.The formation of interactions between Pt clusters and partially reduced Sn species during the H2 treatment is also reflected in the changes in the CO absorption bands in the range 1,8501,650cm1.The CO bands in this range should be associated with the CO adsorbed on the metal clusters3234. The positions of the bands are related to the electronic structures of the metal clusters, which are controlled by their chemical composition, size and geometric structure. Therefore, it is difficult to assign the absorption band to a specific type of species. Nevertheless, we can still see some trends in the changes in the spectra caused by the pre-treatment with H2. The μ3-absorption band of CO on Pt clusters (1,690cm1) can be observed in both K-Pt@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-1h,and decreases drastically after 3h of reduction treatment. On the other hand, the band at 1,659cm1 increases in the K-PtSn@MFI- 600H2-3h spectrum compared with in the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-1h spectrum. These changes indicate the modulation of the electronic structures of the Pt clusters during the H2 treatment, which may be related to the interaction between Pt and Sn species.Nevertheless, the formation of PtSn nanoparticles is confirmed by the decrease in the CO-IR band at 2,018cm1 in the K-PtSn@ MFI samples on increasing the reduction time from 1 to 3h. The contribution of this band, which corresponds to CO adsorbed on highly under-coordinated Pt sites of nanoparticles35, decreases notably when the K-PtSn@MFI sample is reduced for 3h at 600C by H2, as more Sn adds to the cluster and inhibits the adsorption of CO on the adjacent Pt atoms3638. However, we did not observe
PtSn bonding by EXAFS, indicating that the fraction of PtSn nanoparticles in the whole sample is low, consistent with the
fact that the vast majority of Pt atoms retain their original PtPt coordination (Table 1).
The formation of Pt clusters interacting with partially reduced Sn species in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples can also be inferred from the CO chemisorption results. As displayed in Fig. 5b, the apparent Pt dispersion decreases with reduction time, especially from 0 to 6h. Because the size of the Pt clusters remains almost unchanged according to the STEM and EXAFS data, the decrease in exposed surface Pt should be caused by the formation of
PtSn interactions in a scenario in which partially reduced Sn
species interact with the external surface of the Pt clusters. Again,we note that the number of Sn atoms interacting with the Pt clusters
must be low, which causes the absence of a PtSn contribution
in the EXAFS spectra and a Pt dispersion of 30% in the K-PtSn@ MFI-600H2-22h sample39,40.
According to all the spectroscopic results discussed above (Sn-edge XANES and EXAFS, CO-IR), it can be concluded that pre-reduction treatment induces the reduction of Sn(iv) species in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI sample and that the reduced Sn spe- cies can interact with subnanometric Pt clusters. A schematic of the structural evolution of the Pt and Sn species starting from the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample is presented in Fig. 6, in which we postulate that the reduction of Pt single atoms to Pt clusters, the reduction of atomically dispersed Sn(iv) to reduced Sn species and the formation of PtSn bimetallic clusters occur stepwise with a final PtSn cluster structure consisting of a few Pt atoms (we deduce less than 15 based on microscopy results) and a few Sn atoms (for exam- ple, 23) coordinated to the external surface, probably through PtOSn bonding. We note that the geometric and electronic
features of these PtSn bimetallic clusters are not common to most conventional PtSn bimetallic catalysts41,42.
Catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. To demon- strate the implications of the structural changes occurring during H2 reduction, we tested various K-PtSn@MFI samples as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. For this study, we used a short con- tact time to achieve conversions below the thermodynamic equi- librium (70%), to better study the influence of the pre-reduction treatment. The catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI after differ- ent pre-reduction treatments is shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen in
Fig. 7a,after a short pre-reduction treatment (K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample), the initial conversion was 50% (the thermodynamic

The CO-IR spectra were recorded at room temperature. The intensity on the y axis indicates the actual absorbance, which was normalized according to the mass of the solid sample used in the IR measurement. b, The dispersion of Pt in K-PtSn@MFI samples after different pre-reduction treatments by H2 at 600C.

Nature Catalysis  www.nature.com/natcatal Articles Nature Catalysis conversion from propane to propylene and H2 is 70% at a theo- retical 100% propylene selectivity) and the selectivity to propylene was 82%, giving 18% hydrogenolysis products (methane, eth- ane and ethylene) and a very small amount of aromatics. A fast decay of the activity was observed over 15h of time on stream,caused by the blockage of the Pt sites by coke. When the starting K-PtSn@MFI sample was kept in H2 at 600C for 1h before the propane dehydrogenation reaction (using the activation conditions of our previous work17; see Fig. 7b), then the initial activity for the dehydrogenation decreased slightly, whereas the selectivity to pro- pylene increased to 93%. More importantly, the deactivation rate was lower than that of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample. When the pre-reduction time at 600C was further increased to 3, 6 and 12h (Fig. 7ce), the initial conversion of propane remained almost unchanged, whereas the deactivation of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst was markedly suppressed. Coke preferentially forms on unselective Pt sites and therefore the K-PtSn@MFI sample with higher initial selectivity also exhibits slower deactivation43. The slower deacti- vation is associated with the reductive atmosphere, because ther- mal treatment in N2 at 600 C does not alleviate the deactivation (Supplementary Fig. 46). However, when the K-PtSn@MFI sample was pre-reduced with H2 for a longer time of 22h (see Fig. 7f), a slight decrease in the initial activity was observed, but high initial selectivity and very slow deactivation were achieved. Note that no H2 was introduced into the feed gas in any of the above catalytic tests. Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion44,45.
As can be seen in Fig. 7g,h, the initial activity on a per mol Pt basis is almost the same, regardless of the pre-reduction treatments from 0 to 22h, whereas the deactivation constant varies drastically.
This result is remarkable, because the number of Pt sites and their reactivity must remain high while Sn is incorporated to (selectively) modulate the Pt reactivity to avoid hydrogenolysis and coke forma- tion reactions. In this sense, the microscopy and EXAFS analyses confirmed not only that the K-PtSn@MFI samples remain ultra- dispersed after the various thermal treatments, but also that the incorporation of Sn at the longest reduction times is just enough to greatly inhibit the deactivation by coke without compromising the dehydrogenation catalytic activity.
To further confirm the role of Sn, we studied the influence of Sn loading in the K-PtSn@MFI sample on the catalytic performance (see Supplementary Figs. 4751 and Supplementary Discussion).
The sample with lowest Sn loading gave lower initial selectiv- ity to propylene and faster deactivation, which can be associated with fewer PtSn contacts in the sample, whereas in the sample with highest Sn loading, PtSn alloy nanoparticles (>2nm) were formed due to the presence of plenty of defects in the MFI zeolite crystallites, and this sintering of Pt species resulted in a decrease in activity. These results confirm the critical role of Sn in improving the selectivity to propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation.
Furthermore, the results clearly show that the formation of bime- tallic PtSn clusters is much more favourable when Pt and Sn are confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite.
The K-PtSn@MFI samples were also characterized after the
propane dehydrogenation tests by STEM. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 5257, no sintering of the Pt clusters into larger particles was observed in any of the samples after propane dehydrogenation, and the location of PtSn clusters in the 10R sinu- soidal channels is also preserved, further confirming their high stability (Supplementary Figs. 5861). Furthermore, as shown in Supplementary Figs. 62 and 63, the high initial activity, very slow deactivation and size of the subnanometric PtSn clusters were pre- served for three reaction cycles.
The good performance of the Pt species confined in the 10R channels of MFI zeolite is also reflected by comparison of the initial reactivity for propane dehydrogenation with results reported in the literature. We have summarized the catalyst activation conditions

Fig. 6  Structural evolution of K-PtSn@MFI during reduction with H2. a, In the pristine K-PtSn@MFI sample, both Pt and Sn(iv) exist as atomically dispersed species in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite. b, After reduction by H2 at 400C, Pt single atoms will be reduced and form subnanometric Pt clusters. whereas only a few of the Sn(iv) species will be reduced. c, When the temperature is increased to 600C, most of the Sn(iv) species are reduced to Sn(ii), but these reduced Sn species mainly remain separated from the Pt clusters. d, After being kept in a flow of H2 for a long time (12h), some of the reduced Sn species migrate towards the Pt clusters and bimetallic PtSn clusters with reduced Sn species interacting with the external surface of Pt clusters are formed in the sinusoidal 10R channels of the MFI zeolite. It should be noted that, due to the complexity of the structures of the PtSn clusters, the models proposed in this Figure could be over simplified. PtSn clusters with different structures could exist in the working catalyst, as indicated by the CO-IR spectra.

Reaction conditions: 5mlmin1 propane, 16.5mlmin1 N2, 600C, 20mg K-PtSn@ MFI-600H2 catalyst. The catalyst was reduced in a flow of H2 of 35mlmin1 at 600C for different times before the dehydrogenation reaction tests. a, Activity and selectivity of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The catalyst was reduced by H2 from room temperature up to 600C with a ramp rate of 10Cmin1. Once the temperature reached 600C, the atmosphere was switched to the propane dehydrogenation feed gases. bf, Activity and selectivity of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2 catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation reaction following pre-reduction for the given time: K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-1h (b), K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-3h (c), K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-6h (d), K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h (e) and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h (f). For the samples shown in bf, the catalyst was reduced by H2 from room temperature up to 600C with a ramp rate of 10Cmin1 and then kept at 600C for the given time. All the initial activity values are below that corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for propylene yield, which is close to 70% (assuming 100% selectivity to propylene). Analyses were carried out on an on-line GC with an automated sample injector, with an error within 3% for each data point. g, Initial specific activity for the production of propylene with the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst after different pre-reduction treatments at 600C.
The specific activities were calculated using the initial activities shown in af. h, Deactivation constants for the various K-PtSn@MFI catalysts during the propane dehydrogenation reaction at 600C. These values were calculated on the basis of the data presented in af according to the following formula:ln[(1Xfinal)/Xfinal]=kd×T+ln[(1Xintial)/Xintial], where Xfinal and Xinitial are the final and initial propane conversions, respectively, T is the lifetime of the catalyst measured in the catalytic test and kd is the deactivation constant. The error bars were determined on the basis of three independent catalytic tests performed under the given conditions. The errors in the initial specific activities and deactivation constants are within 6 and 12%, respectively, for all the samples.
Nature Catalysis  www.nature.com/natcatal Articles Nature Catalysis and catalytic performances of supported Pt catalysts reported in the recent literature (see Supplementary Table 1); the initial activ- ity of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h sample on a per mol Pt basis is amongst the highest, at the same time that the deactivation rate is amongst the lowest. Compared with our previous work (catalyst activated by reduction for 1h at 600C in H2)17, the optimized acti- vation conditions developed in the current work lead to a sevenfold decrease in the deactivation constant.
On the basis of the above results, it can be deduced that a long reduction treatment at 600C is necessary to form subnanometric Pt clusters modified with partially reduced SnOx species that show high activity, selectivity and stability for propane dehydrogenation.
In additional experiments, we observed that a shorter pre-reduction treatment (1h) of the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample at higher tempera- ture (700C) also resulted in subnanometric PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels (Supplementary Fig. 64) that showed similar high selectivity and a very low deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 65).
The amount of coke in the K-PtSn@MFI samples after the propane dehydrogenation reaction was analysed by thermo- gravimetrydifferential scanning calorimetry. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 6671, the amount of coke in all the samples remained below 1wt%, but no correlation between stability and the amount of deposited coke was found. The coke in the used catalysts was also studied by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 72, the ratio of the D and G bands ranges from 0.45 to 0.5 for all the samples, exhibiting only minor differ- ences (see Supplementary Table 2). Therefore, it can be concluded that the amount of coke and its physicochemical properties seem to be similar for all the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2 samples after dif- ferent pre-reduction times. From a structural point of view, the PtSn clusters are mainly located in the sinusoidal channels. Even though coke formation is associated with catalytic events occur- ring at the metal surface, the resulting carbonaceous species seem not to remain directly blocking the active sites. The extended life- times of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2- 22h samples could be associated with much less deposition of coke on the PtSn clusters, leading to lower deactivation rates46.
Because the deposition of coke on Pt-based catalysts for the pro- pane dehydrogenation reaction is related to the chemical com- position of the bimetallic PtM particles47, the results presented indicate that a minimal interaction between the two metals is suf- ficient to suppress most of the coke formation, provided that the active species remain small (in the subnanometric regime) during the lifetime of the catalyst .
Finally, to show the potential of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst acti- vated under the optimized conditions, we tested the catalytic perfor- mance of K-PtSn@MFI under more industrially relevant conditions (for example, no N2 dilution) for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. As presented in Supplementary Fig. 73, the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst showed an initial propane conversion of 20% at 550C,and a high initial selectivity to propylene (>97%) under a high weight hourly space velocity of 118h1. After nearly 70h of time on stream, the propane conversion decreased very slowly from 20 to 17%, demonstrating the outstanding performance of the K-PtSn@ MFI catalyst in this reaction.
Conclusions The geometric and electronic structures of subnanometric bimetal- lic clusters in confined space may be different from the correspond- ing nanoparticles supported on open-structure carriers, which can lead to unique reactivity. Combining multiple in situ characteriza- tion techniques (both averaging techniques such as EXAFS and site-specific techniques such as IR and TEM) is critical to elucidat- ing the nature of the active sites in supported catalysts containing isolated atoms and/or clusters48.
Methods One-pot synthesis of the K-PtSn@MFI sample. First, a tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) solution was prepared by mixing 5.0g K-free TPAOH solution (40wt%, Alfa-Aesar without K), 6.24g TPAOH (20wt%, Sigma-Aldrich,containing 0.6wt% of K) and 17.0g distilled water at room temperature. Then,
8.24g tetraethyl orthosilicate was hydrolysed with the TPAOH solution at room
temperature for 6h under stirring (500r.p.m.). The resultant solution was divided into two parts with the same weight. To each portion of solution, 80μl aqueous H2[PtCl6] (0.38moll1), 50mg SnCl4·5H2O and 150μl ethylenediamine were added to the above solution and the mixture stirred for 20min. The resultant yellow solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated in an electric oven at 175C for 96h under static conditions. The amounts of Pt, Sn and K in the final product were 0.4, 0.9 and 0.6wt%, respectively. After the hydrothermal process, the solid product was isolated by filtration, washed with distilled water and acetone, and dried at 60C. Then, the solid sample was calcined under a flow of air at 560C for 8h and then at 600C for 2h.
Characterization. Powder X-ray diffraction was performed with a HTPhilips XPert MPD diffractometer equipped with a PW3050 goniometer using Cu Kα radiation and a multisampling handler.
Samples for electron microscopy studies were prepared by dropping a suspension of the solid sample in CH2Cl2 directly onto holey carbon-coated copper grids. Electron microscopy measurements were performed using two types of microscopes. Thus, a non-corrected JEOL 2100F microscope operating at 200kV both in transmission (TEM) and scanning transmission modes (STEM) was used to record the HAADF Z-contrast images at low resolution. HR-HAADF-STEM and iDPC imaging were performed on a double aberration-corrected, monochromated FEI Titan3 Themis 60300 microscope operating at 300kV. The latter technique provides atomically resolved images in which the contrasts are related to the atomic number of the elements under the beam instead of the roughly Z2-dependent contrasts obtained in the HAADF-STEM images. By using a four-segment detector,this technique allows imaging of light elements, such as O, in the presence of heavier ones (Si, Z=14) under very low electron dose conditions, which is a key aspect of the atomic-scale structural analysis of zeolites, which are very sensitive to electron beams. In particular, 2,048×2,048 STEM-iDPC image pairs were recorded simultaneously using a convergence angle of 18.6mrad and a camera length of 91mm. This configuration allowed us to optimize the collection of signals on the HAADF and FEI DF4 detectors. To limit the damage by the electron beam, a fast image recording protocol was used by combining a beam current of 1030pA, a
1.252.5μs dwell time and an automated fine-tuning alignment of A1 and C1 using
the OptiSTEM software. To obtain images of good quality, the beam current and image acquisition time should be optimized according to the stability of the sample under the beam.
For the quasi in situ TEM studies of the K-PtSn@MFI samples, a pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air powder sample was reduced in a flow of H2 at 600C for a given time (122h), and then the reactor for reduction treatment was closed and transferred to a glove box. The grid for TEM measurements was prepared in the glove box to protect samples from oxidation by air. After sample preparation, the TEM grid was sealed in the vacuum transfer TEM holder and then transferred to the electron microscope for STEM-iDPC measurements.
To determine the spatial distribution of the metallic species within the zeolite framework, a specific methodology for the digital analysis of the experimental images was developed and coded in a home-made Matlab script. First, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, the HR-HAADF-STEM images were de-noised by combining the Anscombe transform and undecimated wavelet transforms (UWVT)49. Then, a user-independent, fully automated segmentation of image contrasts by clustering techniques (K-means method) was applied to recognize and classify the metallic entities, which is a requirement to guarantee statistically meaningful and unbiased results.
To support the K-means clustering analysis and interpret the details of the experimental images, the HR-HAADF-STEM images were simulated using the TEMSIM software50. The complex structural models used as input in these simulations were built using the Rhodius software developed at Universidad de Cadiz51. To approach as close as possible the experimental imaging conditions, a mixture of Poisson and white Gaussian noise was added to the simulated images.
Then, the same methodology used to analyse the experimental images was applied to the deliberately noise-corrupted simulated images.
XAS experiments at the Pt LIII (11,564eV) and Sn K (29,200eV) edges were performed in the ALBA synchrotron52. The beam was monochromatized using Si(111) and Si(311) double crystals, respectively; harmonic rejection was performed using rhodium-coated silicon mirrors. The spectra were collected in transmission (Pt LIII-edge) and fluorescence (Sn K-edge) modes using ionization chambers filled with the appropriate gases (Pt LIII-edge: 95% N2+5% Kr for I0 and
17.1% N2+82.9% Kr for I1; Sn K-edge: 89.4% N2+10.6% Kr for I0 and 100% Kr for
I1) and a fluorescence solid-state detector. Samples in the form of self-supported pellets of optimized thickness were positioned inside an in-house built multipurpose cell described by Guilera et al., allowing in situ experiments53. Several scans were acquired at each measurement step to ensure spectral reproducibility and good signal-to-noise ratio. Data reduction and extraction of the χ(k) function Nature Catalysis  www.nature.com/natcatal Articles Nature Catalysis were performed using the ATHENA code. EXAFS data analysis was performed using the ARTEMIS software54. The phase and amplitudes were calculated using the FEFF6 code. The values of E0 (inflection point in the first derivative of the XANES spectra) used for data alignment taken from the literature are as follows:29,200eV for Sn metal, 29,201eV for SnO, 29,204eV for SnO2 and 11,564eV for Pt metal.
The IR spectra of adsorbed CO on Ptzeolite and Snzeolite samples were recorded at room temperature with a Nexus 8700 FTIR spectrometer using a deuterated-triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector at 4cm1 resolution. The K-PtSn@ MFI samples were reduced at 600C in an oven for different times and then transferred to an IR cell connected to a vacuum system with a gas dosing facility,allowing in situ treatments in controlled atmospheres at temperatures from 25 to 500C . For the IR studies, the samples were pressed into self-supported wafers and pre-treated in a flow of H2 at 450C for 2h, followed by vacuum treatment (105mbar). After activation, the samples were cooled to 25C under dynamic vacuum conditions, followed by CO dosing at increasing pressure (0.48.5mbar).
IR spectra were recorded after each dosage of CO. The dispersion of Pt in K-PtSn@ MFI samples was estimated from CO adsorption using the double isotherm method on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1C instrument55,56. Prior to adsorption,the samples (200300mg) were reduced in situ in a flow of pure H2 (25mlmin1) at 600C for a given time. After the reduction treatment, the samples were degassed at 1.33Pa for 2h at 600C and then cooled to 40C. Then pure CO was admitted and the first adsorption isotherm (that is, the total CO uptake) was measured. After evacuation at 25C, the second isotherm (that is, the reversible CO uptake) was measured. The amount of chemisorbed CO was then obtained by subtracting the two isotherms. The pressure range studied was (0.511)×104Pa.
The dispersion of Pt (D) was calculated from the amount of irreversibly adsorbed CO, assuming a stoichiometry of Pt/CO=1. The mean particle size (d) of Pt was determined from the chemisorption data, assuming a spherical geometry for the metal particle according to the procedure. Equations (1)(3) were used to calculate the dispersion of Pt:
D %
Nm  Fs  M  104=L 1 where Nm is the chemisorption uptake, expressed in mol CO per gram sample, Fs is the adsorption stoichiometry, which is 1 in our measurement, M is the molecular mass of the supported metal (Pt) and L is the loading of the supported metal. d  6  L= Sa  Z  100
2 where d is the mean particle size, Z is the density of the supported metal (Pt) and Sa is the active surface area (m2 per gram metal), calculated from equation (3): Sa  Nm  Fs  Am  Na 3 where Am is the cross-sectional area occupied by each active surface Pt atom and Na is Avogadros constant.
Trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO, Alfa Aesar) was adsorbed on the different catalysts as probe molecules by deposition in dichloromethane solution to study the coordination environment of Sn species by NMR spectroscopy. First, all the catalysts were degassed for 4h under dynamic vacuum at 573K to remove any adsorbed water molecules. They were then transferred to a glove box to prevent any exposure to moisture, which could interact with the metal sites in the catalysts or with TMPO molecules. A solution of 0.02wt% TMPO was prepared with anhydrous dichloromethane in a glove box. Then, 0.3g of this solution was added to each catalyst (75mg) in a vial and the samples were left to stir overnight. Dichloromethane was fully removed by heating at 353K for 6h.
Samples dosed with TMPO were packed under an inert atmosphere into zirconia magic-angle-spinning NMR rotors with gas-tight caps for analysis. The metal and phosphorus contents were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy analysis to determine the TMPO/M ratio.
Catalytic studies of K-PtSn@MFI for propane dehydrogenation reactions.
The reactions were performed in a fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure using N2/propane as feed gas at 600C. The products were analysed by GC, which can detect cracking products (methane, ethene and ethane), propylene, C4 and C5 compounds, and aromatics. Before the reactions, the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst was reduced in a flow of H2 (35mlmin1) at 600C for a given time with a ramp rate of 10Cmin1 from room temperature up to 600C. After reduction pre-treatment,the atmosphere was changed to the reaction feed gas (5mlmin1 propane and 16mlmin1 N2 as balance gas). The analysis was carried out on an on-line GC with an automated sample injector, which gave an error within 3% for each data point.
