WaghmareTinku BaidyaM. S. HegdeK. R. PriolkarP. R. Sarode View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract We determine chemical origins of increase in the reducibility of CeO2 upon Ti substitution using a combination of experiments and first-principles density functional theory calculations. Ce1-xTixO2 (x = 0.00.4) prepared by a single step solution combustion method crystallizes in a cubic fluorite structure, confirmed by Rietveld profile analysis. Ce1-xTixO2 can be reduced by hydrogen to a larger extent compared to CeO2 or TiO2. Temperature programmed reduction of CeO2, TiO2, Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 and Ce0.6Ti0.4O2 up to 700 C in H2 gave CeO1.96, TiO1.92, Ce0.75Ti0.25O1.81, and Ce0.6Ti0.4O1.73, respectively. An extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) study of mixed oxides at the Ti K-egde showed that the local coordination of Ti is 4:4, with TiO distances of 1.9 and 2.5 Å, respectively, which are also confirmed by our first-principles calculations. Bond valence analysis of the microscopic structure and energetics determined from first principles is used to evaluate the strength of binding of different oxygen atoms and vacancies. We find the presence of strongly and weakly bound oxygens in Ce1-xTixO2, of which the latter are responsible for the higher oxygen storage capacity in the mixed oxides than in pure CeO2.

Synopsis Even though Ce1-xTixO2 (0  x  0.4) crystallizes in the cubic fluorite structure, oxygen coordination around Ce/Ti is 4 + 4 instead of 8, leading to short and long Ce/TiO bonds. The longer bonds lead to weaker oxygens than in CeO2, which are more easily reducible by H2. Thus, Ce1-xTixO2 has a higher OSC than CeO2.
1. Introduction
The amount of oxygen that can be released under reducing conditions and can be taken up under oxidizing condition is called the oxygen storage capacity (OSC). 1,2 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) by H2 is generally employed to estimate the OSC. The mechanism of the CeO2Ce2O3 transition associated with oxygen vacancy formation was explained on the basis of first-principles calculations as a possible reason behind the high OSC of ceria. 3 Even though ZrO2 cannot be reduced by CO or H2, OSC was enhanced in the Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solution. 4-6 This means, in the solid solution, Ce can be reduced much more easily compared to pure CeO2. CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 are essential components of the oxide support in auto-exhaust catalysis, and, therefore, there exist several reports to explain higher OSC in Ce1-xZrxO2 compared to CeO2. 7-11 A common observation is that the X-ray diffraction (XRD) lines of Ce1-xZrxO2 are much broader in the solid solution. This is generally attributed to the decrease in size of crystallites, and, therefore, higher OSC was attributed to a larger surface area of Ce1-xZrxO2. It is also possible that the local coordination around Zr in Ce1-xZrxO2 is different from the ideal eightfold coordination of Ce in CeO2, which can lead to broadening of X-ray lines. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies have revealed 4 + 4 coordination for Zr in Ce1-xZrxO2. 12,13 Recently, we have done first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to show 4 + 4 coordination for both Ce and Zr, and because of this, two kinds of oxygens, strongly and weakly bound to the metal ions, which are generated upon Zr ion substitution in CeO2. 14 Atomistic and first-principles calculations have been valuable in studies of ceria and its surfaces 15 and interaction with hydrogen. 16 The role of oxygen vacancies on ceria surfaces in the oxidation of carbon monoxide has been studied. 17 Higher OSC or increased reducibility of CeO2 in the CeO2TiO2 solid solution has not been studied in detail. Ti4+ ions in principle can be substituted for Ce4+ ions forming Ce1-xTixO2. Here, both Ce4+ and Ti4+ ions can be reduced to +3 states, so reducibility of the solid solution or OSC should be higher compared to CeO2 or TiO2. The Ti4+ ion substitution in CeO2 has been shown recently. 18 Here we report synthesis of Ce1-xTixO2 by the solution combustion method, H2/TPR and a first-principles structural study of solid solutions. The theoretically determined structure of Ce1-xTixO2 is compared with the results of EXAFS. We show that the oxygen sublattice is significantly distorted, leading to destabilization of oxide ions in terms of long CeO and TiO and short CeO and TiO bonds; the oxide ions with longer bond distances are weakly bound, which can be utilized for CO oxidation.
2. Methods
2.1. Experiment. Ce1-xTixO2 has been prepared by a solution combustion method. Stoichiometric amounts of ceric ammonium nitrate, titanyl nitrate, and glycine were taken in a glass vessel; the salts were dissolved into solution by adding the minimum amount of water. The solution was heated rapidly at 350 C. At the point of complete water evaporation, the material ignites into a flame reaching a temperature of above 900 C. After the combustion is complete, the sample cools to 350 C in about 1 min. The product was a fine powder of Ce1-xTixO2, which was analyzed for all the measurements. Pure TiO2 (anatase) has been prepared by the combustion of TiO(NO3)2 with glycine. 19 OSC (hydrogen uptake) was measured by TPR with 5% H2 in Ar from 30 to 700 C at a heating rate of 3/min. The volume of H2 taken up for reduction is calibrated against that of CuO. The chemical reactions for the formation of CeO2 and Ce1-xTixO2 can be written as follows:
EXAFS was measured at the Ti K and Ce L3 edges in transmission mode at the EXAFS-1 Beamline at Elettra Synchrotron Source using Si(111) as the monochromator. The incident and transmitted flux was measured using ionization chambers filled with a mixture of N2 and He in different ratios. For the measurements, absorbers were prepared by sprinkling finely ground powder on scotch tape and stacking about 10 such sheets together. The amount of sample was calculated such that total absorption coefficient (μx) after the edge was around than 2.5. The energy was calibrated with respect to Cu K edge in Cu metal. Data analysis was done using the open source IFEFFIT analysis package developed by Matt Newville at the University of Chicago.
2.2. Theory. Our total energy calculations are based on DFT with a local density approximation (LDA) of the exchange correlation energy of electrons. While the LDA+U type of corrections are known to be important in the reduced form of ceria,20 we are mainly interested in the atomic structure which is expected to be less sensitive to these corrections. Compounds based on ceria, which involve a mixed valence of cerium, exhibit a large number of competing local minima of electronic total energy. As the energy differences between the states are small, the ground state can be difficult to access.20 The addition of the U term to the LDA energy functional facilitates access to the physical ground state by enhancing its stability. Physical results, however, were found to be insensitive to the value of the U parameter.20 In fact, the LDA results have been found to be better than generalized gradient approximation results by Fabris et al.20 Interaction between valence electrons and ionic cores is treated using first-principles ultrasoft pseudopotentials. 21 Single particle wave functions (density) were represented on a plane wave basis with an energy cutoff of 30 Ry (150 Ry). Semicore states of Ce and Ti are included in the valence. We have not considered spin polarization in our calculation. The orbitals included in the pseudopotentials are Ti 3s, 3p, 4s, and 3d; Ce 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s; and O 2s and 2p. We use PWSCF 22 implementation of DFT for these calculations. Ti substitution in CeO2 is treated using periodic supercells of up to eight formula units of CeO2 with Ce atoms replaced with Ti according to different concentrations of Ti substitution. Internal structure in each case was optimized to minimize the total energy using the Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno-based method. 23
Integrals over the Brillouin zone were sampled on a 4 × 4 × 4 k-point MonkhorstPack 24 mesh for pure CeO2 and Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 which were simulated with a cubic unit cell with four formula units of MO2 (M = metal ion). For Ce0.875Ti0.125O2, we used a tetragonal supercell (doubled in the ab plane, c/a = 0.71) with eight formula units, and the Brillouin zone was sampled on a 3 × 3 × 4 MonkhorstPack24 k-point mesh. For pure TiO2 in the rutile phase, we used a tetragonal unit cell with c/a = 0.64 with two formula units, and the Brillouin zone was sampled with a 4 × 4 × 6 MonkhorstPack24 mesh.
Bond lengths determined from the optimized structures are used to calculate valencies of metal ions following the bond valence method. 25 Bond valence s is defined as (a) s = (R/R0)-N (for TiO bonds) and (b) s = exp[(R  R0)/B] (for CeO bonds), where R is the bond length, R0 is the length of a bond of unit valence, and N and B are fitted parameters. For CeO bonds, = R0(aLDA/aexp). For TiO bonds, = R0(v1/3LDA/v1/3exp), where v is the volume of a unit cell. The atomic valence V is obtained by summing the bond valencies associated with a particular ion given by V = Σisi.
3. Results
XRD patterns of Ce1-xTixO2 (given in Figure 1a for x = 0.0, 0.25, and 0.4) show that oxides crystallize in the fluorite structure. On Ti substitution, X-ray line widths become much broader compared to those of pure CeO2. Lattice parameters of the oxides have been determined, and a decrease in a for the Ti substituted oxides is observed as expected (see Table 1). The average crystallite size of Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 obtained from Scherrer's formula is 5.5 nm. The structure could be refined using Rietveld profile analysis as shown in Figure 1b for x = 0.4. As can be seen, the fitting is good. Hydrogen uptake as a function of temperature is shown in Figure 2. Note, the y scales are different for different samples. For pure CeO2, the total H2 uptake up to 700 C corresponds to the reduction of CeO2 to CeO1.96, and pure TiO2 is reduced to TiO1.92. With 25 and 40% Ti substitution, the oxides get reduced to Ce0.75Ti0.25O1.81 and Ce0.6Ti0.4O1.73, respectively. Thus, Ti ion substitution in CeO2 enhances reducibility by hydrogen. Because of the nanocrystalline nature of the oxides prepared by the solution combustion method, the hydrogen uptake observed here is much higher than that reported by Luo et al.18 Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns of (A) CeO2, (B) Ce0.75Ti0.25O2, and (C) Ce0.60Ti0.40O2; (b) Rietveld refined observed () and calculated (+) and difference XRD patterns of Ce0.6Ti0.4O2.Figure 2 H2 uptake for CeO2, TiO2, and Ce1-xTixO2.Table 1.

3.1. EXAFS. Normalized X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra at the Ti K edge in Ce1-xTixO2 solid solutions along with that in TiO2 are presented in Figure 3. Normalization is done by first subtracting the Victoreen instrument background obtained from fitting the pre-edge region (4850 eV to 4950 eV) from the all of the raw spectra and then dividing them by respective average absorption coefficients obtained for the spectral region 50505140 eV. It can be seen that the gross XANES features are similar to but slightly broader than those of TiO2m indicating Ti to be in the 4+ state in the solid solutions. The broadened features indicate the presence of disorder in the solid solutions, which is well-supported by the broad Bragg reflections seen in XRD. The position and the normalized height of the pre-edge peak are known to give a clue of the coordination geometry surrounding the Ti ion. 26 In the case of TiO2 the pre-edge peak appears at 4971.5 eV and has a normalized height of 0.179, which is in good agreement with the values reported by Farges et al. for 6 coordination geometry. In the case of Ce1-xTixO2 solid solutions, the pre-edge peak appears at 4970.4 eV and has a height of 0.24. Decrease of the pre-edge peak by 1 eV compared to TiO2 is an indication of a lowering of the coordination around Ti from 6 to a lower value. The values of the height and peak position suggest that Ti has a coordination lower than 5, taking the standard values for model compounds from Farges et al.

The k2 weighted Fourier transforms (FTs) of the Ti K edge EXAFS in Ce1-xTixO2 for x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 were examined. The weighted EXAFS data in the k range from 2 Å-1 to 10 Å-1 were transformed to R space (see Figure 4). The resulting magnitude of FT exhibited a strong peak at about 1.9 Å corresponding to TiO correlations. The peaks in the range from 3 to 4 Å observed are ascribed to TiTi(Ce) correlations. Because the Ti4+ ion is too small to be accommodated for in 8 coordination as for Ce4+ in pure CeO2, oxygen around the Ti ion is distorted, and with one TiO distance, the fitting is too poor. EXAFS data were essentially fitted with correlations obtained for the CeO2 type fluorite structure using FEFF6. However, some essential modifications in the pure CeO2 structure were considered. First, it was assumed that the entire Ti substitutes for Ce randomly, and, therefore, 12 neighbors in the second shell around Ti ion were distributed as per ratio the of Ce to Ti. Second, to fit the first peak, three oxygen coordinations around Ti were considered, namely, 6+2, 4+4, and 4+2+2, such that total number of oxygen ions surrounding Ti equals eight. In Figure 5 the fitting in the back-transformed k space with three distributions is shown for Ce0.6Ti0.4O2. As can be seen, 6+2 coordination does not give a good fit. 4+4 and 4+2+2 coordinations around Ti give good fits, and given the resolution ΔR in R space, it is rather impossible to choose any one from among them. The fittings in the back-transformed k space for different compositions for 4 + 4 coordination are given in Figure 6. The values of bond lengths and DebyeWaller terms are presented in Table 2. For all the solid solutions studied, it can be seen that the σ2 values for the second shell are quite large. The results clearly demonstrate that first coordination of Ti4+ ions is 4 at a TiO distance of 1.9 Å. The other four oxygens are distributed between 2.4 and 2.6 Å. Thus, four oxygens out of eight move closer to the Ti ion at 1.9 Å, and four oxygens move away to longer distances of 2.5 Å in 4+4 coordination and 2.42.6 Å in 4+2+2 coordination. It is important to note that TiO distances at 2.5 Å are much longer than the average CeO distance of 2.36 Å in CeO2. Further, TiTi correlation at 3.0 Å and TiCe correlation at 3.5 Å are unique distances.

To gain insight on the effect of Ti substitution on Ce coordination, EXAFS spectra at the Ce L3 edge were also analyzed. The procedure adapted to fit the EXAFS data was the same as earlier. In this case, however, both the 6 + 2 and 4 + 4 models gave satisfactory fits. This would mean that, in the fluorite structure, the substitution of Ti affects the coordination around it as well as Ce. In CeO2, the CeO bond length is obtained at 2.36 Å, but in Ce1-xTixO2, CeO bond distances are obtained at 2.30 and 2.42 Å in 4 + 4 coordination. Thus, distortion is more around the Ti ion (1.9 and 2.5 Å) than around the Ce ion. In Table 3 the structural details for the Ce L3 EXAFS are given, and the FT of the EXAFS data along with fittings to the two representative compounds x = 0.1 and x = 0.4 are shown in Figure 7. It is important to note that the CeTi distance from the Ce L3 edge agrees well with the TiCe distance from the Ti K edge study. Thus, the EXAFS study clearly shows two kinds of coordination for Ti as well as Ce; 4 + 4 oxygen coordination around the metal ions is observed for the solid solutions compared to the 8 coordination in pure CeO2.

3.2. DFT Calculations. The lattice constants determined from first-principles calculations are within the typical DFT errors with respect to their experimental values (see Table 1). The Ce3TiO8 cell corresponding to a Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 composition is taken, and because there is only one Ti in this cell, the TiTi near-neighbor distance is not obtained. The CeCe distance obtained is 3.81 Å, which agrees well with the Ce L3 edge EXAFS study. Total coordination of Ce is 12. Figure 8 shows the coordination around the cations in the optimized structure of Ce0.75Ti0.25O2, in which oxygens O1, O3, O6, and O8 form short TiO bonds, while oxygens O2, O4, O5, and O7 form long TiO bonds. Four of the eight nearest-neighbor oxygen atoms come closer to the Ti atom, resulting in a coordination of four. O3 forms a short bond with Ti and a long bond with Ce, while O7 forms a long bond with Ti and a short bond with Ce. Hence, those oxygens which move away from the Ti ion move toward the Ce ion and vice versa. From our theoretical calculations, Ti as well as Ce has 4 + 4 coordination of oxygens around the metal ion. The TiO distances are 1.85 and 2.76 Å for Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 and 1.87 and 2.71 Å for Ce0.875Ti0.125O2, which are close to the values obtained from EXAFS analysis. The CeO distances of 2.22 and 2.53 Å for Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 are close to the EXAFS results. For Ce0.875Ti0.125O2, the average short CeO distance is 2.25 Å and the average long CeO distance is 2.47 Å, which are also in good agreement with the experimental values obtained from EXAFS.
Figure 8 Ce0.75Ti0.25O2, showing the coordination around Ti and Ce ions.
With access to local structural details, we carried out bond valence analysis to uncover the cause for the enhanced observed reducibility/OSC. The parameters used in the bond valence calculation25 are given in Table 4. For pure CeO2, the average valency of Ce is 3.97, and that of an oxygen is 1.99. On Ti substitution as given in Table 5, the weakly bonded oxygens have valencies (1.621.73), which are lower than that in pure CeO2, while the stronger ones have higher valencies. The Ti valencies in Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 and Ce0.875Ti0.125O2 are 3.65 and 3.54, respectively. The average Ce valencies in Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 and Ce0.875Ti0.125O2 are 4.21 and 4.24, respectively. The presence of reduced ions in mixed oxides is responsible for formation of long and short bonds, which in turn changes the coordination around the cations, leading to the formation of weak oxygens.

aThe oxygens having three CeO long bonds and one TiO short bond form the weaker catagory.
Distribution of cation to oxygen distances given in Figure 9a shows the presence of a single CeO bond length in pure CeO2 at 2.36 Å. On Ti substitution, the bond lengths can be divided into two categories, short and long, where the short category falls below 2.36 Å and the long category falls above 2.36 Å. In Ce0.875Ti0.125O2, three types of short and three types of long bonds are found. In Ce0.75Ti0.25O2, two types of short and two types of long bonds are found. Table 6 shows the average values of bond lengths in Ti substituted CeO2. The long bonds are weaker, and the short bonds are stronger, hence, the availability of longer bonds in Ti doped CeO2 leads to higher OSC than pure CeO2. Such a distortion of the oxygen sublattice is responsible for the broadening of Bragg reflections in XRD. Thus, from the bond valence analysis, two types of oxygens can be identified: type 1 (strong) and type 2 (weak).

The total cohesive energy E can be expressed in terms of bond energy ε(b): ε(b) D(b) db = E, D(b) being the distribution of bond lengths or the bond length density. To determine energies of short and long bonds in Ce1-xTixO2, we assume the following simple relation: Etype1/Etype2 = av(stype1)/av(stype2), where av(s) is the average bond valence of a type of bond. According to the bond valence theory, valence of an atom is a measure of its involvement in bonding.25 As the valence of an atom is the sum of its individual bond valences, it is reasonable to assume that the higher the bond valence, the stronger the bond and vice versa.
The relative bonding energies in Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 given in Table 7 show that CeO (long), TiO (long), and TiO (short) bonds are weaker than the pure CeO bond. We have showed the percent difference in the bonding energies with respect to pure CeO bond because their absolute values are typically overestimated in LDA calculations.

The binding energy of different types of oxygens is obtained by summing up of individual bond energies. The relative binding energy of oxygens in Ti substituted CeO2 is given in Table 8. For pure CeO2, we have a single type of oxygen, in which each oxygen forms four bonds with Ce. For Ce0.75Ti0.25O2, the binding energy of an oxygen with three CeO short bonds and one TiO long bond is given by type 1 and has a binding energy more than that of an oxygen in pure CeO2. Type 2 has oxygen that has three CeO long bonds and one TiO short bond and is more weakly bound than an oxygen in pure CeO2. Our analysis of bond strengths is consistent with the result that the cohesive energy of Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 is 15.51% smaller than that of pure CeO2.

To probe further the OSC of mixed oxides, we have analyzed effects of oxygen vacancies introduced in the tetrahedral position. Ce0.75Ti0.25O1.75 is a structure with 12.5% oxygen vacancy. The total energy obtained from our calculations for the single O atom is 425.87 eV, while that of half of a molecular oxygen is 430.54 eV. Because Ce0.75Ti0.25O1.75 has one oxygen vacancy, we compare its cohesive energy with that of Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 by keeping the same number of atoms in each case and, hence, adding one oxygen with energy of 425.87 eV to Ce0.75Ti0.25O1.75. The oxygen added is an atomic oxygen. We have not considered spins in our calculation. Our calculated cohesive energies of Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 and (Ce0.75Ti0.25O1.75 + an oxygen) suggest that it will cost an energy of 11.55 eV to create an oxygen vacancy. Similarly, the difference in cohesive energies of CeO2 and (CeO1.75 + an oxygen) is 11.83 eV. If one of the oxide ions is removed from the tetrahedral position to the octahedral vacant position, on relaxing the structure the oxygen moves back to the tetrahedral position resulting in the original structure without vacancy and having the same energy. Thus, it rules out the possibility for an oxygen atom to occupy the octahedral site in the bulk form of these oxides. Our calculations with oxygen vacancy in ceriatitania show that the presence of an oxygen vacancy makes the structure weakly bound and increases the number of weak oxygens, contributing to higher OSC.
Figure 9b shows the presence of both short and long bonds in vacancy-introduced ceria as in CeO1.75 compared to the single bond length of 2.36 Å in pure CeO2. Presence of longer bonds compared to CeO2 shows the availability of weaker oxygens in CeO2-δ. This could also be a reason for the enhanced reducibility of Ce1-xTixO2; initial removal of oxide ions at lower temperature enhances further removal of oxygen. The broad H2 uptake curve indeed supports this calculation.
Hence, presence of oxygen vacancies is an important factor which affects the OSC in mixed oxides (see Table 6 for bond lengths in vacancy introduced mixed oxides). The values of the oxygen valencies for Ce0.75Ti0.25O1.75 are given in Table 5. In each case, the numbers of strong and weak oxygens are four and three, respectively. Hence, it shows that the position of the tetrahedral vacancy was the site of a weakly bound oxygen.
4. Conclusions
In this paper the higher OSC of the Ti doped CeO2 solid solution is probed by EXAFS and DFT calculations. The EXAFS study of Ce1-xTixO2 shows that oxygen coordination around Ti is distorted, resulting in 4 + 4 distribution such that 4 oxygens come close to Ti at 1.9 Å while the other 4 move away at 2.5 Å. The structures determined from our first-principles calculations agree well with the EXAFS results. We find that the presence of short and long bonds results in two types of oxygens: strongly and weakly bound. The stronger ones have a valency greater than 2.0, and the weaker ones have a valency less than 2.0. Using the valencies of cations and oxygens calculated by the bond valence method and binding energies, we determined the weakly bound oxygens responsible for higher OSC in the mixed oxides.
