RodriguezJan HrbekJoseph DvorakCharles H. F. Peden View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract Synchrotron-based high-resolution photoemission, conventional X-ray (Mg Kα) photoemission (XPS), X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), and first-principles density-functional calculations have been used to study the electronic properties of a Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 mixed-metal oxide. The results of density-functional calculations show that the band gap in bulk Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 is 0.6 eV smaller than that in bulk CeO2, with the Zr atoms in the mixed-metal oxide showing smaller positive charges than the cations in ZrO2 or CeO2. When present in a lattice of CeO2, the Zr atoms are forced to adopt larger metalO distances than in ZrO2, leading to a reduction in the oxidation state of this element. Due to nonequivalent ZrO distances, at least three different types of oxygen atoms are found in the Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 system. O K-edge XANES spectra for a series of Ce1-xZrxO2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 1) compounds show a distinctive line shape for the mixed-metal oxides that cannot be attributed to a sum of CeO2 and ZrO2 features, supporting the idea that the O atoms in Ce1-xZrxO2 are in a special chemical environment. XPS Ce 3d core-level spectra show the presence of Ce3+ cations even after prolonged oxidation with oxygen gas, which may be related to the relative stability of oxygen vacancy defects upon incorporation of zirconia into ceria. The interaction of NO2 gas with Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111)-, CeO2-x(111)-, and Zr(Y)O2-x(111)-reduced surfaces was examined. Ne+ ion sputtering was used to generate substantial concentrations of Ce3+, Zr2+, and Zr0 centers on the oxide surfaces. On CeO2-x(111), we observed NO3, NO2, and N upon adsorption of NO2. In contrast, only NO2 and N were detected after adsorption of NO2 on Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) and Zr(Y)O2-x(111). Adsorption of NO2 induced an increase in the oxidation state of the metal cations (Ce3+  Ce4+; Zr0  Zr2+). The NOx species desorbed from the oxides at temperatures ranging from 400 to 800 K, leaving N adatoms on the surfaces. The effects of Zr on the electronic and chemical properties of ceria are discussed and compared to those of other common dopant agents (Ca, Ti, and Cu).

I. Introduction
Zirconia-doped ceria (Ce1-xZrxO2) is a complex material and an important component of catalysts used in automotive exhaust-gas converters. 1 Today, the protection of the environment is receiving much more attention than ever before. One of the efforts for environmental cleanup is focused on controlling the emission of toxic pollutants such as nitrogen oxides NOx (NO2, NO, N2O), which are produced in automotive engines by the oxidation of nitrogen. 2 In many situations, the decomposition rate of nitrogen oxides is slow without catalytic assistance. Therefore, it is necessary to employ appropriate catalysts to reduce the emission of NOx compounds (denoted as the DeNOx process) into the air. 1,3 Due to its redox properties, ceria (CeO2) is a key component in three-way automotive catalysts. 4,5 Ceria-supported noble-metal catalysts are capable of storing oxygen under oxidizing conditions and releasing oxygen under reducing conditions via the facile conversion between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states. 6 Recently, significant attention 7-13 has been directed toward correlating the electronic and geometric structures of nonstoichiometric ceria with their chemical and catalytic properties. Oxygen anion vacancies in ceria surfaces are considered to play an essential role in catalytic reactions. 13-16 To enhance the redox properties and thermal stability of pure ceria, zirconia (ZrO2) is often mixed as an additive to form solid solutions of the Ce1-xZrxO2 type. Zr-doped cerium oxides have been reported to enhance the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and the rate for the oxygen release in automotive catalysts. 16-22 They also retard thermal deactivation.16-22 The focus has been on examining possible correlations between the CeO2ZrO2 interactions and differences in the behavior of Ce1-xZrxO2 and CeO2. It has been suggested that ceria structural modifications mediated by zirconia are responsible for the enhanced OSC properties of ceriazirconia mixed oxides.18,19,22 However, the mechanisms for such doping effects remain uncertain and are still a matter of debate.The exact role of pure and Zr-doped ceria in DeNOx processes in automobile catalytic converters is not clear.5,6 Understanding the details of NOx chemistry on Ce1-xZrxO2 surfaces has both practical and academic interests.3,5 NO2 is formed in automotive engines during the combustion of fuels under oxygen-rich conditions. In general, little is known about the chemistry of NO2 on oxide surfaces at a molecular level.3a,23-27 It has been found that for fully oxidized polycrystalline CeO2 and CeO2 powder, at 300 K, nitrate is the only species that exists on the surface after adsorption of NO2.3a However, on partially reduced ceria (CeO2-x), a surface mixture of N, NO, and NO3 was observed at 300 K with simultaneous transformation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ ions.3a Adsorbed nitrate has been detected as a product of the reaction of NO2 with MgO(100),3a ZnO(0001),28a and TiO2(110)28b at high coverage and moderate temperatures (<250 K). NO2 adsorption on Cr2O3(111),26 Cr2O3(0001),29 and Cr0.06Mg0.94O(100)29 at temperatures of 80100 K leads to dissociation into adsorbed oxygen and adsorbed NO.In this study, we investigate the electronic properties of Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 using first-principles density-functional calculations, photoemission, and XANES. Synchrotron-based high-resolution photoemission is used to study the behavior of NO2 on Ce0.8Zr0.2O2(111) surfaces. Of particular interest is to show how the Zr substitution for Ce at the cation lattice sites affects the NOx chemistry of ceria via structural and/or electronic perturbations. To our knowledge, no study dealing with the interaction of NO2 and ceria-based mixed oxides has been reported.
II. Experimental and Theoretical Methods
II.1. Sample Preparation, Photoemission and XANES Experiments. This work was performed in two separate ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chambers, which are located at the U7A experimental station in the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Photoemission experiments were carried out in a UHV chamber3 fitted with a hemispherical electron-energy analyzer with multichannel detection, low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), a quadruple mass spectrometer (QMS), and a twin (Mg Kα and Al Kα) XPS source. The combined energy resolution in the photoemission experiments was of 0.30.4 eV. The O K-edge XANES spectra were taken at the second UHV chamber in the U7A beamline. The data were collected in the electron-yield mode using a channeltron multiplier near the sample surface. A flood gun was used to compensate for the charging during the experiments. The overall energy resolution was approximately 0.3 eV.
CeO2(111) and Ce1-xZrxO2(111) epitaxial thin films (500700 Å in thickness) were grown onto a Y-stabilized ZrO2(111) surface by oxygen-plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy. 30-32 The Y-stabilized ZrO2 substrate (YSZ) contained 14 at. % Y. The oxide films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), LEED, and XPS.30-32 It has been reported that for Ce1-xZrxO2 mixed-metal oxide systems with compositions of x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, the Zr ions substitutionally replace Ce ions within the cubic fluorite lattice structure of CeO2.30,31 Sample treatment included annealing in an oxygen environment, sputtering with Ne+ ions at room temperature, and annealing in UHV. It is generally accepted that the top layer of the (111) surface of fluorite-type oxides consists of oxygen in order to avoid creating a polar surface. 33 To increase the number of oxygen vacancies and generate Ce3+ centers, Ne+ ion bombardment was used.3a,7,9 In a set of experiments, the electronic properties of CeO2(111), Ce0.8Zr0.2 O2(111), and YSZ(111) surfaces were examined with photoemission. The valence band, N 1s, and Zr 3d core-level spectra were recorded using a photon energy of 325 or 500 eV from the synchrotron beam. The binding energies of all spectra were calibrated with the position of the Fermi edge in the valence region. Except for the Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 sample, both CeO2 and YSZ samples had serious charging problems while data were recorded, with the degree of charging being dependent on the sample preparation and experimental conditions. Similar problems were reported in previous studies.9 In the present work, most photoemission experiments dealing with CeO2 and YSZ at the synchrotron were totally unsuccessful. In these cases, conventional XPS was used to record core-level spectra. The N 1s (NO2), Ce 3d (Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 and CeO2), and Zr 3d5/2 (YSZ) XPS spectra were recorded with Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV). To calibrate the XPS binding-energy position, the Zr 3d5/2 and Ce 3d3/2 core levels were used as internal references, with the Zr4+ 3d5/2 oxidation state set at 182.4 eV, 34 and the binding energies of Ce4+ 3d3/2 set at 916.9 eV. 10,35 NO2 gas (99%, Matheson Company) dosing was performed via a glass-capillary array doser, located within a distance of 2 mm from the sample surface. The NO2 exposures (1 Langmuir = 10-6 Torr·s) were based on the ion-gauge reading without further correction.
II.2. Density-Functional Calculations. The geometries of bulk CeO2, Ce0.8Zr0.2O2, and ZrO2 were calculated using the CASTEP code. 36 A series of previous studies indicates that CASTEP is excellent for predicting structural geometries of oxides. 37 In this code, the wave functions of valence electrons are expanded in a basis set of plane waves with kinetic energies smaller than a specified cutoff energy Ecut. The presence of tightly bound core electrons is represented by nonlocal ultrasoft pseudopotentials. 38 Reciprocal-space integration over the Brillouin Zone is approximated through a careful sampling at a finite number of k-points using the MonkhorstPack scheme. 39 The exchange-correlation contribution to the total electronic energy is treated in the generalized gradient-corrected (GGA) form of the local-density approximation (LDA). 40 In all the CASTEP calculations, the kinetic energy cutoff Ecut (420 eV) and the density of the MonkhorstPack k-point mesh were chosen to be high enough to ensure the convergence of the computed structures and energetics.
Due to the delocalized (plane-wave) nature of its basis set, CASTEP yields useful electronic information (levels and band structure) only in the k-space. To investigate localized charges and the localized electronic density of states around various atoms of interest, we used the DMol3 code. 41 In contrast to CASTEP, DMol3 uses localized functions to describe the atomic orbitals. Our calculations employed numerical basis sets of double-zeta quality plus polarization functions to describe the valence orbitals of O, Ce, and Zr. For cerium, we did include 4f atomic orbitals in the calculations. The inclusion of 4f functions is necessary to obtain a good description of the ionicity in the CeO bonds and the band gap in CeO2. 42 The density-functional calculations with DMol3 were performed within the GGA approximation using Becke-88 for exchange 43 and Perdew-91 for correlation. 44 The charge distributions were estimated using the methodology proposed by Mulliken. 45 This approach has well-known limitations, 45,46 but provides useful qualitative trends for the interpretation of experimental results.46 The calculated charges must not be interpreted in absolute quantitative terms because of the uncertainty in uniquely defining a charge-partitioning scheme.
III. Results
III.1. Electronic Properties of Ce0.8Zr0.2O2, CeO2, and ZrO2. III.1.1. Theoretical Studies. Bulk CeO2 crystallizes in a fluorite structure. After a full structural relaxation, CASTEP predicts a lattice constant (a) of 5.432 Å for CeO2, which is very close to the experimental value of 5.411 Å 47 and values obtained in other theoretical studies.20b ZrO2 can adopt several crystalline phases,37e but the most common are the so-called cubic and monoclinic structures. 48 According to our calculated cohesive energies, the monoclinic phase is 0.18 eV/ZrO2 unit more stable than the cubic phase. A previous CASTEP calculation with different pseudopotentials (Vanderbilt form vs KleimanBylander form) predicts the monoclinic phase to be 0.11 eV/ZrO2 unit more stable than the cubic phase.37e This agrees well with experiments that show that the cubic ZrO2 phase appears only at high temperatures and needs to be doped with Y in order to be stable at low temperatures. 49 However, it is the cubic phase of ZrO2 that is closer structurally to CeO2 (fluorite-type structure in both systems). For the cubic phase of ZrO2, CASTEP gives a lattice constant (a) of 5.099 Å. A lattice constant of 5.122 Å has been measured experimentally for Y-stabilized cubic ZrO2, 50 whereas values of 5.035.14 Å are predicted in quantum mechanical calculations for pure cubic ZrO2.20b,37e In the Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 mixed-metal oxide, one is dealing with a solid solution in which the Zr atoms are randomly located in the cation positions of a CeO2 lattice.30,31 To simulate this compound, we combined two unit cells of CeO2 and replaced 20% of the metal cations with Zr atoms. A full-geometry optimization of the Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 system yielded a structure in which the lattice parameters (5.389 and 10.778 Å) were smaller than those determined for two combined unit cells of CeO2 (5.432 and 10.864 Å). This is consistent with the fact that Zr has a smaller ionic radius than Ce. 51 Furthermore, in cubic ZrO2, each Zr atom is surrounded by eight O atoms, each at a distance of 2.21 Å. For Ce0.8Zr0.2O2, the Zr atoms are in a related but expanded crystal lattice, again surrounded by eight O atoms but asymmetrically located with distances that range from 2.2 to 2.4 Å. The corresponding metaloxygen distances in cubic CeO2 are all equal to 2.36 Å.
The crystal structures determined with CASTEP for CeO2, ZrO2, and Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 were used in DMol3 to examine electronic properties of these oxides. Figure 1 displays the calculated energy positions for the valence (solid lines) and conduction (dashed lines) bands of CeO2, ZrO2, and Ce0.8Zr0.2O2. For CeO2, the calculations predict a band gap of 3 eV. Experimental measurements give band gaps of 3.26 eV for CeO2, depending on the techniques.7b HartreeFock calculations, which do not include Ce 4f orbitals, largely overestimate the band gap of CeO2, predicting a value of 13 eV.20b The band gaps predicted by DMol3 for the cubic and monoclinic phases of ZrO2 (3.3 and 3.9 eV, respectively) are close to the band gaps obtained in other theoretical calculations (3.8 and 4.5 eV, respectively).48 Band gaps of 57 eV have been measured experimentally for the phases of ZrO2. 48,52 For ZrO2, the valence band in Figure 1 is substantially less stable than for CeO2, and upon doping of CeO2 with Zr, there is a reduction of 0.6 eV in the size of the band gap. As a dopant agent, Zr induces only relatively minor changes in the band structure of ceria (i.e., no occupied states appear well above the valence band of the host as seen in other dopant/oxide systems 53). The DF calculations indicate that the valence bands of the oxides contain O 2p character (main component) and metal character. In all of these compounds, the metaloxygen bonds are not fully ionic, including instead a significant degree of covalency. A similar result has been obtained in previous theoretical studies for CeO2 and ZrO2.37e,42,52,54,55 Figure 1 Energy positions for the valence and conduction bands of CeO2, Ce0.8Zr0.2O2, ZrO2 cubic, and ZrO2 monoclinic (DMol3, DF-GGA). The empty and occupied states are indicated by dashed and solid lines, respectively. All energies are reported with respect to the vacuum level.
Table 1 lists calculated charges for the cations in CeO2, ZrO2, and Ce0.8Zr0.2O2. A Mulliken population analysis indicates that the oxides are ionocovalent. On the basis of theoretical calculations, several authors have suggested that the real charge on metal atoms of ZrO2 is closer to +2 than to the formal oxidation state of +4.37e,55 The charges calculated for Ce in pure and Zr-doped ceria are consistent with values obtained in LAPW calculations for CeO2. 54 A larger degree of ionicity is predicted for pure ceria from HartreeFock calculations that do not include Ce 4f functions.20b Interestingly, when Zr is present in a matrix of CeO2, the positive charge in this element is smaller than in pure ZrO2 or CeO2. In the mixed-metal oxide, the Zr atoms are forced into metaloxygen bond distances that are larger than those in ZrO2, leading to an effective reduction in their oxidation state. There was also an effect on the electron density of the oxygens. The calculated Mulliken charges for the oxygen in the cubic structures of CeO2 and ZrO2 were 0.96 and 1.11 e, respectively. On the other hand, in Ce0.8Zr0.2O2, at least three types of oxygen atoms were found (due to the nonequivalent ZrO distances, see above) with charges ranging from 0.92 to 0.99 e. These theoretical results indicate that some of the oxygen atoms in the mixed-metal oxide are in a special chemical environment not seen in CeO2 or ZrO2.

III.1.2. Valence Band Studies. In the following three sections, we will investigate the electronic properties of CeO2, Ce1-xZrxO2, and ZrO2 using valence photoemission, XPS, and XANES. Following a standard practice in the literature, features in the spectra will be attributed to Ce4+, Ce3+, Zr4+, and Zr2+ ions. The reader should keep in mind that these are formal charge assignments, and that the oxides under study are not fully ionic (Table 1 and refs 37e, 42, 52, 54, and 55).
Figure 2 displays a series of valence spectra for polycrystalline CeO2,3a Ce0.8Zr0.2O2(111), and YSZ(111) at room temperature. Figure 2(A) shows the typical valence spectra of pure ceria.9 For the fully oxidized CeO2, no photoemission peaks exist between 0 and 4 eV within the band gap. The peaks at 5 and 7 eV contain mainly O 2p character plus some Ce 4f and 5d character.9,54 When sputtering with Ne+ ions is performed, a new peak appears, centered at 2 eV. This peak is a Ce3+-ion-derived level, related to occupied Ce 4f1 electronic states.9 Figure 2 Typical valence-band photoemission spectra for (A) CeO2 and CeO2-x, (B) Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x with different defect populations, and (C) Zr(Y)O2-x.
Figure 2(B) displays the valence region of Ce0.8Zr0.2O2(111) surfaces with different Ce3+ ion populations. These results indicate that sputtering with Ne+ ions can create significant amounts of oxygen vacancies on a Ce0.8Zr0.2O2(111) system. In general, the structure of the valence bands in CeO2-x and Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x is similar, with a key peak for Ce3+ ions appearing near the Fermi level.
The valence band features for sputtered YSZ(111) are shown in Figure 2(C). For this surface, core-level photoemission data (see below) indicate that 40% of the Zr cations within the escape depth probed by photoemission are in an oxidation state much lower than +4. However, the valence region of Zr(Y)O2-x is very different from those of CeO2-x and Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x, with no strong metal features near the Fermi edge. This difference implies that the Ce3+ ions should play a dominant role in the chemistry of a Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x surface.
III.1.3. XPS Studies. Figure 3(A) displays the CeO2 3d core-level XPS spectra from fully oxidized and heavily sputtered CeO2(111). Fully oxidized samples were annealed under an O2 environment (600 K, 3 × 10-6 Torr, 60 min). Reduced surfaces were obtained by Ne+ ion bombardment (1.5 keV) for 30 min. For both stoichiometric and reduced ceria, the Ce 3d XPS spectra are consistent with previous studies.7 The peak assignment and labels for the Ce3+- and Ce4+-related features follow previous convention,7,35,56 with v and u referring to the two spinorbit split components of the Ce 3d photoemission process, the Ce 3d5/2 and Ce 3d3/2, respectively. The complex structure of the spectra (multiple spinorbit split doublets) is due to various initial and final states,7,35,56 yet all doublets exhibit an energy difference of 18.4 eV between Ce 3d5/2 and Ce3d3/2, consistent with data previously reported in the literature.7,9,30,31,35,56
Figure 3 Ce 3d core-level XPS spectra (hv = 1253.6 eV) for stoichiometric and heavily sputtered samples of (A) CeO2 and (B) Ce0.8Zr0.2O2.
The Ce 3d XPS spectra with zirconia doping as Ce0.8Zr0.2O2(111) are shown in the bottom of Figure 3. Oxidized and reduced samples were prepared following the same methodology as those used for CeO2. There are clear changes in the line shape of the spectra for CeO2(111) and Ce0.8Zr0.2O2(111). For oxidized Ce0.8Zr0.2O2(111), the valley between the v and v peaks is not as deep as that for oxidized CeO2(111). This extra feature is related to the Ce3+ 3d5/2 and denoted as v. XPS data taken after growth and/or reoxidation with an oxygen plasma have indicated various concentrations of Ce3+ ions as a function of the growth conditions and/or Zr concentration in the film.30,31 In fact, primarily Ce4+ ions were identified in films grown under conditions very similar to those used here.30 However, it has been noted that these Zr-doped ceria single-crystal films show strong evidence for the reduction of cerium cations after being manipulated in air.30c In addition, they are subsequently very difficult to fully reoxidize with oxygen gas, in agreement with the results presented here. This difficulty in fully oxidizing Ce1-xZrxO2(111) is probably related to the stability of oxygen vacancies in this mixed-metal oxide.16,19,22 Figure 4 illustrates the effects of Ne+ ion bombardment on the Zr 3d oxidation states for sputtered YSZ(111). In the Zr 3d region, sputtering leads to the appearance of a shoulder on the low-binding-energy side. The curve fitting28,57 results reveal the existence of three oxidation states, which can be assigned as Zr4+, Zr2+, and Zr0 ions,58 respectively, with Zr2+ and Zr0 ions existing as minor species. Previous studies59 show that electron-beam bombardment of YSZ(100) transformed Zr4+ to Zr0 ions. Although Ne+ ion sputtering reduces YSZ(111), under similar conditions, we found no substantial evidence for the reduction of Zr4+ ions in Ce0.8Zr0.2O2(111) after Ne+ ion bombardment. In this case, the full width at half-maximum of the Zr 3d5/2 changed by <0.2 eV with ion sputtering. Similarly, for Ce1-xZrxO2 powders, it is very difficult to reduce Zr4+ ions with hydrogen.15b Figure 4 Ne+-ion-sputtering effects on the Zr 4d core-level XPS spectra (hv = 1253.6 eV) of Zr(Y)O2. The spectra were curve-fitted following the procedure described in refs 28 and 57.
III.1.4. XANES Studies. It is well-known that the oxygen K-edge features of many transition metal oxides are very sensitive to the chemical environment around the X-ray-absorbing atom.60 Figure 5 shows O K-edge electron-yield XANES spectra for a series of CexZr1-xO2 samples, including reference spectra of pure ZrO2, Zr(Y)O2, and CeO2. It is obvious that there is a distinct difference in electronic structure between ZrO2 and CeO2.
Figure 5 O K-edge XANES spectra for Ce1-xZrxO2 at 300 K. For comparison, spectra for pure CeO2, ZrO2, and Zr(Y)O2 are also displayed.
The features labeled as 4f, 5deg, and 5dt2g in pure CeO2 are related to the electronic transitions from the O 1s core levels into the empty cerium 4f, 5deg, and 5dt2g levels, respectively.3a,9,42 The O K-edge spectra of YSZ and ZrO2 come mainly from theO 1s  Zr (4d) electronic transition,61,62 and two peaks separated by 3.2 eV reflect the splitting of the Zr 4d orbitals into levels with eg and t2g symmetries. The O K-edge features of Ce1-xZrxO2 significantly change as a function of Zr doping. First, the relative Ce 4f0 intensity decreases with increasing Zr content. The decreasing intensity of the Ce 4f0 reflects a reduction in Ce concentration and probably a partial occupation of the Ce 4f0 orbitals (i.e., Ce 4f1 for the Ce3+ ions induced by intrinsic O vacancies in the mixed-metal oxides16,19). Second, the peak position of Ce 4f0 increases gradually from 530.5 (CeO2) to 530.6 (Ce0.9Zr0.1O2), 530.8 (Ce0.8Zr0.2O2), and 530.9 eV (Ce0.7Zr0.3O2). At the same time, the energy position of the 5deg peak decreases with the 5dt2g peak position remaining almost fixed. The O K-edge spectra of the Ce1-xZrxO2 compounds show a distinctive line shape that cannot be attributed to a sum of CeO2 and ZrO2 features. All of the above results support the idea that some of the O atoms in the mixed-metal oxides are in a special chemical environment when compared to those of CeO2 or ZrO2. An identical conclusion was reached after analyzing the density-functional results in section III.1.1.
III. 2. Reaction of NO2 with CeO2-x, Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x, and Zr(Y)O2-x. In this section, we investigate the adsorption of NO2 on CeO2-x(111), Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111), and Zr(Y)O2-x(111) surfaces that are rich in O vacancies (2x denotes oxygen deficiency). Severe charging problems made photoemission experiments impossible for stoichiometric CeO2(111), Ce0.8Zr0.2O2(111), and Zr(Y)O2(111) surfaces.
Previous studies have examined the adsorption of NO2 on fully oxidized and partially reduced polycrystalline CeO2.3a For NO2 on CeO2 at 300 K, nitrate was the only adsorbate on the oxide substrate. However, on partially reduced ceria (CeO2-x), a surface mixture of N, NO, and NO3 was observed at 300 K with simultaneous transformation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ ions.3a Partial reoxidation of CeO2-x(111) can be achieved by NO2 exposure at 100 or 300 K. In Figure 6, the bottom Ce 3d spectrum was recorded after creating O vacancies in a CeO2(111) surface by Ne+ sputtering. For this heavily reduced surface, NO2 adsorption at 100 K leads to partial reoxidation. Features for Ce4+ ions (i.e., u and v peaks in Figure 3) gain intensity after depositing more than a layer of NO2 on the oxide substrate. At temperatures from 150 to 300 K, N 1s XPS spectra showed the presence of adsorbed NO2 and NO3 on the surface. When annealing at 300 K was performed, the Ce4+-related features became more pronounced than at 100 K. Further annealing at a high temperature led to the desorption of NOx species and an increase in the signal for Ce3+-derived features.
Figure 6 Effects of NO2 adsorption and subsequent annealing on the Ce 3d core-level spectra (hv = 1253.6 eV) of CeO2-x(111). More than a monolayer of NO2 was dosed at 100 K.
The left panel of Figure 7 shows N 1s spectra for the adsorption of NO2 on a Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) surface at room temperature with subsequent annealing at higher temperatures. Before the dosing with NO2 was performed, Ne+ ion sputtering produced a large concentration of Ce3+ ions and negligible amounts of Zr2+ and Zr0 ions. In Figure 7, an intense peak centered at 404.5 eV and a relatively small peak at 399.5 eV are seen. The N 1s binding energies for adsorbed NO3 (406.5 eV3a), chemisorbed NO2 (404 eV3b), NO (400402 eV3b), and atomic N (396399 eV3b) are well-known from the literature. These results indicate that, upon NO2 adsorption onto the defect-rich Ce0.8Zr0.2O2(111) surface, the main NOx species that is present is chemisorbed NO2. A fraction of the NO2 (10%) undergoes complete dissociation to produce atomic nitrogen. With the increasing annealing temperature, the N 1s peak intensity for the NO2 progressively decreases. By 650 K, the N 1s peak intensity of NO2 is comparable with that of atomic N. The NO2 species disappears completely at 800 K. But atomic nitrogen still remains on the surface at this high temperature.
Figure 7 N 1s spectra (left panel, hv = 500 eV) and valence-band spectra (right panel, hv = 500 eV) for the adsorption of NO2 on a heavily sputtered Ce1-xZrxO2(111) surface. NO2 gas was dosed at 300 K, and the surface was progressively annealed at the indicated temperatures.
The effects on the valence band features of Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) by NO2 dosing at room temperature and subsequent thermal annealing are shown in the right-side panel of Figure 7. Prior to NO2 exposure, the Ce3+ ion intensity is much higher than that of the O 2p band. This is characteristic of a heavily reduced surface.3a,9 The Ce3+ ion intensity significantly decreases upon the exposure of Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) to nitrogen dioxide. Annealing at temperatures up to 800 K induces an increase in the Ce3+-state intensity, suggesting that the adsorption sites for NO2 are probably related to Ce3+ cations. Although the annealing at 800 K removes all the NO2 from the surface, the Ce3+ ion intensity is not restored to the original value. This is probably due to the fact that NO2 molecules crack on the surface, effectively removing O vacancies.
Figure 8 displays N 1s spectra for the adsorption of NO2 on a Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) surface at 100 K. Initially, the amount of Ce3+ ions in this system was similar to that in the clean Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) surface of Figure 7. At 100 K, for the high-intensity peak, the maximum of the N 1s features is located at 404.5 eV and is assigned to the NO2 species. The weak feature located at 399.5 eV may be due to the atomic nitrogen species. The N 1s intensity change of NO2 with the annealing temperatures is displayed in the inset of Figure 8. As shown, the peak intensity decreases drastically around 150 K due to desorption of physisorbed NO2.3 In the annealing temperature range of 200500 K, a small reduction in the N 1s peak intensity is observed. When annealing at 700 K was performed, the N 1s peak for the NO2 species is substantially reduced. The NO2 species is completely desorbed by annealing at 900 K. However, the N 1s peak for atomic nitrogen is still on the surface. The data shown in Figures 7 and 8 show that no adsorbed nitrate is formed on the reduced Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x surfaces. The relative N 1s intensity between NO2 and N suggests that NO2 chemisorption dominates over NO2 decomposition reactions. Similar trends were found when NO2 was dosed to a Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) surface that had been slightly sputtered (i.e., a small Ce3+ ion signal in the valence region as seen in Figure 2B). Due to problems with sample charging, it was impossible to study the adsorption of NO2 on a fully oxidized Ce0.8Zr0.2O2(111) surface.
Figure 8 N 1s spectra (hv = 500 eV) for the adsorption of NO2 on a heavily sputtered Ce1-xZrxO2 surface. NO2 gas was dosed at 100 K, and the sample was progressively annealed at the indicated temperatures. The inset shows the N 1s intensity for NO2 species as a function of annealing temperature.
Figure 9 shows the effects of NO2 adsorption on the Zr 3d levels and the valence band structure of O-vacancy-rich YSZ(111). Similar to the XPS data in Figure 4, Ne+ ion sputtering induced a shoulder in the lower-binding part of the Zr 3d doublet (Zr4+  Zr2+ and Zr0). This phenomenon was not seen for Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) surfaces. Upon NO2 adsorption, as shown in Figure 9, the shoulder disappears, indicating the oxidization of the sample (probably Zr0  Zr2+). After a 10 Langmuir NO2 exposure to the Zr(Y)O2-x at 300 K, N 1s data revealed NO2 to be the main surface species without nitrate groups.

IV. Discussion
It is well-known that the properties of oxide catalysts can be affected using geometric and/or electronic structure modifications induced by dopants.53,63 A priori, how to choose the right type of dopant agent for ceria is a very complex issue.63,64 The ideal lattice of pure CeO2 has a fluorite structure, with each Ce4+ cation octahedrally coordinated to eight equivalent O2- ions, and each O2- anion tetrahedrally coordinated to four Ce4+ ions. In general, the objective is to replace Ce centers with a second metal in a random solid solution. 63-65 Since most metals have atomic sizes that are different from that of cerium,51 one can expect structural perturbations in the lattice of the ceria. Thus, the introduction of Zr into ceria induces a shortening of the unit cell parameters since the radius of Ce4+ ions (0.97 Å) is larger than that of Zr4+ ions (0.84 Å). Recent powder-diffraction studies65 show that the average unit cell parameters of Ce1-xZrxO2 decrease with Zr doping [CeO2 (a = 5.407 Å), Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 (a = 5.379 Å), Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 (a = 5.353 Å), and Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 (a = 5.301 Å)], in agreement with the results of our DF calculations in section III.1 [CeO2 (a = 5.432 Å) and Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 (a = 5.389 Å)]. Gao et al.31 studied mixed Ce1-xZrxO2(001) oxides grown on SrTiO3(001) and concluded that although the lattice distortion induced by the Zr incorporation increases with the Zr-doping levels, the cubic fluorite structure persists with three different compositions (x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). Metals such as Ca,63 Ti,64 and Cu 66 are also used as dopants of CeO2. CASTEP (DF-GGA) calculations for the Ce0.8DM0.2O2 systems (DM = Ca, Ti, or Cu) also give a reduction in the unit cell parameters with respect to CeO2. In all these mixed-metal oxides, the dopant agent is trapped in a lattice of CeO2 surrounded by eight O atoms, adopting bonding positions which lead to nonequivalent metaloxygen distances. One can find several types of oxygen with different electronic properties. Indeed, the O K-edge XANES spectra for Ce1-xZrxO2 compounds (Figure 5) show a distinctive line shape that cannot be attributed to a sum of CeO2 and ZrO2 features, supporting the idea that O atoms in the mixed-metal oxide are in a special chemical environment.
In addition to inducing structural changes, a dopant agent can introduce occupied electronic states within the band gap of ceria. These types of electronic states are particularly important for the reactivity of mixed-metal oxides.29,37b,37d,53 For example, in Mg1-xCrxO, chromium introduces occupied states 3 eV above the MgO valence band53 and, as a result, Cr-doped catalysts are much more active for DeNOx and DeSOx reactions than pure MgO catalysts.29,53,67 Doping of ceria with Zr induces a relatively minor narrowing (0.6 eV) of the band gap, and no occupied states appear well above the valence band. A similar result is obtained after using other common dopants such as Ca or Ti (Figure 10). In these Ce1-xDMxO2 systems, the dopant activates the host oxide by facilitating the formation of O vacancies and, correspondingly, Ce3+ ions.16,63,64 Ce3+ occupied states appear 2 eV above the CeO2 valence band (Figure 10) and are well-positioned for bonding interactions with unoccupied orbitals of NOx molecules.
Figure 10 Energy positions for the valence and conduction bands of CeO2, Ce0.8Zr0.2O2, Ce0.8Ti0.2O2, and Ce0.8Ca0.2O2 (DMol3, DF-GGA). The empty and occupied states are indicated by dashed and solid lines, respectively. The right side of the figure shows the position for the occupied Ce3+ states when O vacancies are introduced into the oxides.
Figure 3 shows that Ce3+ ions are still present even after extensive oxidation of Ce0.8Zr0.2O2(111) in oxygen gas. This result is similar to those of previous studies of Zr-doped ceria films.30c The difficulty in eliminating these Ce3+ defects in the mixed-oxide films may be due to the relative stability of oxygen-vacancy defects that occur upon doping with Zr (the so-called intrinsic defects16). Indeed, the smaller size of the Zr4+ cations favors the presence of Ce3+ ions by eliminating the strain associated with the transformation from Ce4+ to Ce3+ ions.16 The oxygen vacancies produced by ion bombardment of the oxide surfaces are extrinsic defects. Previous studies show that inert-gas ion sputtering induces Ce3+ defects in the surface and subsurface of thin films.7 We believe that Ce3+ defects, however they form, take part in the chemical reactions with NO2.
In general, the surface chemistry of NO2 on oxides can be very complex since NO2 can interact with both cations and anions by chemisorption, decomposition, and nitrate compound formation.3,26,28,29 In the present work, the primary reactions of NO2 with reduced CeO2-x(111), Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111), and YSZ2-x(111) involve decomposition or simple adsorption on partially reduced metal cation centers. Two types of decomposition reactions are possible. First, despite the fact that no N 1s signal from adsorbed NO was detected, the NO2 gas could still undergo a partial decomposition.
Second, atomic nitrogen species were observed to form on the surfaces, probably via the full decomposition of a fraction of the adsorbed NO2.
By far, the main nitrogen species observed on the oxide surfaces was chemisorbed NO2. Some NO3 was detected on CeO2-x(111),but not on Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) or YSZ2-x(111). Infrared spectroscopy (IR) studies 68 show that at room temperature, on oxidized ZrO2 powders, both nitrate and nitrite species are formed and remain stable at temperatures as high as 473 K. NO3 is the dominant species upon adsorption of NO2 on nonreduced CeO2, MgO, TiO2, Fe2O3, CuO, and ZnO.3,28 It appears that the absence of NO3 on Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) and YSZ2-x(111) is related to the oxygen deficiency of these surfaces as a result of intrinsic defects and ion sputtering. From previous studies, it is known that O vacancies can substantially alter the chemical properties of this type of oxide.13-16,69 It is worthwhile to compare the behavior of NO2 with that of other nitrogen oxides such as NO and N2O on cerium oxide. The chemisorption and reaction of NO and N2O on ceria surfaces have been reported recently.69 On the reduced ceria surfaces, NO chemisorbs, dissociates, and reoxidizes the Ce3+ ions. N2O exposure leads to NO formation.69 It is suggested that the ceria oxidation is partly due to NO- formation on the Ce3+ sites, with one electron transferring from Ce3+ to NO molecules.69 For the NO2 molecule, the highest occupied molecular orbital (6a1) is half-filled and highly stable,3 leading to a large electron affinity. 70 Electron transfer from the reduced oxide to NO2 molecules facilitates NO2δ- formation and oxidation of the Ce3+ sites. The same is valid for adsorption of NO2 on Zr2+ and Zr0 sites. Furthermore, the Ce3+, Zr2+, and Zr0 centers are also oxidized by the N and O atoms produced by the decomposition of NO2 (reactions 1 and 2).
V. Conclusions
Zirconia doping into ceria induces both structural and electronic modifications in ceria. Compared to pure ceria, doping with Zr in the Ce1-xZrxO2 (x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) films may provide a special chemical environment for oxygen atoms as evidenced by O K-edge XANES. The band gap in bulk Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 is 0.6 eV smaller than in bulk CeO2, with the Zr atoms in the mixed-metal oxide showing smaller positive charges than the cations in ZrO2 or CeO2. When present in a lattice of CeO2, the Zr atoms are forced to adopt larger metalO distances than in ZrO2, leading to a partial reduction in the oxidation state of this element.
In prior published work, it was found that nitrate is the dominant product for the adsorption of NO2 on fully oxidized CeO2 and ZrO2. We found here that at both 100 and 300 K, NO2 gas exposure onto reduced Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) surfaces mainly leads to chemisorbed NO2 with transformation of Ce3+ into Ce4+ cations. On partially reduced Zr(Y)O2-x(111) surfaces, chemisorbed NO2 is also the main species for NO2 dosing at 300 K with oxidation of Zr0 to Zr2+ ions. The adsorbed NOx species desorb from the oxide surfaces between 400 and 800 K. On these systems, the existence of O vacancies probably prevents the formation of nitrate species upon NO2 adsorption.
