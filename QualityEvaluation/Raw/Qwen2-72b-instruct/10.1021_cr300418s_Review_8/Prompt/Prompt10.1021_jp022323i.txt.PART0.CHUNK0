RodriguezJonathan C. HansonJae-Yong KimGang LiuAna Iglesias-JuezMarcos Fernndez-Garca View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract In this article the structural and electronic properties of CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles are investigated using time-resolved X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), and density functional calculations. CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 (x  0.5) particles in sizes between 4 and 7 nm were synthesized using a novel microemulsion method. The atoms in these nanoparticles adopted a cubic or pseudocubic crystal structure. The lattice constant decreased with increasing Zr content, varying from 5.4019 Å in CeO2 to 5.3066 Å in Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. Within the cubic structure, the Zr atoms exhibited structural perturbations that led to different types of ZrO distances and nonequivalent O atoms in the Ce1-xZrxO2 compounds. Upon the addition of Zr to CeO2, the Zr positive charge in Ce1-xZrxO2 is smaller than in pure ZrO2 whereas the Ce positive charge is larger than in pure CeO2. Combination of these geometrical and electronic effects produced Zr LIII-edge and O K-edge XANES spectra with a distinctive line-shape not seen in pure ZrO2 or CeO2. The doping with Zr increases the thermal stability of the ceria nanoparticles and their chemical reactivity toward hydrogen. At temperatures between 300 and 900 C, the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles reacted with H2 and water evolved into gas phase. XANES showed the generation of Ce3+ cations (without reduction of Zr4+) but an absence of diffraction lines different from fluorite-type ones was noted. There was an expansion in the unit cell of the reduced particles probably as a consequence of a partial Ce4+  Ce3+ transformation and the sorption of hydrogen into the bulk of the material. The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles interact with H2 and reduce at lower temperatures than bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 systems. This important difference could originate in an enhancement in chemical reactivity characteristic of nanostructured materials.

I. Introduction
Today, the protection of the environment is receiving much more attention than ever before. One of the major efforts of environmental cleanup is focused on controlling the emission of toxic pollutants produced during the combustion of fuels in automotive engines. 1,2 The so-called three-way catalysts (TWC) are commonly used to reduce the emissions of CO, NOx, and hydrocarbons from automobile exhaust. 3,4 Due to its redox properties, ceria (CeO2) is a key component in these catalysts.2,3,5 Ceria-supported noble-metal catalysts are capable of storing oxygen under oxidizing conditions and releasing oxygen under reducing conditions via the facile conversion between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states.5 Oxygen anion vacancies in ceria are considered to play an essential role in catalytic reactions. 5-9 The energetics of O vacancy creation/filling can be altered after doping ceria with a second metal. 10-12 To enhance the redox properties and thermal stability of pure ceria, zirconia (ZrO2) is often mixed as an additive to form solid solutions of the Ce1-xZrxO2 type (x  0.5). For these materials, tetragonal and cubic structures are possible. Typically, cations are randomly distributed in a fluorite-type subcell, whereas the total symmetry is governed by the anion subcell.5 It can be, however, noted that cationic order is detected in some cubic phases.5 Mixed domains or regions, instead of solid solutions, have also being reported for ceriazirconia systems.10 All Zr-doped cerium mixed oxides (with x close to 0.5) enhance the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) as well as the rate for the oxygen release in automotive catalysts.10,13-15 They also retard thermal deactivation.2,10,13,14 The focus has been on examining possible correlations between the CeO2  ZrO2 interactions and differences in the behavior of Ce1-xZrxO2 and CeO2. The mechanisms for the doping effects of Zr remain uncertain and are still a matter of debate. It has been suggested that ceria structural modifications mediated by zirconia13,14 and zirconia-stabilized defects in ceria10b are responsible for the enhanced OSC properties of ceriazirconia mixed oxides. Contributions from electronic effects (i.e., modifications in the chemical properties of the metal cations as a consequence of electronic perturbations) have been often dismissed, although it is clear that they cannot be ruled out.6,12,16 New environmental regulations emphasize the importance of more efficient technologies for controlling and decreasing the emissions of CO, NOx, and hydrocarbons in automotive engines.2 This fact has motivated a strong interest in enhancing the catalytic properties of Ce1-xZrxO2 by preparing novel structures or spatial arrays of this material.4,15,17,18 In the emerging field of nanotechnology a goal is to make nanostructures with interesting functional properties. In principle, the chemical properties of a material can change when the length scale varies from a bulk sample to nanoparticles. Recent studies have shown that nanoparticles of Ce1-xZrxO2 can be prepared by a novel microemulsion method that leads to highly homogeneous materials in terms of chemical composition (i.e., Ce,Zr distribution), having a narrow distribution of particle sizes.15,17,19 The catalysts prepared in this way are very useful for studying the thermal stability of the Ce1-xZrxO2 system and aging treatments at high temperature.17,19 Oxygen handling and thermal stability properties of Ce1-xZrxO2 nanostructured materials primarily depend on structural parameters (phase-type) and chemical homogeneity (i.e., Ce,Zr distribution through the solid solution). Generally speaking, ordered cubic (κ) or disordered t-tetragonal phases optimize redox properties 5,20 and surface Ce enrichment may enhance oxygen handling but markedly decreases thermal stability.19,20 On the other hand, the general redox properties of Ce,Zr can vary with the size of an oxide particle.20 This is grounded in the fact that all, surface and bulk, oxygen atoms are potentially involved in redox processes in a nanoparticle whereas in bulk ceria oxide, for example, only surface ones can be used.5,19,20 In this article, the structural and electronic properties of Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles are investigated using time-resolved X-ray diffraction (XRD), 21 X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), 22,23 and density functional (DF) calculations. 24 Investigations at Brookhaven National Laboratory have established the feasibility of conducting subminute, time-resolved XRD experiments when the high intensity of synchrotron radiation and new parallel data-collection devices are combined.21a This technique is ideal for studying structural transformations in Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles as a function of temperature or reaction conditions. Here, H2 chemisorption is used to study the chemical properties of the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles. The study has practical applications, as hydrogen is one of the reducing agents of exhaust gases5 and ceria-containing materials have the potential to form bronze-like phases, thus being hydrogen storage materials.26 The deviation of bulk ceria from its ideal CeO2 composition has been extensively studied by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with hydrogen. 25-27 Experimental26,27a and theoretical25 studies indicate that hydrogen can be incorporated into bulk ceria, slightly expanding the lattice of the oxide. It is worthwhile to examine if the same phenomenon can occur in the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles and study the mechanism for the partial reduction of these systems.
II. Experimental Section and Theoretical Methods
II.1. Synthesis of the Ce1-xZrxO2 Nanoparticles. The nanoparticles of Ce1-xZrxO2 were prepared using an adaptation of the microemulsion method reported previously.15,17 Three specimens were prepared with initial Ce:Zr atomic ratios of 9:1, 2:1, and 1:1 in the reacting mixtures. The corresponding Ce(III) nitrate hexahydrate (Aldrich, purity 99.9%) and zirconyl nitrate (Aldrich, purity 99.99%) were introduced in a reverse microemulsion (water in oil) using n-heptane as the organic phase, Triton X-100 (Aldrich) as surfactant, and hexanol as cosurfactant. This suspension was mixed with another one (having similar characteristics in terms of the water/organic concentrations) containing as aqueous phase an alkali solution (TMAH, Aldrich). The resulting mixtures, with all cations coprecipitated, were stirred for 24 h, centrifuged, decanted, and rinsed with methanol. After the solid portion was dried overnight at 80 C, the resulting powders were calcinated at 500 C for 2 h. These materials will be hereafter referred to as Ce0.9Zr0.1O2, Ce0.66Zr0.33O2, and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (in correlation with the corresponding atomic ratios). Chemical analysis (by ICP-AES) showed differences of Ce:Zr atomic content within 10% of the nominal values. All binary oxides displayed a pseudocubic t-structure and BET specific areas of 142 (Ce0.9Zr0.1O2), 152 (Ce0.66Zr0.33O2), and 147 (Ce0.50Zr0.50O2) m2 g-1. A ceria oxide fluorite-type reference was also synthesized (SBET = 122 m2 g-1).
II.2. Time-Resolved XRD Experiments. The time-resolved diffraction data were collected on beam line X7B of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS).21a,28 In the experiments dealing with the thermal stability and sintering of the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles, the sample was kept in a quartz capillary and heated using a small resistance heater placed under the capillary.21 A chromelalumel thermocouple was used to measure the temperature of the sample. In the experiments for the reduction with H2, samples of Ce1-xZrxO2 were loaded in an open sapphire capillary that was attached to a flow-reaction cell similar to those described in refs 29 and 30. The capillary was connected to 1/16 in. Swagelok style fittings with Vespel ferrules. A 0.010 in. chromelalumel thermocouple was inserted straight into the capillary near the oxide sample.29 The oxide sample was heated using a small resistance heater wrapped around the capillary. Diffraction patterns were recorded at temperatures in the range 25950 C under a 5% H2/95% He gas mixture (flow rate = 515 cm3/min). A MAR345 detector was used to record the in situ XRD data. The typical time required for collecting an individual diffraction pattern was in the range 0.52 min. The powder rings were integrated using the FIT2D code.31 Rietveld refinements were performed with the program GSAS32 in a manner similar to that followed in a previous work.33,34
II.3. XANES Experiments. The Ce and Zr LIII-edge XANES spectra were collected at the NSLS on beam line X19A in the fluorescence-yield mode using a boomerang-type flat crystal monochromator and a special cell with a modified Stern-Heald-Lytle detector. Beamline U7A was utilized to record the O K-edge spectra. This beamline is equipped with a toroidal-spherical grating monochromator. The O K-edge spectra were taken in the electron-yield mode by using a channeltron multiplier located near the sample surface. The energy resolution at the Ce and Zr LIII-edges and the O K-edge was close to 0.5 eV. All the XANES spectra were taken at room temperature.
II.4. Theoretical Methods. The first-principles density functional (DF) calculations reported in section III were performed using the CASTEP (Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package) suite of programs.24,35 In this code, the KohnSham implementation of DF theory is used to obtain the total energy of the system. CASTEP has an excellent track record in accurate prediction of geometry and energetics for oxide systems.6,35-40 In this code, the wave functions of valence electrons are expanded in a plane wave basis set with k-vectors within a specified energy cutoff Ecut. Tightly bound core electrons are represented by nonlocal ultrasoft pseudopotentials. 41 Brillouin Zone integration is approximated by a sum over special k-points chosen using the MonkhorstPack scheme. 42 In all the calculations, the kinetic energy cutoff Ecut (400 eV), and the density of the MonkhorstPack k-point mesh (a 4 × 4 × 4 grid in the smallest unit cells, reduced to a 4 × 4 × 2 grid for larger cells) were chosen high enough to ensure convergence of the computed structures and energetics. The exchange-correlation contribution to the total electronic energy was treated in a generalized-gradient corrected (GGA) form of the local density approximation (LDA): PerdewBurkeErnzerhoff functional. 43 The structural parameters of the bulk CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 systems in their different configurations were determined using the BroydenFletcherGoldfarbShanno (BFGS) minimization technique, with the following thresholds for the converged structures: energy change per atom less than 5 × 10-6 eV, residual force less than 0.02 eV/Å, displacement of atoms during the geometry optimization less than 0.001 Å, and root mean square (rms) of the stress tensor less than 0.1 GPa. For each optimized structure, the partial charges on the atoms were estimated by projecting the occupied one-electron eigenstates onto a localized basis set with a subsequent Mulliken population analysis. 44,45 Mulliken charges have well-known limitations, 46 but are nevertheless useful as a qualitative tool to study trends in charge distribution.
III. Results
III.1. Structural Properties and Sintering of Ce1-xZrxO2 Nanoparticles. Figure 1 shows time-resolved XRD results obtained after heating a sample of Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 nanoparticles from 25 to 900 C. Similar results were found for other Ce1-xZrxO2 systems. When the temperature is raised, the diffraction lines clearly gain intensity and become better defined. No phase transformation is visible. These changes are a consequence of an increase in the size of the particles (sintering) at temperatures above 500 C. This process is irreversible.
Figure 1 Time-resolved XRD data for the heating of Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 nanoparticles in air. Heating rate = 4.8 C/min. λ = 0.8941 Å.
From the width of the diffraction lines one can get a reasonable estimate of the average size of the CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles. 47 Figure 2 displays changes in size as a function of temperature. Initially, the particles have a size in the range 47 nm. The size of the pure CeO2 nanoparticles (7 nm) is comparable to that obtained recently using a different synthetic method.18 Around 600 C, the size of the particles starts to increase and by 900 C is close to 18 nm. For the Ce1-xZrxO2 systems the sintering also starts near 600 C, but the magnitude of the size increase diminishes when the content of Zr is raised. The Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles exhibit the highest thermal stability, and their size increases by only 2.5 nm when the temperature increases from 500 to 950 C. In this case, the extra thermal stability could be consequence of a more dense packing of the atoms in the unit cell of the compound, as we will see below. The trends in Figure 2 are important and consistent with the fact that the addition of zirconia to ceria enhances the thermal stability of automotive catalysts.2,10,13,14 Figure 2 Effects of heating on the size of a series of Ce1-xZrxO2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.33, 0.5) nanoparticles.Table 1 lists lattice constants determined from a Rietveld refinement of our XRD data for the CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles. The small size of these systems puts a limit in the accuracy of our structural analysis, and the a parameter listed in some cases in fact represents an average value for a pseudocubic phase with a slight tetragonal distortion. For comparison, we also include in Table 1 lattice constants calculated with DF for bulk CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 in a cubic structure. In the experimental and theoretical results, one can see the same trend: as the content of Zr increases, there is a reduction in the lattice constant of the oxide. For x < 0.5, the lattice parameter displays a linear relationship with Zr content of the mixed oxide.5b,48 An identical result has been found in XRD studies for bulk Ce1-xZrxO25b,48 although the slope of the linear relationship has been shown to be dependent on particle size.5b The lattice constant decrease is a consequence of the smaller size of Zr with respect to Ce.20b,49 The DF calculations indicate that this difference in size is quite important for the local structure of the metal cations. Even within a cubic structure, the Zr atoms exhibit a structural perturbation that leads to different types of ZrO distances and nonequivalent O atoms in the Ce1-xZrxO2 compounds. In essence, it is very difficult for the Zr atoms to adopt the large metaloxygen distances expected in a lattice of CeO2. The perturbations in the ZrO coordination sphere could be responsible for the high oxygen mobility seen in ceriazirconia mixed oxides.20b,48 Table 1: Lattice Constant (a) for CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 ananoparticles, XRDdata(Å) abulk, DFresults(Å) CeO2 5.4019 5.46(5.4108)a Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 5.3984 Ce0.875Zr0.125O2   5.44 Ce0.75Zr0.25O2   5.39 Ce0.66Zr0.33O2 5.3573 Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 5.3066 5.30 Ce0.25Zr0.75O2   5.17 Ce0.125Zr0.875O2   5.15 ZrO2   5.11 aXRD value for bulk CeO2.Figure 3 shows how the unit cell parameter of the CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles changes as a function of temperature. The results for bulk CeO2 and the CeO2 nanoparticles are close, showing a continuous expansion of the unit cell from 25 to 950 C. Something similar is observed for the nanoparticles independently of the content of Zr. In the nanoparticles the cell expansion at temperatures above 600 C is accompanied by sintering (Figure 2). Comparison of the slopes of the curves in Figures 2 and 3 seems to indicate that the sintering process does not have a major effect in the unit cell expansion of the nanoparticles. This expansion is probably a direct result of an increase in temperature (i.e., thermal movement of the atoms within the unit cell).Figure 3 Cell dimension as a function of temperature for a series of nanoparticles: (a) Ce0.5Zr0.5O2; (b) Ce0.66Zr0.33O2; (c) Ce0.90Zr0.10O2; (d) CeO2.
III.2. Electronic Properties of the Ce1-xZrxO2 Nanoparticles. The electronic properties of the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles were investigated using XANES and DF calculations. XANES measurements were done at the Ce and Zr LIII-edges and at the O K-edge. The spectra for the Ce LIII-edge of the nanoparticles showed energies and the line shape reported for bulk CeO2.23,50 Thus, the limited size of these systems or the doping with Zr did not induce formation of a significant amount of Ce3+. Figure 4 shows Zr LIII-edge spectra for bulk ZrO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles. At the temperature at which the spectra were acquired (300 K), a monoclinic crystal structure is the thermodynamically stable phase for ZrO2.6,51 The Zr LIII-edge of this oxide is characterized by four distinctive features. The two main ones (a, b) correspond to electronic transitions from the occupied Zr 2p orbitals to the empty Zr 4d orbitals, which are split into orbitals with t and e symmetry.52 In oxides, the relative intensity of the a and b peaks depends strongly on the chemical environment around the Zr cations.52 In the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles, the Zr atoms are in a pseudocubic environment and the relative intensity of the b peak is stronger than that observed for monoclinic ZrO2 or for tetragonal Zr-doped Y2O3.52 The ab peak separation in Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 is 0.25 eV larger than that in ZrO2. As the concentration of zirconium in Ce1-xZrxO2 increases, the Zr LIII-edge line shape changes and becomes closer to that in pure ZrO2 (bottom of Figure 4).
Figure 4 Zr LIII-edge XANES spectra for bulk ZrO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles.
Figure 5 displays O K-edge XANES spectra for a series of Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles, including reference spectra for bulk ZrO2 and CeO2. The features labeled 4f, 5deg, and 5dt2g in pure CeO2 are related to electronic transitions from the O 1s core levels to the empty cerium 4f, 5deg, and 5dt2glevels, respectively.53 The O K-edge spectrum of ZrO2 comes mainly from O 1s  Zr(4d) electronic transitions,6,22 and the two main peaks reflect the splitting of the Zr 4d orbitals into levels with eg and t2g symmetry.52 The O K-edge spectra of the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles significantly change as a function of Zr doping. They exhibit features that match very well those found previously for bulklike films of Ce1-xZrxO2.6 The O K-edge spectra of Ce1-xZrxO2 compounds have a distinctive line shape that cannot be attributed to a sum of CeO2 and ZrO2 peaks. This is consistent with the results of our DF calculations, which show CeO and ZrO bond distances in Ce1-xZrxO2 not seen in the isolated oxides (i.e., some O atoms are in a special chemical environment).
Figure 5 O K-edge XANES spectra for bulk ZrO2, Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles, and bulk CeO2.
Using DF calculations, we investigated the charge distribution in bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 and small stoichiometric clusters. In agreement with early studies,6,51,54-56 our calculations indicate that bulk CeO2 and ZrO2 are far from being fully ionic compounds. This is valid independent of the method of calculation and the type of basis set used to describe the atomic orbitals of Zr, Ce and O.6,51,55,56 In the valence bands of ceria and zirconia there is a very significant amount of metal character. Upon the addition of Zr to CeO2, we found that in Ce1-xZrxO2 the positive charge on Zr is smaller than in pure ZrO2, whereas the positive charge on Ce is larger than in pure CeO2. This is illustrated in the results of Figure 6 for bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 in a cubic structure and was also found in DF calculations after replacing Ce with Zr in the clusters of Figure 7. Interestingly, when Zr replaces Ce in bulk ceria or CenO2n clusters, the ZrO distances obtained are larger than in the corresponding ZrO2 systems, and at the same time the CeO distances become shorter than in the initial CeO2 compounds. The variations in cation charge seen in the bulk compounds (Figure 6) and small clusters track changes in cationoxygen distances: the larger the metaloxygen bond length, the smaller the charge in the cation.
Figure 6 DF results for bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 in a cubic structure. The two top panels show the calculated Zr charge and average ZrO bond length. The bottom two panels display the calculated Ce charge and the average CeO bond length.
Figure 7 Ce2O4 and Ce8O16 clusters investigated in the DF calculations. Ce atoms (white spheres) were replaced with Zr to generate compounds with Ce1-xZrxO2 stoichiometry.
Returning to the Zr LIII-edge XANES spectra in Figure 4, it is likely that the changing line shape as a function of Zr concentration is accompanied by perturbations in the occupancy of the Zr 4d orbitals and in the arrangement of the O atoms around the Zr cations. Corresponding changes in Ce-cation charges seem less influencial in the Ce LIII-edge, probably due to energy resolution problems and the always large concentration of Ce in the samples. The O K-edge (Figure 5), however, suggests a modest stabilization of Ce orbitals (clearly visible for the 4f resonance in the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 sample). As the continuum resonances have an inverse dependence with the square of the coordination distance,23 this shift has an electronic ground, as is likely induced by the larger positive charge detected for cerium cations in the Ce,Zr mixed oxides with respect to ceria. Crystal field effects appear of lesser importance when these two oxide types are compared, as the eg/t2g energy separation seems poorly sensitive to the Zr content of the material.
III.3. Reaction of the Ce1-xZrxO2 Nanoparticles with Hydrogen. In many situations oxide catalysts are activated by partial reduction in hydrogen. 57 Hydrogen is one of the reducing agents in automotive exhaust gases.5 The deviation of bulk ceria from its ideal CeO2 composition has been extensively studied by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with hydrogen.25-27 Similar experiments have also been carried out for bulk Ce1-xZrxO2.20,48,58 We investigated the partial reduction of the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles using time-resolved XRD and XANES. Figure 8 shows diffraction patterns obtained after heating Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 nanoparticles from 25 to 900 C under a 5% H2/95% He stream (20 cm3/min). As the temperature increases, there is a narrowing of the diffraction peaks together with a clear shift in position. The narrowing indicates sintering of the nanoparticles (see above) and the shift to the lower angle in 2θ is a consequence of an expansion in their unit cell as a result of introducing O vacancies and/or sorbing hydrogen during the reduction process (see below). Similar trends were observed in the corresponding XRD data for nanoparticles of CeO2, Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, and Ce0.66Zr0.33O2. The diffraction results did not show the formation of reduced oxides with the crystal structures of CeO1.71, 59 Ce2O3, 60 or Ce2Zr2O7+x pyrochlore structures.5b,20b
Figure 8 Time-resolved XRD data for the heating of Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 nanoparticles under a flow of 5% H295% He. Heating rate = 5.9 C/min. λ = 0.9034 Å.
Figure 9 shows data for the isothermal reduction of Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 at 525 C. In the first 20 min, the temperature of the sample was ramped from 25 to 525 C. This produced an expansion in the unit cell of the nanoparticles. Then, the sample was exposed to a 5% H295% He stream. Water evolution was observed with a mass spectrometer located at the exit of the reaction cell and this was accompanied by an additional expansion of the unit cell. In similar experiments, XANES measurements at the Ce LIII-edge gave spectra with the line shape expected for a mixture of Ce4+ and Ce3+.23,50,58 On the other hand, there were relatively minor changes in the Zr LIII-edge spectrum with respect to the fully oxidized sample. This is consistent with previous studies for bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 systems, 6,61 which show that it is easier to reduce Ce4+ than Zr4+ in the mixed oxide. Thus, the expansion in the unit cell seen in Figures 8 and 9 probably reflects a change in the cation size when going from Ce4+ (small size) to Ce3+ (larger size).6,20b,60 Sorption of hydrogen into the nanoparticles also could contribute to enlarge the unit cell size.25,26,27a Using DF calculations and following previous studies for bulk CeO2,25 we investigated the effects of one hydrogen atom placed inside the main cavity of the crystal structures of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 with overall stoichiometries of H0.25Ce(Zr)O2 and H0.125Ce(Zr)O2 (Figure 10). The H did not remain at the high-symmetry position in the center of a cavity, instead preferring to interact with O centers, forming hydroxyl species. These species can be seen as the precursors for the removal of O during the reduction process. In the case of systems with H0.5Ce(Zr)O2 stoichiometry (two hydrogens inside a cavity), sorbed atomic H was energetically unstable and transformed into H2 molecules. Table 2 shows the calculated lattice constants for the systems in Figure 10. The sorption of H produced an unit-cell expansion of 0.40.7% for a H0.125Ce(Zr)O2 stoichiometry, and 11.6% at a H0.25Ce(Zr)O2 stoichiometry. Thus, in the experiments of Figure 9 the concentration of H inside the nanoparticles is probably less than expected for a H0.25Ce(Zr)O2 stoichiometry.
Figure 9 Data for the isothermal reduction of Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 at 525 C. In the first 20 min, the temperature of the sample was ramped from 25 to 525 C. Then, the sample was exposed to a 5% H295% He stream. The left axis shows the variation in the unit cell parameter (a, Å) and corresponds to the dashed curve. The right axis displays the measured intensity for the water signal in a mass spectrometer and corresponds to the solid curve.
Figure 10 Unit cells used in DF calculations for H0.25Ce(Zr)O2 and H0.125Ce(Zr)O2 systems. The ratio of Ce/Zr varied from CeO2 to Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, and finally to Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. White spheres represent Ce or Zr atoms. Dark spheres correspond to O atoms. The small gray spheres denote H atoms.
Figure 11 shows how the size of the unit cell of Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles changes as a function of temperature when they are reduced in hydrogen. The cell expansions are much larger than seen during simple heating (compare to Figure 3) as a consequence of a chemical reaction (Ce3+ formation) and the sorption of hydrogen. The OSC of Ce1-xZrxO2 is clearly related to the ratio of Ce/Zr.10,13-15,20 The magnitude of the changes in the lattice constant for the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles during reduction also depends on the Ce/Zr ratio. In Figure 11, similar trends are observed for the Ce0.9Zr0.1O2, Ce0.66Zr0.33O2, and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 systems. Substantial increases in cell dimension occur from 300 to 500 C, and from 600 to 900 C. The nanoparticles of CeO2 have a different behavior: there is a minor cell expansion between 200 and 600 C, and a rapid increase above 700 C. It can be noted, however, that the Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 material shows the two mentioned, well-defined regions of cell dimension variation, but only one abrupt jump followed by a smooth increase is detected for Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. This can be rationalized by considering that, in ceria, surface and bulk oxygen mobility are well-differentiated processes whereas in the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 mixed oxide cannot be distinguished.5b,20 These results indicate that the variation from a ceria-like behavior to a ceriazirconia is progressive, although very significant changes are already observed in terms of initial temperature (e.g., energy) when only 10% of Ce atoms are substituted by Zr.

On the other hand, it is clear that the CeO2 nanoparticles exhibit the lowest reactivity in Figure 11. This agrees with trends found in H2-TPR experiments for bulk CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2,20a,48 and it is frequently linked to the OSC improvement seen in Zr-doped ceria. 20,62 During the oxygen release process, there is stress in the oxide lattice as a consequence of the difference in atomic size of Ce4+ (0.97 Å) and Ce3+ (1.14 Å).20b The introduction of relatively small Zr4+ ions (0.84 Å) into the ceria framework could compensate the volume increment, and ease the valence change (Ce4+  Ce3+) and reduction process in Ce1-xZrxO2.20b,62 Interestingly, the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles in Figure 11 start to reduce at lower temperatures than bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 systems (>400 C).20a,48 This important difference could originate in an enhancement in chemical reactivity due to differences in the cationanion energetics, attributable to the nanostructured properties of the materials.Ceria-supported noble-metal catalysts release oxygen under reducing conditions and are capable to store oxygen under oxidizing conditions.5 We carried out studies of reduction/oxidation for the CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles. These studies revealed that the full reoxidation of partially reduced nanoparticles is possible at lower temperatures than those reported for the full reoxidation of bulk ceria.20 Figure 12 displays XRD data for a fresh Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 system (4 nm particle size, left panel) and a Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 system preannealed to 950 C (10 nm particle size, right panel). The 4 nm particles were exposed to a mixture of 5% H295% He at 25 C and then heated at 510 C. This induced oxide reduction with an expansion in the unit cell. Subsequently, the hydrogen was replaced with a mixture of mainly He plus some O2 (<1%), and finally the He was replaced with pure O2. The last two steps lead to a contraction in the oxide unit cell due to the flushing of the sorbed hydrogen and the reoxidation of Ce3+. At the end, the system had a unit cell dimension close to that observed for 4 nm Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 at 510 C. In the experiment for the 10 nm particles, the sample was first heated to 525 C and then exposed to a stream of 5% H295% He for 40 min. After partial reduction, H2 was replaced with He and a trace of O2 (<1%), and then pure O2, which led to almost full reoxidation. To do experiments similar to those seen in Figure 12 for bulk CeO2, one needs temperatures much higher than 510525 C to obtain a significant reduction (cell expansion) and subsequent full reoxidation.20,48 Again, the higher chemical reactivity of the CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles could come from differences in the cationanion energetics attributable to the nanostructured properties of the materials.
IV. Summary and Conclusions
In this article the structural and electronic properties of CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles were investigated using time- resolved XRD, XANES, and DF calculations. CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 (x  0.5) particles in sizes between 4 and 7 nm were synthesized using a novel microemulsion method. The atoms in these nanoparticles were arranged in a cubic or pseudocubic crystal structure. The lattice constant decreased with increasing Zr content, varying from 5.4019 Å in CeO2 to 5.3066 Å in Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. Within the cubic structure, the Zr atoms exhibited structural perturbations that led to different types of ZrO distances and nonequivalent oxygen atoms in the Ce1-xZrxO2 compounds. Upon the addition of Zr to CeO2, the Zr positive charge in Ce1-xZrxO2 was smaller than in pure ZrO2 whereas the Ce positive charge was larger than in pure CeO2. The variations in cation charge track changes in cationoxygen distances: the larger the metaloxygen bond length, the smaller the charge in the cation. The combination of structural (metaloxygen distance) and electronic (mainly cation charge) effects produced Zr LIII-edge and O K-edge XANES spectra with a distinctive line shape not seen in pure ZrO2 or CeO2.
The doping with Zr increased the thermal stability of the ceria nanoparticles (reducing sintering above 600 C) and their chemical reactivity toward hydrogen. At temperatures between 300 and 900 C, the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles reacted with H2 and water evolved into the gas phase. A smooth evolution was observed with Zr content in the Ce1-xZrxO2 reduction behavior in going from the two-step (surface and bulk) mechanism characteristic of ceria to a single step typical of binary systems with a Ce/Zr atomic ratio close to 1. XANES showed the generation of Ce3+ cations (without reduction of Zr4+) but no diffraction lines were detected for the formation of crystal structures similar to bulk CeO1.71 or Ce2O3. There was an expansion in the unit cell of the reduced particles probably as a consequence of a partial Ce4+  Ce3+ transformation and the sorption of hydrogen. Hydrogen could be stored at the bulk of the mixed oxides with a H/cation ratio close to 0.2. The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles interact with H2 and get reduced at lower temperatures than bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 systems. This important difference could originate in an enhancement in chemical reactivity due to differences in cationanion energetics, attributable to the nanostructured properties of the materials.
