Compared to pure ceria, reduction is facilitated and the reducibility increases in the sequence of CeO2-SnO2, CeO2-GeO2, and CeO2-SiO2, which correlates with the decrease of the ionic radii of the solutes. For low solute concentrations, there is an inverse relation between high reducibility and the solution energy of tetravalent solutes. CeO2-PbO2 is unique in the sense that the initial reduction occurs by PbIVPbII instead of the usual CeIVCeIII reaction. Among the investigated ceria compounds, CeO2-PbO2 has the lowest reduc- tion energy and rather low solution energy. We have studied how the solution and reduction energies depend on the concentration of Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Ti, Zr, Hf, and Th solute ions. While the solution energy increases monotonously with concentration, the reduction energy first decreases, as compared to pure ceria except for Th, which exhibits a small increase, and with further increase of solute concentration, it either remains almost constant Zr, Hf, and Th or slightly increases Ti, Si, Ge, and Sn.

I. INTRODUCTION
Ceria based materials are found in a wide range of appli- cations,for example,ceria-zirconia mixed oxides Ce1yZryO2 are used for oxygen storage release in three- way catalysts for automotive exhaust treatment.1,2 CeO2 doped with divalent or trivalent ions is a promising electro- lyte material for application in solid oxide fuel cells.35 In three-way catalysts, ceria is used to control the oxygen at- mosphere by making use of the ability of ceria to release oxygen by forming oxygen vacancies under reducing condi- tions and, conversely, to store oxygen by filling oxygen va- cancies under oxidizing conditions. The excellent oxygen storage capacity OSC is an inherent property of ceria in the cubic fluorite structure.6 The addition of ZrO2 further im- proves the OSC as well as the thermal stability.2,710 Using density functional theory DFT calculations, we have previ- ously investigated how small amounts of tetravalent ions from group 4b in the Periodic Table, i.e., Zr4+, Hf4+, Ti4+,and Th4+, influence the redox thermodynamics and kinetics of ceria.11 We concluded that reduction is facilitated by dis- solving TiO2 largest improvement, HfO2, or ZrO2 least improvement, while ThO2 makes the reduction slightly more difficult. The migration barrier for the diffusion of oxy- gen ions is much lower in the neighborhood of a Ti ion largest decrease, Hf ion, or Zr ion least decrease, which increases the rate of oxygen diffusion. The binding energy of vacancies and solutes, which decreases from Ti, Hf, Zr, to Th, influences diffusion in the opposite direction by increas- ing the activation energy for diffusion. In Ref. 11, we ratio- nalized the properties of ceria solid solutions in terms of defect cluster relaxations that are coupled to a gain in the band energy. Small ions such as Ti4+ enable a favorable re- laxation pattern that allows large Ce3+ ions to fit into the ceria matrix, while large ions such as Th4+ instead worsen these properties. The benefits of dissolving ZrO2 into CeO2 are well established,2,710 but HfO2 Ref. 12 and TiO2 Refs. 13 and 14 have also been identified as promising alterna- tives. Recent experiments15,16 have reported a considerable decrease of the reduction energy for Ce1yZryO2 y=0.19 compared to CeO2, which is in agreement with our theoret- ical predictions in Ref. 11. Nevertheless, experiments sug- gest a slightly larger decrease than theory.15,16 In conjunction with Ti, Zr, Hf, and Th, the group 4a elements, i.e., Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb, form tetravalent oxygen compounds and pro- spectively they can be used as solutes or dopants to optimize the properties of ceria. Moreover, Si is one of the main con- taminants in commercial CeO2 grades and thus it is impor- tant to understand its effect on redox thermodynamics and structural properties. Solid solutions of ceria and tetravalent ions from group 4a have only been scarcely discussed in the literature. One reason for this is the difficulty of forming the solid solutions in a controlled way. A few studies have been undertaken on composite and mixed CeO2-SiO2 Refs. 1720 materials, which under certain conditions were re- ported to possess favorable redox properties compared to pure CeO2 and CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides. Due to the high complexity of these materials, interpretation of experiments is often nontrivial but could be made easier if the redox properties of the constituent phases were established.
CeO2-SnO2 materials were studied by Lin et al.21,22 and they found excellent redox properties and high catalytic activity.
The development of new OSC materials will benefit from better knowledge of the redox properties and the stability ranges of CeO2-MO2 M=Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb solution phases.
In the present paper, we address the above issues using theoretical methods based on the density functional theory.

The DFT calculations were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package VASP in the framework of the projector augmented wave method.2327 In order to account for the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion among the Ce 4f electrons, we have applied the LDA+U scheme formulated by Dudarev et al.28 The exchange-correlation effects were treated within the local density approximation LDA to- gether with a Hubbard U parameter of 6 eV since that is a good choice to describe the structural, electronic band struc- ture,and energetic properties of CeO2, Ce2O3,and CeO2x.29 We modeled defect properties using a 222 supercell 96 sites, derived from the ideal fluorite structure.
For small solute concentrations, the volume of the supercell was set equal to the calculated volume of pure ceria.29 This results in an underestimation of the vacancy formation en- ergy see below by 0.040.05 eV 1.4%1.6%, which is negligible on the scale of vacancy formation energy values.
This range was estimated through the volume relaxation of CeO1.9688, Ce1.9688Ti0.0312O1.9688, and Ce1.9688Si0.0312O1.9688,as well as of the corresponding oxidized compounds, i.e., Ce1.9688Ti0.0312O2 and Ce1.9688Si0.0312O2. It is more important to include volume relaxation for high solute concentrations and, in our case, it was included for y=0.25. All internal structural parameters were relaxed until the Hellman- Feynman forces on each ion were negligible 0.02 eV/Å.
We used a plane-wave cutoff energy of 400 eV and applied a 222 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh30 four irreducible k points with Gaussian smearing of 0.20 eV.29 For accurate calculation of the electronic density of states DOS, we ap- plied a 333 k-point mesh30 eight irreducible k points and the modified tetrahedron method of Blchl.31 All the band structure properties were derived from the accurate DOS calculations, but to improve visibility of atomiclike peaks, a smearing was also applied to all the DOS plots.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Vacancy formation in Ce0.9688M0.0312O2
Ceria releases oxygen according to the reaction CeO2 CeO2x + x
2O2.
1 The equilibrium is controlled by the oxygen chemical poten- tial and for a given x, it is determined by Hf v TSf v + RT 2 lnPO2 = 0. 2 Here, PO2 is the partial pressure of O2, T is the temperature,and R is the molar gas constant. The vacancy formation en- thalpy Hf v and entropy Sf v are defined as Xf v = 1 xXCeO2x + 1
2XO2 1
xXCeO2,3 where X denotes either enthalpy H or entropy S. We as- sume that Hf v is equal to the vacancy formation energy, Ef v.
Low Ef v means high reducibility, which translates into a high
OSC. Theoretical values of Ef
v derived from DFT calcula- tions are underestimated compared to experiments.29,32 By creating one vacancy in the 222 supercell x=0.0312,we estimate Ef v to be 3.61 eV,29 to be compared with mea- sured values of 4.655.00 eV for bulk reduction.33 The the- oretical underestimation is largely due to the overestimation of the O2 binding energy within DFT29,31 1.2 eV/0.5 O2 in the LDA and consequently the underestimation is inde- pendent of the conditions in the ceria material itself and can easily be corrected.
When a vacancy is formed in pure ceria, two electrons localize on two f-level traps on two nearest neighbor NN Ce ions, thus transforming into Ce3+. This process is influ- enced by the presence of +4 solute ions. In Ref. 11, we identified an almost linear dependence of Ef v on the ionic radius of the +4 solutes from group 4b, which is illustrated in Fig. 1a where these data have been reproduced. In this paper, the ionic radius34 either refers to eightfold Ti4+, Zr4+, Hf4+, Th4+, Sn4+, and Pb4+ or fourfold Si4+ and Ge4+ co- ordination of the tetravalent ions. Si4+ and Ge4+ strongly pre- fer fourfold rather than eightfold coordination and conse- quently there is no data for the ionic radius of the eightfold coordination. One may assume that the +4 ions from group 4a should follow a similar pattern; however, Fig. 1a, at least partly, does not support this reasoning. The differences between the group 4a and 4b ions must originate from the electronic structure of the solid solutions.
According to Fig. 1a, the vacancy formation energy in Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2 is higher than the extrapolation from the group 4b elements; however, the absolute value is still some- what lower than for Ce0.9688Ti0.0312O2, which has the smallest vacancy formation energy of the group 4b ceria compounds.
The explanation for the facile vacancy formation in Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2 is that the small size of the Si4+ ions en- ables the large Ce3+ ions in reduced ceria to better fit into the ceria matrix. This is directly visible in the Ce3+-O2nearest neighbor coordination, which mimics the calculated coordi- nation in the hexagonal A-type form of the Ce2O3 sesquioxide,11,29 in which all the Ce ions are trivalent. The geometry relaxation is coupled to a gain in the band energy the sum of the energies of all the individual electrons; in DFT, the sum of the one-electron energies, via a decrease of the separation between the occupied Ce 4f states in the band gap and the O 2p valence band edge hereafter referred to as the band separation, see Fig. 3, as compared to pure ceria.11 Among the group 4b ceria compounds, the largest decrease of the band separation was found for Ce0.9688Ti0.0312O1.9688
0.27 eV,11 which also exhibits the smallest Ef
v. In agree- ment with this observation, the decrease of the band separa- tion is even larger for Ce0.9688Si0.0312O1.9688 0.30 eV. One way of quantifying the effect of local relaxation of the Ce3+-M4+-Va clusters is to calculate the structural relaxation energy, i.e., the effect of local strain minimization, in the ANDERSSON et al.

174119-2 vacancy-containing material. Figure 1b shows that the un- relaxed vacancy formation energy Ef v unrelaxed is mark- edly lower for Si4+ containing ceria compounds than for any of the group 4b ceria compounds. This is a consequence of the small size of the Si4+ ions and their strong preference to surround themselves with four oxygen ions in a tetrahedral arrangement fourfold coordination. In the regular fluorite structure no vacancies, the cations are surrounded by eight oxygen ions in a cubic arrangement. The Si4+-O2coordina- tion in Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2 is illustrated in Fig. 2. In order to form the stable tetrahedron arrangement, the O2ions must leave their original fluorite lattice positions and occupy interstitial-like sites inside the matrix. Hereafter, these ions are denoted OT. The oxygen ions that are not a part of the tetrahedron move away from the Si4+ ion. The Si-O distances in the tetrahedron are 1.685 Å, which is significantly shorter than the average cation-oxygen distance in the ceria matrix 2.34 Å. The lowest-energy structural configuration of the vacancy-free material cannot be found by starting the relaxation from the positions of the ideal fluorite structure.
The reason is that the local reconstruction around the +4 solute ion requires the symmetry of the eight nearest neigh- bor oxygen ions to be broken, which does not occur unless temperature or an external distortion is applied in the simu- lations. We achieve this by creating an oxygen vacancy and,after relaxing the vacancy-containing structure, the lowest- energy vacancy-free state is obtained by refilling the vacant oxygen position. The large distortions of the lattice that ac- company the formation of the Si4+-O2tetrahedron in the vacancy-free material explain the low values for the unre- laxed vacancy formation energy Ef v unrelaxed and for the relaxation energy Er. For Ce0.9688Si0.0312O1.9688, most of the relaxation, which for the group 4b ceria solid solutions is associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies, already takes place during the reconstruction around the Si4+ ion in the vacancy-free material.

174119-3 sity of states PDOS for the Si 3s, Si 3p, and Ce 4f orbitals,given as an average over all the Si and Ce atoms in the unit cell, respectively. The O 2p projections are divided into the contribution from the OT atoms and from the remaining O atoms. The O 2p projections that are restricted to the OT atoms reveal that localization occurs for some OT 2p states.
These states are situated about 0.51.0 eV below the main O 2p band see Fig. 3 and integration yields a total of two electrons.
The formation of the Si4+-O2tetrahedron will effectively enlarge the octahedral interstitial positions in the fluorite lat- tice, which should lower the energy that is needed to put an oxygen ion in one of these positions. In pure ceria, our cal- culations predict that an energy of 4.05 eV is required to form an oxygen interstitial in the octahedral position from one of the lattice oxygen ions, i.e., a Frenkel defect. Such a high value casts some doubt upon the conclusion that a large fraction of Frenkel defects should exist in pure CeO2.35,36 If the oxygen ion in the octahedral interstitial position is placed next to its original lattice position, now a vacant site, it spon- taneously relaxes back into this site. In Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2, the energy needed to form a Frenkel defect is lowered to
3.09 eV. We calculated this value by placing the vacancy
close to the Si4+ ion in the 222 supercell and the oxygen ion in an octahedral interstitial site away from the vacancy.
The gain in energy compared to pure ceria mainly comes from the formation of the low-energy Si4+-O2tetrahedron.
This mechanism may, at least partly, be responsible for the observation of interstitial oxygen ions in nanoscale CeO2 powders.35,36 The properties of Ce0.9688Ge0.0312O2 are similar to the properties of Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2. Both the relaxed and unre- laxed vacancy formation energies are shifted slightly up- wards and, equivalently, the occupied Ce f states move away from the O 2p valence band edge by 0.03 eV compared to Ce0.9688Si0.0312O1.9688 band separation. The Ge4+-OT dis- tance is 1.83 Å, which is higher than for Si4+ but still sig- nificantly lower than the distance in the ideal fluorite struc- ture.
The driving force to form a tetrahedral arrangement with the neighboring oxygen ions is weaker for Sn4+ and Pb4+ than for Si4+ or Ge4+, but from the projected density of states not shown, we conclude that there is still some localization of electrons on the oxygen ions that surround the tetravalent ions. These states are still situated below the main O 2p band. The localization is not restricted to the OT ions but it involves instead all the eight nearest neighbor oxygen ions in the fluorite lattice. The average Sn4+-OT and Pb4+-OT dis- tances are
2.07
and
2.22 Å,
respectively.
Unlike Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2 and Ce0.9688Ge0.0312O2, the vacancy forma- tion energy for Ce0.9688Sn0.0312O2 lies on the line that indi- cates the trend for the group 4b ceria compounds dashed line in Fig. 1a, while the corresponding value for Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2 is surprisingly low see Fig. 1a. The va- cancy formation energy for Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2 is, as a matter of fact, lower than for any of the other solute ions, in spite of the fact that Pb4+ has the largest ionic radius with the ex- ception of Th4+. This is the result of a different vacancy formation mechanism in Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2 than for any other ceria solid solutions. For Ce0.9688M0.0312O1.9688 with M being Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, Si, Ge, or Sn, the two electrons that are left behind when an oxygen atom is released from ceria localize on two nearest neighbor Ce ions, which thus transform from +4 to +3 and, due to Hunds rule, they also exhibit a local- ized magnetic moment of 1B/Ce3+.
However,for Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O1.9688, the two extra electrons instead occupy the states of mainly O 2p and Pb 6s character that are situ- ated in the band gap 0.64 eV above the top of the O 2p valence band Fig. 4. This signature is indicative of the pres- ence of a Pb2+ ion. This implies that for Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2,the initial reduction is, in fact, due to PbIVPbII rather than the usual CeIVCeIII reaction. The total magnetic moment of Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O1.9688 is zero, while it is 2B for the ferromagnetically aligned solution for Ce0.9688M0.0312O1.9688 M=Ce, Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, Si, Ge, or Sn,where the reduction occurs via CeIVCeIII. The solu- tion for Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O1.9688 with two localized Ce f elec- trons can be obtained as a metastable state by starting the calculation from a different magnetic and structural configu- ration. This solution is 0.60 eV higher in energy triangle in Fig. 1a than the ground-state solution. The metastable Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O1.9688 solution predicts that the vacancy for- mation energy increases compared to Ce0.9688Sn0.0312O2 and,as indicated by the dash-dotted line in Fig. 1a, this is in 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 Density (states/eV) Total DOS Unoccupied Ce 4f O 2p valence band Localized Si 3s/O 2p states Band separation Band gap Localized Ce 4f Spin UP Spin DOWN -20 -15 -10 -5 0 5 Energy (eV)

174119-4 agreement with the general trend for the vacancy formation energy. For the metastable solution, the PDOS does not in- dicate any O 2p or Pb 6s states just above the top of the valence band, but instead localized Ce f states two elec- trons appear in the band gap. Our calculations show that the average nearest neighbor Pb-O distance taken for the seven nearest neighbor oxygen ions is 0.2 Å higher for the Pb2+ solution than for the Pb4+ solution, as expected from the larger size of the Pb2+ ion compared to the Pb4+ ion. We have also been able to estimate the vacancy formation energy in Ce0.9688Sn0.0312O2 and Ce0.9688Ge0.0312O2 according to the MIVMII reaction. These values are 1.31 and 2.11 eV higher in energy than for the corresponding CeIVCeIII reactions, respectively. Since Si, Zr, Hf, and Th are very unstable in their divalent modifications, we were not able to estimate the vacancy formation energies according to the MIVMII reaction. Ti exists in the divalent state, e.g.,in TiO.37 Nevertheless, we were unable to calculate any ac- curate value for the metastable TiIVTiII reaction. The tendency of the M4+ ions to undergo reduction is directly related to the energy associated with the MO2MO+O2/2 reaction. Here, MO2 and MO refer to the ground-state struc- tures for each metal oxide. Table I summarizes the experi- mental reaction enthalpies at 298 K for the Pb, Sn, Ge, and Ti oxides there is no data for the other elements since those reactions do not occur. From these numbers, we conclude that the reaction enthalpy for Pb is significantly lower than for the other elements, which is in agreement with our theo- retical prediction of the reducibility of Pb4+ ions in Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2 and the metastable character of this reduc- tion mechanism for the other investigated solute ions.
Equation 2 establishes the equilibrium relation between T and PO2 for CeO2x and Ce0.9688M0.0312O2x. For x =0.0312, Hf v is known from the calculated values of Ef v pre- sented in Fig. 1a corrected for the overestimation of the O2 binding energy by 1.2 eV/0.5 O2. For Sf v, the experimental value for CeO2x Ref. 38 can be used as a first approxima- tion.

Ce0.9688M0.0312O1.9688 The oxygen diffusivity, which, for example, determines how fast the bulk ceria material can exchange oxygen with the surrounding environment, is influenced by interactions between the dissolved +4 ions and the oxygen vacancies.
The diffusivity is governed by the activation energy for dif- fusion, which is identified as the sum of the migration barrier for moving an oxygen ion from one lattice site to a neigh- boring vacant site Em and the binding energy between va- cancies and tetravalent solutes. We estimated Em Fig. 6a by calculating the energy that is needed to place an oxygen ion in the saddle point position that is situated next to the +4 solute ion in the 222 supercell model of Ce0.96880M0.0312O1.9688. The saddle point is taken halfway be- tween the oxygen sites involved in the diffusion process.39 The migrating oxygen ion was only allowed to relax in the directions perpendicular to the migration path, while the re- maining ions were fully relaxed. Compared to pure ceria, the barrier decreases significantly for Sn4+ and Pb4+, which is understood from the fact that the small size of these ions allows a simple passage through the saddle point. The barrier for the saddle point next to a Pb2+ ion remember the PbIVPbII reaction mechanism is much higher than for the Pb4+ case 1.52 eV compared to 0.27 eV, which is due to the large size of the Pb2+ ion. This implies that the diffusing oxygen ions in Pb-doped ceria would avoid the migration paths involving saddle points close to the Pb2+ ions. One may speculate that the Pb2+ barrier is lowered by an instantaneous electronic transition from Pb2+ to Pb4+,accompanied by the formation of two Ce3+ ions, when an oxygen ion passes through the saddle point. Our calculations show that such a reaction is energetically favorable. Even though both the Si4+ and the Ge4+ ions are small, their tetra- hedral oxygen coordination results in migration barriers that are of the same magnitude as for the larger Sn4+ and Pb4+ ions. We note that the migration barriers that enter the acti- vation energy for diffusion correspond to an effective bulk barrier and should not be directly identified with the barrier close to the M4+ ions, at least not for low concentration of solute ions.
Oxygen vacancies bind to the +4 solute ions and Fig. 6b contains our calculated binding energies. The Pb2+-Va bind- ing energy is approximately 0.1 eV higher than for Pb4+-Va Pb4+-Va is shown in Fig. 6b. For small solute concentra- tions, defect binding will increase the activation energy for diffusion and thus decrease the diffusivity of oxygen ions.
Due to overlapping interaction fields of the solute ions, this effect should decrease for increasing solute concentrations.
C. Dissolution of tetravalent solutes M4+, Ce0.9688M0.0312O2
The solution energy Es of +4 ions in ceria determines the stability of the solid solution phases with respect to phase separation into the constituent oxides. Figure 7 shows the calculated values of Es for one +4 ion in the 222 super- cell Ce0.9688M0.0312O2. The rutile structure was used as the
