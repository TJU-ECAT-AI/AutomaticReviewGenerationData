[1] "If doping an oxide with a LVD turns it into a Lewis acid, then doping should increase substantially the binding energy of any Lewis base, not just the formation of an oxygen vacancy. Calculations show that this is indeed the case. (73, 77, 80, 86) This is true of CO adsorption, which is a Lewis base, whose binding energy to the oxygen atom next to a LVD is substantially larger than the binding energy to the undoped oxide. (54, 72-74, 80, 88, 92, 93) The binding of a H atom (a Lewis base) provides another example. (77, 86, 94) The energy of the reaction 1/2H2 + Ox  H/Ox (here H/Ox is the oxide with a H adsorbed to make a hydroxyl) is 1.53 eV if Ox = La2O3 and 2.35 eV if Ox = MgLa2O3; it is 1.24 eV if Ox = CeO2 and 2.94 eV if Ox = LaCeO2 (here MgLa2O3 is La2O3 doped with Mg, and LaCeO2 has a similar meaning). This large shift in the binding energy has been observed for all surfaces doped with LVDs for which we have calculations."
[2] "The chemistry of the reducible oxides doped with LVDs is complicated by the fact that the cations are acidic and the dopant-induced acidity is additional to that already present in the oxide."
[3] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases. If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active."
[4] "These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair."

1.Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by altering their Lewis acid-base properties. Doping with a low-valence dopant (LVD) turns the oxide surface into a Lewis acid, substantially increasing the binding energy of Lewis bases such as CO and H atoms. This effect has been observed for all surfaces doped with LVDs. The chemistry of reducible oxides doped with LVDs is complicated by the acidity of the cations, which adds to the dopant-induced acidity. HVDs are Lewis bases that strongly adsorb Lewis acids like O2 or halogens. If the dopant's basicity is not excessive, the adsorbed acid retains reactivity with Lewis bases. However, if the dopant is very basic, the adsorbed acid becomes too strongly bound and loses chemical activity. These rules seem to apply universally to chemical processes involving Lewis acid-base pairs, regardless of the specific chemicals involved.

1.相同价态掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价态掺杂剂(HVDs)通过改变金属氧化物的Lewis酸碱性质来影响其催化性能。用低价态掺杂剂(LVDs)掺杂会将氧化物表面转变为Lewis酸，显著提高Lewis碱如CO和H原子的结合能。这一效应在所有用LVDs掺杂的表面中都有观察到。可还原氧化物用LVDs掺杂的化学性质因金属离子的酸性而变得复杂，这增加了掺杂剂引起的酸性。HVDs是Lewis碱，能强烈吸附如O2或卤素等Lewis酸。如果掺杂剂的碱性不过分，吸附的酸仍能与Lewis碱反应。然而，如果掺杂剂非常碱性，吸附的酸会结合得太强，失去化学活性。这些规则似乎普遍适用于涉及Lewis酸碱对的化学过程，无论具体涉及的化学物质如何。
