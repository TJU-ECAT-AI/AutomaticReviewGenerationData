1.The document does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does discuss the effects of low-valence dopants (LVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the Lewis acid-base properties of oxide surfaces, which can have implications for catalytic activity. LVDs can turn oxide surfaces into Lewis acids, enhancing the binding of Lewis bases and facilitating certain chemical reactions. HVDs act as Lewis bases, which can strongly adsorb Lewis acids like O2 or X2, affecting the reactivity of the surface. The document also notes that reducible oxides have intrinsic Lewis acidity, which can influence the formation of oxygen vacancies and the binding of metal atoms. The challenge in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior lies in the complex interplay between the dopant's valence state, the Lewis acid-base properties of the host oxide, and the specific chemical reactions of interest.

1.文档没有提供关于同价掺杂剂(SVD)和高价掺杂剂(HVD)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能的具体信息。然而,它确实讨论了低价掺杂剂(LVD)和高价掺杂剂(HVD)对氧化物表面Lewis酸碱性质的影响,这可能对催化活性有影响。LVD可以使氧化物表面变成Lewis酸,增强Lewis碱的结合,促进某些化学反应。HVD作为Lewis碱,可以强烈吸附O2或X2等Lewis酸,影响表面的反应性。文档还指出,可还原氧化物具有内在的Lewis酸性,这可能影响氧空位的形成和金属原子的结合。在制定一般预测规则以描述掺杂剂行为的挑战在于掺杂剂的价态、宿主氧化物的Lewis酸碱性质以及感兴趣的特定化学反应之间的复杂相互作用。
