[1] "We have shown that many trends related to chemical processes relevant to catalytic chemistry of oxide surfaces can be predicted (or rationalized) by a few rules pertaining to the Lewis acidbase properties of the chemicals involved."
[2] "These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair."
[3] "If doping an oxide with a LVD turns it into a Lewis acid, then doping should increase substantially the binding energy of any Lewis base, not just the formation of an oxygen vacancy."
[4] "The chemistry of the reducible oxides doped with LVDs is complicated by the fact that the cations are acidic and the dopant-induced acidity is additional to that already present in the oxide."
[5] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[6] "If the dopant is not a very strong base, it adsorbs O2 (or X2), but it does not manage to neutralize its acidity completely. Because of this, the adsorbed O2 is capable of reacting with Lewis bases."
[7] "If the dopant is a very strong base, it neutralized the (Lewis acid) O2 completely, so it will no longer react with Lewis bases."
[8] "In some cases, an adsorbed species can have two isomers, one that is a base and the other that is an acid. If that species is coadsorbed with a Lewis acid, it will take the structure that is a base. If it is coadsorbed with a Lewis base, it will take the structure in which it is an acid."
[9] "It is possible to define, qualitatively, an acid or a base strength, and the acidbase interaction increases as the strength of the acid or the base is increased."
[10] "If a surface is modified to be a Lewis acid, to confer on it certain properties, these properties can be substantially suppressed by adsorbing on the surface a Lewis base. The system behaves as if the base neutralizes the acid."

1.The influence of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides can be predicted by rules related to Lewis acid-base properties. These rules seem to be general and apply to any chemical process involving a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair. Doping an oxide with a low-valence dopant (LVD) turns it into a Lewis acid, which increases the binding energy of any Lewis base. The chemistry of reducible oxides doped with LVDs is complicated by the acidity of the cations and the additional acidity induced by the dopant. HVDs are Lewis bases that strongly adsorb Lewis acids such as O2 or X2. If the dopant is not a very strong base, it adsorbs O2 but does not completely neutralize its acidity, allowing the adsorbed O2 to react with Lewis bases. If the dopant is a very strong base, it completely neutralizes the acidity of O2, preventing it from reacting with Lewis bases. Adsorbed species can have two isomers, one a base and the other an acid, and their structure is determined by the presence of a Lewis acid or base. Acid-base strength can be qualitatively defined, and the acid-base interaction increases with the strength of the acid or base. Adsorbing a Lewis base on a surface modified to be a Lewis acid can suppress the properties conferred by the acid, behaving as if the base neutralizes the acid. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).

1.同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对不同金属氧化物催化性能的影响可以通过与参与化学过程的Lewis酸碱性质相关的规则来预测。这些规则似乎是普遍的，适用于任何涉及Lewis酸和碱的化学过程，无论化学对的性质如何。用低价掺杂剂(LVD)掺杂氧化物会使其成为Lewis酸，从而增加任何Lewis碱的结合能。LVDs掺杂的可还原氧化物的化学性质因阳离子的酸性以及掺杂剂引起的额外酸性而变得复杂。HVDs是Lewis碱，强烈吸附如O2或X2等Lewis酸。如果掺杂剂不是非常强的碱，它会吸附O2但不会完全中和其酸性，使吸附的O2能够与Lewis碱反应。如果掺杂剂是非常强的碱，它会完全中和O2的酸性，阻止它与Lewis碱反应。吸附物种可能有两种异构体，一种是碱，另一种是酸，它们的结构由Lewis酸或碱的存在决定。可以定性地定义酸碱强度，酸碱相互作用随着酸或碱的强度增加而增加。在被修改为Lewis酸的表面上吸附Lewis碱可以抑制酸赋予的性质，表现得好像碱中和了酸。在考虑Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质(可还原与不可还原)的情况下，制定一般预测规则以描述掺杂剂行为的挑战依然存在。
