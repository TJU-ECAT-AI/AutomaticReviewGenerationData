[1] "If doping an oxide with a LVD turns it into a Lewis acid, then doping should increase substantially the binding energy of any Lewis base, not just the formation of an oxygen vacancy. Calculations show that this is indeed the case. (73, 77, 80, 86) This is true of CO adsorption, which is a Lewis base, whose binding energy to the oxygen atom next to a LVD is substantially larger than the binding energy to the undoped oxide. (54, 72-74, 80, 88, 92, 93) The binding of a H atom (a Lewis base) provides another example. (77, 86, 94) The energy of the reaction 1/2H2 + Ox  H/Ox (here H/Ox is the oxide with a H adsorbed to make a hydroxyl) is 1.53 eV if Ox = La2O3 and 2.35 eV if Ox = MgLa2O3; it is 1.24 eV if Ox = CeO2 and 2.94 eV if Ox = LaCeO2 (here MgLa2O3 is La2O3 doped with Mg, and LaCeO2 has a similar meaning). This large shift in the binding energy has been observed for all surfaces doped with LVDs for which we have calculations."
[2] "The chemistry of the reducible oxides doped with LVDs is complicated by the fact that the cations are acidic and the dopant-induced acidity is additional to that already present in the oxide."
[3] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases. If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active."
[4] "These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair."

1.Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by altering their Lewis acid-base properties. Doping with a low-valence dopant (LVD) turns the oxide surface into a Lewis acid, substantially increasing the binding energy of Lewis bases such as CO and H atoms. This effect has been observed for all surfaces doped with LVDs. The chemistry of reducible oxides doped with LVDs is complicated by the acidity of the cations, which adds to the dopant-induced acidity. HVDs are Lewis bases that strongly adsorb Lewis acids like O2 or halogens. If the dopant's basicity is not excessive, the adsorbed acid retains reactivity with Lewis bases. However, if the dopant is very basic, the adsorbed acid becomes too strongly bound and loses chemical activity. These rules seem to apply universally to chemical processes involving Lewis acid-base pairs, regardless of the specific chemicals involved.

1.相同价态掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价态掺杂剂(HVDs)通过改变金属氧化物的Lewis酸碱性质来影响其催化性能。用低价态掺杂剂(LVDs)掺杂会将氧化物表面转变为Lewis酸，显著提高Lewis碱如CO和H原子的结合能。这一效应在所有用LVDs掺杂的表面中都有观察到。可还原氧化物用LVDs掺杂的化学性质因金属离子的酸性而变得复杂，这增加了掺杂剂引起的酸性。HVDs是Lewis碱，能强烈吸附如O2或卤素等Lewis酸。如果掺杂剂的碱性不过分，吸附的酸仍能与Lewis碱反应。然而，如果掺杂剂非常碱性，吸附的酸会结合得太强，失去化学活性。这些规则似乎普遍适用于涉及Lewis酸碱对的化学过程，无论具体涉及的化学物质如何。

1.The document does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does discuss the effects of low-valence dopants (LVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the Lewis acid-base properties of oxide surfaces, which can affect catalytic activity. LVDs can turn oxide surfaces into Lewis acids, enhancing the binding of Lewis bases and facilitating reactions involving Lewis acid-base interactions. HVDs act as Lewis bases, which can strongly adsorb Lewis acids like O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). The document also mentions that reducible oxides are weak Lewis acids, which can lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increase the binding energy of single metal atoms. The effects of dopants on catalytic properties depend on factors such as the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) and the strength of the Lewis acid-base interactions.

[1] "We have shown that many trends related to chemical processes relevant to catalytic chemistry of oxide surfaces can be predicted (or rationalized) by a few rules pertaining to the Lewis acidbase properties of the chemicals involved."
[2] "These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair."
[3] "If a surface is modified to be a Lewis acid, to confer on it certain properties, these properties can be substantially suppressed by adsorbing on the surface a Lewis base. The system behaves as if the base neutralizes the acid."
[4] "In some cases, an adsorbed species can have two isomers, one that is a base and the other that is an acid. If that species is coadsorbed with a Lewis acid, it will take the structure that is a base. If it is coadsorbed with a Lewis base, it will take the structure in which it is an acid."
[5] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."
[6] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[7] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[8] "If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."
[9] "If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active."
[10] "In some cases the group formed by the dopant with O2 adsorbed on it acts as a low-valence dopant and activates surface oxygen."

1.The influence of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides can be predicted by rules related to Lewis acid-base properties. These rules are general and apply to any chemical process involving a Lewis acid and a base. The presence of a Lewis base can suppress properties conferred by modifying a surface to be a Lewis acid. Adsorbed species can change isomers based on coadsorbed Lewis acids or bases. Oxides doped with low-valence dopants become Lewis acids, affecting oxygen vacancy formation and base binding. Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, influencing oxygen vacancy formation and metal atom binding. HVDs are Lewis bases that strongly adsorb Lewis acids like O2 or X2. The reactivity of adsorbed oxygen or Br2 with Lewis bases depends on the dopant's basicity. In some cases, a dopant with O2 adsorbed on it can act as a low-valence dopant, activating surface oxygen.

1.相同价态掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价态掺杂剂(HVDs)对不同金属氧化物催化性能的影响可以通过与路易斯酸碱性质相关的规则来预测。这些规则是通用的，适用于任何涉及路易斯酸和碱的化学过程。路易斯碱的存在可以抑制通过将表面改性为路易斯酸而获得的性质。吸附物种可以根据共吸附的路易斯酸或碱改变异构体。用低价态掺杂剂掺杂的氧化物成为路易斯酸，影响氧空位的形成和碱的结合。可还原氧化物是路易斯酸，影响氧空位的形成和金属原子的结合。HVDs是路易斯碱，强烈吸附O2或X2等路易斯酸。吸附氧或Br2与路易斯碱反应的活性取决于掺杂剂的碱性。在某些情况下，吸附O2上的掺杂剂可以作为低价态掺杂剂，激活表面氧。

Adsorbed species can have two isomers, one a base and the other an acid, and their structure is determined by the presence of a Lewis acid or base. Acid-base strength can be qualitatively defined, and the acid-base interaction increases with the strength of the acid or base. Adsorbing a Lewis base on a surface modified to be a Lewis acid can suppress the properties conferred by the acid, behaving as if the base neutralizes the acid. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).

1.同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对不同金属氧化物催化性能的影响可以通过与参与化学过程的Lewis酸碱性质相关的规则来预测。这些规则似乎是普遍的，适用于任何涉及Lewis酸和碱的化学过程，无论化学对的性质如何。用低价掺杂剂(LVD)掺杂氧化物会使其成为Lewis酸，从而增加任何Lewis碱的结合能。LVDs掺杂的可还原氧化物的化学性质因阳离子的酸性以及掺杂剂引起的额外酸性而变得复杂。HVDs是Lewis碱，强烈吸附如O2或X2等Lewis酸。如果掺杂剂不是非常强的碱，它会吸附O2但不会完全中和其酸性，使吸附的O2能够与Lewis碱反应。如果掺杂剂是非常强的碱，它会完全中和O2的酸性，阻止它与Lewis碱反应。吸附物种可能有两种异构体，一种是碱，另一种是酸，它们的结构由Lewis酸或碱的存在决定。可以定性地定义酸碱强度，酸碱相互作用随着酸或碱的强度增加而增加。在被修改为Lewis酸的表面上吸附Lewis碱可以抑制酸赋予的性质，表现得好像碱中和了酸。在考虑Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质(可还原与不可还原)的情况下，制定一般预测规则以描述掺杂剂行为的挑战依然存在。
