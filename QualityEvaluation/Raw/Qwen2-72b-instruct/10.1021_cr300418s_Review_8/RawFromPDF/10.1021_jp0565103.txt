Abstract
Nanocrystalline Ce1-xTixO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) and Ce1-x-yTixPtyO2-δ (x = 0.15, y = 0.01, 0.02) solid solutions crystallizing in fluorite structure have been prepared by a single step solution combustion method. Temperature programmed reduction and XPS study of Ce1-xTixO2 (x = 0.0−04) show complete reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ and reduction of ∼20% Ce4+ to Ce3+ state compared to 8% Ce4+ to Ce3+ in the case of pure CeO2 below 675 °C. The substitution of Ti ions in CeO2 enhances the reducibility of CeO2. Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ crystallizes in fluorite structure and Pt is ionically substituted with 2+ and 4+ oxidation states. The H/Pt atomic ratio at 30 °C over Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ is 5 and that over Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ is 4 against just 0.078 for 8 nm Pt metal particles. Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon oxidation activity are much higher over Ce1-x-yTixPtyO2 (x = 0.15, y = 0.01, 0.02) compared to Ce1-xPtxO2 (x = 0.01, 0.02). Synergistic involvement of Pt2+/Pt° and Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couples in addition to Ce4+/Ce3+ due to the overlap of Pt(5d), Ti(3d), and Ce(4f) bands near EF is shown to be responsible for improved redox property and higher catalytic activity.

Introduction
Precious metals Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ru are dispersed over an oxide support generally by impregnation, drying, and reduction in hydrogen at ∼400−500 °C. The commonly used oxide supports are α-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3, 1,2 and SiO2, 3 which are not reducible by hydrogen, and the precious metals disperse as fine metal particles on these supports. On the other hand, CeO2, TiO2, and SnO2 are reducible oxide supports, 4-13 and therefore, metals supported on these oxides can become oxidized. Nano-CeO2 can be partially reduced by hydrogen at ∼400−500 °C to CeO2-δ (δ ∼ 0.1) and to Ce2O3 above 900 °C. Oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was introduced on a quantitative basis, which is the capacity of ceria based support to release oxygen under reducing condition and to uptake oxygen under oxidizing condition. 14 While ZrO2 cannot be reduced by hydrogen, reducibility of CeO2 is enhanced in the Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solution, thereby increasing OSC. 15-17 Only the Ce4+ ion is known to be reduced to a greater extent in the presence of Zr ions. If Ce1-xTixO2 solid solution can be prepared, both Ce and Ti can be reduced and therefore large OSC is expected. Indeed, the formation of Ce1-xTixO2 (x = 0.4) oxides has been reported to be promising toward oxygen storage capacity. 18
In an attempt to understand noble metal−CeO2 interaction, Pd2+, Cu2+, Pt2+, and Rh3+ ions were substituted for Ce4+ in CeO2 forming a Ce1-xMxO2-δ solid solution for small values of x = 0.01−0.02. 19-22 For charge compensation, on lower valent ionic substitution for Ce4+ in CeO2, oxide ion vacancies are created. Enhanced catalytic activity toward CO oxidation, hydrocarbon oxidation, and hydrogen adsorption were observed compared to that of Pt/Al2O3 or Pt° (metal particles) over CeO2 itself. Synergistic involvement of Pt2+/Pt° and Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couples mediated by oxide ion vacancy is shown to be responsible for higher catalytic activity. 23 Therefore, if Pt2+ ions can be substituted for Ce4+ or Ti4+ in Ce1-xTixO2, Pt2+/Pt° along with Ce4+/Ce3+ and Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couples from the support can enhance the redox-catalytic activity further compared to Ce1-xPtxO2-δ.
Here we report the redox property of Ce1-xTixO2 (x = 0.1−0.4) in H2 and a systematic study of the effect of Pt2+ substitution in Ce1-xTixO2 forming Ce1-x-yTixPtyO2-δ prepared by a single step solution combustion method. Just as the reducibility of Ce1-xZrxO2 is higher than that of CeO2, Ce1-xTixO2 shows higher reducibility than CeO2 or TiO2. Further, Ce1-x-yTixPtyO2-δ showed higher rates of CO, C2H2, C2H4, and C3H8 oxidation activity compared to Ce1-xPtxO2-δ.
Experimental Section
TiCl4 (10 cm3) was added to ice cold (4 °C) acidified water (1 mL of concentrated HCl in 200 mL of H2O) slowly with continuous stirring forming TiOCl2. Dilute ammonium hydroxide was added to this solution giving a white precipitate of TiO(OH)2. The precipitate was filtered and washed thoroughly to remove chloride ion. Then, TiO(OH)2 was dissolved in a minimum amount of concentrated nitric acid to obtain the nitrate precursor TiO(NO3)2. The Ti ion concentration in the solution was estimated by the colorimetric method. 24
Ce1-xTixO2 (x = 0.1−0.4) were prepared by taking stoichiometric amounts of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6·6H2O (E. Mark India Ltd.), TiO(NO3)2, and glycene and heating at 400 °C to give a flaming combustion. 25,26
Chemical reactions occurring in the combustion process can be written as follows:
Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 (1 atom %) was prepared by the solution combustion method taking (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6·6H2O, Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (ABCR, France), TiO(NO3)2, and glycene in the mole ratio of 0.8415:0.01:0.1485:2.42. In a typical preparation, 3 g of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6·6H2O, 0.0252 g of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2, 0.1823 g of TiO(NO3)2 (in solution), and 1.1814 g of glycine were taken in a 300 mL Pyrex dish. Similarly, 2 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 was also prepared. To compare the catalytic activity of 1 atom % Pt impregnated over combustion, synthesized Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 was prepared by reducing H2PtCl6 dispersed over the oxide support by hydrazine.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of all the mixed oxides and the Pt-substituted oxides were recorded on a SIEMENS D5005 diffractometer at a scan rate of 0.5° min-1 in the 2θ range between 20° and 100°. For the structural refinement by the Rietveld method, the XRD data were recorded in a Philips X'Pert diffractometer at a scan rate of 0.5° min-1 with a 0.02° step size in the 2θ range between 20° and 100°. The refinement was done with the FullProf-fp2k program 27 varying 17 parameters simultaneously.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the prepared samples and a few hydrogen reduced materials were recorded in an ESCA-3 Mark II spectrometer (VG Scientific Ltd., England), using Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). Binding energies were calibrated with respect to C(1s) at 285 eV with a precision of ±0.2 eV. For XPS analysis the powder samples were made into 0.5 mm thick, 8 mm diameter pallets and placed into an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber at 10-9 Torr housing the analyzer. The obtained spectra were curve fitted with Gaussian peaks after subtracting a linear background.
Hydrogen Uptake Measurement and Catalytic Reactions
Hydrogen uptake measurements were performed in a continuous flow microreactor of length 30 and 0.4 cm internal diameter with 5.49% H2/Ar (certified calibration gas mixture from Bhuruka Gases Ltd., Bangalore) flowing at 30 sccm at a linear heating rate of 10 deg min-1 up to 700 °C. For Pt-substituted samples, the low temperature was achieved through liquid nitrogen cooling. Hydrogen concentration was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The volume of hydrogen consumed was calibrated against the reduction of a known amount of CuO. The gas flow was monitored with a mass flow sensor (AWM3100V) calibrated with a standard bubble flow meter. Hydrogen uptake over Pt-substituted samples also has been carried out under isothermal condition.
The catalytic test was done in a temperature programmed reaction (TPR) system equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer SX200 (VG Scientific Ltd., England) for product analysis in a packed bed tubular quartz reactor (dimensions 25 cm × 0.4 cm) at atmospheric pressure. Typically, 50 mg of the catalyst (40/80 mesh size) diluted with SiO2 (30/60 mesh size) was loaded in the reactor to obtain a column length of 1.1 cm and the ends were plugged with ceramic wool. For all the reactions, the total flow was kept fixed at 100 sccm to achieve a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 43 000 h-1. Actual rates of the reactions were obtained following the percent conversion as a function of W/F, where W is the weight of the catalyst and F is the gas flow rate in moles/second. Before the catalytic test, the as-prepared catalyst was heated in O2 flow at 200 °C for 1 h followed by degassing in He flow to the experimental temperature. The reactions were carried out as a function of temperature with a linear heating rate of 10 deg min-1.
Results
Catalytic Test. CO oxidation over the catalysts are carried out with 25 mg of each catalyst at space velocity of 43 000 h-1 with 2:2 vol % of CO and O2. The heating rate was also kept constant at 10 deg/min. In Figure 1, CO conversion vs temperature plots are shown. As can be seen from the figure, Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ catalyst has a much lower light-off temperature with T50 = 170 °C compared to Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ with T50 = 260 °C. Further, T50 of 2 atom % Pt in CeO2 or Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 are lower compared to the corresponding 1 atom % Pt oxides. A 1 atom % Pt metal impregnated catalyst over Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 shows T50 of 260 °C compared to 170 °C in the combustion synthesized catalyst. Having observed higher catalytic activity from the light-off curves for Pt in Ce1-xTixO2 compared to Pt in CeO2, actual rates were estimated by running the reactor under differential condition:  rate = FCOx/W, where FCO in the molar flow rate (moles/second), W is the weight of the catalyst (grams), and x is the fractional conversion. A series of reactions were carried out by varying W keeping the CO:O2 ratio of 2:6 vol % constant. Total gas flow was kept constant at 100 sccm made up with He. Space velocity was kept constant at 43 000 h-1. In Figure 2a, fractional CO conversion vs W/F plots is shown at various temparatures. From the figure it can be noted that even up to 40% conversion, x vs W/F is linear. Accordingly, from the slopes, rates were estimated. CO oxidation experiments were carried out over Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ under the same experimental conditions, and here also up to 40% conversion, conversion was linear with W/F. In Figure 2b rates of CO conversion (μmol·gm-1·s-1) vs temperature are plotted. Clearly, there is a huge difference in the CO oxidation rates between Pt in Ce1-xTixO2 and Pt in CeO2. At 155 °C, the rate of CO conversion over Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ is 45 times higher than that over Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ. In the same plot, rates derived from light-off curves taking conversion up to 25% are plotted for the two catalysts. The rates obtained from the light-off curve below 15% conversion are in good agreement with the rates obtained under differential condition. Further, the conversion up to 15% is linear with W up to 150 mg of catalyst. Therefore, rates of CO oxidation as a function of PO2, rates of hydrocarbon oxidation, and NO reduction reported here are taken for conversions less than 15% by running the reaction with 100−150 mg of the catalyst with GHSV of 43 000h-1.
Figure 1 (a) Percent CO conversion as a function of temperature over Ce0.85Ti0.15O2, and Pt, Ti substituted oxides under the following reaction conditions:  CO = 2 vol %, O2 = 2 vol %, Ft = 100 sccm, GHSV = 43 000 h-1, W = 25 mg.

In Figure 3a, activation energy of CO oxidation is given taking rates from W/F plots and activation energy is 13.2 kcal/mol with Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ, and it is much lower than that over Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ with a value of 19.6 kcal/mol. Thus, Ce1-xTixO2 is a better oxide support for Pt than pure CeO2.

Partial pressure dependence of oxygen over CO oxidation is shown in Figure 3b where 2 vol % of CO is kept constant and the volume percent of oxygen was varied from 0.2 to 10. Reaction was carried out with 50 mg of Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ catalyst. From the log(rate) vs log(PO2), we find that when the partial pressure of oxygen is lower than the of CO, the order is 0.78 and in excess oxygen condition, the order is 0.28.
In Figure 4a light-off curves of C2H2, C2H4, and C3H8 oxidation over 100 mg of the two catalysts are given. In each of the reactions, 1 vol % of “HC” was taken and the “HC” to oxygen ratio was 1:5 with a total flow of 100 sccm. In Figure 4b, Arrhenius plots are given for all the reactions with the two catalysts taking the rates estimated below 15% conversion. Clearly, Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ shows higher catalytic activity compared to Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ. The activation energies are lower for the Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ compared to Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ for oxidation of all the hydrocarbons studied here.

NO reduction by CO was carried out taking 0.25 vol % of NO and 0.25 vol % of CO with a 40 sccm total flow over 150 mg of catalysts and in Figure 5, the percent NO conversion vs temperature is given. NO reduction activity over Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ and Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ is similar. The rate of conversion at 135 °C (at 15% conversion) is 2 × 10-7 mol gm-1 s-1. Activation energies are 23 and 24 kcal mol-1 for Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ and Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ, respectively.

Hydrogen Uptake Studies. Figure 6a shows the temperature programmed reduction profiles of Ce1-xTixO2 (x = 0.0−0.4) along with pure TiO2. Notice the Y-scales are different in the plots for different compositions. Pure CeO2 shows H2 uptake from 350 °C with a low-temperature peak at ∼500 °C, which has been attributed to surface cerium reduction14 followed by bulk cerium reduction beyond 550 °C. The area under the peak up to 675 °C corresponds to 5.2 cm3 of H2 per g of CeO2. Upon Ti substitution, the reduction starts at ∼300 °C. The total reduction up to 675 °C has been evaluated for all the compositions and the data are given in Table 1. Clearly, the extent of reduction increases with increase in Ti content. The samples were reoxidized by passing oxygen at 300 °C for 1 h. The hydrogen uptake of the reoxidized sample in the subsequent cycle was about the same as that in the first cycle. From the volume of hydrogen taken up by Ce0.6Ti0.4O2 up to 675 °C, the stoichiometry of the reduced oxide is Ce0.46+4Ce0.14+3Ti0.4+3O1.73, on the basis of 100% reduction of Ti4+ to the Ti3+ state. That the Ti4+ ion is fully reduced to Ti3+ in the TPR is substantiated by XPS studies presented later. While only 16% Ti is reduced from Ti4+ to Ti3+ up to 675 °C in TiO2, 100% Ti from Ti4+ is reduced to 3+ in the solid solution. Only about 8% Ce is reduced in pure CeO2 up to 675 °C but over 20% Ce4+ is reduced in Ce1-xTixO2. Thus, reducibility of both Ce4+ and Ti4+ is enhanced in Ce1-xTixO2.

Notice the difference in the Y-scale for different samples.

Figure 6b shows the TPR profiles of 1−2 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 from −100 to 650 °C. There are three regions ofhydrogen uptake:  first one extends from −50 to 120 °C; the second region extends from ∼120 to 300 °C; and the third region is above 300 °C. The low-temperature region corresponds to hydrogen uptake related to Pt species in the compound.23 The second and the third regions of the H2 uptake can be attributed to the reduction of the Ti4+ and the Ce4+ state, respectively. Reduction of both Ti4+ and Ce4+ ions occurs at a lower temperature upon Pt substitution and the extent of reduction of Ce4+ is increased. The H2 uptake curve for Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ is also given for comparison in the figure. The H2/Pt molar ratio in the first region of 1 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 is 12.0, which is 3 times higher than that observed over 1 atom % Pt/CeO2.23 For 2 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2, the ratio is 7.5 under region 1. Total H2 uptake up to 650 °C is also much higher than that of the corresponding Ce1-xTixO2 oxides without Pt. The reduced material is oxidized when exposed to air even at room temperature, as observed from the amount of hydrogen taken up by the reduced sample exposed to air. After the first cycle, O2 was passed at 300 °C for 1 h followed by purging with pure Ar and a second TPR run was carried out. The H2 uptake curves in the second cycle were similar to those in the first cycle [compare curves C and C‘ of Figure 6b].
The H2 uptake experiment was also carried out under isothermal condition at 30 °C as a function of time. The experiment was repeated for reduction−oxidation cycles at 30 °C to check for the reversibility of H2 uptake. First, H2 uptake was measured at 30 °C over 1 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2. When O2 was passed at 30 °C over the H2 adsorbed catalysts, temperature increased to 38 °C indicating H2 + O2 to H2O reaction. The reactor was purged with pure Ar and again H2/Ar was passed. Adsorption of H2 followed by the H2 + O2 reaction cycle was repeated over 50 times and each time the volume of H2 adsorbed was the same (Figure S1, Supporting Information). However, the H2 adsorbed sample was purged with Ar and a repeat H2/Ar run did not show any H2 uptake. The H2/Pt molar ratios were 2.5 and 1.5 for 1 and 2 atom % Pt in Ce0.85Ti0.15O2. The H2/Pt molar ratio at 30 °C for Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ was 2. This means for 1 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 the number of H atoms per Pt atom adsorbed at 30 °C is 5. The H2 adsorption was carried out at 30 °C over ∼80 Å Pt metal particles (prepared by the polyol reduction method) in a separate experiment. The H2/Pt molar ratio was 0.078. Thus, at 30 °C, there is 25 times enhancement of H2/Pt over Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ and 32 times over Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ compared to Pt metal particles. The number of H atoms per surface Pt atom (estimated from ∼80 Å Pt metal particles) turnes out to be 0.97, which is close to 1. This is what is expected for Pt metal particles. To confirm whether the adsorbed H2 reacts with O2 at 30 °C, O2 was passed over the H2 adsorbed catalyst in the catalytic reactor equipped with QMS. First H2/He was passed over 1 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2, the sample was purged with He, and then O2/He was passed over the catalyst. Formation of H2O is detected by the mass spectrometer. When H2/He and O2/He are passed simultaneously, H2O is formed at 30 °C, but the temperature increased rapidly due to the exothermic nature of the reaction H2 + O2 → H2O. This clearly suggests that the H2 adsorbed is either dissociated or a precursor for dissociation. Thus, the isothermal H2 uptake experiment also shows higher H2 uptake for Pt in Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 than Pt in CeO2. Enhanced reducibility of CeO2 due to Ti ion substitution by hydrogen in both the presence and the absence of Pt and enhanced catalytic activity of Ce1-x-yTixPtyO2-δ compared to Ce1-xPtxO2-δ is to be attributed to the structure of Ce1-xTixO2 and Pt/Ce1-xTixO2. Therefore, a detailed study of the structure of the oxides was undertaken.
XRD Studies. Figure 7a shows the XRD pattern of Ce1-xTixO2 for x = 0.0−0.5. All the XRD patterns can be indexed to the fluorite structure. Peaks due to TiO2 in anatase or rutile phases are not detectable up to x = 0.4 even when the pattern is expanded in the Y-scale. For x = 0.5, the TiO2 (110) peak is visible. There is a systematic increase in the 2θ values of the diffraction lines with the increase in Ti indicative of solid solution formation. The background is flat for 2θ = 20−90°, indicating the material is crystalline. The line width increased with increasing Tix for x = 0.2, which further supports the idea of solid solution. To confirm further, Rietveld refinements were carried out while simultaneously varying 17 parameters such as overall scale factor and background parameter. Observed, calculated, and difference plots are given for the x = 0.4 sample in Figure 7b (see Figure S2, Supporting Information, for x = 0.1 composition). The structural parameters are given in Table 2. Lattice parameter “a” decreased from 5.4131(6) Å for CeO2 to 5.3720(3) for x = 0.4. A systematic decrease in the lattice parameter confirms Ce1-xTixO2 solid solution formation.

In Figure 8a−c, XRD patterns of 1 atom % Pt in Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 made by the combustion method and 1 atom % Pt impregnated over combustion synthesized Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 are shown by expanding the Y-scale 25 times after normalizing the intensities with respect to the (111) peak. The position of the 100% peak expected due to anatase TiO2 at 2θ = 25.3° [marked arrow in Figure 8a] is absent in the pattern even at an expansion of 25 times in the Y-scale. The Pt(111) peak is to be observed at 2θ = 39.8° and expansion of the curve in Figure 8b shows that the intensity in the Pt(111) peak region is negligibly small; it is in the noise level. But a good Pt(111) peak is observed for the Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 impregnated sample (Figure 8c). Pt in H2PtCl6 taken in the combustion synthesis is converted into Pt°, PtO, or PtO2; at least 100% intensity peak due to these oxides should be of detectable intensity as in the Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 (impregnated) sample, but no such peak could be detected. Therefore, Pt is finely dispersed as either atoms or ions. As is shown later, Pt is dispersed as ions from XPS studies. Therefore, the natural position for the Pt ions in CeO2 is the Ce4+ site. The structure of Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ by EXAFS indeed showed Pt2+ ion substitution for Ce4+ in CeO2 where a unique Pt−Ce distance is obtained at 3.28 Å.21 Rietveld refinement of XRD profiles of Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 and Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ was done (see Figure S3a,b, Supporting Information, for 1% and 2% Pt in Ce0.85Ti0.15O2) and lattice parameter “a” is 5.4032(2) and 5.4052(3) Å, respectively. The increase in the lattice parameter is significant, which indicates Pt ionic substitution in Ce1-xTixO2.

High-Resolution TEM Study. The high-resolution TEM image and the electron diffraction pattern of combustion synthesized Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ are shown in Figure 9, parts a and b, respectively. The fringes spaced at ∼3.20 Å correspond to CeO2(111) layers. Fringes due to Pt metal particles separated at 2.30 Å are absent. The electron diffraction pattern clearly shows the fluorite structure of the compound. No spot or ring due to Pt metal is detectable. The average particle size is ∼150 Å, which agrees well with that calculated from X-ray diffraction with use of the Scherrer formula. EDAX analysis on these images showed a Pt:Ti:Ce ratio close to 76:23:1 as shown in Figure 9c, which is close to the bulk composition within the experimental error. In Figure 9d the high-resolution TEM image of Pt metal impregnated over Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 is shown. Clearly, Pt metal particles with Pt(111) fringes at 2.30 Å are observed and are marked in the figure. The lattice fringes with 3.20 Å are due to Ce0.85Ti0.15O2. Thus, the HRTEM study confirmed the presence of Pt metal particles in the Pt impregnated over Ce0.85Ti0.15O2. Therefore, the absence of Pt metal particles in the TEM image and the presence of Pt X-ray emission on the high-resolution image confirm Pt ion substitution in the combustion synthesized Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2.

XPS Studies. To gain confidence in the XPS of Pt metal peaks vs oxidized Pt in CeO2, Pt(4f) of Pt metal foil in metallic contact with the XPS probe, a Pt metal foil insulated from the XPS probe by the ZrO2 pallet were recorded. In addition, Pt metal particles made into a pallet in contact with the probe, Pt metal impregnated over Ce0.85Ti0.15O2, (NH3)4PtII(NO3)2, and PtO2 (in the form of compact 1 mm thick pallets), were also recorded. Pt metal foil and Pt metal particles did not show any charging. Pt(4f) peaks from Pt metal foil that was insulated over the ZrO2 pallet showed a charging shift of 2.6 eV. Pt metal impregnated over Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 showed a charging shift of 6.4 eV. The Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ pallet showed charging of 6.3 eV. Correction for the shift due to charging was done taking C(1s) at 285 eV; since compact pallets are used for powder samples, there is no differential charging. In Figure 10a, Pt(4f) of the above samples are shown. Pt(4f7/2,5/2) peaks due to Pt metal foil with no charging shift and with a charging shift after correction overlap fully with binding energies at 71.1 and 74.2 eV. There is no measurable increase in the width of the Pt(4f) peaks due to charging. Pt(4f) peaks from the Pt metal impregnated sample show an indication of surface oxidation from the decrease in 4f7/2,5/2 peak resolution, even though the main peaks are due to Pt in the metallic state. The binding energy of Pt2+(4f7/2,5/2) from (NH3)4PtII(NO3)2 is at 72.4 and 75.6 eV (curve D, Figure 10). Thus, filling up the valley between (4f7/2,5/2) peaks in Pt metal impregnated over Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 (curve C, Figure 10) is due to surface oxidation of Pt° to the Pt2+ state. In curve E in Figure 10, the Pt(4f) peak from α-PtO2 is plotted where Pt is in the 4+ state. In this compound, there was no charging shift because it is a conducting oxide. Binding energies of Pt(4f7/2,5/2) are at 75.0 and 78.2 eV, respectively. The Pt(4f) spectrum from Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ is distinctly different and indicative of oxidized Pt with more than one oxidation state as seen from Figure 10b. Under such condition, it is common to resolve the spin−orbit doublets into components due to different oxidation states. Accordingly, the Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ is deconvoluted into sets of Pt(4f7/2,5/2) spin−orbit doublets taking into account fwhm from Pt metal 4f7/2,5/2 states, spin−orbit splitting of 3.2 eV, and relative intensity of 7/2 and 5/2 states. The Pt(4f) spectrum of Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ deconvoluted into three sets of spin−orbit states is shown in Figure 10b. The Pt(4f7/2) peaks at 71.1, 72.4, and 75 eV coincide with model compounds with Pt in 0, 2+, and 4+ oxidation states. If the peak due to Pt° is not taken into account, fwhm becomes too high for Pt2+ and Pt4+, which is not realistic.
In the XPS study of the Pt(4f) core level spectrum in Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ, the Pt(4f) was deconvoluted into two sets of spin−orbit doublets, since intensity due to Pt° is not observed. Accordingly, the Pt(4f7/2,5/2) peaks at 72.6, 75.8 and 75.0, 78.2 eV are due to Pt in 2+ and 4+ oxidation states, respectively (Figure 11a). In Ce0.83Ti0.15Pt0.02O2-δ (Figure 11b), the Pt(4f7/2,5/2) region was deconvoluted into three sets of spin−orbit doublets since the intensity due to Pt° was significant. Accordingly, Pt(4f7/2) peaks at 71.1, 72.7, and 74.9 eV are assigned to Pt°, Pt2+, and Pt4+ oxidation states, respectively. The Ce0.83Ti0.15Pt0.02O2-δ was reduced in a tubular furnace in H2 at 675 °C for 6 h and the XPS of the reduced sample showed a much higher intensity of the Pt° state (Figure 11c). The same sample upon air oxidation at 500 °C shows peak positions and intensities due to Pt°, Pt2+, and Pt4+ as in the “as-prepared” sample (Figure 11d). In Table 3 the binding energies of Pt(4f7/2) in the model compounds and the catalysts, full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the 4f7/2 peak, and relative intensities of Pt°, Pt2+, and Pt4+ states calculated from the respective areas are presented. In Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ, 63% Pt is in the 2+ state and 37% in the 4+ state. For 2 atom % Pt-substituted sample, about 7% Pt is found in the Pt° state and 65% Pt in the Pt2+ state. In the H2-reduced sample, the peak intensity at 71.1 eV due to Pt° is 49% and that of Pt2+ is 45%. There is a decrease in the Pt4+ peak intensity and an increase in the Pt° state upon H2 reduction in the reduced sample. Peaks due to the Pt2+ state persist. Ce0.83Ti0.15 Pt0.02O2-δ upon hydrogen reduction turns black. The sample upon exposure to air even at room temperature changes to gray, which is the same color as the “as-prepared” sample. Thus, in combustion synthesized 1 and 2 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2, Pt is present mainly in the 2+ state.
The surface concentration of Pt in all the as-prepared samples was calculated employing the following equation: 28
where X, I, σ, λ, and DE are the surface concentration, intensity, photoionization cross-section, mean escape depth, and geometric factors, respectively. The integrated area under the respective core level peak after subtracting a linear background was taken as the measure of observed intensity. The photoionization cross- sections and mean escape depth were taken from the literature. 29,30 The surface concentrations of Pt in the as-prepared 1 and 2 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 are 3.5% and 4.0%, respectively. Thus, the surface concentration of Pt is higher than that in the bulk, indicating significant surface segregation of platinum in the as-prepared samples. Surface concentration of Ti in Ce1-xTixO2 was close to the bulk composition within experimental error of ±3% and no surface segregation of Ti is observed.

The Ti(2p) spectra of pure TiO2, Ce0.6Ti0.4O2, Ce0.6Ti0.4O1.73 (reduced up to 675 °C in the TPR), as-prepared 1 to 2 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2, and 2 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 (reduced up to 675 °C) are shown in Figure 12a−f. The binding energy of Ti(2p3/2,1/2) at 459.0 and 464.8 eV in TiO2 corresponds to Ti in the 4+ state (Figure 12a). Ti(2p3/2,1/2) peaks are observed at 459.0 and 464.8 eV showing Ti in the 4+ state in Ce0.6Ti0.4O2 (Figure 12b). The Ti4+ ion in Ce1-xTixO2, upon hydrogen reduction in the TPR up to 675 °C, is fully reduced to the 3+ state as can be seen from the peaks at 458.2 and 464.0 eV (Figure 12c). 31 The Ti(2p3/2,1/2) peaks in as-prepared 1 and 2 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 are observed at 458.8 and 464.7 eV (Figure 12d,e) and Ti is essentially in the 4+ state. In the TPR reduced 2 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 sample, Ti(2p3/2,1/2) peaks are observed at 458.2 and 464.0 eV (Figure 12f) corresponding to Ti in the 3+ state. This shows that all the Ti4+ are reduced to the 3+ state.

The Ce(3d) core level regions of Ce0.6Ti0.4O2, Ce0.6Ti0.4O1.73 (H2 reduced up to 675 °C), 2 atom % Pt/Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 (reduced in H2 up to 675 °C), and the same sample air oxidized at 500 °C are given in Figure 13, curves a−d, respectively. Ce is present in the 4+ state in Ce1-xTixO2. The Ce(3d) spectrum is similar to that of CeO2 with 3d5/2 peaks at 882.9 and 901.3 eV and the corresponding satellites are at 889 and 899 eV for 3d5/2. 32 After TPR up to 675 °C, Ce in the 3+ as well as the 4+ states are observed as can be seen from the satellites due to the 3+ state (marked with an asterisk) and the 4+ state (marked with a plus sign). However, TPR reduced Ce0.83Ti0.15Pt0.02O2-δ show Ce mostly in the 4+ state (compare curves a and c in Figure 13c). The same sample upon air oxidation shows Ce in the 4+ state. Significant reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in the TPR reduced Ce0.83Ti0.15Pt0.02O2-δ is not observed. The TPR reduced sample was black, but upon exposure to air while transferring to the XPS chamber the sample turned gray and, therefore, the Ce ion seems to become oxidized even at room temperature to the 4+ state.

In Figure 14, valence band spectra of CeO2, Ce0.6Ti0.4O2 reduced up to 675 °C, Ce0.83Ti0.15Pt0.02O2-δ, and the H2-reduced Ce0.83Ti0.15Pt0.02O2-δ are given. VB of Pt metal and PtO2 are also given in the figure. In CeO2, the valence band consists of O(2p) peaked at 6.5 eV and no electron density up to ∼3 eV from EF. Pure TiO2 also shows a similar valence band due to O(2p). 33 On hydrogen reduction, the Ti3+ state with the Ti(3d1) band with measurable electron density below EF and above the O(2p) band edge is observed as can be seen by curve B in Figure 14. In the Pt ion substituted sample and the reduced sample (curves C and D in Figure 14) also, an increase in the electron density below EF is visible. Very high electron density at EF is seen in Pt metal and the valence band extends up to 6 eV. PtO2 also shows high electron density just below EF due to the Pt(5d) band. Since the extent of Ce4+ reduction is small, the Ce(4f1) peak at ∼2 eV is not discernible in the VB region.
Discussion
Our interest in this study was to see how Ti4+ ionic substitution for Ce4+ in CeO2 influences redox properties of CeO2 and Ce1-xPtxO2-δ. In our earlier studies, we had shown that −Ce4+−O−Pt2+−□−Ce4+− interaction in Ce1-xPtxO2-δ is responsible for dissociated hydrogen adsorption at low temperature. Further, CO adsorption over Pt2+ sites and higher dissociative chemisorption of oxygen over oxide ion vacancy sites around Pt2+ leading to higher CO oxidation activity were shown. Here, formation of Ce1-xTixO2 (x = 0.1−0.4) solid solution by the combustion method is confirmed from XRD studies. Pure CeO2 is reduced to CeO1.96 in H2 up to 675 °C and TiO2 to TiO1.92. However, Ce1-xTixO2 can be reduced to a greater extent. That Ti4+ in Ce1-xTixO2 is reduced to the Ti3+ state fully is shown by XPS. With 15% Ti4+ ion substitution, Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 could be reduced to Ce0.85Ti0.15O1.86. This means 15% of Ti4+ is reduced to the Ti3+ state and 15% of Ce4+ can be reduced to the Ce3+ state compared with just 8% in pure CeO2 and 16% of Ti4+ in TiO2. Ce0.6Ti0.4O2 could be reduced to Ce0.714+Ce0.143+Ti0.43+O1.73 retaining the gross fluorite structure that can be oxidized back to Ce0.6Ti0.4O2. Thus, reducibility of Ce1-xTixO2 is higher than that of CeO2 or TiO2.
The Ti4+ ion is too small to occupy the 8-coordinated Ce4+ site in the CeO2 structure. The Ce−O bond length is 2.34 Å. With the lattice parameter of 5.372 Å for Ce0.6Ti0.4O2, Ce−O and Ti−O bond lengths should be 2.32 Å. The Ti4+ ion with size 0.74 Å, being much smaller than Ce4+ (0.98 Å), prefers 6 coordination as in anatase or rutile phases. Ti−O bond distances are 1.96 and 1.93 Å in the TiO2 anatase phase. The Ce1-xTixO2 phase shows large line broadening in the XRD (see Figure 7) suggesting that oxide ion sublattice may be distorted leading to a change in the local coordination around the Ti4+ ion. It is possible that local coordination of Ti can be 6+2. This means 6 O2- of the 8 oxide ions come closer from the mean of 2.32 Å to ∼2 Å due to the smaller Ti4+ ion and the remaining two oxide ions may move to longer distances. The oxide ions moving away from the shorter Ti−O distances must be easier to remove by H2 thus explaining the higher reduciablity of Ce1-xTixO2. Since oxide ion is bonded to both Ti4+ and Ce4+ ions, both of them are reduced. In Ce1-xCuxO2-δ, for example, the extent of Ce4+ ion reduction was higher due to Cu2+ ion substitution.20 In Ce1-xZrxO2, 4+4 coordination for the Zr4+ ion is suggested to explain the high reducibility of the Ce4+ ion due to the Zr4+ ionic substitution. 34 A detailed local structure of the Ti4+ ion in CeO2 by EXAFS is essential to understand higher chemical reactivity. A more interesting point is its reducibility in the Pt ion substituted Ce0.85Ti0.15O2. XRD, TEM, and XPS studies indicated clearly that Pt is in the ionic state. Since Pt is present mainly in the 2+ state, oxide ion vacancies need to be created. Therefore, we can write the formula of the compound as Ce0.85-xPtxTi0.15O2-δ. The exact composition of oxide ions is difficult to ascertain. However, this compound can be reduced to a greater extent than Ce0.85Ti0.15O2. While Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 can be reduced to Ce0.704+Ce0.153+Ti0.153+O1.86, Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ can be reduced to Ce0.52+4Ce0.32+3Ti0.15+3Pt0.010/+2O1.75 up to 675 °C. This means, more Ce4+ can be reduced with Pt2+ ionic substitution in Ce1-xTixO2.
The Ce(4f) band lies about 2 eV below the EF as observed from the valence band spectrum of Ce2O3.32 In CeO2 it is empty. Pt metal has a high electron density at EF (Figure 14). Even in PtO2 where Pt is in the 4+ state, Pt(5d) electrons have sufficiently high electron density at EF. Certainly, Pt in the 2+ state should have electron density sufficiently high near EF. In TiO2, the Ti(3d) band lying below the EF is empty. The distinct Ti3+(3d) band peak at ∼1.5 eV below EF is well separated from the O(2p) band in Ti2O3.33 Thus, Ti(3d), Pt(5d), and Ce(4f) bands overlap below EF and, therefore, any change in the electron density due to reduction of Pt2+ ion to Pt° should populate Ti(3d) and Ce(4f) levels. Since the Pt° (6s2+5d8) band has high electron density at EF and the Ti(3d) band lying below is empty in the Ti4+ state, oxidation of Pt° to Pt2+ should occur, simultaneously reducing Ti4+ to the Ti3+ state. Increased reduction of Ti4+ and Ce4+ ion in the Pt-substituted sample is to be attributed to such an electronic interaction. Increase of CO oxidation rate over Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ compared to Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ should then be due to facile electron/hole transfer from Pt to Ti and Ce sites. Accordingly, the CO oxidation reaction can be written as follows:
From our XPS and hydrogen reduction studies, the reaction
is more facile than Ce4+-O-Pt°-□- + h• → Ce4+-O-Pt2+-□-. This should be expected because the Ti(3d) band is closer to the Pt(5d) band and electron or hole transfer from Pt(5d) to Ti(3d) is more facile. Thus, the reason for higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation is due to energetically more favorable electron transfer from Pt(5d) to Ti(3d) than Pt(5d) to Ce(4f). If such a proposition is correct, Ti1-xPtxO2-δ should be much more active for CO oxidation than the Pt-substituted Ce1-xTixO2. Indeed, Ti0.99Pt0.01O2-δ was prepared by the solution combustion method and the formation of Ti0.99Pt0.01O2-δ in the anatase phase with Pt in the 2+ and the 4+ states has been well characterized. 35 The CO oxidation over Ti0.99Pt0.01O2-δ under the same experimental condition as in Figure 1 indeed shows T50 at 140 °C (see Figure 1). This confirms that the Pt(5d) → Ti(3d) interaction is responsible for the enhanced catalytic behavior.
While TiO2 (anatase) itself is a good reducible support, the oxide transforms to TiO2 (rutile) above 650 °C 36 whereas Ce1-xTixO2 is stable up to 750 °C without any TiO2 separation. Pt ion substitution in Ce1-xTixO2 has been possible and the compound is stabe up to 750 °C. Further, restoration of metals in the oxidized state, viz., Pt2+, Ti4+, and Ce4+, as in the above reaction scheme is essential for high TOF. The Ce3+ ion is more easily oxidizable than Ti3+ to Ti4+. Therefore, from the catalysis consideration, Ce1-xTixO2 as a support is more important than pure TiO2.
Conclusions
(a) Ce1-xTixO2 (x = 0.1−0.4) solid solutions were synthesized by the solution combustion method.
(b) Ce1-x-yTixPtyO2 (x = 0.15; y = 0.01−0.02) crystallites synthesized by a single step synthesis show that Pt is mainly in the Pt2+ state.
(c) H/Pt molar ratios are 5 and 4 over Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2 and Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ, respectively, and the ratio is just 0.078 over about 8 nm Pt metal particles at 30 °C.
(d) Reducibility of CeO2 is enhanced by Ti4+ ion substitution in Ce1-xTixO2 (x = 0.0−0.4), and Pt ion substitution in Ce1-xTixO2 enhances its reducibility further compared to that of the Pt ion in CeO2.
(e) The rate of CO conversion over Ce0.84Ti0.15Pt0.01O2-δ is 45 times higher than that over Ce0.99Pt0.01O2-δ at 155 °C.
(f) Electronic interaction between Ce4+−Ce3+, Ti4+−Ti3+, and Pt2+−Pt° via overlap of Ce(4f), Pt(5d), and Ti(3d) states in the valence band of Ce1-x-yTixPtyO2-δ is suggested to be responsible for faster electron transfer for higher CO + O2 catalytic activity.
