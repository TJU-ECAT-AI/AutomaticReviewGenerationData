Abstract
The thermodynamic properties of solid solutions of ceria and zirconia, having the general formula Ce1-yZryO2, were studied as a function of temperature and oxygen fugacity by measuring the oxygen content of samples equilibrated in H2/H2O mixtures between 873 and 1173 K. The thermodynamic redox properties were found to be a strong function of oxide composition but were independent of sample surface area and calcination temperature. Ceria−zirconia solid solutions were much more easily reduced than CeO2, so that thermodynamic values such as the enthalpy of oxidation for ceria are not the same as for the solid solution. All of the reduction isotherms for the ceria−zirconia solutions exhibited a plateau in the oxygen stoichiometry at the higher oxygen fugacities accessible using H2/H2O mixtures, suggesting special stabilities for certain reduction states in the solid solutions.

Introduction
Mixtures of ceria and zirconia are an important component in automotive emissions-control catalysts where their ability to store and release oxygen is used to maintain the stoichiometric oxygen-to-fuel ratio that is required for optimal catalyst performance. 1-4 Ceria-based materials are also finding new catalytic applications including supports for water−gas-shift 5-12 and reforming catalysts 13,14 and for hydrocarbon-oxidation catalysts in diesel emissions control systems. 15-17 Furthermore, the importance of ceria in electrochemical applications is growing because it is used in anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) 18 and polymer exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, 19 as a low-temperature electrolyte for SOFCs, 20 and as a barrier layer for SOFC cathodes. 21 Although controversies remain about the mechanisms that ceria plays in many of these applications, it is clear that the redox properties of ceria, doped ceria, and ceria solutions/compounds with other oxides are important.
Given the importance of ceria, and particularly of ceria−zirconia solutions, it is surprising that our fundamental understanding of the redox properties of these and related materials is rather poor. Indeed, there appear to be major discrepancies in the catalytic and thermodynamic literatures on ceria reduction. For example, judging from the thermodynamic data in a recent review, 22 one would not expect to observe significant reduction of ceria in automotive-exhaust catalysts where ceria is used for oxygen storage. According to data from this review, CeO1.98 is the equilibrium stoichiometry at 973 K with an O2 fugacity of 10-23 atm, a fugacity that is established by having 8% H2O/92% H2 or 12% CO2/88% CO mixtures. Reduction is predicted to be even less at lower H2/H2O ratios and lower temperatures. Given that automotive exhaust contains more steam and CO2 than H2 or CO, these data lead to the conclusion that ceria should never undergo significant reduction in the exhaust environment, even under very rich conditions. Note that the presence of small quantities of precious metals in the ceria will change the rate of the oxidation and reduction reactions but should not alter the equilibrium state of the ceria.
Another contradiction comes from the results of Smirnov and Graham, 23 who showed that vapor-deposited Pd films on ceria−zirconia substrates can be completely oxidized by heating to 423 K in ultrahigh vacuum. What makes this surprising is that the reaction, 2CeO2 + Pd → PdO + Ce2O3, should be endothermic by 295 kJ/mol if one uses reported values for the heats of formation of these compounds. 24 Given that the activation energy for transferring 1 mol of O from ceria to Pd must be at least as large as the heat of reaction, the reaction should not occur except possibly at very high temperatures.
To help resolve some of the apparent discrepancies between the thermodynamic data reported in the literature for ceria and the observed properties of ceria in catalytic applications, we have made a series of detailed measurements of the stoichiometry of ceria and ceria−zirconia solutions as a function of oxygen fugacity under reducing conditions. The results of this study show that the thermodynamic redox properties of ceria−zirconia solutions are much different from those of pure ceria and are a function of the composition of the solid solution.
Experimental Methods
Cerium oxide, CeO2, was prepared by thermal decomposition of cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (≥99.5%, Alfa Aesar), at 723 K for 6 h in air. Ceria−zirconia mixed oxides, with composition Ce1-yZryO2 (y = 0.08, 0.19, 0.41, and 0.50), were prepared using the citric acid method, which has been previously described in the literature. 25 Stoichiometric amounts of cerium nitrate hexahydrate and zirconium(IV) oxynitrate hydrate, ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O (99.9%, Aldrich), were dissolved in distilled water and then mixed with aqueous citric acid (≥99.5%, Aldrich) to produce a solution with a ratio of citric acid to total metal ions of 2:1. The solution was stirred vigorously at room temperature for at least 1 h, and then the water was removed by evaporation. The resulting solid was decomposed to produce the oxide by annealing in air at 473 K. The oxide was then ground using a mortal and pestle and further annealed in air at 723 K for 6 h. To vary the surface area and average crystallite size, additional annealing steps at 973 and 1173 K were used.
The sample characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Surface areas were determined by the BET method using Kr as the adsorbent. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Rigaku Geigerflex diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5405 Å). The lattice constants for each sample were estimated using the position of the (220) diffraction peak; the average crystallite sizes were determined using the width of this peak and the Debye−Scherrer equation. Figure 1 shows XRD patterns for Ce1-yZryO2 (y = 0, 0.08, 0.19, 0.41, and 0.50) samples after annealing at 723 K. These data suggest that each sample consisted of a single cubic phase. It has been reported previously that ceria−zirconia solid solutions with intermediate compositions can form metastable tetragonal phases that are difficult to distinguish from a true cubic phase using XRD alone.25 This might indeed be the case for our Ce0.59Zr0.41O2 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 samples, given that the widths of the diffraction peaks made it impossible for us to distinguish between cubic and tetragonal. The inset in the figure shows an expanded view of the (220) peaks and reveals that the lattice constant of the mixed oxide decreases with increasing Zr content. This is due to the smaller ionic radius of Zr4+ (0.84 Å) compared to that of Ce4+ (0.97 Å). The relationship between the lattice constant and the Zr4+ concentration in the oxide was found to obey Vegard's rule, which is consistent with previous reports in the literature.25

The phase stability of the Ce1-yZryO2 samples annealed at higher temperatures was also assessed using XRD. Except for the peak widths, calcining at 973 K for 48 h did not cause any changes in the XRD patterns from those shown in Figure 1. Whereas further increases in the calcination temperature to 1323 K for 4 h had no effect on the structures of the Ce0.92Zr0.8O2 and Ce0.81Zr0.19O2 samples, calcination of the Ce0.59Zr0.41O2 sample at 1323 K caused this material to separate into CeO2-rich (Ce0.78Zr0.22O2) and ZrO2-rich (Ce0.13Zr0.87O2) phases. This result is consistent with that reported in the literature by Colon et al., who also observed high-temperature, phase separation in ceria−zirconia mixed oxides with relatively high zirconia contents. 26
The thermodynamic properties of a Ce1-yZryO2 sample were measured by first allowing the sample to come to equilibrium at a particular O2 fugacity and then measuring the oxygen stoichiometry (i.e., the value of x for Ce1-yZryO2-x) by titrating the amount of O2 required to restore the sample to its fully oxidized state, Ce1-yZryO2. The experiments were carried out as follows:  First, a 0.5−1.0-g sample was placed in a quartz tube reactor and oxidized in flowing air at the temperature of interest for 1 h. The sample was then allowed to equilibrate at a given O2 fugacity by exposing it to a flowing (30 mL/min) mixture of H2 and H2O at the desired temperature for 3 h. Water and H2 were introduced into the reactor by passing a stream of pure H2 through a temperature-controlled water bubbler, and the H2O partial pressure was determined by the vapor pressure of H2O. It is assumed that the O2 fugacity is established by the equilibrium constant for H2 oxidation according to the following equations:
After equilibration of the sample with the H2/H2O mixture, the reactor was purged with dry He for 0.5 h. The extent of reduction of the resulting Ce1-yZryO2-x sample was then determined by measuring the amount of oxygen consumed upon reoxidation of the sample. This was accomplished by flowing air (21% O2 and 79% N2) over the sample at a rate of 4.3 mL/min and measuring the composition of the effluent gas from the reactor using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The N2 signal was used as an internal standard for determining the amount of O2 consumed by oxidation of the sample.
In these experiments, a typical O2 fugacity (PO2) at 973 K was 10-22 atm. Given that the concentration of an ideal gas at 973 K and 10-22 atm is less than 1 molecule/L, it is important to realize that the fugacity is not equivalent to the partial pressure. In our experiments, equilibrium between the solid and the gas is established by oxidation of ceria with steam and reduction of ceria by H2. As long as the oxidation and reduction rates are both high, equilibrium is established. In this study, we demonstrated that equilibrium was attained by showing that the solid reached the same extent of reduction regardless of whether one started with a reduced or an oxidized sample. In several cases, CO/CO2 mixtures were also used to set the value of PO2, and this gave results identical to those obtained when using the H2/H2O mixtures, thus providing further confirmation that equilibrium was indeed attained.
Results and Discussion
To demonstrate the validity of the methods employed to measure the stoichiometry of partially reduced ceria−zirconia samples, measurements were initially made for pure ceria samples produced by decomposing Ce(NO3)3 in air. The results of these measurements are presented in Figure 2 as a plot of the O/Ce atomic ratio in the sample as a function of PO2 for temperatures between 873 and 1173 K. For this temperature range, the data are nearly indistinguishable from those reported by Bevan and Kordis, 27 who used gravimetric methods to measure the ceria composition and primarily CO/CO2 mixtures to establish the O2 fugacity. The change in the shape of the isotherms in going from 973 to 1073 K was also observed by Bevan and Kordis and attributed to the presence of two ceria phases in equilibrium at 973 K and below. It is also worth noting that the enthalpy of oxidation (ΔH) determined from a plot of d ln(P) vs d(1/T) using the data in Figure 2 for O/Ce ratios less than 1.95 is −760 ± 20 kJ/mol of O2. This is identical to ΔH for the reaction 2CeO2 → Ce2O3 + 1/2O2 determined using heats of formation reported in the literature.24

The two sets of data collected at 973 K in Figure 2 also show that surface-area effects were not significant in our measurements. The open-circle data points were obtained using a sample that had never been heated above 973 K and still had a surface area of 35 m2/g after the experiments had been performed. The solid circles were obtained using a sample that had been heated under both oxidizing and reducing conditions at 1173 K and had a surface area of only 2 m2/g. It is significant that the two data sets can be superimposed. Using CeO2(100) as a basis for calculation, surface reduction of the 35 m2/g sample corresponds to 7% of the bulk reduction, so that a shift in the position of the isotherm should have been observed if the thermodynamics of the surface were dramatically different than those of the bulk. This does not appear to be the case.
Figure 3 shows reduction isotherms at 973 K for CeyZr1-yO2 samples with y = 0, 0.08, 0.19, 0.41, 0.50, and 1.0. These data clearly show that the mixed ceria−zirconia samples undergo reduction at much higher values of PO2 than pure CeO2 or ZrO2. For example, the equilibrium O/M (M = Ce + Zr) ratio in the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 sample at a PO2 value of 10-26 atm is 1.79, which corresponds to reduction of 84% of the cerium cations from 4+ to 3+. In contrast, for pure CeO2, the O/Ce ratio at a PO2 value of 10-26 atm is 1.86, which corresponds to only 28% of the cerium cations being reduced to the 3+ oxidation state. It is also worth noting that, even at the highest PO2 values that were accessible using H2/H2O mixtures, a significant fraction of the cerium cations in each of the ceria−zirconia samples remained in the 3+ oxidation state. For the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 sample, roughly half of the cerium cations were in the 3+ oxidation state at PO2 = 10-21 atm. Another interesting observation is that the sample showing the greatest extent of reduction at all PO2 values was the Ce0.59Zr0.41O2 sample. Boaro et al. 28 also observed an optimal composition for maximizing oxygen release in ceria−zirconia solutions. Finally, the data for Ce0.92Zr0.08O2 show that annealing this sample at 1323 K, which resulted in a decrease in surface area from 57 to 24 m2/g, did not induce phase separation and had no effect on the thermodynamic properties.

Figure 4 shows reduction isotherms for the Ce0.81Zr0.19O2 sample at temperatures between 873 and 1173 K. It is interesting that the limiting value of the O/M ratio at high PO2 values for this sample was ∼1.9 at all of the temperatures studied, suggesting that this composition, i.e., Ce0.81Zr0.19O1.90, corresponds to a relatively stable compound. The oxygen associated with the reduction of Ce0.81Zr0.19O2 to Ce0.81Zr0.19O1.90 is almost certainly the most interesting oxygen from a catalytic standpoint; however, determination of the enthalpy changes associated with removing this oxygen requires equilibrium conditions at PO2 values higher than those obtainable in the experimental apparatus used in this study and will therefore be left to a future investigation. For now, it is worthwhile to observe that the differential enthalpies for even deep reduction of Ce0.81Zr0.19O2 are significantly different from that of pure CeO2. As shown in Figure 5, the differential enthalpy of reduction at O/M ratios below 1.9, estimated from the data in Figure 4, is ∼500 kJ/mol of O2 and is independent of the extent of reduction, further demonstrating that the ceria−zirconia solid solutions are more easily reduced than pure ceria.

The XRD data in Figure 6A show that the Ce0.81Zr0.19O2-x sample maintains a cubic structure, even when heavily reduced. The inset in this figure shows that the position of the diffraction peaks is a function of the extent of reduction. This change can be attributed to a small increase in the lattice constant resulting from the increase in the size of the cerium cations upon reduction from Ce4+ to Ce3+ and the introduction of oxygen vacancies. Hong and Virkar 29 have performed a detailed study of the structure of CeO2 doped with 3+ rare-earth ions and developed a model that relates the lattice constant to the dopant concentration. The situation in the present study is analogous in that we are replacing Ce4+ cations in a cubic, fluorite ceria−zirconia lattice with Ce3+ cations that are produced by partial reduction of the sample. Therefore, the model developed by Hong and Virkar should be applicable to the samples used in the present study. The only modification that needs to be made is to account for the fact that the unreduced (i.e., undoped) sample contains both Ce4+ and Zr4+ cations. This modification can be accomplished using a concentration-weighted average to determine an effective radius for the 4+ cations (in essence using Vegard's rule). Using this modification and the values for the ionic radii r(Ce4+) = 0.97 Å, r(Ce3+) = 1.14 Å, r(Zr4+) = 0.84 Å, and r(O2-) = 1.38 Å, 29,30 we calculated the lattice parameter as a function of Ce3+ concentration in Ce0.81Zr0.19O2-x. (The reader is referred to the Hong and Virkar paper for the details of the model.29) The results of this calculation are presented as the solid line in Figure 6B. Note that the calculations are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined lattice constants for Ce0.81Zr0.19O1.83 and Ce0.81Zr0.19O1.9. This result serves as further confirmation that phase separation is not occurring upon reduction of the Ce0.81Zr0.19O2 sample.

To our knowledge, the only previous studies in the literature that report thermodynamic data for the reduction of ceria−zirconia solutions are those of Otobe et al., 31 who used electrochemical methods to measure reduction isotherms for the pyrochlore, Ce2Zr2O7+x, and Huang et al., 32 who used the CALPHAD method to estimate phase diagrams and reduction isotherms for mixed ceria−zirconias. A comparison of the results obtained at 973 K in the present study with those reported in these previous studies is presented in Figure 7. Although there is poor correspondence between our data and the calculation of Huang et al., there are some interesting similarities with the pyrochlore data of Otobe et al. First, there is a significant change in the oxygen stoichiometry in both data sets as PO2 increases from 10-25 to 10-20 atm. Second, Otobe et al. also commented on the presence of a “plateau” corresponding to the Ce0.5Zr0.5O1.87 stoichiometry, although it is certainly less noticeable in their data than in ours. Even with these similarities, there are clearly quantitative differences between the two data sets. This might be due to differences in the structure of the samples used in the two studies, because we did not attempt to synthesize samples with the pyrochlore structure. Additional evidence for the dependence of the reducibility of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 on synthesis and pretreatment conditions can be found in the literature. 33-35 For example, Fornasiero et al. showed that temperature-programmed reduction peak temperatures for ceria−zirconias shift dramatically and reversibly as a function of sample pretreatment conditions34 and that these changes can be related to formation of a stable pyrochlore structure.35

Clearly, important questions remain about the reducibility of ceria−zirconia solid solutions, especially regarding the nature of the oxygen removed at low extents of reduction. However, we have shown that the properties of ceria−zirconias are quite different from those of either oxide. Despite the large number of studies that have been carried out to understand these materials, the mixed oxides remain an interesting topic for investigation.
Conclusions
The following conclusions can be drawn from this study of the redox properties of ceria and ceria−zirconia solid solutions:
1. The thermodynamic redox properties of ceria powders prepared at low temperatures with relatively high surface areas were found to be indistinguishable from the thermodynamic properties of high-temperature-calcined ceria reported in the literature. Surprisingly, no evidence was found for differences in the redox properties associated with surface oxygen.
2. The thermodynamic redox properties were found to be a strong function of composition but were independent of surface area or calcination temperature, as long as calcination did not affect the phase of the mixed oxide. This is unlike the reduction kinetics, which depends strongly on surface area and the presence of a catalyst.
3. The properties of ceria−zirconia solid solutions were found to be very different from those of pure ceria. Unlike pure ceria, all of the solid solutions contained weakly bound oxygen that could be removed at relatively high PO2 values, inaccessible through the use of H2/H2O mixtures. The differential enthalpy changes associated with even deep reduction of the solid solutions were significantly lower than that for pure ceria.
4. Although the solid solutions remained in the cubic structure following reduction, there is evidence in the oxidation isotherms for oxygen stoichiometries having particularly high stabilities (i.e., Ce0.81Zr0.19O1.90; Ce0.5Zr0.5O1.87.).
