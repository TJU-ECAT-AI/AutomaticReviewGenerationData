Abstract
In an exploratory search for new oxygen storage materials (OSMs), we have identified a fluorite-type solid solution series, Ce1−xCrxO2+y (0 < x ≤ 1/3), of which the x = 1/3 member, Ce2/3Cr1/3O2.11 (oxide I), exhibits excellent reversible oxygen release/storage properties at relatively low temperatures (∼350 °C). Oxide I prepared by a hydrothermal route crystallizes in a metastable nanocrystalline (∼4 nm) fluorite type structure (a = 5.352 Å) where the cerium and chromium are randomly distributed. Characterization of oxide I by electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry for the composition, crystal structure, oxidation states of metal atoms, and oxygen stoichiometry yields the formula CeIV2/3CrVI1/9CrIV2/9O2.10 ± 0.02 for oxide I. Investigation of oxygen release/intake by temperature programmed hydrogen reduction and thermogravimetric studies has revealed that oxide I possesses a high oxygen storage capacity of 0.175 moles of O2/mole up to 550 °C; this value is better than or comparable to the best OSMs based on CeO2−ZrO2. The temperature (∼350 °C) at which facile oxygen release/intake occurs with oxide I is also lower than that of CeO2−ZrO2 based oxides. Formation of oxide I with a cation-disordered fluorite structure, unlike other lanthanide analogs, and its oxygen release/storage properties are discussed in terms of the redox chemistry of CeIV/III and CrVI/IV in the solid state.

Synopsis
Characterization of a metastable nanocrystalline fluorite type oxide, Ce2/3Cr1/3O2.10, displaying reversible oxygen storage/release properties that appear to be better than or competitive to the existing oxygen storage materials based on CeO2−ZrO2 oxides is described.
Introduction
Solid materials that store and release oxygen reversibly at moderate temperatures (oxygen storage materials ≡ OSMs) have proven/potential application in many fields of technology. CeO2−ZrO2 mixed oxides are well-known OSMs that already find application as three-way catalyst for the removal of NOx, CO, and hydrocarbons from automobile exhaust emissions. (1, 2) Other applications envisaged for OSMs include: improving the efficiency of H2−O2 fuel cells by incorporating them in the cathode, (3) hydrocarbon/soot oxidation catalysts for emission control from diesel engines (4) and possibly for the production of hydrogen by thermochemical water splitting. (5) To meet these demands, there is a need for new OSMs that store and release large quantities of oxygen at relatively low temperatures (<400 °C). Rare earth oxysulfates, R2O2SO4 (R = rare earth), are a new class of OSMs (6-8) due to the reaction R2O2SO4 → R2O2S + 2O2 that occurs at relatively higher temperatures (≥700 °C). Our efforts to understand and develop new/better OSMs have revealed (9) a synergistic redox role between Ce/Zr that renders CeO2−ZrO2 oxides better OSMs than the corresponding CeO2−HfO2 oxides. Continuing our efforts in this direction with several CeO2-MOx (M = transition metal) systems and keeping in view the Ce/M redox characteristics in oxides as well as crystal chemistry, we have been able to develop a new OSM based on CeO2−CrO3 oxides. The new material, synthesized by a soft-chemical hydrothermal route and stabilized in the fluorite structure through a CeIV/III−CrVI/IV redox process, exhibits excellent oxygen storage/release property that appears to be better than or at least competitive to that of the CeO2−ZrO2-based oxides. The details of synthesis, structure and investigation of oxygen storage/release behavior of the best composition in the CeO2−CrO3 system, viz., Ce2/3Cr1/3O2+y, are described in this paper. After we have completed our work, we came across the report (10) of a new series of oxygen storage materials, REBaCo4O7+δ (RE = rare earth), that show a similar oxygen storage capacity.
Experimental Section
CeO2−CrO3 mixed oxides were synthesized by a hydrothermal method from the starting materials, (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 (CAN), CrO3, and diethylenetriamine (DETA), taken in the molar ratio (1−x), x, and 3.00, respectively. Typically, for the synthesis of Ce2/3Cr1/3O2+y (x = 1/3), 6.67 mmol of CAN were dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water and 3.33 mmol of CrO3 were dissolved in 15 mL of distilled water. Both the solutions were mixed and 0.03 moles (3.1 mL) of DETA were added. The resulting mixture turned into a dark yellow colored gel. The volume of the gel was made up to 45 mL with water and transferred to three Teflon-lined hydrothermal pressure vessels (of 20 mL capacity) and tightly closed. The pressure vessels were heated at 200 °C for 24 h in a hot air oven. After the reaction, the solid products were centrifuged out, washed and dried at 110 °C. x = 0.10 and 0.20 members of the Ce1−xCrxO2+y series were synthesized by a similar procedure by reacting appropriate amounts of CAN, CrO3, and DETA.
Characterization of the solid products was carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis (JEOL JSM - 5600LV Scanning Electron Microscope) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Philips X’Pert Diffractometer fitted with graphite crystal monochromator, Cu Kα radiation). Structures were refined by the Rietveld method on the CeO2-fluorite model by means of Fullprof program. (11) For this purpose, XRD data were collected at a scan rate of 0.25° 2θ min−1 with a 0.01° step size in the 2θ range between 10 and 80°. For Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies, a toluene dispersion of the sample was dropped onto holey carbon coated Cu grids and the images were recorded with FeI Technai 20 instrument at 200kV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Thermoscientific Multilab 2000 equipment employing Al Kα X-rays. XPS binding energies are accurate within ± 0.1 eV. Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses were carried out on a home-built apparatus in flowing 10% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) and in air in the temperature range 30−600 °C at a heating rate of 4 °C/min.
Oxygen storage/release properties of Ce1−xCrxO2+y were studied by hydrogen intake measurements carried out in a microreactor (30 cm length and 0.4 cm internal diameter) employing 5.49% H2/Ar (certified calibration gases mixture obtained from Bhoruka Gases Ltd., Bangalore, India) with 30 sccm flow rate and 10 °C/min heating rate, up to 550 °C. Volume of hydrogen intake/consumption by the sample was calibrated against CuO standard. CO oxidation and direct O2 evolution from the Ce1−xCrxO2+y samples were investigated in a similar microreactor employing 1 vol % CO/He and UHP He gases, respectively, at a total gas flow of 100 sccm over 250 mg of oxide sample at a linear heating rate of 10 °C min−1 up to 600 °C. Gaseous products were analyzed by means of a quadrupole mass spectrometer.
Results and Discussion
We investigated the formation of fluorite-type phases in CeO2-MOx for several transition metals such as M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ru, employing hydrothermal synthesis method (described in the Experimental Section). Fluorite-type phases were formed for M = Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ru over different ranges of composition. Subsequent investigations revealed that clean reproducible characteristics in terms of phase stability and reversible oxygen release and intake were displayed by members of Ce1−xCrxO2+y system, of which the composition with x = 1/3, Ce2/3Cr1/3O2+y (I) turned out to be the best OSM. Therefore, we largely focus our results and discussion on this particular composition. In doing so, we recognize the toxicity of chromium, especially Cr(VI), and related concerns for the actual use of these materials in application/technology and therefore we do not suggest that these materials could serve as a replacement straightaway for the existing Ce−Zr−O oxides.
Oxide I obtained by the hydrothermal route is single phase fluorite with a = 5.352 (2) Å (Figure 1a and Table 1). SEM and EDX data further confirm single phase nature of this material with 2:1 Ce/Cr stoichiometry (Ce = 0.65 ± 0.02 and Cr = 0.35 ± 0.02). It should be mentioned that, for Ce1−xCrxO2+y samples, the nominal composition and the final composition remain the same for x ≤ 1/3. TEM images and corresponding electron diffraction (ED) patterns (Figure 2) of x = 1/3 composition (oxide I) show that the as-prepared and dried sample is nanocrystalline in nature, having crystallites in the range of ∼ 4 nm in size. Line widths of powder XRD reflections (Figure 1a) are consistent with the nanocrystalline particle sizes (average particle size estimated from line width is ∼ 4 nm).

We investigated the oxidation states of chromium and cerium in I by means of XPS. Core level Cr (2p) spectrum for oxide I is compared with the corresponding spectra for Cr2O3 and CrO3 in Figure 3. The data clearly reveal that, contrary to our expectation of Ce2IIICrVIO6 formulation for oxide I, chromium occurs in a mixed-valence state with the likely oxidation states of CrIV and CrVI roughly in the ratio 2:1. Cr (2p3/2) binding energies (BE) for these two states obtained from the spectrum (Figure 3a), 576.9 and 579.3 eV, are consistent with the expected BE values for Cr (IV) and Cr (VI) in oxides. (12) The Ce 3d XPS spectrum (Figure 4a) shows that cerium occurs in the IV state in oxide I (Ce 3d5/2 BE in oxide I is 881.8 and 881.7 eV in CeO2). Independent estimate of oxygen stoichiometry, obtained by iodometric titration, gave the value, Ce2/3Cr1/3O2.10±0.02. Combining this result with XPS results, we formulate oxide I as CeIV2/3CrVI1/9CrIV2/9O2.11.

Thermogravimetry (TG) (Figure 5) not only provides additional support to the above formula but also reveals the nature of oxygen release/intake by this material. The total weight loss under reducing condition (Figure 5a) up to 700 °C (stage 3) is 6.8%. The weight loss calculated for the reduction reaction
(1)
is 6.75%. We see a change in slope around 275 °C (stage 1) and a small plateau around 600 °C (stage 2) in the TG curve (Figure 5a). The weight loss found up to 275 °C is ∼2.5%,which is close to the weight loss expected for the reaction (2.8%)
(2)
The weight loss found up to 600 °C (stage 2) is ∼ 6.0%, which would correspond to the composition CeIV0.147CeIII0.52CrIII0.333O1.573. We have checked the powder XRD patterns of the sample obtained at all the three stages 1, 2 and 3. The completely reduced product (stage 3) was found to be a mixture of perovskite like CeCrO3 (a ≃ 3.87Å) and fluorite like CeO2−y (a ≃ 5.425Å). Intermediate products 1 and 2 however retain the fluorite structure. We show the Rietveld refined powder XRD pattern of the product obtained by heating oxide I up to 550 °C in H2/Ar in Figure 1b (Table 1, a = 5.407 (2) Å). The Cr (2p) and Ce (3d) XPS spectra (Figure 3 b and 4b) show that Cr is in the III state and cerium in mixed (III/IV) state in this product, as expected from TG weight loss data.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Thermogravimetry (TG) curves for (a) reduction of oxide I in hydrogen/argon, (b) reduction of oxide I in air, and (c) reoxidation of oxide I reduced in hydrogen/argon up to 555 °C.
Oxide I releases oxygen in air itself as revealed by TG (Figure 5b) and the weight loss found up to 550 °C is ∼2.8%. The product at this stage retains the fluorite structure (Figure 1c). Interestingly, the reduced fluorite-type products obtained both in hydrogen and air could be reoxidized by heating in oxygen/air almost regaining the weight corresponding to the starting material, oxide I (Figure 5c). Accordingly, we see that oxide I could function as a reversible OSM within the temperature range of 550 °C; oxygen release starts at as low a temperature as 250 °C in hydrogen and at 400 °C in air.
Oxygen release/storage properties of Ce1−xCrxO2+y oxides were investigated by temperature programmed hydrogen reduction (TPR) studies (Figure 6). Oxide I takes up hydrogen from 250 °C and reduction is complete around ∼350 °C (peak in Figure 6a). Total oxygen release estimated from the area under the curve (Figure 6a) corresponds to about 0.36 O which is equivalent to about 4% weight loss; the latter is consistent with the TG weight loss (eq 2). Ce1−xCrxO2+y oxides with x = 0.1 and x = 0.2 also show hydrogen intake at slightly higher temperatures with smaller amount of oxygen release (lines b and c in Figure 6) that is consistent with the composition. For comparison, we also show the hydrogen intake curves for fluorite Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and CeO2 under similar conditions in Figure 6d and e respectively. In Figure 7, we show TPR curves for five cycles and the data for a sample stored for a long time (6 months), revealing that the oxygen release/storage property of oxide I is robust with respect to cycling up to ∼550 °C and “aging”.

Figure 7. Temperature-programmed hydrogen consumption/intake for the reduction of oxide I showing reversible reduction/oxidation for five cycles (a−e). Curve (f) was recorded on a sample of oxide I stored for about 6 months, showing no significant deterioration of oxygen storage capacity.
Clearly, hydrogen intake/oxygen release from oxide I occurs at a lower temperature than from Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. Also, pure CeO2 does not show a significant hydrogen intake in this temperature range. Thus, hydrogen intake studies establish that oxide I is a better OSM than Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. It should be mentioned that the reduced/decomposed sample obtained by heating the oxide I in hydrogen/argon (containing CeCrO3 and CeO2-y) shows a much less oxygen storage capacity (∼0.07 moles O2/mole).
Interestingly, oxide I releases oxygen even under nonreducing conditions. A TPR study of the gaseous products evolved when oxide I is heated in a flow of He gas (Figure 8) shows that oxygen release occurs at ∼350 °C. We have also investigated CO oxidation over oxide I under anaerobic conditions (absence of external oxygen gas). From Figure 9a, we see that CO oxidation starts at as low a temperature as ∼200 °C. Under similar conditions, CO oxidation over Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 occurs >300 °C (Figure 9b).

Our results described above show that oxide I is a better OSM than Ce1−xZrxO2 oxides, both in terms of total oxygen storage capacity and the temperature range at which oxygen release/intake occurs. The maximum oxygen storage capacity expected for Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 is 0.125 moles of O2/mole (1693 μM/g) and the experimentally observed value up to 500 °C for one of the best Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 samples is 0.11 moles of O2/mole (1500 μM /g). (13) For oxide I, the corresponding values are (0.18 moles of O2/mole; 2603 μM /g: expected) and (0.175 moles of O2/mole; 2513 μM/g: found up to 550 °C). It is known (13) that highest oxygen storage capacity is obtained for disordered/atomically homogeneous CeO2−ZrO2 oxides with the fluorite structure. We believe that formation of oxide I with the fluorite structure where Ce/Cr are atomically disordered is one of the factors that contributes to a high oxygen storage capacity. Another likely factor that favors the high oxygen storage capacity is that, whereas Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 depends on CeIV/CeIII redox couple for its oxygen storage/release, oxide I employs both CeIV/CeIII and CrVI/IV/CrIII redox processes for its oxygen storage/release.
Formation of oxide I with a fluorite structure where cerium and chromium are disordered stands in contrast to the well-defined layered structure of other lanthanide oxychromates, Ln2O2CrO4 (Ln = rare earth). (14) This difference in structure most likely arises from the redox characteristics of CeIV/CeIII (1.61 eV) and CrVI/CrIII (1.33 eV). (15) In aqueous media, one would therefore expect from the solution redox potentials that the equilibrium
(3)
would lie to the right. Accordingly, the ideal formulation of Ce2/3Cr1/3O2 would be CeIII2CrVIO6, similar to other lanthanide analogs. (14) On the contrary, formation of oxide I with the cation disordered fluorite structure where chromium is in a mixed-valence (CrIV/CrVI) state and cerium is almost exclusively in the IV state could be due to the redox instability of CrVI in the fluorite structure, where it would be coordinated to eight oxygen atoms. (16) CrVI, which is normally stabilized in the tetrahedral oxygen coordination (CrO42−), would be highly unstable in the fluorite structure, bringing down the empty CrVI:3d0 closer to O (2p) states and closer to CeIII/CeIV redox energy (16) (Figure 10). Accordingly, an electron transfer from CeIII to CrVI becomes facile in the solid state. Thus Ce2/3Cr1/3O2 fluorite would be CeIV2CrIVO6 rather than CeIII2CrVIO6 in the solid state. Presumably, further oxidation of CeIV2CrIVO6 occurs under our synthesis conditions to yield the actual oxide I with the formula CeIV2CrVI1/3CrIV2/3O6.3, where chromium exists in a mixed-valence (CrVI/CrIV) state. Structurally, excess oxygens could be accommodated at interstitial sites in the fluorite structure. (17)

In summary, we have described a new metastable fluorite-type oxide of the composition, Ce2/3Cr1/3O2.11 (a = 5.352 (2) Å), where CeIV and mixed valent CrVI/CrIV are randomly distributed at the cation sites of the fluorite structure. The material exhibits a high oxygen storage capacity of 0.175 moles O2/mole up to 550 °C (retaining the fluorite structure) and a facile oxygen release/intake at a relatively low temperature of ∼350 °C under reducing conditions. Moreover, the material also releases oxygen under anaerobic condition around 350 °C and oxidizes CO at ∼200 °C. All these characteristics make the oxide I an excellent OSM that is better than or at least competitive to Ce1−xZrxO2 oxides. Further investigations to show the viability of Ce1−xCrxO2+y oxides for catalytic and other applications should keep in mind the toxicity of chromium(VI).
