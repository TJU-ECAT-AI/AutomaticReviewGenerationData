I. INTRODUCTION
The ability of cerium oxide (ceria) to undergo a reversible change from its formal
+
4
oxidation state in
CeO
2
to a
+
3
oxidation state makes it a material of great interest in a number of areas, such as catalysis,1 intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,2 and gas sensors.3 This change in oxidation state is coupled with the relative ease with which oxygen vacancies form. All told, this phenomenon makes ceria an attractive material for catalysis. This includes important reactions such as oxidation of CO to
CO
2
and reduction of
NO
X
to
N
2
⁠, as well as the water gas shift reaction. In the ceria-catalyzed CO oxidation, the reaction can proceed in the following redox scheme:
CO
+
NO

CO

+

N
2
or through a reaction in which CO abstracts oxygen from the oxide surface and
O
2
can then fill the vacancy with another CO reacting with this species to form
CO
2
and heal the surface vacancy. In both reaction schemes, a key reaction is that in which CO reacts with the oxide surface, pulling oxygen out of the surface.4,5
To enhance the reaction of CO with ceria, we can think about reducing the energy needed to form the oxygen vacancy, which makes the key reaction of abstraction of oxygen by CO more favorable. We, and others, have shown that the interaction of CO with ceria surfaces is rather surface dependent—with no interaction at all with the (111) surface and strong interactions with the (110) and (100) surfaces.6–8 
Recent modeling studies have shown that doping with Zr (Refs. 9 and 10) can enhance the interaction of CO with ceria, making CO oxidation more favorable. Furthermore, we have also shown that Au,11,12 Ti, and Hf (Ref. 10) doping also enhances the interaction of CO with ceria. There has also been recent experimental work in this area. For example Patil et al.13 found that La-doping of
CeO
2
nanoparticles increase the concentration of oxygen vacancies and La-doping of ceria was found to promote soot oxidation by Bueno-Lopez et al.14 A recent publication by Hernandez et al.15 showed that
Eu
3
+
doping of ceria enhances CO oxidation up to a critical concentration (above which phase separation occurs).
This paper studies La doping of ceria (with a more detailed analysis of structure and energetics to be presented in another publication16) with the central aim of understanding how La doping modifies the interaction of CO with ceria (111) and (110) surfaces. We apply first principles density functional theory, corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions

⁠,17 throughout the paper to describe the ceria (111) and (110) surfaces. The
DFT
+
U
method is by now well known to provide a consistent treatment of reduced Ce ions in ceria, e.g, Refs. 18–20, which are important for understanding reactivity. In this approach, the value of
U
must be determined; our earlier work arrived at
U
=
5
eV
⁠, based on comparison of the photoemission spectrum of reduced ceria21 and the computed density of states (DOS);18,19 subsequent work has shown this value of
U
to be suitable for describing a range of properties of ceria and we choose it for this work.
We find that (i) La doping leads to formation of electronic hole states localized at oxygen, i.e., the
[
La

]
defect state, (ii) oxygen vacancy formation in
CeO
2
is enhanced at both surfaces and (iii) the interaction of CO with the doped surfaces can lead to
CO
2
or carbonate formation, but is more favorable over the undoped surface.
II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
We use slab models of the surfaces and a plane wave basis set to describe the valence electronic wave functions with the VASP code.22 The cutoff for the kinetic energy is 396 eV. For the core-valence interaction we apply Blöchl’s projector augmented wave approach.23 For Ce, we use 12 valence electrons, for La 11 valence electrons and for O and C six and four valence electrons. We use the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof approximation for the exchange-correlation functional.24 In common with earlier studies,18–20 we use density functional theory (DFT) corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions

⁠, where

and is applied to the Ce 4f states. The details of this approach and our choice of
U
are discussed extensively in Refs. 18 and 19. k-point sampling is performed using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme with a
(

sampling grid.
The (111) surface is type II (in the Tasker classification) with neutral, stoichiometric trilayers of O–Ce–O along the slab, while the (110) surface is a type I surface with each plane made up of neutral stoichiometric
CeO
2
layers. No dipole moment is present upon cleaving in both slabs.25 We use a
(
4
×
4
)
expansion of the (111) surface supercell and a
(
4
×
2
)
expansion of the (110) surface supercell. In the (111) surface, one dopant gives an overall doping level of 1.6% and in the (110) surface, the dopant concentration is 1.8%. This dopant concentration is consistent with what has been presented in the literature13–15 and at these dopant concentrations the material retains the ceria cubic fluorite structure. The slab models are 4 trilayers (11.5 Å) and 7
CeO
2
layers (11.5 Å) thick for (111) and (110) with a 15 Å vacuum gap and the bottom two layers were fixed during the relaxations. All calculations are spin polarized.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Modeling of La doping of the (111) and (110) ceria surfaces with
DFT
+
U
We begin by describing the ceria surfaces after La doping with a more detailed discussion of the energetics and structure to be given in another publication.16 The structures of the La-doped
CeO
2
(111) surface are shown in Fig. 1(a) and for the La doped (110) surface in Fig. 1(c). We show the structures with two La dopants, which have their optimum separation at La–La distances of 6.70 and 5.40 Å for the (111) and (110) surfaces, respectively. In both surfaces La prefers to be found in the outermost layer of Ce ions and the La dopant distributions shown were determined by considering possible La–La distributions at both surfaces.16

In both surfaces, the presence of the La dopant leads to a localized distortion around the dopant and the formation of an electronic hole localized on one oxygen atom. Without the
U
term on O 2p states, we find that the hole is delocalized over many oxygen atoms in the surface. On the (111) surface, the La–O distance to the terminal oxygen atoms is 2.52 Å, while to the subsurface oxygen atoms, the La–O distances are 2.46 Å, which compare to surface Ce–O distances of 2.36 Å. In the (110) surface, each La has one long surface La–O distance of 2.60 Å and three shorter distances of 2.40, 2.41, and 2.48 Å. La–O distances to subsurface oxygen atoms are 2.32 Å, which are similar to Ce–O distances in the undoped surface. Thus, the local surface structure around the dopant is distorted compared to the undoped surface.
To investigate the destination of the oxygen hole, we plot the excess spin density (difference between up and down spin electron density) in Fig. 1(b) for the (111) surface and Fig. 1(d) for the (110) surface. The spin density is strongly localized on two surface terminating oxygen atoms, each such oxygen near a dopant with computed spin magnetizations of 0.93 on each oxygen in (111) and 0.87 on each oxygen in (110). These are the oxygen atoms with the longer La–O distances, so that the hole localization and structural distortion are coupled.26,27 There is a very small spin density on some neighboring oxygen atoms. Thus upon doping of the (111) and (100) ceria surfaces with La, the localized electronic hole defect is formed. The formation of this species in metal oxides doped with lower valence cations is well known with a number of reviews on this topic, e.g., Refs. 28 and 29. Other examples include Li-doped ZnO,30 Na doped
BaTiO

(Ref. 31), and Mg doped

⁠.32 
There are as yet no experimental demonstrations of the formation of this defect center in ceria that we are aware of and we suggest that this will be a fruitful avenue for further exploration. There is some work on trivalent cation substitution in zirconia33,34 that shows the formation of oxygen holes in the system, and a recent Hartree–Fock study of Al-doped
TiO
2
showed that an oxygen hole forms35 so that the presence of oxygen holes in La-doped ceria is very probable, but can only be obtained with a
U
term on the O 2p states.
Next, we remove an oxygen atom from this structure and compute the oxygen vacancy formation energy—to investigate the possibility that an oxygen vacancy forms to compensate the
[
La
3
+
–
O
−
]
defect centers. The most stable sites for the oxygen vacancy (see Ref. 16 for a detailed discussion) are found to have an energy cost of 0.90 eV on the (111) surface and 0.64 eV on the (110) surface; these energies are notably reduced over the undoped surfaces, which are 2.60 and 1.99 eV from Ref. 19 and 1.93 eV for (110) in Ref. 36, but are positive, indicating that the oxygen hole defect will be present upon La doping. An important point to note is that when the oxygen vacancy forms it does not necessarily compensate the electronic hole states localized at the oxygen site, as would be expected from simple defect chemistry. Instead we always find that one hole is compensated and a
Ce
3
+
ion forms with a full discussion of this point presented in Ref. 16; we were unable to find a solution in which an oxygen vacancy leads to formation of a
[
Ce
4
+
–
O
vacancy
]
defect. This is in contrast to, e.g., Li doped MgO (Ref. 37) and arises from the ease with which Ce is reduced to
Ce
3
+
⁠, so that in this case hole compensation and cation reduction will compete. Experimental investigations of this aspect of La-doped ceria would be of great interest. The reducibility of the oxide cation will be key in determining what defect is present when the oxygen vacancy forms.
B. CO adsorption
Although there is an energy cost to form an oxygen vacancy at the La-doped (111) and (110) ceria surfaces, this energy cost is relatively small; this means that a real sample could conceivably have both localized electronic hole states and
Ce
3
+
present. We therefore consider the possibility that CO could adsorb at a vacancy free, doped surface and at a doped surface with an oxygen vacancy and show results for CO adsorbed at La-doped surfaces for each possibility. Numerous possible CO adsorption sites were considered for each surface. Many of these lead to no appreciable interaction between CO and the doped surface. Furthermore, on the La-doped (111) surface with an oxygen vacancy, no strongly bound configurations were found. In a separate calculation, we find that formation of a second oxygen vacancy at this doped surface has a high cost of 1.9 eV, so that the interaction of CO with this surface when the dopant is compensated will not be expected to be favorable.
Only adsorption configurations on the (111) surface with no oxygen vacancies lead to a strong interaction between CO and the surface. In Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), we show the final adsorbed species at the (111) surface that result from CO adsorption. The two configurations [denoted I and II, Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)] result from a strong interaction between the surface and CO that changes the structure of the original CO species. For configuration I the adsorption energy is −0.87 eV and for configuration II the adsorption energy is −0.97 eV. In both configurations, a
CO
2
-like moiety is adsorbed at the surface; this structure forms during the relaxation with no barrier present to formation.

[(a) and (b)] CO adsorption structures at vacancy free La-doped (111) surface. The color scheme of Fig. 1 is used, except that carbon is colored gray.
In configuration I, the C–O distances are 1.18 Å (to surface oxygen,

⁠) and 1.1 Å (to oxygen of the initial CO,
O
C
⁠), while for configuration II, the C–O distances are 1.17 Å for
C

O
S
and 1.16 Å for
C
–
O
C
⁠. The C–O distances in the adsorbed species are consistent with those in free
CO
2
(with Ce–O distance of 1.16 Å), indicating that upon adsorption,
CO
2
forms directly, rather than through a carbonate intermediate; we will contrast this with the (110) surface in the following. This behavior is different to the undoped surface,7 where no such CO adsorption configurations have been found; with an adsorption energy of 0.26 eV, CO shows physisorption and demonstrates the strong impact of doping on improving the reactivity of ceria. At the doping concentration used in the calculations, this finding is consistent with experimental work.14,15
On the doped vacancy free (110) surface, there are two adsorption configurations in which CO interacts strongly with the surface. These structures are shown in Figs. 3(a)–3(d) and are both carbonatelike. This bidentate carbonate adsorption structure is of course well-known for CO adsorbed at the undoped (110) surface,7 with an adsorption energy of 1.95 eV (Ref. 7) and −1.78 eV.36 To form the carbonate structure, the CO molecule pulls two oxygen atoms out of the ceria surface. There are two such bidentate adsorption modes—one in which the two oxygen atoms pulled out of the surface are coordinated to the same surface Ce atom [configuration I, Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)] and one in which the two oxygen atoms were initially coordinated to different surface Ce atoms [configuration II, Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)]. Configuration I has an adsorption energy of −2.42 eV and configuration II has an adsorption energy of −2.35 eV, showing a strong interaction between the molecule and the surface and that both adsorption modes are equally favorable.

[(e) and (f)] CO adsorption configuration at the at the La-doped (110) surface with one oxygen vacancy; part (f) is a side view of part (e).

In configuration I, the

distances are 1.29/1.35 Å and the
C
–
O
C
distance is 1.27 Å, while in configuration II, these C–O distances are 1.32/1.34 Å and 1.22 Å. These structural data are rather similar to CO adsorption on the undoped surface, and are consistent with formation of a bidentate carbonate adsorption mode.7 The energetics of CO adsorption at the La-doped surface indicate that the reaction is more favorable than at the undoped surface.
In the dopant compensated surface, only one strong adsorption mode was found, shown in Figs. 3(e) and 3(f) with an adsorption energy of −2.35 eV. Looking at the structure of the adsorbate, we see that instead of a bidentate adsorption mode, a monodentate adsorption mode is present [similar to Ti/Zr/Hf-doped ceria (110) (Ref. 10)]. This adsorption mode is essentially a
CO
2
species coordinated to a surface oxygen atom that has been displaced from its initial position in the surface layer to bridge two surface Ce atoms; this bridging structure has been found for oxygen vacancies at the (110) surface. The C–O distances are 1.35 Å to
O
S
and 1.27/1.26 Å to
O
C
⁠; these distances are consistent with formation of a monodentate
CO
3
species that is anchored to the surface by one oxygen atom; for comparison, the same
CO
2
-like adsorption structure is found with Ti doping with very similar C–O distances.10 Thus, a strong reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy on this surface (achieved by doping) can lead to a different adsorption mode for CO at the surface. The small vacancy formation energy for two oxygen vacancies at this surface, which is 0.9 eV means that interaction of CO with this doped surface is favorable.
To examine the electronic structure, we plot in Fig. 4, the atom and angular momentum decomposed partial electronic DOS (PEDOS) for the example of CO adsorbed at the La-doped (110) surface, both vacancy free and with an oxygen vacancy. With no pre-existing oxygen vacancies, the PEDOS, Fig. 4(a), shows that reduced
Ce

+
ions are formed, as indicated by the
Ce
4
f
derived gap state in between the top of the valence band and the unoccupied
Ce
4
f
states, which appears just below the Fermi level (set at 0 eV).17 With an oxygen vacancy at the surface, Fig. 4(c), the PEDOS also shows the presence of
Ce
3
+
with a different offset from the Fermi level compared to the vacancy free surface. The PEDOS for the C and O atoms of the adsorbed moiety is consistent with the presence of carbonate on the both surfaces, Figs. 4(a) and 4(c). We see this by comparison with the computed PEDOS for a carbonate species from Ref. 7, in which the highest occupied states are dominated by O 2p and the C 2p states appear
∼
5
eV
below the highest occupied electronic state in carbonate. We see these DOS features for the carbonate adsorbate in the present work. This is in contrast to intact CO.

The excess spin densities are shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(d). For CO adsorption at the vacancy free surface, we find that a subsurface Ce ion, directly below the adsorption site of CO is reduced to
Ce
3
+
and there remains one oxygen hole in the surface layer. Thus, the formation of the carbonate species uses two of the electrons from the two oxygen atoms pulled out of the surface. Of the remaining two electrons, one is used to compensate an oxygen hole and the other reduces a Ce ion. This is interesting, as it again shows that Ce reduction and oxygen hole compensation are competitive in this system. For CO adsorption the surface with one oxygen vacancy,
Ce
3
+
ions are present and the electronic hole states have been compensated; analysis of the individual atomic spin magnetizations shows that there is a spin magnetization of 0.93 electrons on each of the

IV. DISCUSSION
These results clarify the impact of La doping on the adsorption of CO at ceria surfaces, which itself shows a notable surface dependence. At the (111) surface with no oxygen vacancies, strong CO adsorption results in direct formation of a surface bound
CO
2
species and a carbonate adsorbate is never observed. In contrast, the (110) surface shows formation of mono- or bidentate carbonate species, depending on the presence or otherwise of oxygen vacancies. The different adsorption modes of CO will result in different vibrational spectra and could be used as probes of the nature of ceria surfaces in nanostructures that expose these surfaces.
The lack of carbonate formation at the (111) surface is driven by the geometry of the surface. With O–O distances of 3.87 Å at the surface, it is hard for a CO molecule to bridge two surface oxygen atoms, pull both out of the surface and displace them to the carbon. In contrast, on the (110) surface, the O–O distance is much shorter at 2.74 Å, and it is easier to pull both oxygen atoms off their lattice sites to displace them to carbon of the adsorbate. In addition, the formation of oxygen vacancies is easier at the (110) surface, making oxygen at the (111) surface harder to displace from its lattice site.
On the (111) surface the combination of surface geometry and the reduced oxygen vacancy formation energy promoted by doping means that when CO adsorbs strongly, it will pull out one surface oxygen atom to directly form
CO
2
⁠. On the undoped surface, this energy cost is too large, however, the presence of the La dopant substantially reduces the cost of removing oxygen from the surface and
CO
2
formation can occur. On the (110) surface, the introduction of a dopant can change the CO adsorption mode from bidentate carbonate to monodentate carbonate. This arises from the reduction of the oxygen vacancy formation energy upon doping.
Comparing with the growing body of work on the impact of doping on the reactivity of ceria to CO adsorption, we see that doping will lead to an enhancement of CO adsorption at ceria surfaces. This is particularly interesting for the (111) surface, which when undoped only shows weak interaction with a CO molecule. However, doping with Au,11 Zr,9 and La makes the interaction with CO much more favorable. Another interesting point is that on the doped (111) surface a
CO
2
species is found, rather than a carbonate, and it will be interesting to investigate further dopants in this surface to see if the direct formation of
CO
2
at the doped (111) surface is a more general phenomenon. From the discussion of the effect of surface geometry in the previous paragraph there are good reasons to suppose that this will be the case. For the example of the undoped (100) surface, we found that on the undoped surface the O–O distance between surface terminating oxygen atoms means that it is hard to form a carbonate species7 and on the Au doped (100) surface12 only
CO
2
is found after CO reacts with the doped surface.
On the (110) surface, previous work on Au,11,12 Ti/Hf/Zr doping10 shows that CO adsorption is enhanced over the undoped surface with larger adsorption energies and the formation of a carbonate species. For the latter dopants, the carbonate is now monodentate, which is also a stable adsorption mode with La doping. However, in all cases, two surface oxygen atoms are pulled out of the surface layer to form the adsorption structure. Again, the role of surface geometry has been discussed.7 
These findings do point to crucial roles played by the surface geometry and substitutional doping in determining the reactivity of ceria surfaces to the first step in CO oxidation. The role of the dopant is in distorting geometry around the dopant and facilitating an easier removal of oxygen atoms from the surface, which thus enhances the reactivity of ceria to CO adsorption. Experimentally, it is known that doping of ceria with La and Eu enhances CO oxidation and the impact of the dopant on the initial adsorption of CO must be, at least in part, responsible for this finding. While
DFT
+
U
calculations also support this for Au, Ti, Zr, and Hf doping, there is now a need for experimental investigations of this point.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The results of this paper clarify the impact of La doping on the adsorption of CO at ceria surfaces. At the doped (111) surface, strong CO adsorption results in direct formation of a surface bound
CO
2
species and a carbonate adsorbate is never observed. This is in contrast to the undoped surface, in which CO only weakly physisorbs at the (111) surface. At the doped (110) surface formation of mono- or bidentate carbonate species is possible, depending on the presence or otherwise of oxygen vacancies. At both surfaces, the interaction with CO is enhanced over the corresponding undoped surfaces, consistent with experimental results and results from other dopants in ceria. Finally, the range of adsorption modes of adsorbed CO will result in different vibrational spectra and this could be used as a probe of which ceria surfaces are present in a real sample. This would be an interesting and useful set of experiments to carry out.
