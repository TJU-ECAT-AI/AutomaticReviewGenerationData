1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature to answer the question about how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications. Additionally, there are no quotes to address the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).

1.在文献中没有找到与如何同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能，以及从计算和实验研究中获得的关于它们在各种催化应用中性能影响的见解相关的相关引用。此外，没有引用可以解决在考虑Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物性质(可还原与不可还原)的情况下制定一般预测规则的挑战。
