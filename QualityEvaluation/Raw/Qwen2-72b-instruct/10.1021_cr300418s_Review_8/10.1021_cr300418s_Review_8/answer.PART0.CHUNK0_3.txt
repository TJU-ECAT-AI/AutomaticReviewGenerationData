[1] "The effect of high-valence dopants on the chemistry of the host oxide is more complex than that of LVDs because it depends on whether the host is reducible or not."
[2] "Because Ce4+ cations are easily reduced to Ce3+ (Ce4+ is a Lewis acid), an HVD can donate its excess electrons to reduce Ce ions in the host oxide."
[3] "Pala et al. (271) examined the effect of all substitutional dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the surface of ZnO. They showed that all HVDs increased the energy needed for removing a surface oxygen atom located near the dopant."
[4] "A limited number of calculations on other systems suggest that the activation of the oxygen adsorbed on an HVD1 is likely to be general."
[5] "The situation is different in the limiting case of HVD2. An example is provided by Ta-doped La2O3(001) exposed to oxygen. The O2 molecule dissociates: one atom binds to Ta, and the other binds to a surface oxygen atom forming a sort of O2 molecule."
[6] "Very few calculations have examined this kind of system. They allow us to make some guesses and extrapolations, but they need to be reinforced (or modified) by further work."
[7] "Quite a bit of work has been devoted to the situation when the dopant and the cation being substituted have the same valence."
[8] "All of these calculations show that the dopant affects favorably the properties of the host oxide."
[9] "However, we were unable to formulate any simple rules regarding the SVDs in catalysis other than to say that they should be tried, especially if one tunes the properties of an oxide that is already an efficient catalyst."
[10] "Not much is known about the general behavior of such systems."
[11] "Another interesting example of flexible-valence dopant is provided by Cr-doped ceria."
[12] "The examples presented here suggest that it may be difficult to find simple rules for the effects of flexible-valence dopants, especially if the host oxide is a reducible. More computational and experimental work is needed for clarifying the behavior of these systems."

1.High-valence dopants (HVDs) have a more complex effect on the chemistry of the host oxide than low-valence dopants (LVDs), depending on whether the host oxide is reducible or not. In reducible oxides, HVDs can donate their excess electrons to reduce cations in the host oxide, such as Ce4+ to Ce3+. In irreducible oxides, HVDs can increase the energy needed for removing a surface oxygen atom, which may hinder oxidation. The activation of oxygen adsorbed on HVD1 is likely to be general, while HVD2 binds oxygen too strongly, forming complexes that are too low in energy to participate in redox reactions.
2.Same-valence dopants (SVDs) generally favorably affect the properties of the host oxide, improving performance in various catalytic applications. However, simple rules for their effects in catalysis are lacking, and they should be tried, especially when tuning the properties of an already efficient catalyst.
3.Flexible-valence dopants (FVDs) have complex behavior, and it is difficult to find simple rules for their effects, especially if the host oxide is reducible. More computational and experimental work is needed to clarify the behavior of these systems.

1.高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对宿主氧化物的化学影响比低价掺杂剂（LVDs）更复杂，这取决于宿主氧化物是否可还原。在可还原氧化物中，HVDs可以将其过剩电子捐赠给宿主氧化物中的阳离子，例如将Ce4+还原为Ce3+。在不可还原氧化物中，HVDs可以增加移除表面氧原子所需的能量，这可能阻碍氧化。HVD1上吸附的氧的活化可能是普遍的，而HVD2与氧结合得太强，形成的复合物能量太低，无法参与氧化还原反应。
2.同价掺杂剂（SVDs）通常对宿主氧化物的性质有有利影响，可以改善各种催化应用中的性能。然而，关于它们在催化中的作用的简单规则缺乏，应该尝试使用它们，特别是在调整已经有效的催化剂的性质时。
3.可变价掺杂剂（FVDs）具有复杂的行为，很难找到它们影响的简单规则，特别是如果宿主氧化物是可还原的。需要更多的计算和实验工作来澄清这些系统的性质。
