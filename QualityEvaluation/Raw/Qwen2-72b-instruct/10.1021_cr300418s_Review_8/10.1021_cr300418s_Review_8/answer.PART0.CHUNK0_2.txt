[1] "The effect of high-valence dopants on the chemistry of the host oxide is more complex than that of LVDs because it depends on whether the host is reducible or not."
[2] "Pala et al. (271) examined the effect of all substitutional dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the surface of ZnO. They showed that all HVDs increased the energy needed for removing a surface oxygen atom located near the dopant."
[3] "A limited number of calculations on other systems suggest that the activation of the oxygen adsorbed on an HVD1 is likely to be general."
[4] "The situation is different in the limiting case of HVD2. An example is provided by Ta-doped La2O3(001) exposed to oxygen. The O2 molecule dissociates: one atom binds to Ta, and the other binds to a surface oxygen atom forming a sort of O2 molecule."
[5] "Very few calculations have examined this kind of system. They allow us to make some guesses and extrapolations, but they need to be reinforced (or modified) by further work."
[6] "Quite a bit of work has been devoted to the situation when the dopant and the cation being substituted have the same valence. Calculations have been performed to study the properties of TiO2 doped with Ce, (361) Zr, (361) and Pt (141) and of CeO2 doped with Zr, (229, 235, 255, 258, 334, 361, 362) or with Ti, (362) or Hf, (362) or Pd, (229) or Pt, (258) or Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb. (363)"
[7] "All of these calculations show that the dopant affects favorably the properties of the host oxide."
[8] "However, we were unable to formulate any simple rules regarding the SVDs in catalysis other than to say that they should be tried, especially if one tunes the properties of an oxide that is already an efficient catalyst."
[9] "Because we define the valence of a dopant by examining the stoichiometry of its stable oxides, we cannot assign a unique valence to dopants that have several stable oxides."
[10] "Not much is known about the general behavior of such systems."
[11] "Another interesting example of flexible-valence dopant is provided by Cr-doped ceria. Experiments in Hegdes group (381, 382) indicated that this doped oxide contains Ce3+ and Ce4+ as well as Cr4+ and Cr6+."
[12] "The examples presented here suggest that it may be difficult to find simple rules for the effects of flexible-valence dopants, especially if the host oxide is a reducible. More computational and experimental work is needed for clarifying the behavior of these systems."

1.High-valence dopants (HVDs) have a more complex effect on the chemistry of the host oxide than low-valence dopants (LVDs), depending on whether the host oxide is reducible or not. In irreducible oxides, HVDs can increase the energy needed for oxygen-vacancy formation, potentially hindering oxidation. In reducible oxides, HVDs can donate electrons to reduce host ions, changing their behavior compared to in irreducible oxides. The behavior of HVDs is influenced by Lewis acid-base interactions.
2.Same-valence dopants (SVDs) generally improve the properties of the host oxide, affecting its catalytic performance favorably. However, formulating simple rules for their behavior in catalysis is challenging, and they should be tried in tuning the properties of an already efficient catalyst.
3.Flexible-valence dopants (FVDs), which have several stable oxides and can take various valences, present additional complexities. Their effects on the host oxide are not well understood, especially in reducible oxides, and more computational and experimental work is needed to clarify their behavior.

1.高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对宿主氧化物化学的影响比低价掺杂剂（LVDs）更复杂，这取决于宿主氧化物是否可还原。在不可还原的氧化物中，HVDs可以增加形成氧空位所需的能量，可能阻碍氧化。在可还原的氧化物中，HVDs可以捐赠电子以还原宿主离子，与在不可还原的氧化物中相比，它们的行为会发生变化。HVDs的行为受到Lewis酸碱相互作用的影响。
2.同价掺杂剂（SVDs）通常会改善宿主氧化物的性质，对其催化性能产生有利影响。然而，制定关于它们在催化作用中的行为的简单规则具有挑战性，应该在调整已经有效的催化剂的性质时尝试使用SVDs。
3.可变价掺杂剂（FVDs），具有几种稳定的氧化物，可以采取各种价态，带来了额外的复杂性。它们对宿主氧化物的影响尚不清楚，特别是在可还原的氧化物中，需要更多的计算和实验工作来阐明它们的行为。
