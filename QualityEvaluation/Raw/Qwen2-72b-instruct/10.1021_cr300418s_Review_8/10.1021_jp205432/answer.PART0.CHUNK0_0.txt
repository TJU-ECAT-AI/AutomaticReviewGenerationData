1.The literature does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does discuss the effects of various dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at the surface of ceria and magnesium oxide. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) such as La and Y in ceria and Li and Na in magnesia lower the energy of making an oxygen vacancy both near and far from the dopant. High-valence dopants in MgO(001) such as Al, Sc, and Y slightly increase the energy of vacancy formation next to them. The effect of dopants on the oxygen-vacancy formation in reducible oxides like ceria is more complex and does not follow simple rules based on the strength of their bond to oxygen and their valence. The literature does not address the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior in different metal oxides, but it does highlight the importance of considering factors such as the reducibility of the host oxide and the ability of the dopant to adjust its valence.

1.文献没有提供关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能的具体信息。然而,它确实讨论了各种掺杂剂对氧化铈和氧化镁表面氧空位形成能的影响。低价掺杂剂(LVDs),如氧化铈中的La和Y以及氧化镁中的Li和Na,降低了靠近和远离掺杂剂形成氧空位的能量。MgO(001)中的高价掺杂剂,如Al、Sc和Y,略微增加了紧邻它们形成空位的能量。高价掺杂剂对可还原氧化物如氧化铈的氧空位形成的影响更为复杂,并不遵循基于它们与氧的结合强度和价态的简单规则。文献没有涉及在不同金属氧化物中制定一般预测掺杂剂行为规则的挑战,但它确实强调了考虑诸如宿主氧化物的可还原性和掺杂剂调整其价态的能力等因素的重要性。
