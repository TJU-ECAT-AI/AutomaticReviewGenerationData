1.The literature does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does discuss the effects of various dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in ceria and magnesia, which can be related to catalytic properties. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) such as La and Y in ceria and Li and Na in magnesia lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation both near and far from the dopant. High-valence dopants in MgO(001) such as Al, Sc, and Y slightly increase the energy of vacancy formation next to them, with the exception of Ga, which behaves differently due to its reduction when the vacancy is formed. Doping CeO2(111) with Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W does not have a long-range effect on the energy of vacancy formation, but these dopants affect the energy of vacancy formation next to them by roughly the same amount, despite their different chemical properties. The literature suggests that the lack of correlation between the strength of the dopant-oxygen bond in the oxide of the dopant and the effect of the dopant on the energy of vacancy formation is explained, in part, by the ability of the Ce ions to change easily their formal charge from +4 to +3, giving ceria great flexibility in adjusting to the extra electrons provided by these dopants. The challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior are not explicitly stated, but the literature highlights the complexity of the effects of dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the need to consider factors such as the reducibility of the host oxide and the valence of the dopant in its own oxide.

1.文献没有提供具体信息关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能。然而,它确实讨论了各种掺杂剂对氧化铈和氧化镁中氧空位形成能的影响,这可以与催化性能相关。低价掺杂剂(LVDs),如铈中的La和Y以及镁中的Li和Na,降低了靠近和远离掺杂剂的氧空位形成能。在MgO(001)中的高价掺杂剂,如Al、Sc和Y,在它们旁边稍微增加了空位形成能,除了Ga,由于在形成空位时的还原,其行为不同。掺杂CeO2(111)与Pt、Ru、Zr、Nb、Ta、Mo和W没有对氧空位形成能产生长程效应,但这些掺杂剂对它们旁边氧空位形成能的影响大致相同,尽管它们的化学性质不同。文献建议,掺杂剂氧化物中掺杂剂-氧键强度与掺杂剂对氧空位形成能影响之间缺乏相关性,部分解释为Ce离子容易从+4到+3改变其形式电荷,给予铈调整这些掺杂剂提供的额外电子的巨大灵活性。制定一般预测掺杂剂行为规则的挑战没有明确说明,但文献强调了掺杂剂对氧空位形成能影响的复杂性,以及需要考虑诸如宿主氧化物的还原性和掺杂剂在自身氧化物中的价态等因素。
