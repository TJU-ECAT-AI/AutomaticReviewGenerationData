1.No relevant quotes were found in the provided literature to answer the question about how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications. Additionally, no information was found regarding the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).
