          The literature does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does suggest that doping with metals such as Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni can weaken the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, making it more reactive and potentially a better oxidation catalyst. The effectiveness of the dopant in enhancing catalytic activity may depend on factors such as the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation and the capacity to take oxygen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction. A balance between these two properties is necessary for an efficient catalyst. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior may include the complexity of interactions between the dopant and the host oxide, as well as the influence of factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide.

          文献没有提供关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能的具体信息。然而,它确实表明,用Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni等金属掺杂可以削弱表面氧与氧化物的结合,使其更具反应性,可能成为更好的氧化催化剂。掺杂剂增强催化活性的有效性可能取决于诸如在氧化过程中捐赠氧原子的能力和从气相中获取氧以修复氧化反应形成的氧空位的能力等因素。高效催化剂需要在这两种性质之间取得平衡。制定一般预测掺杂剂行为规则的挑战可能包括掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间复杂相互作用的复杂性,以及诸如Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的还原性等因素的影响。
