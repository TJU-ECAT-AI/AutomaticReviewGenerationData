1.The literature does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does state that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts. The weakening of the oxygen-oxide bond by the dopant facilitates the donation of an oxygen atom during oxidation and the taking of oxygen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction. A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation and that of taking oxygen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy. The stability of the catalyst is also a critical factor, as a too rapid removal of the oxygen atoms can compromise the stability of the catalyst by the formation of neutral dopant atoms. The literature does not address the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).

1.文献没有提供关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能的具体信息。但是,它确实指出,用Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni掺杂会减少表面氧与二氧化钛或铈的键合,使它们成为更好的氧化催化剂。掺杂剂削弱氧-氧化物键,便于在氧化过程中捐赠氧原子,并从气相中获取氧以治愈氧化反应形成的氧空位。这一类中的良好催化剂必须在氧化过程中捐赠氧原子的能力和从气相中获取氧以治愈氧空位之间取得平衡。催化剂的稳定性也是一个关键因素,因为氧原子的过快去除可能会通过形成中性掺杂剂原子来破坏催化剂的稳定性。文献没有涉及在考虑Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质(可还原与不可还原)的情况下,制定一般预测规则的挑战。
