How do same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications? Additionally, what challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)?

1.The document does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does discuss the effects of doping La2O3 with Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe, and Al, and how these dopants can lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, making the oxide a better oxidant. The document also mentions that dopants can affect catalytic activity by weakening the bond between oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, facilitating the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for oxidation, adsorbing O2 from the gas phase, and facilitating the dissociative adsorption of molecules. The challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior are not explicitly stated, but the document suggests that factors such as the valence of the dopant, the stability of the dopant's oxide, and the structure of the oxide being doped can influence the effectiveness of the dopant.

1.文档没有提供关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性质的具体信息。然而,它确实讨论了用Cu、Zn、Mg、Fe和Al掺杂La2O3的影响,以及这些掺杂剂如何降低氧空位形成能,使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。文档还提到,掺杂剂可以通过削弱表面层中氧原子与氧化物之间的键,促进Marsvan Krevelen氧化机制,从气相吸附O2,以及促进分子的解离吸附来影响催化活性。没有明确说明制定一般预测掺杂剂行为规则的挑战,但文档表明,掺杂剂的价态、掺杂剂氧化物的稳定性以及被掺杂氧化物的结构等因素可以影响掺杂剂的有效性。

However, it does discuss the effects of doping La2O3 with Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe, and Al, and how these dopants lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, which can make the doped oxide a better oxidant. The document also notes that the energy of vacancy formation in the doped oxide is related to the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant. The document does not address the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior or the role of Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) in dopant effects.

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does discuss the effects of doping La2O3 with Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe, and Al, and how these dopants can lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, potentially improving catalytic activity. The literature also mentions that the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a predictor of the ability of surface oxygen atoms to engage in chemical reactions.
