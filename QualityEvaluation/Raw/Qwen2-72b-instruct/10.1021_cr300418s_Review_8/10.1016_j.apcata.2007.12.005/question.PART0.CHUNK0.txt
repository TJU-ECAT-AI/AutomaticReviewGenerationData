The effects of CeO2 content,calcination temperature and interaction between the components on the structure and reductive properties of CeO2ZrO2 oxides were evaluated by using different techniques such as XRD, DRS, FTIR, Raman, XPS, TGA and TPR. Spectroscopic data showed that the tetragonal phase of zirconia is preserved in all CeO2ZrO2 oxides, although they retain a high number of defect sites caused by a strong interaction between zirconia and cerium oxide species. An enrichment of the zirconia surface with a fluorite structure of CeO2 is observed for the CeO2 ZrO2 oxide with the highest CeO2 content (12 wt%). The samples subjected to consecutive reductionoxidation cycles at different temperatures showed good redox properties related to the increase of oxygen mobility. It was concluded that these CeO2ZrO2 oxide systems, displaying high surface and good thermal stability, are similar to chemically mixed oxides due to the strong interaction between the zirconia carrier and deposited ceria.

1. Introduction
When used as supports, oxides such as ceria and zirconia are known to impart metal-support interactions to enhance catalytic performances, due to the oxygen-storage/transport character- istics of the support [1] or to the generation of active centres at the interface between metal and support [24]. Ceria and ceria- based mixed oxides are effective carriers or catalysts for important industrial or environmentally friendly reactions, such as automotive exhaust gas conversion [5], methane reforming processes [6,7], watergas shift reaction [8,9], etc. An oxygen- storage component in the form of ceria-containing oxide can be included in the catalyst to decrease coke deposition on the active phase for CH4 reforming catalysts or to moderate the effect of the oscillations between reach and lean conditions for the three-way catalysts operating under atmospheric pressure.
Cerium oxide is widely employed as a promoter for supported- noble metal catalysts due to its advantages: (i) to stabilize the metal dispersion on the carrier; (ii) to improve the oxidation and reduction of the noble metal; (iii) to enhance oxygen storage and release by shifting between CeO2 under oxidizing conditions and Ce2O3 under reducing conditions, respectively.
However, the major problem of CeO2 when used as a carrier is the loss of oxygen storage capacity (OSC) due to a reduction in surface area upon thermal treatment. Insertion of zirconia into the cubic CeO2 framework with formation of a solid solution results in increased thermal stability and improved redox properties due to the high efficiency of the Ce4+ , Ce3+ redox cycle [1012].
The mixed CexZr1  xO2 oxides, as a new generation of oxygen storage capacity systems, have recently been reported in many studies. The distortion of the O2 sublattices in the mixed oxides permits a higher mobility of lattice oxygen, and the reduction occurs not only on the surface but also extends deep into the bulk [13]. Ceria stabilized zirconia has attracted attention in recent years due not only to its good mechanical www.elsevier.com/locate/apcata Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Applied Catalysis A: General 337 (2008) 8696 * Corresponding author.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.apcata.2007.12.005 and electrical properties, but also to its application as catalysts,given their good stability and redox properties. However, the properties of these materials largely depend on the preparation method, the nature of the present phases and their content. It has been shown that phase segregation of binary oxides could be suppressed by doping with proper elements. The substitu- tion of zirconium atoms by iron ones can generate oxygen vacancies in the tetragonal network of ZrO2CeO2 system prepared by the solid-state route, or phase segregation could be inhibited by doping the mixed oxide with rare earth elements [14,15].
It is worth noting that the most frequently used methods for obtaining a binary oxide system are solgel and firing of mechanically ground mixtures of the oxide precursors at high temperatures [16,17]. Ceriazirconia mixed oxides have recently been prepared by continuous hydrothermal synthesis in supercritical water, resulting in a homogeneous complex with highly crystallized nanoparticles [18]. However, such methods ensure the formation of a solid solution, and products are highly dense, lacking the surface area and pore volume desired for catalytic applications.
An important feature associated with binary CeO2ZrO2 systems is to improve their low-temperature reducibility at moderate temperatures or their oxygen storage/release capa- city. It is well known that the reducibility of the carrier of supported metal catalysts is a very important issue regarding its ability to generate oxygen vacancies and transfer the oxygen onto the metal particles. This refers to redox behaviour that is relevant to catalysis and considers all the characteristics of the reduction and oxidation processes.
The objective of our work is to stabilize highly dispersed ceria on zirconia and obtain ceriazirconia oxides with high thermal stability and surface area and good redox properties.
The high thermal stability and high reducibility of these oxides would make them very attractive carriers for supported Pt catalysts for CH4 reforming reactions. The work is focused on the effect of: (i) CeO2 content; (ii) temperature of calcination;(iii) interaction between the components on the structure and reductive properties of CeO2ZrO2 oxides. Different techni- ques were used for characterization of the samples: X-ray diffraction (XRD), UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
(DRS),
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR),
Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), tem- perature-programmed reduction (TPR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
2. Experimental
2.1. Sample preparation
The ZrO2 was obtained by calcination of zirconium hydroxide, kindly provided by Eurosupport, The Netherlands.
The CeO2ZrO2 supports were obtained by impregnation of ZrO2 with an aqueous solution of diammonium hexanitrate cerate (NH4)2[Ce(NO3)6] (99.99% pure from Degussa). The obtained solids were dried in air at 383 K for 12 h and were calcined at 823 and 1073 K for 4 h. The theoretical amount of CeO2 was in the range of 112 wt%. The samples were denoted as xCeO2ZrO2, where x is the theoretical amount of CeO2. For comparative purposes, a CeO2 was obtained by calcination of (NH4)2[Ce(NO3)6] at 923 and 1073 K for 4 h.
2.2. Methods
Chemical analysis of calcined samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using a PerkinElmer Optima 3300DV instrument.
The CeO2 loading of the samples is summarized in Table 1.
The textural properties of the calcined samples were evaluated from the nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms,determined at 77 K with a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 apparatus. The samples were previously degassed at 423 K for 24 h under vacuum (104 mbar) to ensure a relatively clean surface. The specific areas of the samples were determined according to standard BET procedure using nitrogen adsorption data taken in the relative equilibrium pressure interval of
0.03 < P/P0 < 0.3.
XRD measurements of the calcined samples were performed on a computerized Seifert 3000XRD diffractometer using Cu Ka (l = 0.1538 nm) radiation and a PW 2200 BraggBrentano u/2u goniometer equipped with a bent graphite monochromator and an automatic slit. The XRD diffraction patterns were taken in the 2u range of 5808 at a scan speed of 0.048/s. Phase identification was carried out by comparison with JCPDF database cards. The particle size of ZrO2 crystallites was determined by means of the Scherrer equation [19] using the most intensive reflections.
UVvis diffuse reflectance spectra of the calcined samples were recorded in the range of 200800 nm at room temperature using a Varian Cary 5000 UVvis spectrometer equipped with an integration sphere. The framework (400800 cm1) vibra- tions were recorded on a Nicolet 5ZDX FTIR spectro- photometer. The calcined samples were diluted in KBr (0.05 wt% of sample in KBr) and pressed into transparent discs. Typically, 100 scans were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm1 using a MCT-B detector.
The Raman spectra were run with a Renishaw Micro-Raman System 1000 equipped with a cooled CCD detector (200 K) and a holographic Notch filter that removes the elastic scattering.
The samples were excited with the 514 nm Ar line in an in situ cell (Linkam, TS-1500), which allows temperature treatments of up to 1770 K under gas flow. The samples were in powder form to prevent diffusion problems and ensure that all the Table 1 Textural properties and particle size (DXRD) for CeO2ZrO2 oxides Samples CeO2 (wt%)

87 catalyst in the cell is exposed to the gas flow. The spectral resolution is 3 cm1, and the spectra acquisition consisted of 20 accumulations of 30 s for each sample. The samples calcined at 1073 K were pre-treated in air at 773 K for 30 min.
Surface analysis was carried out on a VG Escalab 200R electron spectrometer provided with Al Ka (hn = 1486.6 eV,1 eV = 1.6302  1019 J) X-ray source and a hemi-spherical electron analyser. The powder samples pressed in 8 mm diameter copper troughs were fixed onto the XYZ manipulator.
The base pressure in the analysis chamber was maintained below 4  109 mbar during data acquisition. The binding energies (BE) of Zr 3d, Ce 3d and O 1s core-levels were recorded. The binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak at 284.6 eV. The accuracy of the BE values was 0.1 eV. Data processing was performed with the XPS peak program, and the spectra were decomposed with the least squares fitting routine provided with the software with Gaussian/Lorentzian (90/10) product function and after subtracting a Shirley background.
Atomic fractions were calculated using peak areas normalized on the basis of sensitivity factors.
Temperature-programmed reduction profiles of the calcined samples were obtained on a semiautomatic Micromeritics TPD/ TPR 2900 apparatus interfaced with a computer. Samples of 50 mg placed in a U-shaped quartz tube were first purged in a He flow at 473 K for 0.5 h and then cooled to ambient temperature. The TPR profiles of the fresh samples were recorded on the previously degassed sample by passing a 10 wt% H2/Ar gas mixture (60 ml/min) through the sample heated at a constant rate of 15 K/min from room temperature to 1173 K. A cold trap was placed just before the thermo- conductivity detector (TCD) to remove water from the exit stream. Samples denoted as R-O773 and R-O1073 were subjected to redox treatment, which consists of H2-TPR to 1173 K followed by in situ oxidation with an oxygen flow (70 ml/min) at 773 and 1073 K for 2 h, respectively.
Thermogravimetric analysis experiments in Ar/H2 (5%) flow (total flow 100 ml/min) were recorded with TGA/SDTA 851e Mettler Toledo. Each sample was treated in a N2 atmosphere at 553 K for 30 min. They were then heated at a constant rate (10 K/min) to 673 K and kept at that temperature for 15 min to remove the adsorbed water. Finally, the Ar/H2 mixture was introduced while keeping the temperature at 773 K for 30 min. The observed weight loss due to oxygen removal by H2 to form water was associated with the total oxygen storage capacity at that temperature [15].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Textural properties
Table 1 lists the most important textural parameters calculated from the nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms:the specific surface area BET (SBET) and pore volume (Vp). The representative isotherms of the samples are shown in Fig. 1. The shape of the isotherms of CeO2ZrO2 oxides is similar to that of ZrO2 and belongs to type I/II of the IUPAC classification [20].
At low relative pressure, the prevailing process is the formation of a monolayer of adsorbed molecules, while multilayer adsorption takes place at high relative pressure. Type I/II isotherms are typical for micro- and macroporous materials.
The isotherms of the samples have hysteresis loops belonging to H1 type according to IUPAC, typical for mesoporous materials [20]. The isotherm of CeO2 showed that ceria has micropores.
The calcined CeO2ZrO2 samples have specific areas in the range of 204180 m2/g (Table 1). The CeO2 content 6 wt% does not affect the textural properties of the mixed oxides.
However, the CeO2 content of 12 wt% leads to a slight decrease in both specific area and pore volume of ceriazirconia oxide.
The stabilization effect of ceria on the textural properties of zirconia is evident at low ceria loadings. The same variation in the textural properties with CeO2 loading was observed for CeO2Al2O3 system [21]. The surface areas decreased by 20 30% after treatment of the ZrO2 and CeO2ZrO2 samples at a high temperature of 1073 K.
3.2. Structure and surface properties
3.2.1. XRD
The diffraction patterns of the mixed CeO2ZrO2 oxides calcined at 823 and 1073 K are compared in Fig. 2A and B,respectively. Pure CeO2 sample calcined at 923 and 1073 K (Fig. 2A and B, respectively) is composed of cubic CeO2 with fluorite structure at 2u = 28.78, 47.68 and 56.48 [21]. X-ray Fig. 1.

88 diffraction pattern of ZrO2 at 823 K (Fig. 2A) shows poorly resolved peaks of zirconia, indicating an amorphous phase. The addition of a small amount of ceria to zirconia leads to the appearance of broad peaks, characteristic of zirconia, at 2u = 30.28, 50.48 and 44.78 (Fig. 2). The characteristic peaks of ZrO2 are well resolved after high temperature treatment of the samples at 1073 K (Fig. 2B). The broadness of the XRD peaks exhibited by the calcined samples means that it is not possible to use the X-ray results to establish clearly whether the formed phase is tetragonal or cubic. It is known that the XRD patterns of the cubic and the tetragonal zirconia modifications are nearly identical [22]; the only difference is that the tetragonal phase shows a limited number of additional high order, low intensity reflections due to its lower degree of symmetry. However, the tetragonal and cubic phases may be readily identified and distinguished by other spectroscopic techniques.
No indication of phase splitting is detected after calcination of the CeO2ZrO2 oxides at higher temperature (1073 K, Fig. 2B). However, this cannot exclude the presence of different arrangements of oxygen sublattice or the presence of a multi- phase system at nanoscale level after high temperature treatment. A slight shift of 2u8 to a lower angle is observed for the sample with the highest CeO2 content compared to that of ZrO2 (from 30.68 to 30.18), suggesting an enrichment of the zirconia surface with ceria.
XRD data show that the calculated average particle size of ZrO2 (DXRD) in CeO2ZrO2 oxides is not too strongly affected by the increase of CeO2 content (Table 1). An estimate of average particle size by the line broadening method gives a value of around 6 nm. The increase of calcination temperature to 1073 K leads to a less pronounced effect on the crystallite size of ZrO2 (to about 7 nm). There is a significant increase in the crystallite size of CeO2 at high temperature treatment (from
9.8 to 29.4 nm at 823 and 1073 K, respectively, Table 1).
It is clear from these results that a significant sintering of ZrO2 does not occur during calcination up to 1073 K. It suggests that the resistance of ZrO2 to phase transformation is probably due to its ability to retain small particle size forthcoming during the preparation procedure.
3.2.2. DR-UVvis spectroscopy
The electronic spectra of the samples calcined at 823 and 1073 K are shown in Fig. 3A and B, respectively. A split of the absorption is observed at 276 and 342 nm in the spectrum of pure ceria (Fig. 3A). The former can be related to O2 ! Ce4+ charge transfer transitions in agreement with Refs. [23,24]. A main absorption at 211 nm with a shoulder in the region of 290 400 nm is observed in the spectrum of pure zirconia (Fig. 3A).
The absorption edge appearing at higher energies (211 nm) is attributed to the charge transfer transitions of O2 ! Zr2+ [23].
According to the d0 configuration of Zr4+ ions, no feature characteristics of dd transitions are displayed in the visible region (above 400 nm) in the electronic spectrum of zirconia (Fig. 3A). The occurrence of the second component in the spectrum of zirconia is very likely due to the presence of impurities with tetravalent species absorbing at higher wavelength [23].
It should be noted that the overall absorption of the CeO2 ZrO2 oxides is significantly higher than that of pure zirconia (Fig. 3). Two maxima can be distinguished (Fig. 3A) in the electronic spectra of the mixed oxides treated at 823 K. The first maximum centred at 211 nm is related to the transitions on pure zirconia. The second one is centred at 295 nm. There is no connection between the position of the second maximum in the spectra of the mixed oxides and their composition. However,the intensity of the second maximum rises with increasing CeO2 content in the CeO2ZrO2 samples. On the other hand,the value of the second maximum is an intermediate of the values for the split absorption of pure ceria. This means that the zirconia surface is covered with cerium oxide species.
When comparing the electronic spectra in Fig. 3A and B, it is evident that the sintering process, which takes place at 1073 K, Fig. 2. XRD of CeO2, ZrO2 and CeO2ZrO2 oxides with different CeO2 content after temperature treatment at 823 (A) and 1073 K (B).

89 results in a loss of intensity of the electronic spectra of all samples. The position of both maxima shifts to higher energies.
The main maximum for pure zirconia and zirconia-supported samples is shifted from 211 to 204 nm. Whereas the position of the second one in the spectra of the samples is related to the composition of the mixed oxides; it shifts to lower energies with the increase of CeO2 content (from 265 to 280 nm for 1CeO2 ZrO2 and 12CeO2ZrO2, respectively). Moreover, the position of the edge onset is slightly higher than that for the oxides treated at low temperature. The shift of the absorption onset to lower energies is probably associated with the larger crystal size of the oxides calcined at 1073 K compared to those at low calcination temperature.
3.2.3. FTIR spectra
The IR spectra of pure ceria, zirconia and CeO2ZrO2 samples after calcination at 823 and 1073 K are shown in Fig. 4A and B, respectively. A broad absorption at ca. 460 cm1 with a less well-defined shoulder at ca. 430 cm1 is displayed in the IR spectrum of pure ceria previously calcined at 923 K (Fig. 4A). According to literature data [25] on the vibrational active modes in the fluorite structure, the main maximum would be assigned to the transverse mode (TO) of the triply degenerated F1u fundamental, and the shoulder to the longitudinal component (LO) of the same fundamental.
The IR spectrum of pure zirconia treated at 823 K (Fig. 4A) displays an intense absorption with less well-resolved components at about 516 and 596 cm1. The breadth of the peak is anomalous owing to a structural disorder associated with oxygen vacancies [23]. Two bands associated with the movements of oxide ions, both undergoing TOLO splitting,are expected in the 400650 cm1 range [24]. The IR active mode in the 600650 cm1 range is caused by asymmetrically coupled asymmetric ZrOZr stretching, and the mode arising from the symmetric ZrOZr stretching is revealed in the 400 500 cm1 region [24]. The IR spectra of the mixed CeO2ZrO2 Fig. 4. FTIR spectra of CeO2, ZrO2 and CeO2ZrO2 samples with different CeO2 content after temperature treatment at 823 (A) and 1073 K (B).

90 oxides with CeO2 content up to 6 wt% do not vary strongly compared to that of pure zirconia. The intensity of the low- wavenumber component increases slightly with the increasing CeO2 content, as seen in Fig. 4A. However, the IR spectrum of the CeO2ZrO2 sample with the highest CeO2 content (12 wt%) reveals a strong absorption with a maximum at about 500 cm1 nm and a poorly defined shoulder in the higher wavenumber range. The shifting of the maximum from 516 cm1 to lower wavenumber with the increasing CeO2 content, near to that observed for pure ceria, means that a fluorite-like phase becomes predominant in CeO2 richer samples.
After treatment of the mixed oxides at the higher temperature of 1073 K (Fig. 4B), the intensity of the right component of the absorption at ca. 600 cm1 increases compared to that for pure zirconia. This is more pronounced for samples with CeO2 content lower than 12 wt%. In addition,this component is moved to a higher wavenumber (up to 620 cm1) for the sample with 6 wt% CeO2. This phenomenon is similar to the case when a tetragonal solid solution phase is formed and a distortion of the unit cell in CeO2ZrO2 mixed oxides occurs [24,25]. Although our samples are prepared by the conventional impregnation method, there is a strong grafting of ceria on the zirconia surface.
3.2.4. Raman spectra
Since the information provided by IR spectroscopy is less relevant due to its lower sensitivity (broadening of the peaks and LOTO splitting) to unit cell distortions, Raman spectro- scopy was applied to determine the coordination symmetry of cations in the mixed CeO2ZrO2 oxides. The Raman spectra of the pure (ZrO2, CeO2) and mixed CeO2ZrO2 oxides calcined at 1073 K are shown in Fig. 5. It should be noted that the Raman spectra of zirconia and CeO2ZrO2 samples calcined at 823 K did not reveal any band from ZrO2. However, broad bands at 148, 268, 311, 450 and 635 cm1 are detected in the Raman spectrum of pure ZrO2 at 1073 K, which is characteristic of the tetragonal zirconia phase. The present results are similar to those reported in Refs. [25,26]. Six-Raman-active modes of A1g + 3Eg + 2B1g symmetry are typical for the tetragonal ZrO2 phase (space group P42/nmc) [25,26], whereas only one F2g mode centred at ca. 490 cm1 is Raman active for the cubic fluorite structure (space group Fm3m) [27]. In the Raman spectrum of pure ceria, which also has a fluorite structure, the F2g mode is centred at 456 cm1, as seen in Fig. 5. A high frequency broadening of the 450 nm band is observed after the addition of ceria to zirconia due to some overlapping with the band of the cubic phase (Fig. 5). The attenuation of the Raman spectra of the CeO2ZrO2 samples is probably caused by the high concentration of oxygen vacancies formation resulting from cerium reduction [11], due to a strong interaction between zirconium and cerium oxide species occurring under the high temperature calcination process. Kim et al. [28] have observed two strong bands at 263 and 148 cm1 in the pure tetragonal ZrO2, whose frequencies shift towards lower values in the tetragonal t-Ce0.12Zr0.88O2 mixed oxide caused by defect sites.
The presence of a significant amount of defects in the binary CeO2ZrO2 oxides was revealed by density measurements [29],and not even their precise nature was ascertained. Due to the broadness and overlapping of the bands of ZrO2 and CeO2, it is difficult to say whether there is a co-presence of a tetragonal and a cubic phase. However, it is suggested that the spectra of CeO2ZrO2 with the highest CeO2 loading contains both phases. The formation of nanocrystalline CeO2 oxide phase is expected to be less efficient at low CeO2 concentrations (<12 wt%).
3.2.5. XPS studies
Photoelectron spectroscopy was used to obtain further information about the valence/oxidation state of the elements and surface composition of the CeZr mixed oxides by inspecting the spectral line shape and the intensities of the Ce 3d core-level electrons. Fig. 6 compares the Ce 3d spectra of the CeO2ZrO2 oxides calcined at 823 K with that of the Ce 3d spectrum of pure CeO2. The BEs of Ce 3d5/2, Zr 3d5/2 and O 1s core-levels and surface atomic Ce/Ce + Zr ratios are listed in Table 2. The satellites and the main peaks are clearly identified in the spectrum of CeO2 and they are similar to those reported by Burroughs et al. [30]. According to the complexity in the resolution of the spectra of CeO2 [29], peaks denoted as u and n correspond to Ce 3d3/2 and Ce 3d5/2 contributions at 882.7 and 900 eV, respectively. Ce 3d spectrum of CeO2 is characteristic of strong satellites at 888.8 (vII), 898.7 (vIII) and 907.6 (uII),
916.9 (uIII) eV. Comparing the observed Ce 3d spectra, it can be
concluded that all samples (Fig. 6) show distinct spectral features compared to that of CeO2 (Fig. 6). A new component Fig. 5. Raman spectra of CeO2, ZrO2 and CeO2ZrO2 samples with different CeO2 content treated at 1023 K.

91 (vI) at about 885 eV appeared in the spectra of CeO2ZrO2 samples. The growth of the line vI and disappearance of vII component indicate that the electronic configuration of cerium is far from 4+. In addition, the decrease of the intensity of the Ce4+ satellite at 916.7 eV (uIII) is taken as an indication of the presence of Ce3+ [31]. Thus, both the shape and the intensity of satellites of Ce 3d spectrum of the mixed CeZr oxides are indicative of the presence of cerium in different oxidation states, Ce4+ and Ce3+. Through fitting of the Ce 3d profile to eight components, the ratio (r) of the area of the satellite at
916.7 eV to the total area was calculated. Assuming that this
ratio is proportional to the surface concentration of Ce4+ and that this ratio reaches 0.16 for all cerium atoms in the Ce4+ state,the percent fraction r = Ce4+/(Ce3+ + Ce4+) was calculated. The 3CeO2ZrO2 sample displayed the lowest r value (38), then it increased for 6CeO2ZrO2 (44), 12CeO2ZrO2 (56) and 1CeO2ZrO2 (75), while r reached 94 for bulk CeO2.
As mentioned above, the broadening of the lines in the XPS of CeO2ZrO2 samples can be caused by the presence of several surface cerium oxide species. Non-stoichiometric CeO2  x (0 < x > 0.5) is probably formed due to a strong interaction between supported CeO2 and ZrO2 carrier under calcination. In addition, it should be noted that some photoreduction of Ce4+ might take place during exposure of the samples to a high X-ray flux under ultra-high vacuum employed during data acquisition.
We can thus conclude that the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple exists on the surface of the fresh CeO2ZrO2 oxides.
The change in the coordination number of Ce atoms is confirmed by the change in the BE values of Ce 3d5/2 core levels (Table 2). For all CeO2ZrO2 samples, there is a decrease in the values of BE of Ce 3d5/2 component (882.3 eV) compared to that for bulk CeO2 (882.9 eV). This shift can be interpreted in terms of the interaction between zirconia and cerium oxide species, i.e. CeOZr bond formation. It is likely that oxygen vacancies are easily generated at the CeOZr interface. As ZrO2 oxide is the major oxide phase in the ZrO2CeO2 systems,the BEs of Zr 3d5/2 core-levels (182.1 eV) are essentially the same for all CeO2ZrO2 samples and identical to that of pure zirconia. An idea of the dispersion degree reached by ceria on the zirconia substrate can be obtained from the surface Ce/ (Ce + Zr) atomic ratios. Experimental Ce/(Ce + Zr) surface ratios are collected in Table 2 and compared with the nominal ones assuming that ceria has been uniformly distributed within the CeO2ZrO2 system. It is evident from this comparison that the surface of CeO2ZrO2 is CeO2-enriched, and that this enrichment is more marked at the highest CeO2 loading (12 wt%).

The reducibility of the carrier of supported metal catalysts is a very important issue in connection with its ability to generate oxygen vacancies and transfer the oxygen onto the metal particles.
The TPR profiles of fresh ceria, zirconia and CeO2ZrO2 oxides calcined at 823 K and the effects of subsequent reoxidation and reduction cycles are compared in Fig. 7af.
The calculated H2 consumptions per gram of material and the positions of the TPR peaks are summarized in Table 3. Bulk CeO2 exhibits two peaks: the small one at ca. 816 K and the big one with a maximum at ca. 1080 K (Fig. 7f). As reported in literature [32], the reduction of ceria occurs in two steps: the bulk reduction occurs at temperatures above 1023 K, while the Fig. 6.

92 surface shell reduction step takes place at a much lower temperature. Surface shell reduction involves several phenom- ena [33], including: (i) reduction of the surface Ce atoms from Ce4+ to Ce3+ oxidation state; (ii) formation of bridging OH groups. The area of the low-temperature peak is lower compared to that of the high-temperature peak, which is typical for low-surface area samples [34]. A good relationship was found between the BET surface area and H2 consumption Fig. 7. TPR of ZrO2 (a) CeO2 (f) and CeO2ZrO2 oxides with different CeO2 content: 1 (b), 3 (c) 6 (d) 12 wt% (e).

93 from the first peak, indicating that the reduction of ceria occurs first on the surface and then progressively affects the bulk. The highest temperature peak can therefore be attributed to the complete reduction of Ce4+ into Ce3+ by removing O2 anions of the lattice and the formation of Ce2O3. It should be remembered that the CeO2 used in the TPR experiments was prepared by calcination at 1023 K and the surface area of the sample is relatively low.
Intense H2 consumption with poorly resolved maxima at 856 and 908 K is observed in the TPR profile of the fresh ZrO2 (Fig. 7a and Table 3). The observed reducibility for ZrO2 is unusual since no reduction of ZrO2 has been detected in many reports. Indeed, the XPS spectrum of pure ZrO2 precluded the presence of carbonates and other impurities. As this behaviour appears to be associated to the kind of zirconia phase and also to the method of preparation, it is suggested that the H2 consumption peak formation is caused by the formation of the type II bridging OH groups, as observed by Pigos et al. [35].
The TPR profiles of CeO2ZrO2 oxides differ compared to that of pure ZrO2. The difference is probably due to the type of interaction strength between supported cerium oxide species and zirconia carrier. The addition of ceria causes a shift in the temperature of the surface reduction process on zirconia to lower values (Fig. 7); the maximum of the main peak in the TPR of the fresh CeO2ZrO2 samples is shifted to lower values with increasing CeO2 content. On the other hand, the low intense peak to the left of the main peak revealed in the TPR profiles of the samples with higher CeO2 content (6 wt%) (Fig. 7d and e) is due to a reduction of cerium oxide species. It should be noted that this reduction occurs at a lower temperature (below 770 K) compared to that observed for bulk ceria. Doping zirconium atoms into ceria could facilitate the oxygen transport from bulk to surface [36]. Traces from Ce2O3 at 1101 K are observed in the TPR profile of the sample with the highest CeO2 content (12 wt%, Fig. 7e). The calculated hydrogen consumption for CeO2ZrO2 samples increases with the increase of CeO2 content (Table 3).
The redox properties of the pure oxides, as well as of the mixed oxides, subjected to different treatments, are shown in Fig. 7. The characteristic peak in TPR profiles due to the surface reduction of the fresh materials disappeared after subjecting the samples to reoxidation at 773 K (R-O773) (Fig. 7). All samples show marked enhancement of the low-temperature reducibility relative to that of the fresh samples. This improved low- temperature reducibility is especially dominant for mixed CeO2ZrO2 samples. The easy reduction should be caused by the increasing oxygen mobility in the structure of ceria zirconia oxides.
A strong peak at 652 K accompanied by a small one at 904 K is detected for pure ZrO2 subjected to R-O773 (Fig. 7a). By contrast, for pure ceria subjected to R-O773 (Fig. 7f), the peak at a low-temperature range is significantly lower compared to that at 1080 K from bulk reduction. The shoulder at ca. 757 K on the high-temperature side of the 646 K peak is probably due to a formation of non-stoichiometric cerium oxide species [34].
Non-stoichiometric ceria has been obtained from perfect stoichiometry of ceria heated at 773 K in air [37], in vacuum or in a hydrogen atmosphere [38], with no detectable departure from the original structure.
It is difficult to separate the species corresponding to the reduction of cerium or zirconium oxide species and their relative amounts of H2 consumed in the TPR profiles of mixed CeO2ZrO2 oxides due to the width of the peaks and their overlapping. Two TPR peaks are observed for mixed oxides with the lowest CeO2 content after R-O773 (Fig. 7b): a big one at 649 K and a small one at 806 K. The first peak coincides with that for pure zirconia, but the second one can be related to a reduction of cerium oxide species. A shift of the peak maximum to higher values with the increase of CeO2 content up to 6 wt% is observed (from 649 to 700 K and from 806 to 840 K for 1CeO2ZrO2 and 6CeO2ZrO2, respectively). After that,the peak maximum is again shifted to a lower value for the sample with the highest CeO2 content. In addition, H2 consumption is also increased with the CeO2 content (Table 3).
A further point worth noting is that the reduction in fresh samples starts at a higher temperature than that of the recycled samples at R-O773. The higher ionic character of the ZrO bond compared to that of CeO bond promotes the hydrophilic character of the ZrO2 surface, rendering surface rehydroxyla- tion an easy process. Upon thermal treatment, the ZrO2 surface shows a depletion of surface oxygen, that is, an indication of Lewis type acidity [39]. Accordingly, we suggest that a progressive elimination of the surface OH groups occurs with the increasing temperature during the TPR experiment, which could generate surface sites of strong Lewis acidity. Therefore,such sites may play a role in H2 activation, accounting for the lower temperature of the surface reduction after recycling (Fig. 7). In addition, the high surface area favours surface reduction at a lower temperature similar to the observation for mixed Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 oxides prepared by solgel method [11],where modification of the surface properties accounted for the variation of the initial temperature of the reduction.
Subjecting the R-O773 samples to another cycle of R-O1073 leads to a decrease in the low-temperature peak and reappearance of the high-temperature
H2
uptake peak,indicating some agglomeration of the oxides and/or an increase of the defect sites on the surface [1] during the two steps of redox aging. The CeO2ZrO2 samples still retained some low- temperature reducibility, more evident for high CeO2 loaded samples. H2 consumption increases significantly for all samples (Table 3).
It can be concluded that the redox behaviour of the samples after
R-O1073
is modified,since the reduction occurs concurrently at the surface and in the bulk. The shoulder on the high temperature side of the broad peak at about 1093 K in the TPR profiles of the samples subjected to R-O1073 is attributed to a bulk reduction of zirconia, as well as to the reduction of CeO2 to Ce2O3 (Fig. 7). The maximum of the shoulder is moved to a lower temperature after addition of a small amount of CeO2 to ZrO2 (Table 3), thereby facilitating the bulk reduction of the zirconia phase. The presence of two peaks for bulk reduction was previously reported for solid solution Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 [11], and it was attributed to clustering of bulk oxygen vacancies.

94 It is generally accepted that the low-temperature process accounts for reduction of the surface. It has been observed [18] that bulk reduction may prevail due to the high-temperature redox aging, while the role of surface reduction diminishes. It was suggested that the lattice oxygen should migrate more easily in the bulk after some redox aging treatment of binary CeO2ZrO2 oxides obtained by co-precipitation and super- critical synthesis [1,16,18]. It can be assumed that the surface shell reduction as well as the bulk reduction of ZrO2 and mixed CeO2ZrO2 samples is occurred. This could be associated with an increase in defect sites on zirconia phase due to the deeper incorporation of ceria into zirconia causing increased oxygen mobility [1,11]. By contrast, the highest reduction degree of CeO2 is mainly due to the bulk reduction of the larger ceria crystallites (Table 1).
CeO2rich samples show higher H2 consumption after reoxidation at both temperatures compared to those of the fresh samples and pure ZrO2 (Table 3). A partial segregation of Ce3+ occurs on the surface of the oxides due to the higher ionic radii of Ce3+ (1.1 A ) compared to that of Ce4+ (0.97 A ) and Zr4+
(0.84 A
) [40]. Upon reoxidation, the segregated cerium cations form small ceria-rich clusters on top of the oxides. The surface segregation of cerium species is confirmed by the increasing surface atomic Ce/Ce + Zr ratio (Table 2). The reduction of the surface and the bulk of this new ceria-rich phase could be responsible for the enhanced reducibility of the mixed CeO2 ZrO2 oxides after high-temperature redox aging.
The TGA profiles of the samples showed weight loss against time under H2/N2 atmosphere at 773 K. According to Trovarelli et al. [15] the weight loss due to the removal of oxygen with formation of water was related to a measurement of OSC. The weight loss of the samples decreases in the following order:12CeO2ZrO2 > 6CeO2ZrO2 > 3CeO2ZrO2  1CeO2 ZrO2  ZrO2 > CeO2. An unusually low OSC is obtained for CeO2. It should be noted that the CeO2 sample was obtained at high calcination temperature (1073 K) and the contribution of the surface shell reduction is low, as seen in the TPR profile of ceria (Fig. 7f). However, ceria rich samples have high OSC (6 and 12 wt%) showing high H2 consumptions (Table 3). Since total OSC is correlated to more subtle structural features, H2 consumption values extracted from TPR could therefore sometimes be considered as total OSC [15].
4. Conclusions
Although CeO2ZrO2 oxides are not true mixed oxides,being prepared by impregnation of ZrO2 with a solution of cerium nitrate, the results clearly indicate that a strong interaction exists between the zirconia carrier and deposited ceria, which makes the system similar to chemically mixed oxides. The CeO2ZrO2 system displays better redox properties than that of ZrO2, due to the generation of a high concentration of defect sites on the zirconia surface and the ability to generate O-vacancies. The availability of our CeO2ZrO2 system for redox processes at moderate temperature makes these materials very attractive as carriers for catalysts requiring a highly efficient redox couple Ce4+/Ce3+.
