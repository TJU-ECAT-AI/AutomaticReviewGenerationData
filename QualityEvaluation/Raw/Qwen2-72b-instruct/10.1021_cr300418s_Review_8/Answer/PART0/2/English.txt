Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include the complex interplay between the dopant's valence, the stability of the dopant's oxide, and the electronic structure of the host oxide, which can be reducible or irreducible. Factors such as the valence of the dopant, the stability of the dopant's oxide, and the structure of the doped oxide can influence the effectiveness of the dopant.
