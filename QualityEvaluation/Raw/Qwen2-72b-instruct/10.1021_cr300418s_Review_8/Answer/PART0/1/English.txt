High-valence dopants (HVDs) have a more complex effect on the chemistry of the host oxide than low-valence dopants (LVDs), depending on whether the host oxide is reducible or not. In irreducible oxides, HVDs can hinder oxidation by the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, but in reducible oxides, they can donate electrons to reduce cations in the host oxide. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) generally improve the performance of the host oxide in catalytic applications. However, formulating simple rules for the effects of SVDs and HVDs is challenging due to factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide. Computational and experimental studies have shown that HVDs can increase the energy needed for removing surface oxygen atoms in irreducible oxides, which can hinder oxidation. In reducible oxides, HVDs can reduce cations, affecting the redox properties of the oxide. SVDs have been shown to favorably affect the properties of the host oxide in various catalytic applications. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior due to the complexity of interactions between dopants and host oxides. The behavior of flexible-valence dopants (FVDs) is particularly difficult to predict, especially in reducible host oxides. More computational and experimental work is needed to clarify the behavior of these systems.

The literature does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does discuss the effects of various dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at the surface of ceria and magnesium oxide. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) such as La and Y in ceria and Li and Na in magnesia lower the energy of making an oxygen vacancy both near and far from the dopant. High-valence dopants in MgO(001) such as Al, Sc, and Y slightly increase the energy of vacancy formation next to them. The effect of dopants on the oxygen-vacancy formation in reducible oxides like ceria is more complex and does not follow simple rules based on the strength of their bond to oxygen and their valence. Doping CeO2(111) with Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W has no long-range effect on the energy of vacancy formation. These dopants affect the energy of vacancy formation next to them by roughly the same amount, even though they have very different chemical properties. The lack of correlation between the strength of the dopant-oxygen bond in the oxide of the dopant and the effect of the dopant on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is explained, in part, by the ability of the Ce ions to change easily their formal charge from +4 to +3, giving ceria great flexibility in adjusting to the extra electrons provided by these dopants. The effect of high-valence dopants on the oxygen-vacancy formation depends qualitatively on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible. The effect of dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopant-oxygen bonds that are much shorter than the CeO bonds in ceria. The effect of dopants on the oxygen-vacancy formation in MgO is predictable on the basis of a dopant's valence. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible), because the effect of dopants on the energy of vacancy formation does not always follow simple rules based on the strength of their bond to oxygen and on their valence in their own oxides.

The literature and documents do not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, they do discuss the effects of doping La2O3 with Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe, and Al, and how these dopants can lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, potentially improving catalytic activity. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a predictor of the ability of surface oxygen atoms to engage in chemical reactions. Dopants can affect catalytic activity by weakening the bond between oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, facilitating the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for oxidation, adsorbing O2 from the gas phase, and facilitating the dissociative adsorption of molecules.

The influence of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides can be predicted by rules related to Lewis acid-base properties. These rules seem to be general and apply to any chemical process involving a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair. Doping an oxide with a low-valence dopant (LVD) turns it into a Lewis acid, which increases the binding energy of any Lewis base. The chemistry of reducible oxides doped with LVDs is complicated by the acidity of the cations and the additional acidity induced by the dopant. HVDs are Lewis bases that strongly adsorb Lewis acids such as O2 or X2. If the dopant is not a very strong base, it adsorbs O2 but does not completely neutralize its acidity, allowing the adsorbed O2 to react with Lewis bases. If the dopant is a very strong base, it completely neutralizes the acidity of O2, preventing it from reacting with Lewis bases. Adsorbed species can have two isomers, one a base and the other an acid, and their structure is determined by the presence of a Lewis acid or base. Acid-base strength can be qualitatively defined, and the acid-base interaction increases with the strength of the acid or base. Adsorbing a Lewis base on a surface modified to be a Lewis acid can suppress the properties conferred by the acid, behaving as if the base neutralizes the acid. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).

The literature does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does suggest that doping with metals such as Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni can weaken the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, making it more reactive and potentially a better oxidation catalyst. The effectiveness of the dopant in enhancing catalytic activity may depend on factors such as the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation and the capacity to take oxygen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction. A balance between these two properties is necessary for an efficient catalyst. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior may include the complexity of interactions between the dopant and the host oxide, as well as the influence of factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide.

Computational and experimental studies have shown that HVDs can increase the energy needed for removing surface oxygen atoms in irreducible oxides, which can hinder oxidation. In reducible oxides, HVDs can reduce cations, affecting the redox properties of the oxide. SVDs have been shown to favorably affect the properties of the host oxide in various catalytic applications. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior due to the complexity of interactions between dopants and host oxides. The behavior of flexible-valence dopants (FVDs) is particularly difficult to predict, especially in reducible host oxides. More computational and experimental work is needed to clarify the behavior of these systems.

The literature does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does discuss the effects of various dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at the surface of ceria and magnesium oxide. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) such as La and Y in ceria and Li and Na in magnesia lower the energy of making an oxygen vacancy both near and far from the dopant. High-valence dopants in MgO(001) such as Al, Sc, and Y slightly increase the energy of vacancy formation next to them. The effect of dopants on the oxygen-vacancy formation in reducible oxides like ceria is more complex and does not follow simple rules based on the strength of their bond to oxygen and their valence. Doping CeO2(111) with Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W has no long-range effect on the energy of vacancy formation. These dopants affect the energy of vacancy formation next to them by roughly the same amount, even though they have very different chemical properties. The lack of correlation between the strength of the dopant-oxygen bond in the oxide of the dopant and the effect of the dopant on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is explained, in part, by the ability of the Ce ions to change easily their formal charge from +4 to +3, giving ceria great flexibility in adjusting to the extra electrons provided by these dopants. The effect of high-valence dopants on the oxygen-vacancy formation depends qualitatively on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible. The effect of dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopant-oxygen bonds that are much shorter than the CeO bonds in ceria. The effect of dopants on the oxygen-vacancy formation in MgO is predictable on the basis of a dopant's valence. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible), because the effect of dopants on the energy of vacancy formation does not always follow simple rules based on the strength of their bond to oxygen and on their valence in their own oxides.

The literature and documents do not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, they do discuss the effects of doping La2O3 with Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe, and Al, and how these dopants can lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, potentially improving catalytic activity. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a predictor of the ability of surface oxygen atoms to engage in chemical reactions. Dopants can affect catalytic activity by weakening the bond between oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, facilitating the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for oxidation, adsorbing O2 from the gas phase, and facilitating the dissociative adsorption of molecules.

The influence of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides can be predicted by rules related to Lewis acid-base properties. These rules seem to be general and apply to any chemical process involving a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair. Doping an oxide with a low-valence dopant (LVD) turns it into a Lewis acid, which increases the binding energy of any Lewis base. The chemistry of reducible oxides doped with LVDs is complicated by the acidity of the cations and the additional acidity induced by the dopant. HVDs are Lewis bases that strongly adsorb Lewis acids such as O2 or X2. If the dopant is not a very strong base, it adsorbs O2 but does not completely neutralize its acidity, allowing the adsorbed O2 to react with Lewis bases. If the dopant is a very strong base, it completely neutralizes the acidity of O2, preventing it from reacting with Lewis bases. Adsorbed species can have two isomers, one a base and the other an acid, and their structure is determined by the presence of a Lewis acid or base. Acid-base strength can be qualitatively defined, and the acid-base interaction increases with the strength of the acid or base. Adsorbing a Lewis base on a surface modified to be a Lewis acid can suppress the properties conferred by the acid, behaving as if the base neutralizes the acid. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).

The literature does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does suggest that doping with metals such as Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni can weaken the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, making it more reactive and potentially a better oxidation catalyst. The effectiveness of the dopant in enhancing catalytic activity may depend on factors such as the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation and the capacity to take oxygen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction. A balance between these two properties is necessary for an efficient catalyst. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior may include the complexity of interactions between the dopant and the host oxide, as well as the influence of factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide.

High-valence dopants (HVDs) have a more complex effect on the chemistry of the host oxide than low-valence dopants (LVDs), depending on whether the host oxide is reducible or not. In irreducible oxides, HVDs can hinder oxidation by the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, but in reducible oxides, they can donate electrons to reduce cations in the host oxide. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) generally improve the performance of the host oxide in catalytic applications. However, formulating simple rules for the effects of SVDs and HVDs is challenging due to factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide.
