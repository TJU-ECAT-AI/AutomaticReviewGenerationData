Doping CeO2(111) with Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W has no long-range effect on the energy of vacancy formation. These dopants affect the energy of vacancy formation next to them by roughly the same amount, even though they have very different chemical properties. The lack of correlation between the strength of the dopant-oxygen bond in the oxide of the dopant and the effect of the dopant on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is explained, in part, by the ability of the Ce ions to change easily their formal charge from +4 to +3, giving ceria great flexibility in adjusting to the extra electrons provided by these dopants. The effect of high-valence dopants on the oxygen-vacancy formation depends qualitatively on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible. The effect of dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopant-oxygen bonds that are much shorter than the CeO bonds in ceria. The effect of dopants on the oxygen-vacancy formation in MgO is predictable on the basis of a dopant's valence. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible), because the effect of dopants on the energy of vacancy formation does not always follow simple rules based on the strength of their bond to oxygen and on their valence in their own oxides.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp205432"},

Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).", "Doi": "10.1021/jp301341"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The literature does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does suggest that doping with metals such as Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni can weaken the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, making it more reactive and potentially a better oxidation catalyst. The effectiveness of the dopant in enhancing catalytic activity may depend on factors such as the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation and the capacity to take oxygen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction. A balance between these two properties is necessary for an efficient catalyst. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior may include the complexity of interactions between the dopant and the host oxide, as well as the influence of factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide.", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-005-0014-6"},
