          [7] "The chemistry of the reducible oxides doped with LVDs is complicated by the fact that the cations are acidic and the dopant-induced acidity is additional to that already present in the oxide."
          [8] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
          [9] "If the dopant is not a very strong base, it adsorbs O2 (or X2), but it does not manage to neutralize its acidity completely. Because of this, the adsorbed O2 is capable of reacting with Lewis bases."
          [10] "If the dopant is a very strong base, it neutralized the (Lewis acid) O2 completely, so it will no longer react with Lewis bases."
          [11] "In some cases, an adsorbed species can have two isomers, one that is a base and the other that is an acid. If that species is coadsorbed with a Lewis acid, it will take the structure that is a base. If it is coadsorbed with a Lewis base, it will take the structure in which it is an acid."
          [12] "It is possible to define, qualitatively, an acid or a base strength, and the acidbase interaction increases as the strength of the acid or the base is increased."
          [13] "If a surface is modified to be a Lewis acid, to confer on it certain properties, these properties can be substantially suppressed by adsorbing on the surface a Lewis base. The system behaves as if the base neutralizes the acid."



[1] "The effect of high-valence dopants on the chemistry of the host oxide is more complex than that of LVDs because it depends on whether the host is reducible or not."
          [2] "Pala et al. (271) examined the effect of all substitutional dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the surface of ZnO. They showed that all HVDs increased the energy needed for removing a surface oxygen atom located near the dopant."
          [3] "A limited number of calculations on other systems suggest that the activation of the oxygen adsorbed on an HVD1 is likely to be general."
          [4] "The situation is different in the limiting case of HVD2. An example is provided by Ta-doped La2O3(001) exposed to oxygen. The O2 molecule dissociates: one atom binds to Ta, and the other binds to a surface oxygen atom forming a sort of O2 molecule."
          [5] "Very few calculations have examined this kind of system. They allow us to make some guesses and extrapolations, but they need to be reinforced (or modified) by further work."
          [6] "Quite a bit of work has been devoted to the situation when the dopant and the cation being substituted have the same valence."
          [7] "All of these calculations show that the dopant affects favorably the properties of the host oxide."
          [8] "However, we were unable to formulate any simple rules regarding the SVDs in catalysis other than to say that they should be tried, especially if one tunes the properties of an oxide that is already an efficient catalyst."
          [9] "Because we define the valence of a dopant by examining the stoichiometry of its stable oxides, we cannot assign a unique valence to dopants that have several stable oxides."
          [10] "Not much is known about the general behavior of such systems."
          [11] "Another interesting example of flexible-valence dopant is provided by Cr-doped ceria. Experiments in Hegdes group (381, 382) indicated that this doped oxide contains Ce3+ and Ce4+ as well as Cr4+ and Cr6+."
          [12] "The examples presented here suggest that it may be difficult to find simple rules for the effects of flexible-valence dopants, especially if the host oxide is a reducible. More computational and experimental work is needed for clarifying the behavior of these systems."





[1] "If doping an oxide with a LVD turns it into a Lewis acid, then doping should increase substantially the binding energy of any Lewis base, not just the formation of an oxygen vacancy. Calculations show that this is indeed the case. (73, 77, 80, 86) This is true of CO adsorption, which is a Lewis base, whose binding energy to the oxygen atom next to a LVD is substantially larger than the binding energy to the undoped oxide. (54, 72-74, 80, 88, 92, 93) The binding of a H atom (a Lewis base) provides another example. (77, 86, 94) The energy of the reaction 1/2H2 + Ox  H/Ox (here H/Ox is the oxide with a H adsorbed to make a hydroxyl) is 1.53 eV if Ox = La2O3 and 2.35 eV if Ox = MgLa2O3; it is 1.24 eV if Ox = CeO2 and 2.94 eV if Ox = LaCeO2 (here MgLa2O3 is La2O3 doped with Mg, and LaCeO2 has a similar meaning). This large shift in the binding energy has been observed for all surfaces doped with LVDs for which we have calculations."

If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases. If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active."
          [4] "These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair."
          [5] "We have shown that many trends related to chemical processes relevant to catalytic chemistry of oxide surfaces can be predicted (or rationalized) by a few rules pertaining to the Lewis acidbase properties of the chemicals involved."
