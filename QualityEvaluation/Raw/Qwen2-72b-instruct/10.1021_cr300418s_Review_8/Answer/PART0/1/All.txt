The lack of correlation between the strength of the dopant-oxygen bond in the oxide of the dopant and the effect of the dopant on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is explained, in part, by the ability of the Ce ions to change easily their formal charge from +4 to +3, giving ceria great flexibility in adjusting to the extra electrons provided by these dopants. The effect of high-valence dopants on the oxygen-vacancy formation depends qualitatively on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible.

Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible), because the effect of dopants on the energy of vacancy formation does not always follow simple rules based on the strength of their bond to oxygen and on their valence in their own oxides.", "Chinese": "文献没有提供关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能的具体信息。然而,它确实讨论了各种掺杂剂对氧化铈和氧化镁表面氧空位形成能的影响。低价掺杂剂(LVDs),如氧化铈中的La和Y以及氧化镁中的Li和Na,降低了靠近和远离掺杂剂形成氧空位的能量。MgO(001)中的高价掺杂剂,如Al、Sc和Y,略微增加了紧邻它们形成空位的能量。高价掺杂剂对可还原氧化物如氧化铈的氧空位形成的影响更为复杂,并不遵循基于它们与氧的结合强度和价态的简单规则。掺杂CeO2(111)与Pt、Ru、Zr、Nb、Ta、Mo和W没有对氧空位形成能产生远程效应。尽管这些掺杂剂具有非常不同的化学性质,但它们对靠近它们的空位形成能的影响大致相同。掺杂剂与其氧化物中氧之间的键强度与其对空位形成能的影响之间缺乏相关性,部分原因是Ce离子能够轻松地将其形式电荷从+4改变为+3,从而使铈具有很大的灵活性,以适应这些掺杂剂提供的额外电子。高价掺杂剂对氧空位形成的影响在可还原或不可还原的宿主氧化物上定性地取决于。在MgO上,高价掺杂剂对氧空位形成的影响可以根据掺杂剂的价态进行预测。在考虑路易斯酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质(可还原与不可还原)时,制定一般预测规则仍然存在挑战,因为掺杂剂对空位形成能的影响并不总是遵循基于它们与氧的键强度和它们在自己的氧化物中的价态的简单规则。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp205432"},

(54, 72-74, 80, 88, 92, 93) The binding of a H atom (a Lewis base) provides another example. (77, 86, 94) The energy of the reaction 1/2H2 + Ox  H/Ox (here H/Ox is the oxide with a H adsorbed to make a hydroxyl) is 1.53 eV if Ox = La2O3 and 2.35 eV if Ox = MgLa2O3; it is 1.24 eV if Ox = CeO2 and 2.94 eV if Ox = LaCeO2 (here MgLa2O3 is La2O3 doped with Mg, and LaCeO2 has a similar meaning). This large shift in the binding energy has been observed for all surfaces doped with LVDs for which we have calculations.\"\n          [2] \"The chemistry of the reducible oxides doped with LVDs is complicated by the fact that the cations are acidic and the dopant-induced acidity is additional to that already present in the oxide.\"\n          [3] \"High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases. If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active.\"\n          [4] \"These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair.\"\n          [5] \"We have shown that many trends related to chemical processes relevant to catalytic chemistry of oxide surfaces can be predicted (or rationalized) by a few rules pertaining to the Lewis acidbase properties of the chemicals involved.\"\n          [6] \"If doping an oxide with a LVD turns it into a Lewis acid, then doping should increase substantially the binding energy of any Lewis base, not just the formation of an oxygen vacancy.\"\n          [7] \"The chemistry of the reducible oxides doped with LVDs is complicated by the fact that the cations are acidic and the dopant-induced acidity is additional to that already present in the oxide.\"\n          [8] \"High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen).\"\n          [9] \"If the dopant is not a very strong base, it adsorbs O2 (or X2), but it does not manage to neutralize its acidity completely. Because of this, the adsorbed O2 is capable of reacting with Lewis bases.\"\n          [10] \"If the dopant is a very strong base, it neutralized the (Lewis acid) O2 completely, so it will no longer react with Lewis bases.\"\n          [11] \"In some cases, an adsorbed species can have two isomers, one that is a base and the other that is an acid.

The system behaves as if the base neutralizes the acid.\"", "English": "The influence of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides can be predicted by rules related to Lewis acid-base properties. These rules seem to be general and apply to any chemical process involving a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair. Doping an oxide with a low-valence dopant (LVD) turns it into a Lewis acid, which increases the binding energy of any Lewis base. The chemistry of reducible oxides doped with LVDs is complicated by the acidity of the cations and the additional acidity induced by the dopant. HVDs are Lewis bases that strongly adsorb Lewis acids such as O2 or X2. If the dopant is not a very strong base, it adsorbs O2 but does not completely neutralize its acidity, allowing the adsorbed O2 to react with Lewis bases. If the dopant is a very strong base, it completely neutralizes the acidity of O2, preventing it from reacting with Lewis bases. Adsorbed species can have two isomers, one a base and the other an acid, and their structure is determined by the presence of a Lewis acid or base. Acid-base strength can be qualitatively defined, and the acid-base interaction increases with the strength of the acid or base. Adsorbing a Lewis base on a surface modified to be a Lewis acid can suppress the properties conferred by the acid, behaving as if the base neutralizes the acid. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).", "Chinese": "同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对不同金属氧化物催化性能的影响可以通过与参与化学过程的Lewis酸碱性质相关的规则来预测。这些规则似乎是普遍的，适用于任何涉及Lewis酸和碱的化学过程，无论化学对的性质如何。用低价掺杂剂(LVD)掺杂氧化物会使其成为Lewis酸，从而增加任何Lewis碱的结合能。LVDs掺杂的可还原氧化物的化学性质因阳离子的酸性以及掺杂剂引起的额外酸性而变得复杂。HVDs是Lewis碱，强烈吸附如O2或X2等Lewis酸。如果掺杂剂不是非常强的碱，它会吸附O2但不会完全中和其酸性，使吸附的O2能够与Lewis碱反应。如果掺杂剂是非常强的碱，它会完全中和O2的酸性，阻止它与Lewis碱反应。吸附物种可能有两种异构体，一种是碱，另一种是酸，它们的结构由Lewis酸或碱的存在决定。可以定性地定义酸碱强度，酸碱相互作用随着酸或碱的强度增加而增加。在被修改为Lewis酸的表面上吸附Lewis碱可以抑制酸赋予的性质，表现得好像碱中和了酸。在考虑Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质(可还原与不可还原)的情况下，制定一般预测规则以描述掺杂剂行为的挑战依然存在。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp301341"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The literature does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does suggest that doping with metals such as Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni can weaken the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, making it more reactive and potentially a better oxidation catalyst. The effectiveness of the dopant in enhancing catalytic activity may depend on factors such as the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation and the capacity to take oxygen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction. A balance between these two properties is necessary for an efficient catalyst. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior may include the complexity of interactions between the dopant and the host oxide, as well as the influence of factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide.", "Chinese": "文献没有提供关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能的具体信息。然而,它确实表明,用Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni等金属掺杂可以削弱表面氧与氧化物的结合,使其更具反应性,可能成为更好的氧化催化剂。掺杂剂增强催化活性的有效性可能取决于诸如在氧化过程中捐赠氧原子的能力和从气相中获取氧以修复氧化反应形成的氧空位的能力等因素。高效催化剂需要在这两种性质之间取得平衡。制定一般预测掺杂剂行为规则的挑战可能包括掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间复杂相互作用的复杂性,以及诸如Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的还原性等因素的影响。", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-005-0014-6"},
