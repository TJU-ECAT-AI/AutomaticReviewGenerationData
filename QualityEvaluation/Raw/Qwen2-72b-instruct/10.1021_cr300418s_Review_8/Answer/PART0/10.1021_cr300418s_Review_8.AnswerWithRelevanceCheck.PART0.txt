          [1] "The effect of high-valence dopants on the chemistry of the host oxide is more complex than that of LVDs because it depends on whether the host is reducible or not."
          [2] "Pala et al. (271) examined the effect of all substitutional dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the surface of ZnO. They showed that all HVDs increased the energy needed for removing a surface oxygen atom located near the dopant."
          [3] "A limited number of calculations on other systems suggest that the activation of the oxygen adsorbed on an HVD1 is likely to be general."
          [4] "The situation is different in the limiting case of HVD2. An example is provided by Ta-doped La2O3(001) exposed to oxygen. The O2 molecule dissociates: one atom binds to Ta, and the other binds to a surface oxygen atom forming a sort of O2 molecule."
          [5] "Very few calculations have examined this kind of system. They allow us to make some guesses and extrapolations, but they need to be reinforced (or modified) by further work."
          [6] "Quite a bit of work has been devoted to the situation when the dopant and the cation being substituted have the same valence."
          [7] "All of these calculations show that the dopant affects favorably the properties of the host oxide."
          [8] "However, we were unable to formulate any simple rules regarding the SVDs in catalysis other than to say that they should be tried, especially if one tunes the properties of an oxide that is already an efficient catalyst."
          [9] "Because we define the valence of a dopant by examining the stoichiometry of its stable oxides, we cannot assign a unique valence to dopants that have several stable oxides."
          [10] "Not much is known about the general behavior of such systems."
          [11] "Another interesting example of flexible-valence dopant is provided by Cr-doped ceria. Experiments in Hegdes group (381, 382) indicated that this doped oxide contains Ce3+ and Ce4+ as well as Cr4+ and Cr6+."
          [12] "The examples presented here suggest that it may be difficult to find simple rules for the effects of flexible-valence dopants, especially if the host oxide is a reducible. More computational and experimental work is needed for clarifying the behavior of these systems."

          High-valence dopants (HVDs) have a more complex effect on the chemistry of the host oxide than low-valence dopants (LVDs), depending on whether the host oxide is reducible or not. In irreducible oxides, HVDs can hinder oxidation by the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, but in reducible oxides, they can donate electrons to reduce cations in the host oxide. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) generally improve the performance of the host oxide in catalytic applications. However, formulating simple rules for the effects of SVDs and HVDs is challenging due to factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide. Computational and experimental studies have shown that HVDs can increase the energy needed for removing surface oxygen atoms in irreducible oxides, which can hinder oxidation. In reducible oxides, HVDs can reduce cations, affecting the redox properties of the oxide. SVDs have been shown to favorably affect the properties of the host oxide in various catalytic applications. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior due to the complexity of interactions between dopants and host oxides. The behavior of flexible-valence dopants (FVDs) is particularly difficult to predict, especially in reducible host oxides. More computational and experimental work is needed to clarify the behavior of these systems.

          高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对宿主氧化物化学的影响比低价掺杂剂（LVDs）更复杂，这取决于宿主氧化物是否可还原。在不可还原的氧化物中，HVDs可以阻碍Mars-van Krevelen机制的氧化，但在可还原的氧化物中，它们可以捐赠电子来还原宿主氧化物中的阳离子。同价掺杂剂（SVDs）通常可以改善宿主氧化物在催化应用中的性能。然而，由于路易斯酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质等因素，制定关于SVDs和HVDs效应的简单规则具有挑战性。计算和实验研究表明，HVDs可以增加在不可还原氧化物中去除表面氧原子所需的能量，从而阻碍氧化。在可还原氧化物中，HVDs可以还原阳离子，影响氧化物的氧化还原性质。SVDs已被证明可以有利地影响宿主氧化物在各种催化应用中的性质。由于掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间相互作用的复杂性，制定关于掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则仍然存在挑战。特别是对于可还原宿主氧化物中的灵活价态掺杂剂（FVDs）的行为，很难预测。需要更多的计算和实验工作来澄清这些系统的性质。
