1.The document does not provide specific information on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. However, it does discuss the effects of various dopants on the oxidative power of ZnO(1010) surfaces. Dopants such as Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE), making the surface oxygen more reactive. On the other hand, dopants like Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase OVFE, making the surface oxygen less reactive. The document also notes that the location of the dopant, whether at the surface or in the bulk, affects its impact on the oxide's catalytic properties. The document does not address the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior or the role of Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide in dopant effects.

Dopants such as Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk. On the other hand, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase OVFE. Among these, Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface while the remainder are happier substituting a Zn atom in the bulk. The document also notes that it is difficult to find any qualitative factor that will allow us to guess a priori the effect of the dopant on the oxygen atoms in a given host oxide due to the many factors involved in determining the magnitude of OVFE. The document does not address the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).

The document also notes that it is difficult to find a reliable trend or a rationalization for the computed values of OVFE for a wide set of dopants. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior due to the lack of correlation between OVFE and properties of the dopant's oxide, and the complexity of factors affecting OVFE.
