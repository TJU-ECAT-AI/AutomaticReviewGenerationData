The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed by doping active boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto the surface of various hosting materials. The exposed surface of bulk boride materials can also serve as 2-D dispersed active sites. These sites offer a significant advantage over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density, which can be substantially increased. This unique structural feature has attracted extensive research interest due to its potential to enhance catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction.
