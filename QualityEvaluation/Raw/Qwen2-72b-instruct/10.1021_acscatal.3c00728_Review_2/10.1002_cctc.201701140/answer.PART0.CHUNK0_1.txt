1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature to directly answer the question about how 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, the specific advantages they offer over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance, and why these unique structural features have attracted significant research interest in the field. However, the literature does suggest that boron-containing materials, including elemental boron, show high selectivity to propylene in the ODHP reaction. The surfaces of these materials are enriched with B and O atoms, and upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase, suggesting the formation of BOx active sites. These sites are proposed to play a critical role in the ODHP reaction. The reactivity differences between elemental boron and boron-containing materials may be due to active-site density and electronic interactions between surface BOx species and the subsurface bulk structure.

1.在文献中没有找到直接回答关于如何在基于硼的催化剂中开发2-D分散活性位点，这些位点在活性位点密度和催化性能方面相对于线性分散边缘位点的具体优势，以及为什么这些独特的结构特征在该领域引起了大量研究兴趣的问题的相关引用。然而，文献确实表明，包括元素硼在内的含硼材料在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中显示出对丙烯的高选择性。这些材料的表面富含B和O原子，当暴露在ODHP反应中时，表面氧浓度增加，表明形成了BOx活性位点。这些位点被提议在ODHP反应中起关键作用。元素硼和含硼材料之间的反应性差异可能是由于活性位点密度和表面BOx物种与次表面体结构之间的电子相互作用。
