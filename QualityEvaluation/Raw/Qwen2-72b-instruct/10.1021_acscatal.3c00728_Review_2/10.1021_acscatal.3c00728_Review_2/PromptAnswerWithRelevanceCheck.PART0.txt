[1] "The 2-D dispersed active sites can be developed by doping the active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on the surface of diverse hosting materials. Moreover, the exposed surface of bulk boride materials can also be regarded as the 2-D dispersed active sites for the ODHP reaction. Compared with the linearly dispersed edge sites, the density of active site can be significantly improved."
[2] "Consequently, B nanomaterials with 2-D active sites have drawn extensive interest from researchers in the ODHP reaction because of their unique structural features."

1.2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed by doping active boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto the surface of various hosting materials. The exposed surface of bulk boride materials can also serve as 2-D dispersed active sites. These sites offer a significant increase in active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, which enhances catalytic performance. This unique structural feature has attracted substantial research interest due to its potential to improve the efficiency of the ODHP reaction.
