[1] "The 2-D dispersed active sites can be developed by doping the active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on the surface of diverse hosting materials. Moreover, the exposed surface of bulk boride materials can also be regarded as the 2-D dispersed active sites for the ODHP reaction."
[2] "Compared with the linearly dispersed edge sites, the density of active site can be significantly improved."
[3] "Consequently, B nanomaterials with 2-D active sites have drawn extensive interest from researchers in the ODHP reaction because of their unique structural features."

1.2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed by doping active boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto the surface of various hosting materials. The exposed surface of bulk boride materials also serves as 2-D dispersed active sites. These sites offer a significant advantage over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density, which can be substantially increased. This unique structural feature has attracted extensive research interest due to its potential to enhance catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction.

1.硼基催化剂中用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的二维分散活性位点是通过在各种宿主材料表面掺杂活性硼氧化物或硼羟基单元来开发的。大块硼化物材料的暴露表面也可以视为ODHP反应的二维分散活性位点。与线性分散的边缘位点相比，这些位点可以显著提高活性位点的密度。因此，具有二维活性位点的B纳米材料因其独特的结构特征而引起了ODHP反应领域研究人员的广泛关注，这可能增强催化性能。
