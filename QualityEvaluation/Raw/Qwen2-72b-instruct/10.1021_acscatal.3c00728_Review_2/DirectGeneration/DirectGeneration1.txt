The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts has revolutionized the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, offering significant advantages over traditional linearly dispersed edge sites. These 2-D sites are characterized by their improved density, which allows for a higher concentration of active sites per unit area, enhancing the catalytic efficiency. Their unique structural features, such as increased surface area and accessibility, facilitate better reactant diffusion and product desorption, leading to improved selectivity and yield. This innovation has garnered increased research interest due to its potential to overcome limitations in conventional catalysts, such as deactivation and low activity. The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts represent a promising direction in catalysis, offering a more sustainable and efficient approach to the ODHP reaction.
