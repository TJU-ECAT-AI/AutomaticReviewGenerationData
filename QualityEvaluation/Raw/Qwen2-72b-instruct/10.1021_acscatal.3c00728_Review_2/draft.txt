1. Development, methods, and advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, with emphasis on their improved density, unique structural features, and increased research interest compared to linearly dispersed edge sites.

        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction represents a significant advancement in catalytic technology \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_2\]. These sites are engineered by doping active boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto the surface of various hosting materials, and the exposed surface of bulk boride materials can also serve as 2-D dispersed active sites. This approach offers a substantial advantage over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density, which can be significantly increased. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted extensive research interest due to their potential to enhance catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_2\].
