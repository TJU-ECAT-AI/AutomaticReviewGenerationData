Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) were recently reported as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins in the gas phase. Previous studies revealed a substantial increase in surface oxygen content after exposure to ODH conditions (heating to ca. 500 °C under a flow of alkane and oxygen); however, the complexity of these materials has thus far precluded an in-depth understanding of the oxygenated surface species. In this contribution, we combine advanced NMR spectroscopy experiments with scanning electron microscopy and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy to characterize the molecular structure of the oxygen functionalized phase that arises on h-BN and BNNT following catalytic testing for ODH of propane. The pristine BN materials are readily oxidized and hydrolyzed under ODH reaction conditions to yield a phase consisting of three-coordinate boron sites with variable numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups which is denoted B(OH)xO3–x (where x = 0–3). Evidence for this robust oxide phase revises previous literature hypotheses of hydroxylated BN edges as the active component on h-BN.

Introduction
Boron nitride (BN) is a versatile material used in a number of diverse applications because of its mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, and chemical stability. (1,2) Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is isostructural to graphite, consisting of alternating B- and N atoms that make a hexagonal, honeycomb-like structure. Much like its carbon-based counterpart, h-BN can exist as both two-dimensional sheets that are structurally analogous to graphene, or as boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) that are structurally analogous to carbon nanotubes. Additional functional groups can be added to the edges of boron nitride materials to further tune the properties of the material. For example, oxygen functionalization of h-BN (e.g., with −OH or −OR groups) has been used in applications including modification of mechanical and thermal properties in composite materials, (3,4) drug delivery, (5) hydrogen storage, (6,7) and water purification. (8)
Recently, our group, followed by others, reported that h-BN and BNNT are surprisingly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins. (9−14) For example, propane ODH at 500 °C over h-BN results in 76.0% selectivity to propylene, 11.5% to ethylene, and only 9.4% to COx (CO plus CO2) at 19.1% propane conversion. These selectivities result in olefin yields that are higher than those obtained with state-of-the-art supported vanadium oxide catalysts (15,16) while achieving good productivity (i.e., 2 kg of propene/kg of catalyst/h). These results present a promising route to olefin production from shale gas-derived alkanes, which is potentially far more energy-efficient than traditional cracking of oil-derived naphtha. (17)
Given the reported chemical inertness of BN, it is of great fundamental and practical significance to understand how its remarkable catalytic activity arises. In an effort to unravel the nature of the catalytically active phase, previous studies characterized BN materials with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy after ODH catalytic testing. (9,18) XPS shows a peak shift to higher binding energies in the B 1s region of spent (used) catalysts that indicates increased oxygen coordination to boron. This shift to higher binding energy was not observed in the N 1s region. Additionally, XPS reveals that the atomic composition within the upper surface layer (ca. top 10 nm) of the spent BN catalysts has higher relative quantities of oxygen and boron atoms compared to the fresh materials. (9,10,18) IR spectra of the spent catalysts contain spectroscopic features that are attributed to BO–H and B–O vibrations at ∼3200 and 1190 cm–1, respectively. (3,19) These spectroscopic features are not detected in fresh h-BN, and are only observed at low intensities in fresh BNNT. (9,10) Given the resistance of h-BN to oxidation in air below 800 °C, (4,18,20) early literature reports of h-BN-catalyzed ODH hypothesized that BN oxidation is confined to edge sites that catalyze the ODH reaction. (9−13) We also note here that elemental boron and other boron-containing materials—such as NiB, HfB2, WB, Ti2B, and B4C—also exhibit similarly remarkable selectivity to h-BN and BNNT and show an increase in oxygen content after ODH by the same characterization techniques. (18) The similarities between these materials suggests that the oxidized boron phase plays an important role in the catalytic behavior of BN and other B-containing materials during ODH. In addition, the observation of an induction period to reach maximum alkane conversion during h-BN-catalyzed ODH further suggests that the formation of this oxidized phase on B-containing materials is required for catalytic activity. (21) Therefore, we report a detailed structural investigation of the oxidized phase on h-BN and BNNT as an important first step toward understanding the catalytic behavior of these materials. We also emphasize that exposure of BN to ODH conditions conveniently produces oxygen-functionalized BN that might find applications beyond ODH catalysis, (3−8) and that detailed structural characterization of functionalized BN is crucial for its implementation in these applications as well.
In this study, we apply magic angle spinning (MAS) 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, (22) scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize the transformation of h-BN and BNNT before and after use as catalysts for propane ODH (denoted as fresh and spent, respectively). A general overview of this approach is summarized in Figure S1. First, we obtain quantitative 1D 11B spin echo spectra for each of the h-BN and BNNT samples. Since 11B is a half-integer quadrupolar nucleus (I = 3/2), the different boron sites exhibit complex line shapes. 2D 11B Multiple-Quantum Magic Angle Spinning (MQMAS) experiments are used to resolve overlapping 11B powder patterns and provide an experimental basis for the choice of peak positions within fits of the quantitative spin echo NMR spectra. Double-resonance 11B–1H NMR experiments such as 11B{1H} Dipolar Heteronuclear Multiple-Quantum Coherence (D-HMQC), 11B → 1H Insensitive Nuclei Enhanced by Polarization Transfer (INEPT), and 11B{1H dephased} spin echo spectra are then used to identify 11B spins that are proximate to or distant from 1H nuclei. These experiments show that a fraction of the boron atoms in the oxidized part of the spent materials are proximate to protons, suggesting the formation of an amorphous mixed oxide/hydroxide phase with B(OH)xO3–x sites (x = 0–3) in the spent catalyst materials. Additional information about changes in the surface properties of the material were obtained with surface-selective dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) NMR experiments in combination with qualitative observations in surface morphology changes from SEM. Finally, XAS data on the h-BN and BNNT samples provide information about the coordination of B and O atoms that support the observations from the NMR experiments. In the B K-edge X-ray absorption spectra for h-BN and BNNT, we observe a shift from primarily BN3-coordinated species (based on a feature observed at 192 eV) in the fresh materials to a mixture of BN3 and BO3 (signal features at 194 eV) species in the spent materials. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) regions for both B and O (>195 eV for B; >537 eV for O) for the spent materials are distinct from bulk B2O3 under XAS measurement conditions and are consistent with the formation of a disordered B(OH)xO3–x phase.
Results and Discussion
11B Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy
Figure 1 shows the MAS 11B spin echo solid-state NMR spectra of h-BN and BNNT before and after use as propane ODH catalysts (materials denoted fresh and spent, respectively). We also report the spectra of spent materials treated at 500 °C for 16 h under dry air (denoted as spent dehydrated). The 11B spin echo NMR spectra are quantitative because they were obtained with recycle delays of at least 3 times the boron longitudinal relaxation time constant (T1(11B)) of the slowest relaxing boron site within a sample and all sites have a similar quadrupolar coupling constants (CQ). Saturation recovery experiments showed that the h-BN phase has an unexpectedly long T1(11B) of ca. 175 s (Figure S2); therefore, the 11B spin echo NMR spectra of the h-BN materials in Figures 1a–c were obtained with a 600 s recycle delay. 11B spin echo spectra obtained with shorter recycle delays of 50 and 0.1 s emphasize the signals from the oxidized boron phase because this component has a much shorter T1(11B) of ca. 1.4 s (Figure 1b, inset). The T1(11B) of the BN phase in spent BNNT was ca. 10 s (Figure S2); quantitative 11B spin echo of the BNNT materials in Figures 1d–f were obtained with a 50 s recycle delay.

The dashed traces below the experimental spectra represent analytical simulations of the data, and the overlapping features below represent the individual peaks corresponding to the total analytical fit. The inset in (b) compares 11B spin echo pulse NMR spectra obtained with recycle delays of 600, 50, and 0.1 s. The 11B NMR parameters determined from the analytical simulations—which are not chemically meaningful and are rather meant to approximate a distribution of boron species—are summarized in the main text and Table 1.
Analytical simulations of the MAS 11B spin echo solid-state NMR spectra provide the isotropic chemical shift (δiso)—analogous to chemical shifts measured in solution NMR experiments—as well as the electric field gradient (EFG) tensor parameters: the quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) and the EFG tensor asymmetry parameter (ηQ). (23,24) δiso for each site occurs at a higher frequency than the leftmost edge of each MAS powder pattern because of the quadrupole-induced shift. (23,24) For this reason, δiso was determined from the analytical simulations of the MAS powder patterns. (23,24) The breadth of the simulated powder patterns indicates the magnitude of CQ. The CQ depends upon the degree of spherical symmetry at the nuclear site, with spherically symmetric nuclear environments leading to small or vanishing values of CQ. (23,24) For boron, four-coordinate tetrahedral sites usually give rise to CQ values below 1 MHz and narrow NMR signals, while anisotropic three-coordinate trigonal-planar sites typically result in a CQ between 2.5 and 3 MHz and relatively broad NMR signals (Table 1; Table S1).

The 11B spin echo NMR spectrum of the fresh h-BN sample shows one major feature that can be simulated with a δiso of 30.4 ppm, a CQ of 2.9 MHz, and an ηQ of 0.0 (Figure 1a), consistent with previous solid-state NMR studies on h-BN. (7,11,27,28) The 11B spin echo of the fresh BNNT resembles that of fresh h-BN and was simulated with similar NMR parameters. A 2D 11B MQMAS spectrum of the fresh BNNT confirms that a predominant boron site with a δiso of 30.4 ppm is present (Figure S3). Therefore, the 11B NMR signal with a δiso of 30.4 ppm in the spin echo NMR spectra of fresh h-BN and fresh BNNT are attributed to boron atoms with trigonal planar symmetry and three coordinating nitrogen atoms (BN3). The spin echo spectra for both fresh samples contain small amounts (5% for h-BN and 10% for BNNT) of an impurity with δiso values corresponding to three-coordinate oxidized boron species (BO3) similar to that of boric acid that are likely residual impurities from the commercial synthesis of these materials by nitriding boron oxide with ammonia. (29) Although we observe evidence for oxidized impurities in the 11B NMR spectrum for fresh h-BN, these impurities do not appear in the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern for fresh h-BN because either they are amorphous in nature or their crystallite size is below the detection limit for this technique (Figure S4).
The 11B spin echo NMR spectra of spent h-BN (Figure 1b) and spent BNNT (Figure 1e) show significant changes from the corresponding fresh samples. In both 11B spin echo NMR spectra we observe the appearance of a new feature at a lower chemical shift from the original BN3 peak. On the basis of previous observations of oxidized boron species from XPS and IR (9,18) as well as the isotropic chemical shifts, we attribute this feature to the formation of oxidized and hydrolyzed boron species on the h-BN and BNNT materials. Given the complexity of the oxidized boron feature in the spectrum for spent h-BN, we utilized 2D 11B MQMAS NMR and double-resonance 11B–1H NMR experiments to resolve and identify the different boron coordination environments in spent h-BN (Figure 2). (22,24,30,31)

(b) Comparison of 11B solid-state NMR spectra of spent h-BN obtained with a spin echo pulse sequence (red trace), 11B {1H} D-HMQC pulse sequence (top black trace), and a 11B {1H dephased} NMR spectrum (lower black trace) of spent h-BN. (c) 2D 11B → 1H D-RINEPT spectrum. All spectra were obtained with a 1.0 s recycle delay.
Figure 2a and Figure S3 show the 2D 11B MQMAS spectrum for spent h-BN and spent BNNT, respectively. The 2D 11B MQMAS spectrum of h-BN shows signals only from the oxidized phase because a recycle delay of 1.0 s was used. The horizontal axis gives a typical 1D 11B MAS NMR spectrum of the material, whereas the vertical axis of the MQMAS spectrum shows a high-resolution isotropic 11B dimension free of quadrupolar broadening. The horizontal projections from different points along the indirect isotropic dimension in the 2D MQMAS spectrum illustrate that there is a large distribution of δiso values ranging from ca. 20 to 13 ppm (right side of Figure 2a). Analytical simulations indicate CQ is approximately 2.7 MHz and ηQ = 0.0 for all boron sites within the distribution (Table S1). The MQMAS spectrum of spent h-BN is reminiscent of the MQMAS spectra of boron oxide glasses where the distribution in δiso for the trigonal planar BO3 sites arises because the sites within boroxol rings and sites that link the rings have different chemical shifts. (31) In spent h-BN the large distribution in δiso likely arises because there are a variety of trigonal planar boron sites with different numbers of oxide and hydroxide ligands (see discussion below).
With use of the information obtained from the 2D MQMAS spectra, the 11B spin echo NMR spectra could be fit with analytical simulations (Figure 1). To simplify the analysis and interpretation of the data, the distribution of NMR signals arising from the oxidized/hydrolyzed sites was accounted for by using simulations of five distinct boron sites with CQ = 2.7 MHz and ηQ = 0.0 but different δiso that varied by about 2 ppm over the range from ca. 20 to 10 ppm (Table 1 and Table S1). Simulations of the MAS 11B solid-state NMR spectra obtained at both 14.1 and 9.4 T showed good agreement with the experimental NMR spectra (>90% overlap between experimental and simulated data), confirming the validity of the fits (Figure S5). The distinct chemical shifts used in the simulations are not chemically meaningful; rather, they are required to broaden the simulated pattern (to approximate a distribution of boron sites) and obtain a better match to the experimental spectrum intensity. Simulations with distributions in the isotropic chemical shift and EFG tensor parameters would likely yield improved fits that better reflect the structural disorder present in the spent materials.
11B–1H double-resonance experiments and trends in δiso were used to detect distinct boron coordination environments within the oxidized/hydrolyzed boron phase and to assist with structural assignments within this phase (Figure 2b,c). The 11B{1H} D-HMQC spectrum shows the 11B spectrum of proximate, dipolar-coupled 11B and 1H spins, while a 11B{1H dephased} experiment with 0.5 ms of dipolar dephasing shows the NMR signals from 11B spins that are distant from 1H spins (Figure 2b; analogous experiments performed for BNNT are provided in Figure S6). In addition, the 2D 11B → 1H dipolar refocused INEPT (D-RINEPT) spectrum shows both the 11B and 1H NMR spectra of dipolar-coupled 11B and 1H spins (Figure 2c). The 11B NMR spectrum obtained with D-HMQC (and D-RINEPT) shows a more positive δiso compared to the 11B{1H dephased} NMR spectrum; however, both 11B patterns fit within the broad NMR signal of the oxidized phase obtained with a spin echo pulse sequence (Figure 2b). Boric acid (B(OH)3) consists of trigonal planar boron sites bonded to three hydroxyl groups and has previously been reported to have 11B NMR parameters of δiso = 18.8 ppm, CQ = 2.5 MHz, and ηQ = 0.0. (32) B2O3 consists of trigonal planar BO3 sites with bridging oxide bonds and has reported 11B NMR parameters δiso = 14.6 ppm, CQ = 2.7 MHz, and ηQ = 0.05 (Table 1), although three-coordinate oxygen coordinated boron sites can take on a range of δiso values from 14.6 to 22.5 ppm depending on whether the oxide ligands are terminal or bridging. (22,25) Therefore, based upon the 11B–1H double-resonance experiments and previously reported δiso, the 11B NMR signals with the most positive δiso are assigned to sites with three hydroxyl groups, intermediate shifts likely have a mixture of bridging oxide and hydroxyl groups, and sites with lower chemical shifts are coordinated by three bridging oxide bonds. Note that the 1H chemical shift observed in the 2D 11B → 1H D-RINEPT for spent h-BN has a maximum intensity at ca. 5 ppm, while pure boric acid has a 1H chemical shift of ca. 8 ppm (Figure S7). The 11B and 1H NMR spectra of spent h-BN therefore suggest that the boron environments within the oxidized/hydrolyzed phase are distinct from those of pure boric acid or boron oxide. On the basis of all solid-state NMR experiments, the broad range of NMR signals in the oxide chemical shift region are assigned to a phase denoted B(OH)xO3–x where x = 0–3 to indicate that there are three-coordinate boron sites with different numbers of bridging oxide and hydroxyl groups. The B(OH)xO3–x phase must result from varying degrees of oxidation/hydrolysis of the BN materials under the propane ODH reaction conditions.
The 11B spin echo spectra presented in Figure 1 are quantitative; therefore, the extent of oxidation in these materials can be determined by comparing the percent area of the BN3 feature in the fresh and spent h-BN and BNNT samples. On the basis of this analysis, approximately 30% of the boron nitride phase in fresh h-BN is converted to B(OH)xO3–x species in the spent material. Remarkably, 80% of the boron nitride phase in fresh BNNT is converted to B(OH)xO3–x species in the spent material (Table 1). The NMR peak fits are in good agreement with the boron XAS, which shows a higher degree of oxidation/hydrolysis in spent BNNT as compared to that in spent h-BN (vide infra). The higher extent of oxidation in BNNT likely occurs because BNNT has a much higher surface area than h-BN, and therefore a larger fraction of boron atoms is surface-exposed in BNNT and is available for reaction. This hypothesis is also consistent with the fact that BNNT is a much more active catalyst for ODH than h-BN (vide infra).
11B solid-state NMR experiments were also performed on spent BNNT and spent h-BN samples that were treated at 500 °C for 16 h under dry air to observe any changes in the oxidized boron phase upon removal of water (Figure 1c,f). The dehydrated samples were handled in a glovebox and the NMR rotors were spun with dry nitrogen gas to prevent readsorption of moisture during spectral acquisition. The 11B spin echo NMR spectra of the B(OH)xO3–x phase in dehydrated spent h-BN and dehydrated spent BNNT are very similar to those observed from the corresponding untreated samples; however, there is a slight increase in intensity of sites with a lower δiso (Figures S9 and S10). Lower δiso are likely associated with BO3 sites, suggesting dehydroxylation of some boron sites in the B(OH)xO3–x phase upon dehydration at high temperatures. This observation was also corroborated with Raman spectroscopy (Figure S8). However, 2D 11B{1H} D-HMQC spectra of both dehydrated spent h-BN and dehydrated spent BNNT show that many of the boron spins are still proximate to 1H nuclei even after dehydration (Figures S9 and S10). The 11B–1H double-resonance NMR experiments suggest that hydroxyl groups are likely present under ODH conditions and are potentially relevant to the catalytic performance of the material.
DNP-Enhanced 11B Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy
Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-enhanced 11B solid-state NMR experiments were also performed to specifically probe the surface of the h-BN and BNNT samples (Figure 3). All fresh and spent h-BN and BNNT were prepared for DNP experiments by impregnating the powdered solids with a 15–20 mM solution of the biradical polarizing agent TEKPol in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE). (33,34) The measured direct and indirect boron DNP enhancements provide insight into the textural properties and macroscopic arrangement of the different phases in the fresh and spent materials. SEM images of the fresh and spent catalysts are provided in Figure 4 and used in combination with the DNP experiments to help understand how changes in the morphological properties of the catalysts are related to the observed DNP enhancements.

During a DNP experiment, electron spins from the TEKPol biradical are polarized with microwaves and the magnetization from these electrons is transferred to 11B nuclei in the sample either via a direct (i.e., electron → 11B) or an indirect (i.e., electron → 1H → 11B) pathway that depends on the choice of NMR experiment (Figure S11). The direct excitation 11B spin echo NMR experiments probe all the boron sites in the material, although the direct boron DNP enhancement (εB) should strongly depend upon the proximity of the boron nuclei to the polarizing agent (high εB for small particles/surface signals) and the 11B T1 (high εB for longer T1). Indirect DNP-enhanced 1H → 11B CPMAS solid-state NMR spectra were also recorded and are briefly discussed in the Supporting Information (Figure S12).
Figure 3 shows the 11B solid-state NMR spectra collected with a 263 GHz/400 MHz DNP solid-state NMR spectrometer. The NMR parameters extracted from simulations of the DNP-enhanced 11B NMR spectra are reported in Table S2. Figure S13 shows the 11B solid-state NMR spectra obtained with and without microwaves and illustrates how DNP enhancements (εB and εB CP for direct and indirect DNP enhancements, respectively) were determined for different signals. The maximum theoretical 11B direct DNP enhancement (εB) is given by the ratio of electron to 11B gyromagnetic ratios (γe/γB; ca. 1050 for 11B); however, typical enhancements—including most of the enhancements reported in Figure 3a–d—usually range from 10 to 200. (35) DNP-enhanced 1H spin echo solid-state NMR experiments for fresh and spent h-BN and measured proton DNP enhancements (εH) and are provided in Figure S14.
A very high εB of ca. 120 was measured for the boron nitride signal of fresh h-BN (Figure 3a). This high εB is somewhat surprising because h-BN consists of hexagonal sheets that are ca. 1 μm in diameter with a thickness of ca. 50–100 nm (SEM, Figure 4a). Therefore, most of the 11B spins in h-BN should not have a substantial dipolar coupling to unpaired electrons of the radical polarizing agent and direct DNP enhancements is expected to be small. However, T1(11B) is exceptionally long (ca. 175 s) in h-BN, and a long nuclear T1 will favor high DNP enhancements. A second signal was visible at lower frequency and is assigned to a small amount of oxidized boron impurities—potentially residual from the commercial synthesis of the material—present on the surface of fresh h-BN material. This signal has a small relative integrated intensity (ca. 20%) and a slightly higher εB of ca. 140, which suggests that the oxidized impurities exist as small particles or are found on the surface of the h-BN. A moderately high εB of 18 was measured for the DNP-enhanced 11B spin echo for fresh BNNT (Figure 3c). A substantial DNP enhancement is expected because the BNNT are small in diameter (ca. 3 nm, Figure 4c) and the radical polarizing agents can potentially approach within a few nanometers of all 11B spins. Clearly, while the magnitude of DNP enhancements can give valuable information about the textural and morphological properties of a sample, the DNP mechanisms can be very complex (as seen in the case of fresh h-BN) and therefore these apparent enhancements are nonquantitative.
Parts (b) and (d) of Figure 3 show the DNP-enhanced 11B spin echo spectra for spent h-BN and BNNT, respectively. The DNP-enhanced 11B spin echo NMR spectra of spent h-BN and spent BNNT samples show signals corresponding to BN3-coordinated nuclei and additional intense signals from the B(OH)xO3–x phase. The εB for the BN3 nuclei in spent h-BN decreased to 5 from an original εB of 120 in the fresh material, despite the fact that there was no change in T1(11B) for the h-BN signals. The εB for BN3 nuclei in the spent BNNT decreased to 12 from an original εB of 18 in the fresh BNNT. The reductions in εB observed for the nitride signals in the spent materials could arise if the B(OH)xO3–x phases form at the surface and block access of the radical to the nitride phases. In each of the spent materials, εB is ca. 2 for the B(OH)xO3–x phase. This suggests that the B(OH)xO3–x phase consists of large particles where the majority of boron spins are distant from the radical polarizing agents, although the short T1(11B) of ca. 1 s will also contribute to reduced εB. Indeed, the SEM image of spent h-BN shows clear degradation of the original platelet-like nanostructures (Figure 4b). SEM of the spent BNNT shows that the nanotube structures of the fresh material have been mostly transformed into an amorphous surface phase devoid of distinct nanostructure (Figure 4d). Additional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images illustrating the transformation of BNNT under ODH conditions are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S15). The large reduction in εB for the spent h-BN is likely due to sintering and is consistent with an observed loss in BET surface area from 8 ± 1 to 2 ± 2 m2·g–1 (isotherms provided in Figure S16). The indirect DNP enhancements measured with 1H → 11B CPMAS experiments confirm these qualitative descriptions of particle size/morphology reached with SEM and direct DNP (Figures S12 and S17).
X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
Figure 5a shows the boron K-edge XAS spectra of fresh and spent h-BN and BNNT. In the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) region for both the fresh and spent h-BN and BNNT (<195 eV), we observe a strong feature at 192 eV which is attributed to a BN3 coordination environment. (36) The feature at 194 eV present in the fresh BNNT and both spent materials corresponds to a BO3 coordination environment. (36) A small BO3 feature in the fresh BNNT is indicative of residual impurities from the material synthesis that is consistent with our observations from the 11B spin echo NMR spectrum of fresh BNNT (Figure 1d). The increase in intensity of the BO3 feature in the spent materials confirms oxidation occurs under ODH conditions. The intensity of the BO3 feature relative to the BN3 feature is significantly greater in the spent BNNT than in the spent h-BN, consistent with the signal intensities observed in the 11B solid-state NMR spectra (Figure 1). This difference in relative BO3 and BN3 NMR and XAS signal intensities might be explained by the higher rate of propane consumption with BNNT (1.3 × 10–3 mol of C3H6·m–2·h–1, normalized by surface area) compared to the rate for h-BN (4.0 × 10–4 mol of C3H6·m–2·h–1, normalized by surface area), which suggests a greater number of reactive sites on this material. (9) In addition, although the feature at 194 eV also appears in the reference B2O3 material, features in the EXAFS region (>195 eV) of BNNT and h-BN remain unchanged after exposure to propane ODH conditions and are considerably different from that of the reference compounds. The difference in fine structure suggests that the long-range order of the boron atom on the fresh and spent BN surfaces does not match that of B2O3. This agrees with our conclusions from 11B MAS NMR experiments, which indicate the formation of a mixture of BO3 species that are distinct from bulk B2O3 on the surface of BN catalysts after propane ODH.

The oxygen K-edge XAS spectra of h-BN and BNNT (Figure 5b) provide additional support to the conclusion that the B(OH)xO3–x phase on both spent h-BN and BNNT catalysts are structurally distinct from bulk B2O3. The O K-edge XAS spectra of fresh and spent h-BN (Figure 5b) show a major signal at ∼532 eV. This signal is attributed to a B–O bond, and is distinct from the B–O bond of B2O3, which shows a signal at 536 eV. (37,38) A smaller signal is also observed in fresh h-BN at 530.6 eV that has been previously attributed to N═O bonding (in O 1s XPS spectra that give comparable information to the XANES region in XAS) and disappears in the spent catalyst. (38) Identical B–O features at ∼532 eV are observed in fresh and spent BNNT (Figure 5b). The spectrum of fresh BNNT shows an additional signal at 528 eV. This signal is too low in energy to correspond to water or an – OH species (39) and is not expected to be a contribution from a metal impurity, as prior elemental analyses showed no evidence for metal impurities. (9) Therefore, we attribute this signal to a strained and relatively unstable oxygen species at the surface of fresh BNNT. After exposure to ODH conditions, unstable surface oxygen species are no longer present. We hypothesize that this is due to exfoliation or “unzipping” of the BNNT material, leading to the disappearance of the signal at 528 eV in spent BNNT. (19)
Conclusions
In conclusion, solid-state characterization techniques including 11B solid-state NMR, SEM, and XAS were used to identify and characterize an amorphous B(OH)xO3–x phase that forms on the surface of h-BN and BNNT following exposure to ODH conditions. Quantitative 11B spin echo experiments provide information about the changes in 11B coordination environment between fresh and spent samples, and 2D 11B MQMAS experiments provide an experimental basis for the deconvolution of these spectra. 1H-11B double-resonance experiments verify the presence of a distribution of boron sites with different degrees of hydroxylation within the B(OH)xO3–x phase. DNP NMR and SEM experiments on the fresh and spent h-BN and BNNT reveal an increase in particle size (and decrease in surface area) following catalytic testing. Complementary XAS studies on the fresh and spent materials verify our observations of an increase in BO3-coordinated species atoms after ODH. This work shows that the oxidation of h-BN and BNNT catalysts is far more extensive than was previously hypothesized in the literature.
These studies represent an important step toward understanding the transformation of boron nitride catalysts during ODH reactions, as well as toward the elucidation of an active site for these materials. In addition, these results will enable the construction of appropriate computational models to study possible active sites on the catalyst surface. It is also important to reconcile observations from these ex situ studies with further in situ spectroscopic studies to understand the dynamic transformation of this phase under catalytic conditions. Furthermore, oxidation of boron nitride at lower temperature treatments (500 °C in an air and alkane mixture as opposed to >800 °C in air) could have implications for the oxygen functionalization of BN for other applications.
Experimental Section
Sample Preparation
Fresh h-BN and BNNT were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and BNNT, LLC, respectively, and were used without any further treatment. To make the spent samples, 50–100 mg of h-BN or BNNT was added to a quartz reactor tube (9 mm diameter). The reactor tube was heated to 500 °C under a flow of O2 and N2 (20% and 80%, respectively; total flow rate 40 mL·min–1) and held at 500 °C for 1 h. The gas feed was then switched to a flow of O2, C3H8, and N2 (15%, 30%, and 55%, respectively), while maintaining a total flow rate of 40 mL·min–1. The samples were heated under these conditions for a total of 24 h. The spent dehydrated h-BN and BNNT samples were prepared by transferring the spent materials to another quartz reactor tube fitted with vacuum valves at the inlet and outlet. The samples were then heated to 500 °C in a flow (approximately 20 mL·min–1) of air for 16 h. The samples were then sealed under vacuum and handled in a glovebox prior to NMR analysis.
Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy
Conventional room-temperature solid-state NMR experiments were conducted on Bruker 9.4 T wide-bore (ν0(1H) = 400 MHz) or Bruker 14.1 T wide-bore (ν0(1H) = 600 MHz) NMR spectrometers. The 9.4 T spectrometer was equipped with a Bruker Avance III HD console and the 14.1 T spectrometer was equipped with a Bruker Avance II console. Bruker 2.5 mm broadband HXY MAS probes were employed on both systems and the MAS frequency was 25 kHz in all cases. The 1H NMR chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane in CDCl3 by using adamantane as a secondary chemical shift standard (δiso(1H) = 1.82 ppm). For DNP experiments the 1H chemical shift of the frozen tetrachlorethane solvent was used as the secondary shift standard (δiso(1H) = 6.2 ppm). 11B chemical shifts were indirectly referenced to the established chemical shift standards using the previously published relative NMR frequencies. (40) The 0.0 ppm 11B frequency was then calculated by multiplying the 1H 0.0 ppm frequency by a factor of 0.32083974. The dehydrated samples were packed into rotors in an inert nitrogen atmosphere glovebox, and MAS experiments were performed with nitrogen gas to prevent rehydration. Specific experimental details for the NMR pulse experiments reported in this manuscript are provided in the Supporting Information and pulse sequence illustrations are provided in Figure S18.
Dynamic Nuclear Polarization NMR Spectroscopy
Prior to DNP analysis, samples were ground with a mortar and pestle and the powdered sample was then impregnated with 15–20 μL of the DNP polarizing agent solution. TEKPol was used as the polarizing agent and was prepared as a 15–20 mM solution in tetrachloroethane. (34) After the samples were impregnated, they were packed into a sapphire 3.2 mm DNP rotor, with a Teflon screw insert and a zirconia drive cap.
DNP-enhanced solid-state NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker 9.4 T 400 MHz/263 GHz DNP solid-state NMR spectrometer equipped with a Bruker Avance III console. (41) A Bruker 3.2 mm double-resonance DNP probe was used for acquisition of all DNP spectra. The sample temperature for DNP experiments was approximately 110 K and a MAS frequency of 10 kHz was employed. The microwave power for optimal DNP enhancements was directly optimized on the samples of interest. 1H pulse lengths and RF fields were calibrated on each sample directly. 1H chemical shifts were referenced with respect to tetramethylsilane. All cross-polarization magic-angle spinning experiments were employed with a variable amplitude 1H contact pulse which was linearly ramped from 90% to 100% RF field (S12F). The variable amplitude 1H contact pulse helps to broaden the Hartmann–Hahn match condition. (42) SPINAL-64 1H heteronuclear decoupling was applied during signal acquisition with a 1H RF field of ca. 100 kHz. (43)
All experiments on the same nucleus have been processed with the same window function parameters for a quantitative comparison of the signal-to-noise ratio. 11B NMR spectra of catalysts were processed with 100 Hz exponential line broadening. Simulations of all MAS 11B solid-state NMR spectra were performed in the solid line shape analysis (SOLA) module v2.2.4 included in the Bruker Topspin v4.0.1 software.
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Fresh and spent h-BN and BNNT materials were characterized by SEM (LEO Supra55 VP) using an accelerating voltage of 2 keV.
X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
X-ray absorption experiments were carried out at the Advanced Light Source of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Beamline 6.3.2 was used for all experiments. Powdered samples were loaded onto carbon tape on an electrically grounded sample stage for analysis. All spectra were taken in total electron yield mode under 10–7 Torr. Spectra in this paper are shown after subtracting the dark spectrum to account for systematic error and electronic noise in the detector. Spectra were normalized to a maximum intensity of 1. Specific parameters for boron and oxygen K-edge measurements are listed in Table S3 and Table S4.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. MAS 11B spin echo solid-state NMR spectra of (a) fresh h-BN, (b) spent h-BN, (c) spent dehydrated h-BN, (d) fresh BNNT, (e) spent BNNT, and (f) spent dehydrated BNNT. The dashed traces below the experimental spectra represent analytical simulations of the data, and the overlapping features below represent the individual peaks corresponding to the total analytical fit. The inset in (b) compares 11B spin echo pulse NMR spectra obtained with recycle delays of 600, 50, and 0.1 s. The 11B NMR parameters determined from the analytical simulations—which are not chemically meaningful and are rather meant to approximate a distribution of boron species—are summarized in the main text and Table 1.

Figure 2. (a) 2D 11B MQMAS spectrum of spent h-BN. Several rows extracted from the 2D NMR spectrum and their corresponding analytical simulations are shown to the right. (b) Comparison of 11B solid-state NMR spectra of spent h-BN obtained with a spin echo pulse sequence (red trace), 11B {1H} D-HMQC pulse sequence (top black trace), and a 11B {1H dephased} NMR spectrum (lower black trace) of spent h-BN. (c) 2D 11B → 1H D-RINEPT spectrum. All spectra were obtained with a 1.0 s recycle delay.
