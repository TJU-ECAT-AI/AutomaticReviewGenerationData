          [1] "Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry."
          [2] "Furthermore, cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation."
          [3] "Comparative studies of these reaction pathways provide an opportunity to determine how the formation of bimetallic bonds affects the hydrogenation activity and selectivity."

          Cyclohexene is an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it is a cyclic hydrocarbon that serves as an important intermediate in refinery and petrochemical processes and is a building block for many chemicals in the chemical industry. It has multiple competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation. Comparative studies of these reaction pathways can provide insights into how the formation of bimetallic bonds affects hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.
