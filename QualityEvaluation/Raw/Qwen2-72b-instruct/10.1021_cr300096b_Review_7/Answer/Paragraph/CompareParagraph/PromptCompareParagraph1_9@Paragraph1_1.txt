4.1.1 C═C Hydrogenation
4.1.1.1 Example: Cyclohexene Hydrogenation on Pt&ndash;3d Catalysts
Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry. Furthermore, cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation. Comparative studies of these reaction pathways provide an opportunity to determine how the formation of bimetallic bonds affects the hydrogenation activity and selectivity.
DFT and UHV Studies on Single-Crystal 3d/Pt(111) Surfaces
To facilitate the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene, one hypothesis is that an effective catalyst should bond relatively weakly to atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene. Hammer and Nørskov (302) have shown that the binding strength of molecules on transition metals is dependent on the electronic structure of the surface, by using the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level to describe the surface electronic property. Chen et al. (10) have summarized experimental and theoretical studies that identify a nearly linear relationship between the binding energies and the surface d-band center for many adsorbates on a wide range of bimetallic surfaces.
DFT calculations were performed to estimate the values of hydrogen-binding energy (HBE) on several 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) and Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111) surfaces. As shown in Figure 10a, (27) HBE is related to the position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level, in agreement with the trend observed in previous studies for other surfaces. (10) In general, the addition of a 3d metal surface layer on Pt(111) moves the d-band center closer to the Fermi level compared to that of the bulk 3d metals. This is primarily due to the tensile strain induced by the Pt lattice because the ligand effect is weakest between late transition metal overlayers and the Pt(111) substrate. (16) Conversely, the presence of subsurface 3d metals shifts the surface d-band center of Pt away from the Fermi level as compared to that of Pt(111), mainly due to the electronic interaction of Pt and the subsurface 3d atoms. (16) The comparison in Figure 10a demonstrates that HBE typically follows the trend of 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) > Pt(111) > Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111). In addition, the nearly linear correlation between HBE and the surface d-band center should enable one to predict HBE on other bimetallic catalysts based on the extensive database of d-band center values for many bimetallic surfaces.
The binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexene, typically follow the same trend as HBE. As shown in Figure 10b, DFT calculations reveal that the Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111) subsurface structures bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) surface structures. For example, DFT results indicate that both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111) than on Ni&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111), Pt(111), and Ni(111), suggesting that the subsurface Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111) structure should be more effective for the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the other three surfaces. This has been confirmed experimentally by comparing the hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene on these four surfaces using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), as shown in Figure 11. (27) As illustrated in the TPD peak area of the cyclohexane product, the subsurface Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111) structure shows the highest hydrogenation yield, with the desorption peak centered at a very low temperature of 203 K. Similar Pt-terminated bimetallic surface structures can be produced by depositing one monolayer of Pt on a Ni(111) substrate, which also possesses the novel low-temperature pathway for cyclohexene hydrogenation. (53)
The trend in the DFT calculations in Figure 10b also shows that the binding energies of cyclohexene on Pt&ndash;Co&ndash;Pt(111) and Pt&ndash;Fe&ndash;Pt(111) are even weaker than that on Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111). Although this might suggest that the former two surfaces would be more active toward hydrogenation than Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111); one should keep in mind that the adsorption of cyclohexene needs to be strong enough for the hydrogenation to take place. One would therefore expect to observe a volcano relationship for the hydrogenation activity as the d-band center moves further away from the Fermi level, i.e., when the adsorption of cyclohexene becomes too weak for hydrogenation to occur. This is verified experimentally in the results shown in Figure 11b. The hydrogenation yield from TPD measurements is the highest on Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111) but starts to decrease on the Pt&ndash;Co&ndash;Pt(111) and Pt&ndash;Fe&ndash;Pt(111) surfaces, where the binding of cyclohexene becomes too weak for hydrogenation to occur. On the other side of the volcano curve, the binding energies of cyclohexene on the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) surfaces are too strong, preventing the effective hydrogenation of cyclohexene. (27)
Extension to Polycrystalline Ni/Pt Films
Polycrystalline bimetallic films provide a potential way to bridge the materials gap between single-crystal surfaces and supported catalysts. As illustrated earlier in Figure 4, it is possible to assume that the surface chemistry of a bimetallic nanoparticle should be dominated primarily by the first few atomic layers. It is also reasonable to assume that the chemistry of the individual crystal facets on the nanoparticle (primarily (111) and (100) for an fcc nanoparticle) can be approximated by their respective single-crystal extension. (33) This is verified by studying cyclohexene hydrogenation on Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt subsurface structures prepared on a polycrystalline Pt film consisting of mainly the (111) and (100) facets. (239) Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on a Pt foil at room temperature to produce the Ni&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt subsurface structure. (33) Similar to the corresponding single-crystal surfaces, the subsurface Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt polycrystalline structure shows significantly higher hydrogenation activity than that from the polycrystalline Pt and Ni surfaces. These results confirm the assumption that the trend observed on single-crystal bimetallic surfaces can be extended to the polycrystalline counterparts.
Reactor Evaluation of Supported Ni/Pt Catalysts
Supported monometallic Pt and bimetallic Pt&ndash;Ni and Pt&ndash;Co catalysts have been synthesized on γ-Al2O3 using the incipient wetness method. (280, 303) Characterization of the catalysts by a variety of techniques, including EXAFS, confirms the formation of Pt&ndash;3d bimetallic bonds. As shown earlier in Figure 5, the Pt&ndash;Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is Pt-terminated and resembles the subsurface Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt structure. The Pt-terminated configuration is also consistent with results by Sedlacek et al. that the surfaces of Pt&ndash;Ni alloys are enriched in Pt when treated with H2, (304) as well as with findings reported by Arenas-Alatorre et al. for Pt&ndash;Ni catalysts supported on SiO2 (305) and by Mu et al. for Pt&ndash;Ni catalysts supported on graphite. (209) Because the Pt-terminated structure is thermodynamically stable in the presence of hydrogen (Figure 6), one would expect that the Pt&ndash;Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst should be very active for cyclohexene hydrogenation.
The supported catalysts were evaluated using both batch and flow reactors to determine the hydrogenation kinetics of cyclohexene at a low temperature of 303 K. The hydrogenation rate constants were determined to be 1.7, 21, and 24 min&ndash;1 for Pt/γ-Al2O3, Pt&ndash;Co/γ-Al2O3, and Pt&ndash;Ni/γ-Al2O3, respectively. (280) The trend observed in the rate constant for cyclohexene hydrogenation is consistent with that from the single-crystal surfaces for the same reaction, Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111) > Pt&ndash;Co&ndash;Pt(111) > Pt(111), as shown earlier in the volcano curve in Figure 11b. The similar trend between DFT predictions on single-crystal surfaces, UHV experimental studies on single-crystal and polycrystalline model surfaces, and reactor evaluation over supported catalysts provides an important demonstration of designing bimetallic catalysts from combined theoretical and experimental approaches.

The utilization of cyclohexene as an ideal probe molecule for investigating hydrogenation reactions, with emphasis on its industrial relevance, multiple reaction pathways, and its role in elucidating the effects of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity, has been established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.01.024\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.03.007\], \[10.1021/cr300096b\_7\], and \[10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001\] further elucidates the unique hydrogenation pathway observed on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, which is not present on either of the parent metal surfaces, providing insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The study of cyclohexene hydrogenation on bimetallic surfaces can guide the rational design of catalytic materials for industrial hydrogenation processes, as highlighted in reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.03.007\]. The distinct reaction pathways of cyclohexene on different catalysts can reveal how bimetallic surfaces modify the catalytic properties, leading to enhanced or altered hydrogenation activity and selectivity, as discussed in reference \[10.1016/j.susc.2004.03.032\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel bimetallic catalytic materials for hydrogenation reactions in industrial processes, guided by the rational design principles informed by the study of cyclohexene hydrogenation on bimetallic surfaces. The unique hydrogenation pathway observed on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, which results from the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, provides insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. This understanding can be leveraged to design catalysts with tailored properties for specific industrial applications. The study of cyclohexene hydrogenation on bimetallic surfaces can also guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications, considering the distinct reaction pathways of cyclohexene on different catalysts and how bimetallic surfaces modify the catalytic properties, leading to enhanced or altered hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The insights gained from the study of cyclohexene hydrogenation on bimetallic surfaces can also be applied to the development of catalysts for other hydrogenation reactions, potentially leading to the discovery of new catalytic materials with improved performance.
