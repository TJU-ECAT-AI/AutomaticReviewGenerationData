Cyclohexene's multifaceted role as a probe molecule for hydrogenation reactions is underscored by its sensitivity to the surface termination of Pt or Ni in bimetallic catalysts \[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.01.024\]. Its multiple reaction pathways, particularly the disproportionation pathway, offer insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.01.024\]. The unique hydrogenation pathway observed on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, not present on either parent metal surfaces, reveals the enhanced catalytic properties of bimetallic systems compared to monometallic materials \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.03.007\]. The weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface leads to a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway, demonstrating the enhanced catalytic properties of bimetallic systems \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.03.007\]. Comparative studies of cyclohexene's reaction pathways provide opportunities to determine how the formation of bimetallic bonds affects hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes \[10.1021/cr300096b_7\]. Cyclohexene's ability to undergo self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation on bimetallic catalysts like Ni/Pt(111) and PtNiPt(111), which are not observed on parent metals, confirms its role as an ideal probe molecule \[10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001\]. The correlation of self-hydrogenation activity with the surface d-band center of MBS structures is further confirmed by experimental results, providing insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes \[10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001\]. Cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and decomposition, allow researchers to understand the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons \[10.1016/j.susc.2004.03.032\]. The hydrogenation of cyclohexene was used as a probe reaction to demonstrate the enhanced hydrogenation activity toward the CC bond on the bimetallic catalysts, consistent with predictions from surface science studies \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.08.016\].

Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.03.007\], \[10.1021/cr300096b_7\], and \[10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001\] further elucidates the intricate relationship between cyclohexene's reaction pathways and the catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces.

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the rational design of novel bimetallic catalytic materials for hydrogenation reactions in industrial processes, guided by the unique hydrogenation pathway observed on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure. This pathway, which results from the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, provides insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The study of cyclohexene hydrogenation on bimetallic surfaces can guide the rational design of catalytic materials for industrial hydrogenation processes. The distinct reaction pathways of cyclohexene on different catalysts can reveal how bimetallic surfaces modify the catalytic properties, leading to enhanced or altered hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The different reaction pathways of cyclohexene allow researchers to understand the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. The correlation of self-hydrogenation activity with the surface d-band center of MBS structures is further confirmed by experimental results. These insights can help understand the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

Cyclohexene, a cyclic hydrocarbon, serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its sensitivity to the surface termination of Pt or Ni in bimetallic catalysts \[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.01.024\]. Its multiple reaction pathways, including disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.01.024\]. The unique hydrogenation pathway observed on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, which is not present on either of the parent metal surfaces, demonstrates the enhanced catalytic properties of bimetallic systems compared to monometallic materials \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.03.007\]. The weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface leads to a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway, revealing the effects of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation reactions in industrial processes \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.03.007\]. Comparative studies of cyclohexene's reaction pathways can provide insights into how the formation of bimetallic bonds affects hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes \[10.1021/cr300096b_7\]. The distinct reaction pathways of cyclohexene on different catalysts can reveal how bimetallic surfaces modify the catalytic properties, leading to enhanced or altered hydrogenation activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.susc.2004.03.032\]. The hydrogenation of cyclohexene was used as a probe reaction to demonstrate the enhanced hydrogenation activity toward the CC bond on the bimetallic catalysts, as predicted from surface science studies \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.08.016\]. The PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher activity for cyclohexene hydrogenation than PtCo catalysts, consistent with predictions from surface science studies \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.08.016\].
