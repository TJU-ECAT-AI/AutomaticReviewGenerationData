[1] "The unique activity of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer toward cyclohexene is further confirmed using HREELS [143] , as shown in Fig. 39 . The vibrational spectrum of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). Based on detailed vibrational assignment [143] , the species on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface is weakly π -bonded cyclohexene. In contrast, the surface species is assigned as strongly di- σ bonded cyclohexene on Pt(111) and the benzene intermediate on Ni(111). These assignments were further confirmed from the polarization-dependence Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) measurements [143] . Results from both HREELS and NEXAFS measurements indicate that the interaction of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is much weaker than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111), responsible for the onset of the self-hydrogenation pathway on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure."

[2] "The DFT calculations indicate that both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111), predicting that the subsurface structure should be more effective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface structure. This is confirmed experimentally in Fig. 41 , which shows the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed on these two surfaces, with the results from Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film also being included for comparison [87] . The hydrogenation yield, based on peak areas of cyclohexane (84 amu), is much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111)."

[3] "The DFT calculations also reveal that other subsurface MBS structures, such as PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111), also bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding surface monolayer structures. The trends are similar to those shown earlier for atomic H ( Fig. 16 ), atomic O ( Fig. 24 ), ethylene, 1-butene ( Fig. 36 ), and 1-hexene, further confirming that the surface d-band center is a reliable parameter in predicting the binding energies of both atomic and molecular adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces."

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its unique vibrational spectrum on PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer, which is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The species on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface is weakly π-bonded cyclohexene, while the surface species is assigned as strongly di-σ bonded cyclohexene on Pt(111) and the benzene intermediate on Ni(111). This indicates that the interaction of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is much weaker than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111), responsible for the onset of the self-hydrogenation pathway on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. The DFT calculations also reveal that other subsurface MBS structures, such as PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111), also bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding surface monolayer structures. The DFT calculations indicate that both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111), predicting that the subsurface structure should be more effective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface structure. This is confirmed experimentally, with the hydrogenation yield being much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111). These insights can provide guidance for the rational design of bimetallic catalysts with enhanced hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

1.环己烯作为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，是因为它在PtNiPt(111)亚表面单层上的独特振动光谱，与Pt(111)或Ni(111)上的明显不同。PtNiPt(111)亚表面上的物种是弱π键合的环己烯，而Pt(111)上的表面物种被指定为强di-σ键合的环己烯，Ni(111)上的则是苯中间体。这表明环己烯在PtNiPt(111)上的相互作用远弱于Pt(111)或Ni(111)，是PtNiPt(111)亚表面MBS结构上自加氢途径启动的原因。DFT计算还显示，其他亚表面MBS结构，如PtCoPt(111)和PtFePt(111)，与Pt(111)和相应的表面单层结构相比，也与环己烯的结合更弱。DFT计算表明，环己烯和原子氢在PtNiPt(111)上的结合比在NiPt(111)上更弱，预测亚表面结构在环己烯的加氢反应中应比表面结构更有效。这在实验中得到了证实，PtNiPt(111)上的加氢产率远高于NiPt(111)。这些见解可以为工业过程中具有增强加氢活性和选择性的双金属催化剂的合理设计提供指导。
