[1] "The low-temperature self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Ni /Pt(111) are among the earliest examples that demonstrate the novel reaction pathways that are not present on parent metals [137] ."

[2] "The unique activity of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer toward cyclohexene is further confirmed using HREELS [143] , as shown in Fig. 39 ."

[3] "The DFT calculations indicate that both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111), predicting that the subsurface structure should be more effective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface structure."

[4] "The DFT calculations also reveal that other subsurface MBS structures, such as PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111), also bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding surface monolayer structures."

[5] "The results in Fig. 43 further confirm the correlation of the self-hydrogenation activity with the value of the surface d-band center of MBS structures."

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation on bimetallic catalysts like Ni/Pt(111) and PtNiPt(111), which are not observed on parent metals. The unique activity of PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer toward cyclohexene is confirmed by HREELS and DFT calculations, showing that cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111). This suggests that the subsurface structure is more effective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface structure. Other subsurface MBS structures like PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) also bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding surface monolayer structures. The correlation of self-hydrogenation activity with the surface d-band center of MBS structures is further confirmed by experimental results. These insights can help understand the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

1.环己烯作为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，是因为它能在像Ni/Pt(111)和PtNiPt(111)这样的双金属催化剂上进行自加氢和加氢反应，而在单一金属上则观察不到这些反应。PtNiPt(111)亚表面单层对环己烯的独特活性通过HREELS和DFT计算得到证实，表明环己烯和原子氢在PtNiPt(111)上的结合比在NiPt(111)上更弱。这表明亚表面结构在环己烯的加氢反应中比表面结构更有效。其他亚表面MBS结构如PtCoPt(111)和PtFePt(111)也比Pt(111)和相应的表面单层结构与环己烯结合更弱。自加氢活性与MBS结构表面d带中心值的关联通过实验结果进一步得到证实。这些见解有助于理解双金属催化剂对工业过程中加氢活性和选择性的影响。
