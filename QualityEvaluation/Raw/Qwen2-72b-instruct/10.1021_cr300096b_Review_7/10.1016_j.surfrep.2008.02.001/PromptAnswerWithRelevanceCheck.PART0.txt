[1] "The unique activity of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer toward cyclohexene is further confirmed using HREELS [143] , as shown in Fig. 39 . The vibrational spectrum of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). Based on detailed vibrational assignment [143] , the species on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface is weakly π -bonded cyclohexene. In contrast, the surface species is assigned as strongly di- σ bonded cyclohexene on Pt(111) and the benzene intermediate on Ni(111). These assignments were further confirmed from the polarization-dependence Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) measurements [143] . Results from both HREELS and NEXAFS measurements indicate that the interaction of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is much weaker than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111), responsible for the onset of the self-hydrogenation pathway on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure."

[2] "The DFT calculations indicate that both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111), predicting that the subsurface structure should be more effective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface structure. This is confirmed experimentally in Fig. 41 , which shows the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed on these two surfaces, with the results from Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film also being included for comparison [87] . The hydrogenation yield, based on peak areas of cyclohexane (84 amu), is much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111)."

[3] "The DFT calculations also reveal that other subsurface MBS structures, such as PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111), also bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding surface monolayer structures. The trends are similar to those shown earlier for atomic H ( Fig. 16 ), atomic O ( Fig. 24 ), ethylene, 1-butene ( Fig. 36 ), and 1-hexene, further confirming that the surface d-band center is a reliable parameter in predicting the binding energies of both atomic and molecular adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces."

1.环己烯作为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，是因为它在PtNiPt(111)亚表面单层上的独特振动光谱与在Pt(111)或Ni(111)上的显著不同。PtNiPt(111)亚表面上的物种是弱π键合的环己烯，而Pt(111)表面上的物种是强di-σ键合的环己烯，Ni(111)上的则是苯中间体。这些分配通过极化依赖的近边X射线吸收精细结构(NEXAFS)测量进一步得到证实。环己烯在PtNiPt(111)上的相互作用远弱于在Pt(111)或Ni(111)上，这是PtNiPt(111)亚表面MBS结构上自加氢途径开始的原因。DFT计算表明，环己烯和原子氢在PtNiPt(111)上比在NiPt(111)上更弱地结合，预测亚表面结构在环己烯的加氢中应比表面结构更有效。这在实验中得到证实，PtNiPt(111)上的加氢产率远高于NiPt(111)。DFT计算还显示，其他亚表面MBS结构，如PtCoPt(111)和PtFePt(111)，也比Pt(111)和相应的表面单层结构更弱地结合环己烯，进一步证实了表面d带中心在预测双金属表面上原子和分子吸附物的结合能方面的可靠性。环己烯的多种反应途径提供了关于双金属催化剂对工业过程中加氢活性和选择性影响的见解。

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its unique vibrational spectrum on PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer, which is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The weak π-bonded cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) indicates a much weaker interaction compared to the strongly di-σ bonded cyclohexene on Pt(111) and the benzene intermediate on Ni(111). This difference in interaction strength is responsible for the onset of the self-hydrogenation pathway on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene, including self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation, provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The DFT calculations predict that the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure should be more effective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface NiPt(111) structure, which is confirmed experimentally by the higher hydrogenation yield on PtNiPt(111). The DFT calculations also reveal that other subsurface MBS structures, such as PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111), bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding surface monolayer structures, further confirming the reliability of the surface d-band center in predicting binding energies of adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces.

1.环己烯作为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，是因为它在PtNiPt(111)亚表面单层上的独特振动光谱，与在Pt(111)或Ni(111)上的光谱显著不同。在PtNiPt(111)上，弱π键合的环己烯表明与在Pt(111)上的强di-σ键合环己烯和在Ni(111)上的苯中间体相比，相互作用要弱得多。这种相互作用强度的差异是PtNiPt(111)亚表面MBS结构上自加氢途径出现的原因。环己烯的多种反应途径，包括自加氢和加氢，为理解双金属催化剂对加氢活性和选择性的影响提供了见解。DFT计算预测，亚表面PtNiPt(111)结构在环己烯加氢方面应比表面NiPt(111)结构更有效，这一预测在实验中得到了证实，PtNiPt(111)上的加氢产率更高。DFT计算还显示，其他亚表面MBS结构，如PtCoPt(111)和PtFePt(111)，与环己烯的结合比Pt(111)和相应的表面单层结构更弱，进一步证实了表面d带中心在预测双金属表面上吸附物结合能方面的可靠性。

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation on bimetallic catalysts like Ni/Pt(111), demonstrating reaction pathways not present on parent metals. The unique activity of subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) toward cyclohexene, confirmed by HREELS, shows that cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on this structure than on NiPt(111). This suggests that subsurface structures can be more effective for hydrogenation than surface structures. DFT calculations reveal that other subsurface MBS structures, such as PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111), also bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and corresponding surface monolayers. The correlation of self-hydrogenation activity with the surface d-band center of MBS structures, as demonstrated by cyclohexene, provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts can influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

1.环己烯作为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，是因为它能在像Ni/Pt(111)这样的双金属催化剂上进行自加氢和加氢反应，展示了在单一金属上不存在的反应途径。HREELS证实，PtNiPt(111)的次表面单层对环己烯具有独特的活性，表明环己烯和原子氢在这个结构上比在NiPt(111)上更弱地结合。这表明次表面结构在加氢反应中可能比表面结构更有效。DFT计算显示，其他次表面MBS结构，如PtCoPt(111)和PtFePt(111)，也比Pt(111)和相应的表面单层更弱地结合环己烯。环己烯与MBS结构的表面d带中心值之间的自加氢活性相关性，为双金属催化剂如何影响工业过程中的加氢活性和选择性提供了见解。
