[1] "The unique activity of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer toward cyclohexene is further confirmed using HREELS [143] , as shown in Fig. 39 . The vibrational spectrum of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). Based on detailed vibrational assignment [143] , the species on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface is weakly π -bonded cyclohexene. In contrast, the surface species is assigned as strongly di- σ bonded cyclohexene on Pt(111) and the benzene intermediate on Ni(111). These assignments were further confirmed from the polarization-dependence Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) measurements [143] . Results from both HREELS and NEXAFS measurements indicate that the interaction of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is much weaker than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111), responsible for the onset of the self-hydrogenation pathway on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure."

[2] "The DFT calculations indicate that both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111), predicting that the subsurface structure should be more effective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface structure. This is confirmed experimentally in Fig. 41 , which shows the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed on these two surfaces, with the results from Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film also being included for comparison [87] . The hydrogenation yield, based on peak areas of cyclohexane (84 amu), is much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111)."

[3] "The DFT calculations also reveal that other subsurface MBS structures, such as PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111), also bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding surface monolayer structures. The trends are similar to those shown earlier for atomic H ( Fig. 16 ), atomic O ( Fig. 24 ), ethylene, 1-butene ( Fig. 36 ), and 1-hexene, further confirming that the surface d-band center is a reliable parameter in predicting the binding energies of both atomic and molecular adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces."

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its unique vibrational spectrum on PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer, which is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The species on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface is weakly π-bonded cyclohexene, while the surface species is strongly di-σ bonded cyclohexene on Pt(111) and the benzene intermediate on Ni(111). These assignments were further confirmed by polarization-dependence Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) measurements. The interaction of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is much weaker than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111), responsible for the onset of the self-hydrogenation pathway on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. The DFT calculations indicate that both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111), predicting that the subsurface structure should be more effective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface structure. This is confirmed experimentally, with the hydrogenation yield being much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111). The DFT calculations also reveal that other subsurface MBS structures, such as PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111), also bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding surface monolayer structures, further confirming the reliability of the surface d-band center in predicting the binding energies of both atomic and molecular adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces. The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene provide insights about the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

1.环己烯作为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，是因为它在PtNiPt(111)亚表面单层上的独特振动光谱与在Pt(111)或Ni(111)上的显著不同。PtNiPt(111)亚表面上的物种是弱π键合的环己烯，而Pt(111)表面上的物种是强di-σ键合的环己烯，Ni(111)上的则是苯中间体。这些分配通过极化依赖的近边X射线吸收精细结构(NEXAFS)测量进一步得到证实。环己烯在PtNiPt(111)上的相互作用远弱于在Pt(111)或Ni(111)上，这是PtNiPt(111)亚表面MBS结构上自加氢途径开始的原因。DFT计算表明，环己烯和原子氢在PtNiPt(111)上比在NiPt(111)上更弱地结合，预测亚表面结构在环己烯的加氢中应比表面结构更有效。这在实验中得到证实，PtNiPt(111)上的加氢产率远高于NiPt(111)。DFT计算还显示，其他亚表面MBS结构，如PtCoPt(111)和PtFePt(111)，也比Pt(111)和相应的表面单层结构更弱地结合环己烯，进一步证实了表面d带中心在预测双金属表面上原子和分子吸附物的结合能方面的可靠性。环己烯的多种反应途径提供了关于双金属催化剂对工业过程中加氢活性和选择性影响的见解。
