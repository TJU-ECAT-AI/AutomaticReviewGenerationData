1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation on bimetallic catalysts like Ni/Pt(111), demonstrating reaction pathways not present on parent metals. The unique activity of subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) toward cyclohexene, confirmed by HREELS, shows that cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on this structure than on NiPt(111). This suggests that subsurface structures can be more effective for hydrogenation than surface structures. DFT calculations reveal that other subsurface MBS structures, such as PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111), also bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and corresponding surface monolayers. The correlation of self-hydrogenation activity with the surface d-band center of MBS structures, as demonstrated by cyclohexene, provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts can influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

1.环己烯作为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，是因为它能在像Ni/Pt(111)这样的双金属催化剂上进行自加氢和加氢反应，展示了在单一金属上不存在的反应途径。HREELS证实，PtNiPt(111)的次表面单层对环己烯具有独特的活性，表明环己烯和原子氢在这个结构上比在NiPt(111)上更弱地结合。这表明次表面结构在加氢反应中可能比表面结构更有效。DFT计算显示，其他次表面MBS结构，如PtCoPt(111)和PtFePt(111)，也比Pt(111)和相应的表面单层更弱地结合环己烯。环己烯与MBS结构的表面d带中心值之间的自加氢活性相关性，为双金属催化剂如何影响工业过程中的加氢活性和选择性提供了见解。
