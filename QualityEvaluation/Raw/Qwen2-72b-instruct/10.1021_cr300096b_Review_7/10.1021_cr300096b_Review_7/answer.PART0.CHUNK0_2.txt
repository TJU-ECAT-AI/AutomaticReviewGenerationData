[1] "Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry."

[2] "Furthermore, cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation."

[3] "Comparative studies of these reaction pathways provide an opportunity to determine how the formation of bimetallic bonds affects the hydrogenation activity and selectivity."

1.Cyclohexene is a probe molecule for studying hydrogenation because it is a key intermediate in refinery and petrochemical processes and is a precursor for many chemicals. Its multiple reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation, and hydrogenation, allow for the investigation of how bimetallic bonds influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.
