Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<quotes>

[1] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

[2] "Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo disproportionation, which is sensitive to the surface termination of the catalyst by Pt or Ni. This allows insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its sensitivity to the surface termination of bimetallic catalysts by Pt or Ni. Its multiple reaction pathways, particularly the disproportionation pathway, provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. By comparing the activity of different catalysts, researchers can understand how the composition and structure of bimetallic surfaces affect the catalytic performance in industrial hydrogenation processes.
