[1] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

[2] "Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence."

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its sensitivity to the surface termination of bimetallic catalysts by Pt or Ni. Its multiple reaction pathways, particularly the disproportionation pathway, provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. By comparing the activity of different catalysts, researchers can understand how the composition and structure of bimetallic surfaces affect the catalytic performance in industrial hydrogenation processes.
