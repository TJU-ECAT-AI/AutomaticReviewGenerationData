[1] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

[2] "Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence."

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo disproportionation, which is sensitive to the surface termination of the catalyst by Pt or Ni. This allows insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.
