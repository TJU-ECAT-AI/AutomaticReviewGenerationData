1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and decomposition. These pathways provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. The distinct reaction pathways of cyclohexene on different catalysts can reveal how bimetallic surfaces modify the catalytic properties, leading to enhanced or altered hydrogenation activity and selectivity.
