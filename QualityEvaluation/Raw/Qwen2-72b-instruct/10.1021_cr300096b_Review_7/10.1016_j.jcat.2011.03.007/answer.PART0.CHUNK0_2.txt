[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene has previously been used as a probe reaction to determine the novel properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic system. The hydrogenation pathway is present only on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, due to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface [9,14]."

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways on bimetallic catalysts. Its hydrogenation activity and selectivity can provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation reactions in industrial processes. The unique hydrogenation pathway observed on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, characterized by weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, demonstrates the enhanced catalytic properties of bimetallic systems compared to monometallic materials.
