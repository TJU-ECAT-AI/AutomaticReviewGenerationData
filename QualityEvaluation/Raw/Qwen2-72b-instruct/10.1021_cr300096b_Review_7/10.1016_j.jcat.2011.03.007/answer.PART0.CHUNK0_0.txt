[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene has previously been used as a probe reaction to determine the novel properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic system. The hydrogenation pathway is present only on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, due to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface [9,14]."

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways on bimetallic catalysts. The unique hydrogenation pathway observed on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, which is not present on either of the parent metal surfaces, provides insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface leads to a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway, demonstrating the enhanced catalytic properties of bimetallic systems compared to monometallic materials.
