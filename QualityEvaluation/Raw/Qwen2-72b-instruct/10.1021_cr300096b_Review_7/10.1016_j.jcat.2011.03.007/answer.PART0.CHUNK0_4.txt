[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene has previously been used as a probe reaction to determine the novel properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic system. The hydrogenation pathway is present only on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, due to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface [9,14]."

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways on bimetallic catalysts. The unique hydrogenation pathway observed on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, which results from the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, provides insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. This can guide the rational design of novel bimetallic catalytic materials for hydrogenation reactions in industrial processes.

1.环己烯因其在双金属催化剂上能够进行多种反应途径，因此是研究加氢反应的理想探针分子。在PtNiPt(1 1 1)亚表面结构上观察到的独特加氢途径，源于原子氢和环己烯的较弱结合，为双金属催化剂对加氢活性和选择性的影响提供了见解。这可以指导新型双金属催化材料在工业过程中的加氢反应的合理设计。
