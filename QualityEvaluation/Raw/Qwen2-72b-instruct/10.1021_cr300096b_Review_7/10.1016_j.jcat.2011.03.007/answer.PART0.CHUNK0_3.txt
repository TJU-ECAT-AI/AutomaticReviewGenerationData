[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene has previously been used as a probe reaction to determine the novel properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic system. The hydrogenation pathway is present only on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, due to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface [9,14]."

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and decomposition. These pathways provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The unique hydrogenation pathway observed on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, which is not present on either of the parent metal surfaces, demonstrates the enhanced catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts. This pathway is attributed to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface, leading to low-temperature hydrogenation. The study of cyclohexene hydrogenation on bimetallic surfaces can guide the rational design of catalytic materials for industrial hydrogenation processes.

1.环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，是因为它能够经历多种反应途径，包括氢化、脱氢和分解。这些途径提供了对双金属催化剂对氢化活性和选择性影响的见解。在PtNiPt(1 1 1)亚表面结构上观察到的独特氢化途径，不在任一亲本金属表面上出现，展示了双金属催化剂的增强催化性能。这一途径归因于该表面上原子氢和环己烯的较弱结合，导致低温氢化。对双金属表面上环己烯氢化的研究可以指导工业氢化过程催化材料的合理设计。
