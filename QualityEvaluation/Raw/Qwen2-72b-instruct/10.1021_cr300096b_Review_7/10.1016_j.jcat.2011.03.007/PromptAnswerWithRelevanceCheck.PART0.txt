[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene has previously been used as a probe reaction to determine the novel properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic system. The hydrogenation pathway is present only on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, due to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface [9,14]."

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways on bimetallic catalysts. The unique hydrogenation pathway observed on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, which is not present on either of the parent metal surfaces, provides insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface leads to a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway, demonstrating the enhanced catalytic properties of bimetallic systems compared to monometallic materials.

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways on bimetallic catalysts. Its hydrogenation pathway is exclusive to the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, where atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene bond more weakly. This provides insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and decomposition. These pathways provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The unique hydrogenation pathway observed on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, which is not present on either of the parent metal surfaces, demonstrates the enhanced catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts. This pathway is attributed to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface, leading to low-temperature hydrogenation. The study of cyclohexene hydrogenation on bimetallic surfaces can guide the rational design of catalytic materials for industrial hydrogenation processes.
