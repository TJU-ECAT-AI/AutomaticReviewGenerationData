[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene has previously been used as a probe reaction to determine the novel properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic system. The hydrogenation pathway is present only on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, due to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface [9,14]."

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways on bimetallic catalysts. Its hydrogenation pathway is exclusive to the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, where atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene bond more weakly. This provides insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

1.环己烯因其在双金属催化剂上能够进行多种反应路径，因此是研究加氢反应的理想探针分子。其加氢路径仅存在于PtNiPt(1 1 1)亚表面结构上，因为在这个表面上，原子氢和环己烯的结合更弱。这为了解双金属催化剂对工业过程中加氢活性和选择性的影响提供了见解。
