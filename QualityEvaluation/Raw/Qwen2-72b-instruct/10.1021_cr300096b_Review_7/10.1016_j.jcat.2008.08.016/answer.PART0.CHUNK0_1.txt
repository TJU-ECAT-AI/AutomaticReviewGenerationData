1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple reaction pathways, which can provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. The hydrogenation of cyclohexene was used as a probe reaction to demonstrate the enhanced hydrogenation activity toward the CC bond on the bimetallic catalysts, as predicted from the surface science studies. The PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher activity for cyclohexene hydrogenation than PtCo catalysts, consistent with predictions from surface science studies.
