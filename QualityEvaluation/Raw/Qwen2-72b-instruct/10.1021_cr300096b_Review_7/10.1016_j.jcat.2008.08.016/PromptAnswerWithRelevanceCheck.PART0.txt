Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple reaction pathways, which can provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. The hydrogenation of cyclohexene was used as a probe reaction to demonstrate the enhanced hydrogenation activity toward the CC bond on the bimetallic catalysts, as predicted from the surface science studies. The PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher activity for cyclohexene hydrogenation than PtCo catalysts, consistent with predictions from surface science studies.

1.环己烯作为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，因其具有多种反应途径，可以提供关于双金属催化剂对工业过程中加氢活性和选择性影响的见解。环己烯的加氢反应被用作探针反应，以证明双金属催化剂对CC键的增强加氢活性，这与表面科学研究的预测一致。PtNi双金属催化剂在环己烯加氢方面表现出比PtCo催化剂更高的活性，这与表面科学研究的预测一致。
