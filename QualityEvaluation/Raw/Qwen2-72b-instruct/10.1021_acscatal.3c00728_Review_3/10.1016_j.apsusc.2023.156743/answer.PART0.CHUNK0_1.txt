1.The bowl-like structures of B-based materials have a large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space, which enhance their potential in catalysis, environmental remediation, and energy storage. The BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure is constructed from numerous oriented bowl-like blocks, forming a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. The size of the openings can be adjusted by changing the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives, which is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The h-BN generated can enhance the gas trapping capacity of the liquid B2O3 environment foam, allowing for precise control of the pressure differential between large and small bubbles, which favors the oriented opening of the bowl-like structure. The pure h-BN monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure, prepared at higher temperatures, possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure and exhibits excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

1.硼基材料的碗状结构具有大表面积、多孔结构和缓冲空腔空间，这增强了其在催化、环境修复和能源存储领域的潜力。BN@BPO4自支撑泡沫具有定向碗状结构，由大量定向碗状块体构成，形成双层结构，开口面相对。通过改变Cu(NO3)2添加剂的量，可以调整开口的大小，这有利于六方氮化硼（h-BN）的生产。我们认为生成的h-BN可以增强液态B2O3环境泡沫的气体捕获能力，精确控制大泡和小泡之间的压力差，从而有利于碗状结构的定向开口。此外，纯h-BN泡沫在较高温度下制备，具有定向碗状结构，具有多模式分级多孔结构，在催化丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯和有机污染物去除方面表现出优异的性能。
