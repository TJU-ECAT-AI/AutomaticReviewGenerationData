Boron-based materials, particularly those featuring three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites within porous frameworks, have garnered significant attention in the field of catalysis due to their unique structural characteristics and catalytic advantages. These materials offer a high surface area and tunable pore sizes, which facilitate the efficient diffusion of reactants and products. The 3-D dispersion of active sites ensures a high density of catalytic centers, maximizing the material's catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the incorporation of boron into the framework introduces additional electronic effects that can modulate the reactivity of the active sites, enhancing the selectivity and activity of the catalyst. Various methods have been developed for the incorporation of boron into porous materials, including co-condensation, post-synthetic modification, and templating strategies, each offering distinct advantages in terms of control over the structure and functionality of the final material. These B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites have shown promise in a range of catalytic applications, from petrochemical processing to the conversion of biomass and the production of fine chemicals, demonstrating their potential to revolutionize industrial catalysis.
