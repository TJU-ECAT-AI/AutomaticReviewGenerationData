[1] "In this study, we prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method. The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be tuned in the range of 150300nm through h-BN loading change."
[2] "The obtained nanofibrous catalysts exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date."
[3] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."
[4] "The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process."
[5] "There is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."
[6] "The exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contained more defects and edge sites with abundant BOH groups, which facilitated the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution."
[7] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction."
[8] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."

1.本研究通过电纺丝方法制备了一维纳米纤维催化剂，由六方氮化硼/二氧化硅（h-BN/SiO2）组成。关键在于制备由剥离的h-BN组成的均匀溶胶。通过改变h-BN的负载量，纳米纤维催化剂的直径可以在150300nm范围内调节。获得的纳米纤维催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出12.4%的丙烷转化率和85.1%的丙烯选择性，具有显著的24.9golefinsgBN1h1的烯烃生产率，比迄今为止报道的块体ODHP催化剂高出5倍以上。一维纳米材料因其有利于物质传输和具有高活性位点暴露的潜力，在催化应用中引起了广泛关注。通过改变电纺丝过程中的条件，可以轻松调整电纺丝方法制备的纳米纤维的化学和物理性质。在电纺丝方法制备的纳米催化剂中，纳米颗粒和载体之间有良好的相互作用，进一步保证了它们的活性、选择性和长期稳定性。通过球磨剥离的h-BN含有更多的缺陷和边缘位点，具有丰富的BOH基团，这有利于h-BN在水溶液中的分散。h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在ODHP反应中明显表现出比块体h-BN催化剂更高的丙烷转化率。h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂的较高活性主要是因为一维结构促进了活性位点的暴露，参与催化并实现了更高的转化。
