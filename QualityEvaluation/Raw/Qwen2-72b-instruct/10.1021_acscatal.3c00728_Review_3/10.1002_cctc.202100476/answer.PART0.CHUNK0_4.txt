[1] "In this study, we prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method. The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be tuned in the range of 150300nm through h-BN loading change."
[2] "The obtained nanofibrous catalysts exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date."
[3] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."
[4] "The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process."
[5] "Meanwhile, there is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."
[6] "The exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contained more defects and edge sites with abundant BOH groups, which facilitated the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution."
[7] "The obtained spinning solution was ejected from the needle at a certain rate through a syringe pump. Under the action of electric field force, the charged spinning solution breaks through its surface tension to form the Taylor cone. Then, with the solvent instantly evaporated, the dried h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber was collected on the aluminum foil."
[8] "The nanofibers with varying h-BN loadings were prepared via the addition of different weight exfoliated h-BN. After calcination at 600C, similar fibrous morphology was observed from SEM images."
[9] "The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure2fh) showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support."
[10] "The chemical structure of the prepared nanofiber catalysts before and after calcination was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy."
[11] "The XRD patterns of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts with different h-BN loadings were shown in Figure3c. The broad diffraction peak around 22.6 suggested the SiO2 in the nanofibers exhibited amorphous phase."
[12] "The catalytic performance of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with different h-BN loadings in the ODHP reaction was investigated."
[13] "The propane conversion increased with the reaction temperature increasing, typically, as the temperature increased from 480 to 510C, the propane conversion of h-BN (7wt%)/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst increased from 3.6% to 22.2%."
[14] "The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion."
[15] "To illustrate the role of the one-dimensional structure of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst on the activity, a controlled experiment was performed by using exfoliated h-BN powder as catalyst."
[16] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."
[17] "The catalyst stability was evaluated through a time-on-stream experiment performed at 500C and the result was shown in Figure5b. The conversion of propane stabilized at 13%, with the selectivity of propylene and ethylene stabilized at 84% and 7% during the 500min test."
[18] "One of the most important requirements for commercially attractive ODHP catalysts is their ability to achieve a high productivity of olefins."
[19] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction."

1.本研究通过电纺丝方法制备了一维六方氮化硼/二氧化硅(h-BN/SiO2)纳米纤维催化剂，该催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出12.4%的丙烷转化率和85.1%的丙烯选择性，具有显著的24.9golefinsgBN1h1烯烃生产力，比迄今为止报道的块体ODHP催化剂高出5倍以上。一维纳米材料因其有利于物质传输和潜在的高活性位点暴露，在催化应用中引起了广泛关注。通过电纺丝方法制备的纳米纤维的化学和物理性质可以通过改变电纺丝过程中的条件轻松调整。在通过电纺丝方法制备的纳米催化剂中，纳米颗粒和载体之间有良好的相互作用，进一步确保了它们的活性、选择性和长期稳定性。通过球磨制备的剥离h-BN含有更多的缺陷和边缘位点，具有丰富的BOH基团，这有利于h-BN在水溶液中的分散。获得的纺丝溶液通过注射泵以一定速率从针头喷射。在电场力的作用下，带电的纺丝溶液突破其表面张力形成泰勒锥。然后，随着溶剂瞬间蒸发，在铝箔上收集干燥的h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维。通过添加不同重量的剥离h-BN制备了不同h-BN负载量的纳米纤维。在600C下煅烧后，从SEM图像中观察到类似的纤维形态。h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂的TEM和STEM-EDX映射图像显示，h-BN均匀分散在致密的SiO2载体上。通过FT-IR光谱研究了制备的纳米纤维催化剂在煅烧前后的化学结构。显示了不同h-BN负载量的h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂的XRD图谱，22.6附近的宽衍射峰表明纳米纤维中的SiO2呈无定形相。研究了不同h-BN负载量的h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在ODHP反应中的催化性能。随着反应温度的升高，丙烷转化率增加，通常，当温度从480升高到510C时，h-BN(7wt%)/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂的丙烷转化率从3.6%增加到22.2%。h-BN负载量对C3H8转化率有明显影响，随着h-BN负载量的增加，丙烷转化率线性增加，这证明转化率不受分子扩散的限制。为了说明h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂的一维结构在活性中的作用，通过使用剥离的h-BN粉末作为催化剂进行了一项对照实验。h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂的较高活性主要是因为一维结构促进了活性位点的暴露，参与催化并实现了更高的转化率。在500C下进行的在线实验评估了催化剂的稳定性，结果表明，丙烷转化率稳定在13%，丙烯和乙烯的选择性分别稳定在84%和7%，持续500min。对于商业上吸引人的ODHP催化剂，最重要的要求之一是它们能够实现高烯烃生产力。h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在500C和48000mlgcat1h1的空间速度下表现出24.9golefinsgBN1h1的生产力。这个值明显高于块体h-BN催化剂和大多数在ODHP反应中使用的硼基催化剂。
