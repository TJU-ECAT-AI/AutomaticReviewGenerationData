[1] "In this study, we prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method. The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be tuned in the range of 150300nm through h-BN loading change."
[2] "The obtained nanofibrous catalysts exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date."
[3] "The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process."
[4] "The abundant OH groups of SiO2 support can promote the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN."
[5] "The exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contained more defects and edge sites with abundant BOH groups,28 which facilitated the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution."
[6] "The one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."
[7] "The stability of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was superior, which was probably attributed to the SiO2 support anchoring effect."

1.The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for active site exposure and facilitating mass transfer. The electrospinning method used to incorporate B active components into these structures allows for the preparation of uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN, which can be tuned in diameter through h-BN loading change. This method also allows for easy adjustment of the chemical and physical properties of the nanofibers by changing conditions in the electrospinning process. The SiO2 support with abundant OH groups promotes the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN, which is crucial for the catalytic performance. The exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contains more defects and edge sites with abundant BOH groups, facilitating the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution. The one-dimensional structure of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst facilitates active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion. The stability of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst is superior, probably attributed to the SiO2 support anchoring effect.

1.具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特性，如h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂，通过提供大的表面积用于活性位点暴露和促进质量传递，从而增强催化性能。用于将B活性组分掺入这些结构中的电纺丝方法允许制备由剥离的h-BN组成的均匀溶胶，其直径可以通过h-BN负载变化进行调整。该方法还允许通过改变电纺丝过程中的条件轻松调整纳米纤维的化学和物理性质。SiO2支撑体上的大量OH基团促进了h-BN的锚定和分散性，这对于催化性能至关重要。通过球磨剥离的h-BN含有更多的缺陷和边缘位点，具有丰富的BOH基团，促进了h-BN在水溶液中的分散。h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂的一维结构促进了活性位点的暴露，参与催化并实现了更高的转化。h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂的稳定性优越，可能归因于SiO2支撑体的锚定效应。
