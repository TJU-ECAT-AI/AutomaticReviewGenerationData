[1] "In this study, we prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method. The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be tuned in the range of 150300nm through h-BN loading change."
[2] "The obtained h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene."
[3] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction."
[4] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."
[5] "The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."

1.The study prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method. The key to this preparation is to create uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be adjusted in the range of 150-300nm by changing the h-BN loading. The obtained h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst showed excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene. Compared with the bulk h-BN catalyst, the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst showed higher propane conversion in the ODHP reaction. The higher activity of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst is mainly due to the one-dimensional structure that facilitates active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion. The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed.

1.本研究通过电纺丝方法制备了一维纳米纤维催化剂，由六方氮化硼/二氧化硅（h-BN/SiO2）组成。制备的关键是创建由剥离的h-BN组成的均匀溶胶。通过改变h-BN的负载，纳米纤维催化剂的直径可以在150-300nm的范围内调整。获得的h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中表现出优异的活性、选择性和稳定性，具有显著的高丙烯生产力。与块状h-BN催化剂相比，h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在ODHP反应中显示出更高的丙烷转化率。h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂的较高活性主要是由于一维结构促进了活性位点的暴露，参与催化并实现了更高的转化。具有良好分散的h-BN的一维h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在高空间速度条件下表现出更好的催化效率，可能是因为它增强了质量传递，使活性位点容易暴露。
