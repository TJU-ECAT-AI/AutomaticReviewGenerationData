1.The study prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method. The key to the preparation is to create uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be adjusted in the range of 150-300nm through changes in h-BN loading. The obtained h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene. The nanofibers with varying h-BN loadings were prepared by adding different weights of exfoliated h-BN. After calcination at 600C, similar fibrous morphology was observed from SEM images. TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support. The chemical structure of the prepared nanofiber catalysts before and after calcination was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy. The XRD patterns of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts with different h-BN loadings were also analyzed. The catalytic performance of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with different h-BN loadings in the ODHP reaction was investigated. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1.

1.本研究通过电纺丝方法制备了一维纳米纤维催化剂，由六方氮化硼/二氧化硅（h-BN/SiO2）组成。制备的关键是创建由剥离的h-BN组成的均匀溶胶。通过改变h-BN的负载量，纳米纤维催化剂的直径可以在150-300nm的范围内调整。获得的h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中表现出优异的活性、选择性和稳定性，丙烯的生产率显著提高。通过添加不同重量的剥离h-BN，制备了具有不同h-BN负载量的纳米纤维。在600C下煅烧后，从SEM图像中观察到相似的纤维形态。TEM和STEM-EDX映射图像显示，h-BN在致密的SiO2支撑上均匀分散。通过FT-IR光谱研究了制备的纳米纤维催化剂在煅烧前后的化学结构。还分析了具有不同h-BN负载量的h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂的XRD图谱。研究了具有不同h-BN负载量的h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在ODHP反应中的催化性能。在ODHP反应中，h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂的丙烷转化率高于块状h-BN催化剂。在48000mlgcat1h1的空间速度下，h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在500C下的生产率为24.9golefinsgBN1h1。
