[1] "Ordered macroporous materials with rapid mass transport and enhanced active site accessibility are essential for achieving improved catalytic activity."
[2] "Boron phosphate crystals with a three-dimensionally interconnected ordered macroporous structure and a robust framework were fabricated and used as stable and selective catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane."
[3] "Due to the improved mass diffusion and higher number of exposed active sites in the ordered macroporous structure, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable olefin productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1, which is up to 2100 times higher than that of ODH catalysts reported to date."

[13] "The presence of abundant tetra-coordinated boron species in the catalysts had two consequences: on one hand, the boron sites were too crowded to be accessible to nucleophilic species; on the other hand, the electron density in the vicinity of the boron sites was enhanced."
[14] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst."
[15] "These results likely indicate that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane."

1.The ordered macroporous structure of boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by improving mass transport and increasing the accessibility of active sites. The synthesis of ordered macroporous boron phosphate (BPO4) was achieved through hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, using boric acid and phosphoric acid as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as the hard template. The ordered macroporous structure, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores, was an inverse replica of the template. The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited remarkable structural stability, and the content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane. The ordered macroporous structure and the presence of tri-coordinated boron species in the framework were effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH of propane.

1.具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中硼基材料的有序大孔结构通过改善传质和增加活性位点的可及性来增强催化性能。通过水热辅助合成和煅烧制备了有序大孔硼酸盐(BPO4)，其中硼酸和磷酸分别用作硼和磷的来源，而单分散聚苯并恶嗪聚合物球体用作硬模板。有序大孔结构，其相互连接的大孔的平均直径为200纳米，是模板的逆向复制品。三配位表面硼物种被鉴定为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)的活性催化位点。有序大孔BPO4框架显示出显著的结构稳定性，新鲜BPO4(OM)中三配位表面硼物种的含量从约41%增加到消耗催化剂中的51%，表明三配位硼物种对丙烷的ODH负责。有序大孔结构和框架中三配位硼物种的存在对于增强丙烷ODH的催化性能是有效的。
