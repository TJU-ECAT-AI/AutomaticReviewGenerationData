[1] "Ordered macroporous materials with rapid mass transport and enhanced active site accessibility are essential for achieving improved catalytic activity."
[2] "The synthesis of ordered macroporous BPO4 was conducted via hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a) ."
[3] "The ordered macroporous structure was an inverse replica of the template, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores ( Fig. 1(d) ); this diameter was slightly smaller than that of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, due to the thermal shrinkage of the spheres during the pyrolysis process."
[4] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."
[5] "The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was further confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis (Fig. S1); the cumulative pore volume vs. pore diameter curve showed a continuous increase in mercury uptake with decreasing pore diameter (i.e., increasing Hg intrusion pressure)."
[6] "The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield."
[7] "The macropore sizes and the intergrown nanocrystals were essentially unchanged."
[8] "The XRD pattern of the spent BPO4(OM) after the catalytic reaction ( Fig. 3(e) ) was identical to that of the fresh catalyst."
[9] "The peaks located at 1100 and 1620 cm1 were assigned to PO4 groups and PO bonds [ 34 ,35 ]. The transmittance peaks at 935 cm1 were attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of BO4 tetrahedra, and the peaks at 1350 cm1 were tentatively assigned to tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species."
[10] "The B and P species, with chemical shifts of ca. 5.3 and 31 ppm, respectively, were essentially retained after the reaction."
[11] "The atomic percentages of B in the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts were estimated to be ca. 33.1% and 33.7%, respectively. The B 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 193.6, 191.8, and 189.3 eV. These peaks were attributed to BO3 (tri-coordinated boron), BO4 (tetra-coordinated boron), and boron suboxides (BxOy, 1.5 < x/y < 3), respectively [ 36 ,37 ]."
[12] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst (Table S3). These results likely indicate that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane."

1.The ordered macroporous structure of BPO4 materials enhances catalytic performance by providing rapid mass transport and increased accessibility to active sites. The synthesis of these materials involves hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, using polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as a template. The macropores formed are interconnected and have an average diameter of 200 nm, slightly smaller than the template due to thermal shrinkage during pyrolysis. The macropores are bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter, confirming the presence of macroporosity in BPO4. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield. The structural stability of the BPO4(OM) catalyst is evidenced by unchanged macropore sizes and intergrown nanocrystals, as well as an identical XRD pattern before and after the catalytic reaction. The active sites are identified as tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species, which are retained after the reaction, as confirmed by FTIR, NMR, and XPS measurements. The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increases from 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating their role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1.具有有序大孔结构的BPO4材料通过提供快速的质量传递和增加活性位点的可及性来增强催化性能。这些材料的合成涉及水热辅助合成和煅烧，使用聚苯并嗪聚合物球作为模板。形成的大孔是相互连接的，平均直径为200纳米，由于在热解过程中模板的热收缩，略小于模板。大孔由直径为80纳米的墨水瓶颈状通道连接，证实了BPO4中存在大孔性。改善的动能扩散到反应位点导致大大改善的产量。BPO4(OM)催化剂的结构稳定性通过不变的大孔尺寸和交织的纳米晶体以及催化反应前后相同的XRD图案得到证明。活性位点被鉴定为三配位硼(BO3)物种，这些物种在反应后被保留，如FTIR、NMR和XPS测量所证实。三配位表面硼物种的含量从新鲜BPO4(OM)中的41%增加到耗尽催化剂中的51%，表明它们在丙烷氧化脱氢中的作用。
