          [1] "Ordered macroporous materials with rapid mass transport and enhanced active site accessibility are essential for achieving improved catalytic activity."
          [2] "Boron phosphate crystals with a three-dimensionally interconnected ordered macroporous structure and a robust framework were fabricated and used as stable and selective catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane."
          [3] "Due to the improved mass diffusion and higher number of exposed active sites in the ordered macroporous structure, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable olefin productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1, which is up to 2100 times higher than that of ODH catalysts reported to date."
          [4] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."
          [5] "The synthesis of ordered macroporous BPO4 was conducted via hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a) ."
          [6] "Boric acid and phosphoric acid were employed as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres were used as the hard template."
          [7] "The ordered macroporous structure was an inverse replica of the template, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores."
          [8] "The elemental mapping images ( Fig. 1(g) ) show a homogeneous distribution of the B, O, and P elements in the whole BPO4 crystals."
          [9] "The macropore sizes and the intergrown nanocrystals were essentially unchanged."
          [10] "The XRD pattern of the spent BPO4(OM) after the catalytic reaction ( Fig. 3(e) ) was identical to that of the fresh catalyst."
          [11] "The B and P species, with chemical shifts of ca. 5.3 and 31 ppm, respectively, were essentially retained after the reaction."
          [12] "The presence of abundant tetra-coordinated boron species in the catalysts had two consequences: on one hand, the boron sites were too crowded to be accessible to nucleophilic species; on the other hand, the electron density in the vicinity of the boron sites was enhanced."
          [13] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst."
          [14] "These results likely indicate that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane."
          [15] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."
          [16] "The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was further confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis (Fig. S1); the cumulative pore volume vs. pore diameter curve showed a continuous increase in mercury uptake with decreasing pore diameter (i.e., increasing Hg intrusion pressure)."
          [17] "The specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively."
          [18] "The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the ODH of propane."
          [19] "The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions."
          [20] "The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield."
          [21] "The atomic percentages of B in the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts were estimated to be ca. 33.1% and 33.7%, respectively. The B 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 193.6, 191.8, and 189.3 eV. These peaks were attributed to BO3 (tri-coordinated boron), BO4 (tetra-coordinated boron), and boron suboxides (BxOy, 1.5 < x/y < 3), respectively."

          The ordered macroporous structure of boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by improving mass transport and increasing the accessibility of active sites. The synthesis of ordered macroporous boron phosphate (BPO4) was achieved through hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, using boric acid and phosphoric acid as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as the hard template. The ordered macroporous structure, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores, was an inverse replica of the template. The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited remarkable structural stability, and the content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane. The ordered macroporous structure and the presence of tri-coordinated boron species in the framework were effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH of propane. The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter. The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis, and the specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield. The structural stability of the BPO4(OM) catalyst is evidenced by unchanged macropore sizes and intergrown nanocrystals, as well as an identical XRD pattern before and after the catalytic reaction. The active sites are identified as tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species, which are retained after the reaction, as confirmed by FTIR, NMR, and XPS measurements. The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increases from 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating their role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
