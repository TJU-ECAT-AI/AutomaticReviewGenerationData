1.The ordered macroporous structure of boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by improving mass transport and increasing the accessibility of active sites. The synthesis of ordered macroporous boron phosphate (BPO4) was achieved through hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, using boric acid and phosphoric acid as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as the hard template. The ordered macroporous structure, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores, was an inverse replica of the template. The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited remarkable structural stability, and the content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane. The ordered macroporous structure and the presence of tri-coordinated boron species in the framework were effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH of propane.

1.具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中的硼基材料具有快速的质量传递和增强的活性位点可及性，这对于实现改进的催化活性至关重要。有序的多孔硼酸盐晶体具有坚固的框架，被合成并用作丙烷氧化脱氢的稳定和选择性催化剂。由于有序多孔结构中改进的质量扩散和暴露的活性位点数量增加，催化剂表现出显著的烯烃生产力。三配位表面硼物种被鉴定为丙烷氧化脱氢的活性催化位点。有序多孔BPO4的合成是通过水热辅助合成和煅烧进行的，使用硼酸和磷酸作为硼和磷的来源，以及单分散聚苯并恶嗪聚合物球体作为硬模板。有序多孔结构是模板的逆向复制品，互连的多孔平均直径为200纳米。元素映射图像显示整个BPO4晶体中B、O和P元素的均匀分布。反应后，多孔尺寸和互生长的纳米晶体基本保持不变。催化反应后，BPO4(OM)的XRD图谱与新鲜催化剂的图谱相同。反应后，B和P物种基本保留。催化剂中大量四配位硼物种的存在有两个后果：一方面，硼位点过于拥挤，无法被亲核性物种接近；另一方面，硼位点附近电子密度增加。新鲜BPO4(OM)中三配位表面硼物种的含量从约41%增加到消耗催化剂中的51%。这些结果可能表明，三配位硼物种对丙烷氧化脱氢负责。将B活性组分掺入这些结构中的方法对不同的催化应用是有效的。

1.The ordered macroporous structure of BPO4 materials enhances catalytic performance by providing rapid mass transport and increased accessibility to active sites. The synthesis of these materials involves hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, using polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as a template. The macropores formed are interconnected and have an average diameter of 200 nm, slightly smaller than the template due to thermal shrinkage during pyrolysis. The macropores are bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter, confirming the presence of macroporosity in BPO4. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield. The structural stability of the BPO4(OM) catalyst is evidenced by unchanged macropore sizes and intergrown nanocrystals, as well as an identical XRD pattern before and after the catalytic reaction. The active sites are identified as tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species, which are retained after the reaction, as confirmed by FTIR, NMR, and XPS measurements. The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increases from 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating their role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
