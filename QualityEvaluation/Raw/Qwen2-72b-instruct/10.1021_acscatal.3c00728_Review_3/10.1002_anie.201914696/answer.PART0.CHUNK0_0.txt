[1] "Boron-containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins."
[2] "It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06) layer."
[3] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."
[4] "However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."
[5] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."
[6] "The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides."
[7] "The large distribution of boron sites in active materials and their dynamic nature under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s)."
[8] "To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary."
[9] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure."
[10] "The successful synthesis of the MWW framework was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (FigureS1) and N2 physisorption (SBET=498m2g1)."
[11] "The boron loading was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to be 1.10.1wt.%. This loading is within the 0.232.20wt.% range for B/SiO2 catalysts made by incipient wetness impregnation that all showed significant conversion under our ODH reaction conditions."
[12] "The 11B isotropic chemical shift (δiso), electric field gradient asymmetry parameter (η) and quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species."
[13] "The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."
[14] "The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches our results very well, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species."
[15] "The 11B spin echo spectrum of the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW reveals that 57% of the boron species are framework B(OSi)3 groups (δiso(11B)=11ppm) and 43% are B(OSi)2(OH) species (δiso(11B)=15ppm)."
[16] "The 11B spin echo spectrum of B/B-MWW and accompanying NMR parameters are similar to that of catalytically active B/SiO2."
[17] "The 11BNMR signal with δiso=15ppm are assigned to framework B(OSi)2(OH) species."
[18] "The 11BNMR spectrum of B/B-MWW extracted from the 2D D-RINEPT experiment shows different signal intensities from the corresponding 11B spin echo NMR spectrum."
[19] "The D-RINEPT signal build-up for the 1HNMR signal at 3.6ppm fits best to a simulated curve with a dipolar coupling constant of ca. 3.6kHz, corresponding to a 1H-11B inter-nuclear distance of ca. 2.2Å."
[20] "The D-RINEPT signal build-up for the 1HNMR signal at 2.7ppm fits best to a simulated curve with a 1H-11B dipolar coupling constant of ca. 1.6kHz, corresponding to a 2.9Å 1H-11B inter-nuclear distance."
[21] "In the 2D 11B1H DRINEPT spectrum of B-MWW recorded with 2.56ms of recoupling only weak correlations are observed between the B(OSi)2(OH) 1HNMR signal at 3.6ppm and the B(OSi)3 11BNMR signals, suggesting these sites are well separated within the zeolite."
[22] "The 1H{29Si}CPMAS spectrum of B-MWW fresh required ca. 10hours of signal averaging, confirming the majority of the zeolite framework is pristine."
[23] "In summary, the 11B chemical shifts suggest that in B-MWW nearly all boron atoms are incorporated into the framework."
[24] "The SSNMR data also suggests that these sites are well separated (>34Å apart) from one another."
[25] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
[26] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
[27] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
[28] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site."
[29] "Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

1.含硼材料已被鉴定为烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)到烯烃的高选择性催化剂。这些催化剂的表面在反应条件下氧化和水解，形成B2(OH)xO(3x/2)无定形层。然而，B-MWW在丙烷ODH中催化活性的缺乏，否定了孤立BO3位点是含硼催化剂活性位点的假设。硼位点在反应条件下的动态性质使得无法精确实验确定活性位点。为了理解活性位点形成的要求，需要合成具有更受控、更均匀的硼氧化物特性的材料。B-MWW的合成具有与在ODH反应条件下表现出显著转化的B/SiO2催化剂相同的硼负载范围。11B固体核磁共振光谱显示，B-MWW中大多数硼物种以孤立的BO3单元形式存在，完全被整合到沸石框架中。11B各向同性化学位移、电场梯度不对称参数和四极耦合常数的值是三角平面硼物种的特征。δiso(11B)=15ppm的峰被分配为B(OSi)2(OH)物种。δiso=15ppm的11BNMR信号被分配为框架B(OSi)2(OH)物种。1HNMR信号在3.6ppm处的1H-11B核间距约为2.2Å，而在2.7ppm处的1HNMR信号的1H-11B核间距为2.9Å。在B-MWW的2D 11B1H DRINEPT光谱中，仅观察到B(OSi)2(OH) 1HNMR信号在3.6ppm处与B(OSi)3 11BNMR信号之间的微弱相关性，表明这些位点在沸石中相距较远。B-MWW新鲜的1H{29Si}CPMAS光谱确认沸石框架的大部分是原始的。11B化学位移表明，在B-MWW中，几乎所有的硼原子都被整合到框架中。SSNMR数据还表明，这些位点彼此相距>34Å。尽管B-MWW的硼负载足以催化活性，但测试确定它在背景水平上没有表现出任何丙烷ODH转化。催化活性的B/B-MWW、B/SiO2和硼化氮ODH催化剂含有在反应条件下重组的聚集硼位点，而B-MWW在反应条件下是稳定的，硼原子没有重组。B-MWW和其他含硼材料中硼位点的差异导致我们得出结论，硼催化的丙烷ODH不会在孤立的BO3位点上进行。活性的基于硼的ODH催化剂可能需要具有一定程度的B-O-B连通性的硼物种。
