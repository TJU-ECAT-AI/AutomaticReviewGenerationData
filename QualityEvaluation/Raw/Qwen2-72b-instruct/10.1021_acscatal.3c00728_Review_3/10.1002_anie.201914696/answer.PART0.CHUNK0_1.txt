[1] "Boron-containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins."
[2] "It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06) layer."
[3] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."
[4] "However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."
[5] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."
[6] "The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches our results very well, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species."
[7] "The 11B spin echo spectrum of the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW reveals that 57% of the boron species are framework B(OSi)3 groups (δiso(11B)=11ppm) and 43% are B(OSi)2(OH) species (δiso(11B)=15ppm, FiguresS4S5)."
[8] "Clearly, the B(OSi)2(OH) sites now make up a larger fraction of the boron species in B/B-MWW."
[9] "In summary, the 11B chemical shifts suggest that in B-MWW nearly all boron atoms are incorporated into the framework."
[10] "The SSNMR data also suggests that these sites are well separated (>34Å apart) from one another, for the reasons given below."
[11] "In the 2D 11B1H DRINEPT spectrum of B-MWW recorded with 2.56ms of recoupling only weak correlations are observed between the B(OSi)2(OH) 1HNMR signal at 3.6ppm and the B(OSi)3 11BNMR signals, suggesting these sites are well separated within the zeolite."
[12] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site."
[13] "Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

1.Boron-containing materials have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins. The surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) layer. However, the precise nature of the active site(s) remains elusive. The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. This material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene, which refutes the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches the results of B-MWW, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species. The 11B spin echo spectrum of the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW reveals that 57% of the boron species are framework B(OSi)3 groups and 43% are B(OSi)2(OH) species. The B(OSi)2(OH) sites now make up a larger fraction of the boron species in B/B-MWW. In B-MWW, nearly all boron atoms are incorporated into the framework, and these sites are well separated from one another. In the 2D 11B1H DRINEPT spectrum of B-MWW recorded with 2.56ms of recoupling, only weak correlations are observed between the B(OSi)2(OH) 1HNMR signal at 3.6ppm and the B(OSi)3 11BNMR signals, suggesting these sites are well separated within the zeolite.

1.含硼材料已被鉴定为烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)到烯烃的高选择性催化剂。这些含硼ODH催化剂的表面在反应条件下氧化和水解，形成B2(OH)xO(3x/2)的无定形层。然而，活性位点的确切性质仍然未知。B-MWW中大多数硼物种以孤立的BO3单元形式存在，完全被整合到沸石框架中。这种材料对丙烷到丙烯的ODH没有催化活性，这反驳了孤立的BO3位点是含硼催化剂的活性位点的假设。Zones等人测量的B(OSi)3和B(OSi)2(OH)物种的δiso(11B)与B-MWW的结果相匹配，验证了这里合成的B-MWW主要含有框架物种。活性ODH催化剂B/B-MWW的11B自旋回波光谱显示，57%的硼物种是框架B(OSi)3组，43%是B(OSi)2(OH)物种。B(OSi)2(OH)位点现在占B/B-MWW中硼物种的更大比例。在B-MWW中，几乎所有的硼原子都被整合到框架中，这些位点彼此相隔很远。在B-MWW的2D 11B1H DRINEPT光谱中，记录了2.56ms的耦合，仅观察到B(OSi)2(OH) 1HNMR信号在3.6ppm和B(OSi)3 11BNMR信号之间的微弱相关性，表明这些位点在沸石中相隔很远。B-MWW和其他含硼材料之间的硼位点的差异导致我们得出结论，硼催化的丙烷ODH不会在孤立的BO3位点上进行。活性的含硼ODH催化剂可能需要具有一定程度的B-O-B连接性的硼物种。
