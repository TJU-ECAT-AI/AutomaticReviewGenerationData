[1] "Boron-containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins."
[2] "It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06) layer."
[3] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."
[4] "However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."
[5] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."
[6] "The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches our results very well, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species."
[7] "In this work, we successfully synthesized stable, isolated framework B(OSi)3 (major, ca. 90%) and B(OSi)2(OH) (minor, ca. 10%) species in zeolite MWW framework and catalytically tested them for the ODH of propane."
[8] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
[9] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
[10] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
[11] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site."
[12] "Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

1.Boron-containing materials have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins. The surface of these catalysts oxidizes and hydrolyzes under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) layer. However, the B-MWW material, which contains isolated BO3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework, shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. This refutes the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The B-MWW synthesized contains primarily framework species, with B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species. Despite having a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, B-MWW does not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Active boron-based ODH catalysts, such as B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride, contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The conclusion is that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site, but rather requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.

1.含硼材料已被鉴定为烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)到烯烃的高选择性催化剂。这些催化剂的表面在反应条件下氧化和水解，形成B2(OH)xO(3x/2)无定形层。然而，含有完全嵌入沸石框架的孤立BO3单元的B-MWW材料对丙烷到丙烯的ODH没有催化活性。这反驳了孤立BO3单元是基于硼的催化剂的活性位点的假设。合成的B-MWW主要包含框架物种，具有B(OSi)3和B(OSi)2(OH)物种。尽管B-MWW的硼负载足以产生催化活性，但它在背景水平以上没有表现出任何丙烷的ODH转化。活性基于硼的ODH催化剂，如B/B-MWW，B/SiO2和硼化氮，含有在反应条件下重组的聚集硼位点，而B-MWW在反应条件下是稳定的，硼原子没有重组。结论是，硼催化的丙烷ODH不会在孤立的BO3位点上进行，而是需要具有一定程度的B-O-B连接性的硼物种。
