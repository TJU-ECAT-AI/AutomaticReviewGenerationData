[1] "Boron-containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins."
[2] "It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06) layer."
[3] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."
[4] "However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."
[5] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."

[7] "To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary."
[8] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure."

[10] "The boron loading was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to be 1.10.1wt.%. This loading is within the 0.232.20wt.% range for B/SiO2 catalysts made by incipient wetness impregnation that all showed significant conversion under our ODH reaction conditions."
[11] "The 11B isotropic chemical shift (δiso), electric field gradient asymmetry parameter (η) and quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species."
[12] "On the basis of δiso(11B), the simulated peaks with δiso(11B)=11ppm (red fit) and δiso(11B)=12ppm (green fit) are assigned to framework B(OSi)3 species substituted into the zeolite."
[13] "The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."
[14] "The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches our results very well, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species."
[15] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
[16] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
[17] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
[18] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site."
[19] "Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

1.含硼材料已被鉴定为烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)到烯烃的高选择性催化剂。这些含硼ODH催化剂的表面在反应条件下氧化和水解，形成B2(OH)xO(3x/2)无定形层。B-MWW中的大多数硼物种以孤立的BO3单元的形式存在，完全被整合到沸石框架中。然而，这种材料对丙烷到丙烯的ODH没有催化活性。B-MWW对丙烷ODH的催化不活性否定了孤立BO3位点是基于硼的催化剂的活性位点的假设。活性材料中硼位点的广泛分布及其在反应条件下的动态性质排除了对活性位点的精确实验识别。为了理解活性位点形成的要求，有必要合成具有更受控、更均匀的硼氧化物特性的材料。B-MWW是根据文献中已建立的程序通过水热合成的。通过粉末X射线衍射和N2物理吸附确认了MWW框架的成功合成。通过电感耦合等离子体质谱法量化硼含量为1.10.1wt.%。11B各向同性化学位移(δiso)、电场梯度不对称参数(η)和四极耦合常数(CQ)的值具有三配位硼物种的特征。通过对B-MWW的多维1H和11B SSNMR光谱的详细表征，发现硼主要以孤立的B(OSi)3单元的形式存在，这些单元邻近硅醇基团。尽管B-MWW的硼含量足以催化活性，但测试确定它在背景水平上没有表现出丙烷的ODH转化。正如这里和我们之前的工作所示，催化活性的B/B-MWW、B/SiO2和硼化氮ODH催化剂含有在反应条件下重组的聚集硼位点，而B-MWW在反应条件下是稳定的，硼原子没有重组。B-MWW和这些其他硼材料中硼位点的差异使我们得出了一个重要的结论，即硼催化的丙烷ODH不会在孤立的BO3位点上进行。相反，活性的基于硼的ODH催化剂可能需要具有一定程度的B-O-B连接性的硼物种。
