[1] "Boron-containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins."
[2] "It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06) layer."
[3] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."
[4] "However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."
[5] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."
[6] "The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides."
[7] "The large distribution of boron sites in active materials and their dynamic nature under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s)."
[8] "To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary."
[9] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure."
[10] "The successful synthesis of the MWW framework was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (FigureS1) and N2 physisorption (SBET=498m2g1)."
[11] "The boron loading was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to be 1.10.1wt.%. This loading is within the 0.232.20wt.% range for B/SiO2 catalysts made by incipient wetness impregnation that all showed significant conversion under our ODH reaction conditions."
[12] "The 11B isotropic chemical shift (δiso), electric field gradient asymmetry parameter (η) and quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species."
[13] "The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."
[14] "The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches our results very well, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species."
[15] "The 11B spin echo spectrum of the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW reveals that 57% of the boron species are framework B(OSi)3 groups (δiso(11B)=11ppm) and 43% are B(OSi)2(OH) species (δiso(11B)=15ppm)."
[16] "The 11B spin echo spectrum of B/B-MWW and accompanying NMR parameters are similar to that of catalytically active B/SiO2."
[17] "The 11BNMR signal with δiso=15ppm are assigned to framework B(OSi)2(OH) species."
[18] "The 11BNMR spectrum of B/B-MWW extracted from the 2D D-RINEPT experiment shows different signal intensities from the corresponding 11B spin echo NMR spectrum."
[19] "The D-RINEPT signal build-up for the 1HNMR signal at 3.6ppm fits best to a simulated curve with a dipolar coupling constant of ca. 3.6kHz, corresponding to a 1H-11B inter-nuclear distance of ca. 2.2Å."
[20] "The D-RINEPT signal build-up for the 1HNMR signal at 2.7ppm fits best to a simulated curve with a 1H-11B dipolar coupling constant of ca. 1.6kHz, corresponding to a 2.9Å 1H-11B inter-nuclear distance."
[21] "In the 2D 11B1H DRINEPT spectrum of B-MWW recorded with 2.56ms of recoupling only weak correlations are observed between the B(OSi)2(OH) 1HNMR signal at 3.6ppm and the B(OSi)3 11BNMR signals, suggesting these sites are well separated within the zeolite."
[22] "The 1H{29Si}CPMAS spectrum of B-MWW fresh required ca. 10hours of signal averaging, confirming the majority of the zeolite framework is pristine."
[23] "In summary, the 11B chemical shifts suggest that in B-MWW nearly all boron atoms are incorporated into the framework."
[24] "The SSNMR data also suggests that these sites are well separated (>34Å apart) from one another."
[25] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
[26] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
[27] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
[28] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site."
[29] "Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

1.含硼材料已被鉴定为烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)到烯烃的高选择性催化剂。这些催化剂的表面在反应条件下氧化和水解，形成B2(OH)xO(3x/2)无定形层。然而，B-MWW在丙烷ODH中催化活性的缺乏，否定了孤立BO3位点是含硼催化剂活性位点的假设。硼位点在反应条件下的动态性质使得无法精确实验确定活性位点。为了理解活性位点形成的要求，需要合成具有更受控、更均匀的硼氧化物特性的材料。B-MWW的合成具有与在ODH反应条件下表现出显著转化的B/SiO2催化剂相同的硼负载范围。11B固体核磁共振光谱显示，B-MWW中大多数硼物种以孤立的BO3单元形式存在，完全被整合到沸石框架中。11B各向同性化学位移、电场梯度不对称参数和四极耦合常数的值是三角平面硼物种的特征。δiso(11B)=15ppm的峰被分配为B(OSi)2(OH)物种。δiso=15ppm的11BNMR信号被分配为框架B(OSi)2(OH)物种。1HNMR信号在3.6ppm处的1H-11B核间距约为2.2Å，而在2.7ppm处的1HNMR信号的1H-11B核间距为2.9Å。在B-MWW的2D 11B1H DRINEPT光谱中，仅观察到B(OSi)2(OH) 1HNMR信号在3.6ppm处与B(OSi)3 11BNMR信号之间的微弱相关性，表明这些位点在沸石中相距较远。B-MWW新鲜的1H{29Si}CPMAS光谱确认沸石框架的大部分是原始的。11B化学位移表明，在B-MWW中，几乎所有的硼原子都被整合到框架中。SSNMR数据还表明，这些位点彼此相距>34Å。尽管B-MWW的硼负载足以催化活性，但测试确定它在背景水平上没有表现出任何丙烷ODH转化。催化活性的B/B-MWW、B/SiO2和硼化氮ODH催化剂含有在反应条件下重组的聚集硼位点，而B-MWW在反应条件下是稳定的，硼原子没有重组。B-MWW和其他含硼材料中硼位点的差异导致我们得出结论，硼催化的丙烷ODH不会在孤立的BO3位点上进行。活性的基于硼的ODH催化剂可能需要具有一定程度的B-O-B连通性的硼物种。

1.含硼材料已被鉴定为烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)到烯烃的高选择性催化剂。这些含硼ODH催化剂的表面在反应条件下氧化和水解，形成B2(OH)xO(3x/2)无定形层。B-MWW中的大多数硼物种以孤立的BO3单元的形式存在，完全被整合到沸石框架中。然而，这种材料对丙烷到丙烯的ODH没有催化活性。B-MWW对丙烷ODH的催化不活性否定了孤立BO3位点是基于硼的催化剂的活性位点的假设。活性材料中硼位点的广泛分布及其在反应条件下的动态性质排除了对活性位点的精确实验识别。为了理解活性位点形成的要求，有必要合成具有更受控、更均匀的硼氧化物特性的材料。B-MWW是根据文献中已建立的程序通过水热合成的。通过粉末X射线衍射和N2物理吸附确认了MWW框架的成功合成。通过电感耦合等离子体质谱法量化硼含量为1.10.1wt.%。11B各向同性化学位移(δiso)、电场梯度不对称参数(η)和四极耦合常数(CQ)的值具有三配位硼物种的特征。通过对B-MWW的多维1H和11B SSNMR光谱的详细表征，发现硼主要以孤立的B(OSi)3单元的形式存在，这些单元邻近硅醇基团。尽管B-MWW的硼含量足以催化活性，但测试确定它在背景水平上没有表现出丙烷的ODH转化。正如这里和我们之前的工作所示，催化活性的B/B-MWW、B/SiO2和硼化氮ODH催化剂含有在反应条件下重组的聚集硼位点，而B-MWW在反应条件下是稳定的，硼原子没有重组。B-MWW和这些其他硼材料中硼位点的差异使我们得出了一个重要的结论，即硼催化的丙烷ODH不会在孤立的BO3位点上进行。相反，活性的基于硼的ODH催化剂可能需要具有一定程度的B-O-B连接性的硼物种。

[1] "Boron-containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins."
[2] "It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06) layer."
[3] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."
[4] "However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."
[5] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."
[6] "The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides."
[7] "The large distribution of boron sites in active materials and their dynamic nature under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s)."
[8] "To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary."
[9] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure."
[10] "The successful synthesis of the MWW framework was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (FigureS1) and N2 physisorption (SBET=498m2g1)."
[11] "The boron loading was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to be 1.10.1wt.%. This loading is within the 0.232.20wt.% range for B/SiO2 catalysts made by incipient wetness impregnation that all showed significant conversion under our ODH reaction conditions."
[12] "The boron content did not change, within the error margin of the experiment, indicating that there was insignificant leaching during reaction."
[13] "This lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are surprisingly not active for propane ODH."
[14] "Prior to all SSNMR experiments, the samples were fully dehydrated and further handled in an inert atmosphere."
[15] "Direct excitation 11B spin echo MAS SSNMR spectra of pristine B-MWW (fresh) and after 12hours on stream (spent) were recorded at 11.7T (ν0(1H)=500MHz) with a 10kHz MAS frequency."
[16] "The 11B isotropic chemical shift (δiso), electric field gradient asymmetry parameter (η) and quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species."
[17] "The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."
[18] "All of these assignments are consistent with the findings of Zones and co-workers who previously used 1H, 11B and 29Si SSNMR spectroscopy to characterized boron doped B-β, B-SSZ-33 and B-SSZ-42 zeolites."
[19] "Their high field (19.6T) 11B spin echo, 2D 1H11B CP-HETCOR and 11B MQMAS SSNMR spectra clearly showed that B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) incorporated into the framework (δiso(11B)=10.014.8ppm, depending on the zeolite) resonate at a lower δiso(11B) than non-framework boron species (18.0ppm)."
[20] "The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches our results very well, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species."
[21] "In comparison, the 11B spin echo spectrum of the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW reveals that 57% of the boron species are framework B(OSi)3 groups (δiso(11B)=11ppm) and 43% are B(OSi)2(OH) species (δiso(11B)=15ppm)."
[22] "Clearly, the B(OSi)2(OH) sites now make up a larger fraction of the boron species in B/B-MWW."
[23] "The 11B spin echo spectrum of B/B-MWW and accompanying NMR parameters are similar to that of catalytically active B/SiO2."
[24] "To better understand the boron speciation and confirm the assignments of the distinct 11BNMR signals for B-MWW, we performed 1H-11B correlation NMR experiments."
[25] "Because of the similarity in the 1D 11B SSNMR spectra for fresh and spent B-MWW, we only consider the fresh material for these experiments."
[26] "Analysis of the 1D D-RINEPT and 2D11B1H D-RINEPT spectra clearly illustrates that distinct 1H and 11B resonances can be observed depending on the duration of heteronuclear dipolar recoupling."
[27] "With 0.64ms of recoupling (blue trace), only the higher frequency 1HNMR signals (ca. 3.6ppm) are observed and they show intense correlations to the higher frequency 11BNMR signal (δiso 15ppm)."
[28] "On the basis of the chemical shifts, the 1HNMR signal at 3.6ppm and 11BNMR signal with δiso=15ppm are assigned to framework B(OSi)2(OH) species."
[29] "The 2D 11B1H D-RINEPT spectrum recorded with 2.56ms of dipolar recoupling shows additional strong correlations between the 1HNMR signal at 2.7ppm and 11BNMR signal with δiso of 12-11ppm."
[30] "In contrast, the 11BNMR spectrum of B/B-MWW extracted from the 2D D-RINEPT experiment shows different signal intensities from the corresponding 11B spin echo NMR spectrum."
[31] "Taken together these observations suggest that some boron spins are distant from protons, likely due to the formation of some boron oxide clusters in B/B-MWW."
[32] "The D-RINEPT signal build-up for the 1HNMR signal at 3.6ppm fits best to a simulated curve with a dipolar coupling constant of ca. 3.6kHz, corresponding to a 1H-11B inter-nuclear distance of ca. 2.2Å."
[33] "The D-RINEPT signal build-up for the 1HNMR signal at 2.7ppm fits best to a simulated curve with a 1H-11B dipolar coupling constant of ca. 1.6kHz, corresponding to a 2.9Å 1H-11B inter-nuclear distance."
[34] "Taking into account the 11B δiso of 11ppm and the relatively large 1H-11B inter-nuclear distance, this 1H signal is assigned to a framework B(OSi)3 species that is adjacent to a framework silanol."
[35] "In summary, the 11B chemical shifts suggest that in B-MWW nearly all boron atoms are incorporated into the framework."
[36] "The SSNMR data also suggests that these sites are well separated (>34Å apart) from one another."
[37] "In the 2D 11B1H DRINEPT spectrum of B-MWW recorded with 2.56ms of recoupling only weak correlations are observed between the B(OSi)2(OH) 1HNMR signal at 3.6ppm and the B(OSi)3 11BNMR signals, suggesting these sites are well separated within the zeolite."
[38] "This interpretation is confirmed by a 2D 1H-1H dipolar double-quantum-single-quantum (DQ-SQ) homonuclear correlation spectrum of B-MWW which shows that the 1HNMR signals at 2.7ppm, assigned to silanol adjacent to B(OSi)3, do not give rise to any appreciable DQ signal intensity."
[39] "In comparison, these silanol groups give rise to an observable 1H DQ NMR signal in B/B-MWW, consistent with more extensive aggregation of boron sites in this material."
[40] "Finally, 1D 11B-11B DQ-SQ experiments show that the DQ-filtered 11BNMR signal for B-MWW is about three times less than that of B/B-MWW."
[41] "Notably, the DQ-filtered 11B solid-state NMR spectra of B-MWW and B/B-MWW both show signals with more positive chemical shifts as compared to the SQ 11B spin echo spectra."
[42] "The more positive shifts suggest that aggregation preferentially occurs for hydroxylated or oxide-like boron sites, both of which are much more common in B/B-MWW as shown by quantitative 11B spin echo experiments above."
[43] "All of these observations confirm the hypothesis that catalytically inactive B-MWW consist of predominately isolated boron sites incorporated into the zeolite framework, while the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW contains some partially aggregated boron sites."

1.含硼材料已被识别为烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)到烯烃的高选择性催化剂。这些催化剂的表面在反应条件下氧化和水解，形成B2(OH)xO(3x/2)的无定形层。B-MWW中的大多数硼物种以孤立的BO3单元的形式存在，完全被整合到沸石框架中。然而，这种材料对丙烷到丙烯的ODH没有催化活性。B-MWW对丙烷ODH的催化不活性否定了孤立BO3位点是基于硼的催化剂的活性位点的假设。硼位点在反应条件下的动态性质排除了对活性位点的精确实验识别。为了理解活性位点形成的要求，有必要合成具有更受控、更均匀的硼氧化物特性的材料。B-MWW是根据既定的程序合成的，成功的合成通过粉末X射线衍射和N2物理吸附得到确认。硼的负载量通过ICP-MS量化为1.10.1wt.%。催化不活性表明沸石框架中的硼物种对丙烷ODH没有活性。使用固态NMR光谱表征B-MWW中的硼物种。11B各向同性化学位移、电场梯度不对称参数和四极耦合常数的值是三配位硼物种的特征。δiso(11B)=15ppm的峰被分配给B(OSi)2(OH)物种。这些发现与以前对硼掺杂沸石的研究一致。B(OSi)3和B(OSi)2(OH)物种的δiso(11B)与结果相匹配，验证了B-MWW主要包含框架物种。活性ODH催化剂B/B-MWW的11B自旋回波光谱显示，57%的硼物种是框架B(OSi)3组，43%是B(OSi)2(OH)物种。B(OSi)2(OH)位点现在占B/B-MWW中硼物种的更大比例。B/B-MWW的11B自旋回波光谱和伴随的NMR参数与催化活性B/SiO2相似。进行了1H-11B相关NMR实验，以更好地理解B-MWW中的硼物种，并确认11BNMR信号的分配。估计了每对1H-11BNMR信号的1H-11B核间距离。1HNMR信号在3.6ppm的1H-11B核间距离约为2.2Å，1HNMR信号在2.7ppm的1H-11B核间距离为2.9Å。SSNMR数据表明，这些位点彼此相隔>34Å。在2.56ms的耦合下记录的B-MWW的2D 11B1H DRINEPT光谱中，仅观察到B(OSi)2(OH)1HNMR信号在3.6ppm和B(OSi)311BNMR信号之间的微弱相关性，表明这些位点在沸石中相隔很远。这些观察结果证实了催化不活性的B-MWW主要由整合到沸石框架中的孤立硼位点组成，而活性ODH催化剂B/B-MWW含有一些部分聚集的硼位点。
