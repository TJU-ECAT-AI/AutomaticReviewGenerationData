Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins on metal-free catalysts Metal-free boron- and carbon-based catalysts have shown both great fundamental and practical value in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes. In particular, boron-based catalysts show a superior selectivity toward olefins, excellent stability and atom-economy to valuable carbon-based products by minimizing CO2 emission, which are highly promising in future industrialization. The carbonaceous catalysts also exhibited impressive behavior in the ODH of light alkanes helped along by surface oxygen-containing functional groups. This review surveyed and compared the preparation methods of the boron- and carbon-based catalysts and their characterization, their performance in the ODH of light alkanes, and the mechanistic issues of the ODH including the identification of the possible active sites and the exploration of the underlying mechanisms. We discussed different boron-based materials and established versatile methodologies for the investigation of active sites and reaction mechanisms. We also elaborated on the similarities and differences in catalytic and kinetic behaviors, and reaction mechanisms between boron- and carbon-based metal-free materials. A perspective of the potential issues of metal-free ODH catalytic systems in terms of their rational design and their synergy with reactor engineering was sketched.

The development of the chemical industry strongly relies on catalysis, which is involved in more than 80% of industrial processes. The synthesis of polymers, e.g. polyethylene and polypropylene, is one of the key components of the chemical industry, and mainly takes light olefins, including ethylene, propylene and butylene, as feedstocks. In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a).1 These light olefins are mainly produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), methanol to olefins (MTO) and FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO).2,3 These technologies in general feature high energy consumption and enormous carbon emission, and contradict sustainable development criteria that have strict requirements on environmental protection and energy-consumption. This raises challenges both scientifically and technologically, and drives a shift of chemical engineering from energy-demanding chemical processes to more environmentally friendly protocols of catalysis to produce olefins with high atom economy, low energy consumption and low emission.
Fig. 1 (a) The worldwide consumption of propylene and ethylene;26 (b) distributions of proved reserves of natural gas.27 In recent years, the rich availability and low-cost of worldwide natural gas and shale gas production (Fig. 1b) have motivated the development of industrial techniques towards the gas-based dehydrogenation routes to obtain light olefins. In 2018, the proved reserves of natural gas reached 197 trillion cubic meters. These gas resources are composed of considerable amounts of light alkanes, e.g. methane, ethane, and propane, which can be separated from the natural gas,4 and have been mainly used as fuel rather than chemical feedstocks in the past few decades owing to their relatively inert chemical properties compared to olefins. Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route. Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 20255 owing to the success in the large-scale exploitation of natural gas and shale gas. Among the industrialized protocols of direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes,69 two popularly used processes are the Catofin process and Oleflex process4 where the former uses a chromia-alumina catalyst and the latter a platinum-tin based catalyst.4,1017 Since direct dehydrogenation is endothermic in nature, substantial energy input and high temperature is required to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, limiting its overall energy efficiency.4,7,8 In addition, under such tough operation conditions, sintering and coking become serious and cause rapid catalyst deactivation, which thus requires frequent regeneration of the catalysts under high temperature oxidative conditions.15,1822 Coke formation may result in serious consequences, e.g. pressure drop, flow blockage, and decrease of production capacity, leading to low production efficiency.2325
1.1 Thermodynamics aspect of ODH
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, featured by its intrinsic exothermicity and being free of coke, is a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation.2833 It proceeds at a lower temperature without the need of catalyst regeneration. The oxidation of alkanes under aerobic conditions is generally believed to have a complicated reaction pattern demonstrated by the co-existence of various reaction channels under ODH conditions (Table 1).34,35 The rich side reaction channels, e.g. partial oxidation to oxygenated products and deep oxidation to COx, resulted in wide spectrum distribution of products. Thus, an uncatalyzed ODH reaction inevitably suffers from the low selectivity problem, and catalysts are required to promote the targeted reactions by manipulating the reaction kinetics in order to achieve high selectivity for olefins in the oxidative atmosphere.Table 1 Standard molar reaction enthalpies (ΔrH θ m , in kJ mol1) and Gibbs free energies (ΔrG θ m , in kJ mol1) of possible reaction channels in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at 298 K34,35 Possible reactions ΔrH θ m ΔrG θ m Reaction types 1 C3H8 + 1/2O2  C3H6 + H2O 117.5 142.4 ODH 2 C3H8 + 1/2O2  CH3CH2CH2OH 153.7 139.5 Partial oxidation

Considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient ODH catalytic systems to improve the selectivity of olefin products, most of which used metal-based catalysts. These metal-based catalysts displayed high reactivity toward the oxidative conversion of alkanes but suffered from serious deep oxidation to COx, causing significant CO2 emission, owing to the strong interaction between the defected electrophilic metal sites and the electron-rich olefin products. The discovery of boron-based metal-free catalysts showed that this was well circumvented owing to the nucleophilicity of the metal-free catalysts that repelled the approach of olefins.
1.2 Scope of this review
In the past few decades, the research interest in the ODH reaction of light alkanes has been focused on catalytic systems of transition metal oxides (e.g., V2O5, MoO3, and NiO) and alkaline-earth metal oxychlorides.30,36,37 The recent discovery of a novel metal-free catalyst, functionalized hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), with high activity and selectivity to olefins as well as negligible formation of CO2, represents a breakthrough in the development of the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation reaction system.38,39 Subsequently, this new catalytic system attracted considerable research interest in the field of catalysis and material science. A series of boron-based catalysts have been synthesized with exceptional activity similar to h-BN, which paved a new route to selective cleavage of CH bonds.4049 In addition, nanocarbons were also reported to be active in ODH reactions, and have been used as a platform for the fundamental understanding of ODH reactions.5053 These metal-free catalytic systems offered alternative choices to industrialize ODH protocols, and nurtured a new growing point in the utilization of light alkanes as clean energy resources. Meanwhile, there is a quick advance in the understanding of the mechanistic issues, including active site, and the catalytic mechanism, to facilitate rational design of the ODH catalytic systems. A timely survey of the current status is highly necessary in order to promote future study. For this reason, we proceeded to write this review on the study of the metal-free boron- and carbon-based ODH catalytic systems, and overviewed the recent progress in the design of metal-free catalytic materials, and the essential reaction characteristics, including the identification of active sites and the fundamental understanding of the catalytic mechanism, to constitute a comprehensive view to share with the community. This article was finalized with a perspective on future directions in metal-free ODH catalysts. 2 Boron-based catalysts for ODH
2.1 Feature of boron-containing compounds
Boron occurred in nature predominantly as an oxyanion in minerals. It is a chameleon-like element, and may adopt various chemical environments, either as a backbone component to build two- or three-dimensional networks or as a doping atom to incorporate into zeolites and carbon materials, through which their surface electron densities, acid/base properties and functional groups can be modified to improve their performance in catalysis.
Owing to its moderate electronegativity (2.0 in Pauling scale), boron may form borides with metal or nonmetal elements. These, denoted as MmBn, are a family of binary compounds constituted by boron and less electronegative metal or nonmetal elements. They are normally prepared by the following methods: direct combination of the elements at high temperature; reduction of mixed oxides with active metals, carbon, or boron carbide; and reduction of metal oxide with boron.54,55 Borides are diverse in their structural morphologies and stoichiometries. For metal borides, they are classified roughly into boron-rich borides (B:M  4:1) and metal-rich borides (B:M < 4:1). The metal-rich borides contain isolated boron atoms, B2 pairs, boron chains or boron sheets. The structures of boron-rich borides are dominated by inter-boron bonding, and comprise three-dimensional networks of boron atoms and clusters in which the atoms of other elements occupy specific voids or vacant sites. Generally, most of the borides are extremely hard, chemically inert and involatile, and are usually used in high-temperature reactor vessels, crucibles, pump impellers and thermocouple sheaths.Its moderate electronegativity also enables boron to behave similar to carbon and silicon in its propensity to form covalently bound molecular compounds but with one less valence electron than the number of valence orbitals that they can form, a situation sometimes referred to as electron deficiency. This electron-deficient feature results in the complicated and fascinating properties of the compounds containing boron.5557 Its binary and ternary compounds with nonmetal elements, e.g. carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen, usually have similar physical properties and structural morphologies as metal borides.58,59 Boron oxide may breed various compounds by ready association with other elements, e.g. boric acid, borates, borosilicates,60 and boron phosphate.61,62 These compounds expanded the application of boron; for example, boron oxide and boric acid are widely used to prepare borates and other boron-containing materials, and borate has important applications in mineralogy, nonlinear optical materials, laser materials and catalysis. In these oxygenated compounds, boron may adopt two coordination modes, trigonal BO3 and BO4 tetrahedra (B2O6 units), which are generally neighbored to each other via a common vertex or edge to form BxOy polyanion clusters with various configurations.63,64Scheme 1 shows a typical structure of boron-based materials used as ODH catalysts.Scheme 1 Schematic elucidation of typical boron-based materials used as ODH catalysts: (a) edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH);39 Reproduced from ref. 39 with permission from the Wiley-VCH, copyright 2017.

2.2 Binary boron-based catalysts
2.2.1 Hexagonal boron nitride Boron nitrides (BN) may exist in three crystalline forms: graphite-like hexagonal BN (h-BN), diamond-like cubic BN (c-BN), and wurtzite BN (w-BN).65 Under standard conditions, h-BN with a layered structure analogous to graphite is the most stable BN phase.65 With the development of modern technology, h-BN has been synthesized through many methods, such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, and has been extensively used in electronics (wide bandgap (5.06.0 eV)), optics (no optical absorption in 390700 nm) and thermotics (high thermal conductivity 33 W m1 K1) benefitted from its excellent physical properties.67,68 In the field of heterogeneous catalysis, h-BN is generally considered to be chemically inert over the years and has been merely employed as a support in various reaction systems, such as ammonia synthesis,69,70 CO oxidation,71 selective oxidation,7275 and FischerTropsch synthesis.76 Besides, Bao et al. designed coreshell nanocatalysts by an encapsulation strategy and confirmed the confinement effect of h-BN shells that could stabilize the active metal components with an enhanced activity and stability for syngas methanation.77 Beyond that, investigation concerning its catalytic activity is scarce.78
Breakthrough was made when the Hermans group38 and Lu group39 independently reported their finding in the highly specific reactivity of h-BN in catalyzing the ODH of propane. Hermans and co-workers38 reported a selectivity of 79% for propylene and 12% for ethylene at 14% propane conversion in the h-BN catalytic system, which ran stably for over 32 h, with a COx proportion of 9%, a value far lower than that produced over traditional VOx/SiO2 catalysts at 9% propane conversion (Fig. 2a).38 Similar product distributions were observed when using BNNTs, but with a higher rate of propylene productivity (kgC3H6 kgcat1 h1) than h-BN by more than five times (Fig. 2b).

Lu and coworkers39 reported more pronounced performance of home-made edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) in the ODH of propane and ethane to the corresponding olefins with high selectivity and negligible CO2 formation, on which high propane conversion (20.6%) and olefin selectivity (80.2% for C3 and 90.9% for C23) were achieved with considerably low CO2 formation (0.5%) (Fig. 2c). Meanwhile, feeding propylene and molecular oxygen did not consume propylene, demonstrating the suppression of its over-oxidation in the BNOH catalytic system. BNOH also exhibited olefin productivity of 6.8 golefin gcat1 h1, which was far higher than those of metal oxide catalysts, and remained stable for at least 300 h (Fig. 2d).
In the ODH of ethane on BNOH,42 the ethylene selectivity reached up to 95%, 90%, and 80% at the ethane conversion of 11%, 40%, and 63%, respectively, with only a negligible amount of CO2 (Fig. 3a). These results show that the BNOH catalyzed ODH is comparable to the industrialized ethane steam cracking process in view of their ethylene selectivity (85% at 60% ethane conversion for the latter), but wins over the latter considering the much lower reaction temperature and CO2 emission.79 The BNOH catalyst can also afford high ethylene productivity (9.1 gC2H4 gcat1 h1) with >90% selectivity by modulating the reaction conditions (Fig. 3b). The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst was evidenced by the operation for 200 h at 590 C (Fig. 3c). Such stable productivity far exceeded the critical value, 1 gC2H4 gcat1 h1, and demonstrated its potential application for industry.36 Fig. 3 ODH of ethane on h-BN:42 (a) dependence of ethane conversion, ethylene selectivity and yield on the reaction temperature; (b) effect of space velocity and reaction temperature on the productivity of ethylene.

By means of various advanced experimental characterization techniques and computational methods, the determining role of edge BOH groups was identified unambiguously,39,42 which represented a distinct understanding with that reported.38 The comparative study40 on the catalytic activity of several boron-containing compounds (B4C, Ti2B, NiB, CoxB, HfB2, and WB) and elemental B in ODH also confirmed the importance of BO sites and showed that the absence of nitrogen sites did not eliminate the catalytic activity of boron-containing compounds. The knowledge on the responsible species in the h-BN catalytic systems has since then been evolving, and it is now a consensus38,39,42,78,8083 that oxygenated boron species dictate the performance of the boron-based catalysts.
The suppression of over-oxidation of alkanes on h-BN was also demonstrated by the ODH reactions of n-butane and isobutane,84 in which the main side products were observed to be C2 and C3 olefins rather than COx. In contrast, the main side product was COx in the Cr-based,85,86 V-based,87 and P modified CNT50 catalytic systems at similar alkane conversion levels. The total selectivity of all formed olefins (ethylene, propylene, butylene, and isobutylene) on the h-BN catalyst was over 85% at 10% alkane conversion. This also showed that h-BN may be used in n-butane oxidative cracking to produce ethylene and propylene by decreasing the presence of O2 to shift the dominant product distribution from butylenes (oxidative dehydrogenation products) to propylene and ethylene (cracking products), which may be further enhanced at elevated reaction temperature with high selectivity for propylene (43.9%) and ethylene (24.2%), and the catalytic system remained stable for over 100 h with low total COx selectivity (1.2%).88 Hexagonal boron nitride is known with the low presence of defects. Accordingly, an option to further optimize its catalytic performance would be to increase the number of active sites. High surface area boron nitride nanosheets synthesized by the reaction of boric acid with urea were reported to show high activity for ODH of ethane with nearly 100% selectivity for ethylene at 10% conversion of ethane, which changed to 60% if raising the ethane conversion to 78% during which the catalytic system remained stable for at least 400 h at 575 C.41 When using dicyanamide to substitute for urea in the preparation for high surface area boron nitride,43 its enhanced catalytic performance was maintained in the ODH of propane in view of the 53% propylene selectivity and 18% ethylene selectivity at a 52% propane conversion. However, the operation time of this catalytic system was measured to be only about 5 h, owing to the oxidation of surface BN bonds in the oxidative atmosphere, which may be improved by the addition of ammonia to more than 100 h. Ball-milled h-BN can expose more edge sites with significantly increased surface area, leading to a significant improvement in view of the ethylene selectivity (92%) at 10% ethane conversion in ODH of ethane compared to pristine h-BN (42%).89 The third way to increase the number of active sites is via nanostructural engineering by assembling 2D h-BN into a 3D spherical superstructure. This catalyst afforded a selectivity of 78% for propylene and 10% for ethylene at the propane conversion of 20% in the ODH of propane and operated for 100 h at 490 C, and increasing the temperature to 510 C resulted in high conversion of propane of 58% but bifurcated olefin selectivity (48% for propylene and 21% for ethylene).47 This study also showed that this morphology lowered the apparent activation energy to 175.3 kJ mol1, implicating that lower energy channels were favored on this catalyst.
The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst49 offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues. This h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst was fabricated by chemical vapor deposition using boric acid and urea as precursors, and exhibited 82.1% propylene selectivity with only 3.7% CO and no detected CO2 at 16.8% propane conversion in the ODH of propane with high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV, 576000 mL gBN1 h1) (Fig. 4a). The well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guaranteed the mass transfer process at high GHSV, and achieved a high propylene productivity of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1 h1, both of which are critical indicators for the potential industrial implementation of ODH.49 Fig. 4 High space velocity and low risk of hotspot formation in the propane ODH over h-BN: (a) effect of space velocities and reaction temperatures on the propane conversion and product selectivity over the h-BN/Cordierite catalyst.

The presence of hotspots in the catalyst bed is a typical phenomenon in the ODH of light alkanes owing to its highly exothermic nature, which can significantly accelerate the undesired over-oxidation of olefins, leading to a low selectivity to olefins. It is a consensus that the catalyst design is one of the two key components in an industrial implementation, with another one the reactor engineering, and an ideal strategy is determined by their optimal synergy.9 Boron nitride materials are known with high thermal conductivity (33 W m1 K1), and thus are ideal choices to remove quickly the heat generated in ODH reactions, which is crucial to the industrialization of the ODH protocol. A recent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation compared the hotspot and the temperature profiles in the fixed-bed reactor in the ODH of propane using h-BN and VOx/γ-Al2O3 as catalysts, respectively,90 and showed that the temperature of the catalyst bed increased by less than 1 C in the h-BN catalyst bed which was much smaller than that in the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst bed (8 C) at a similar propane conversion (25%) with a micro-tubular reactor of 6 mm in diameter. The high thermal conductivity of an h-BN catalyst could maintain isothermal operation in such a micro-tubular reactor at even up to 590 C with a higher propane conversion of 45%. In contrast, a hotspot of >5 C temperature gradient was inevitable in the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst bed even at the relatively low temperature of 520 C. In an industrially relevant reactor with an inner diameter of 60 mm, the h-BN catalyst bed maintained a uniform temperature profile (a temperature gradient as small as 1.5 C), while the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst bed suffered from a temperature gradient of 47 C (Fig. 4b). These results suggest that the superior thermal conductivity the h-BN catalyst favors its industrial practice in ODH of light alkanes conducted in a fixed-bed reactor.
The investigation of the influence of reactor parameters on the ODH of propane using the h-BN catalyst showed91 that there was little transport limitation, and the use of SiC as an inert catalyst diluent may promote the catalysis significantly. This work attributed this to the contribution of the surface-initiated gas phase radical reactions, which is different from the opinion in the CFD simulation90 that emphasized the known high thermal conductivity of the catalyst. In this work, the authors reported a volcano-like dependence of the propane consumption rate on the mass of h-BN. This may be the consequence of multiple reasons, e.g. the contribution of gas-phase radical chemistry that did not rely on the quantity of the catalyst, the forming and encapsulation of the catalyst, and other issues, which remain to be clarified.
2.2.2 Silicon boride Silicon borides have a number of phases with a stoichiometric ratio of B:Si ranging from 3 to 6 with complicated morphologies varied from homogeneity to heterogeneity.9294 According to a crystallographic study, the unit cell of SiB6 contains 289 atoms with 281 of them building up interconnected icosahedra (18) and icosihexahedra (4).95 Silicon borides are generally synthesized by melting a certain proportion of elemental silicon and boron at high temperature and pressure, and adjusting the temperature and the ratio of B/Si may result in their various phases.
Silicon borides are widely used as substrates in the synthesis of ceramic composite96 and borosilicate glass materials,97 or as an additive in the modification of carbon fibre/lithium aluminosilicate composites.98 They are also used as an antioxidant coating material taking advantage of the facile formation of an oxide film on their surface, showing their good oxidation resistance at high temperatures.99,100 Though rarely used in catalysis, their rich boron sites and good oxidation resistance endow them as potential catalysts to promote ODH of light alkanes. In a recent study, oxygenated silicon borides were prepared with SiB6 as the main phases and remarkable catalytic performance was observed in ODH of light alkanes including ethane (95.8% C2 at 29% ethane conversion, and 90% C2 at 50% conversion), propane (82.2% C3 at 19% propane conversion, and 88.7% C23 at 31% propane conversion) and isobutane (77.1% C4 and 96.4% C24 at 6% isobutane conversion, and 90.9% C24 at 15.6% isobutane conversion),45 showing superior performance in resisting over-oxidation of olefins at high conversion (Fig. 5). In addition, the light olefin productivity was up to 1.22.6 golefins gcat1 h1, and the silicon boride catalyst in the ODH of propane remained stable for more than 100 h.45 Note that most silicon boride materials have relatively low specific surface areas, and the synthesis of silicon boride with high specific surface may be an effective way to improve its catalytic activity.

2.2.3 Boron carbide Boron carbide (B410.4C) is a compositionally disordered material with rhombohedral phase.101,102 The primary structural units of boron carbide are the 12-atom icosahedra located at the vertices of a rhombohedral lattice of trigonal symmetry, and the 3-atom linear chains that link the icosahedra along the (111) rhombohedral axis (Fig. 6a and b).103 Since it was reported in 1883, various protocols for its synthesis have been developed, including magnesiothermic reduction, carbothermic reduction, vapor phase reactions, synthesis from elements and synthesis from polymer precursors,101 to produce boron carbide with distinct morphologies (Fig. 6c and d), e.g. thin films via direct ion-beam deposition and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition from boranes,104,105 nanorods by reacting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with boron powder, the boron carbide nanoparticles that can be synthesized by reacting multiwall CNT with magnesium diboride at high temperature in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere,106,107 bulk boron carbide by the reaction of boric acid and polyvinyl alcohol at low temperature,108 and fine powder, fibers, whiskers and thin film coating of boron carbide101 by vapor phase reactions.

Owing to its superior properties such as high hardness (29.1 GPa), high melting point (2450 C), high elastic modulus (448 GPa) and chemical inertness, B4C is widely applied in wear-resistant materials, vehicle armor, and strengthening medium. Furthermore, B4C can also be used as a nuclear reactor, neutron detector and shielding material,111,112 owing to its capability to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived radionuclides.
In recent years, boron carbide has been used in catalysis as a support in methanol oxidation113 and proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells114 to load Pt catalysts or directly participated in catalyzed oxidative desulfurization for ultra-deep desulfurization.115 Its activity in catalyzing oxidative ODH reactions was also reported40 displaying the same catalytic behavior as h-BN in ODH of propane with an alkane consumption rate of 4.7 × 103 molC3H8 kgcat1 s1 at 500 C and remaining stable for 2 days (Fig. 6e).
2.2.4 Boron oxide Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form116 featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles with a comparatively high fraction of six-membered rings (boroxol rings) and a portion of non-ring BO3/2 units,117119 with the boroxol rings decaying in the liquid state with increasing temperature.120 Due to its low melting point of boron oxide and its dispersion behavior, when used in catalysis, it is often used as a supported catalyst, e.g. on Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, MgO and zeolites,121125 and it has been reported to be active in the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime,126 cyclohexene hydrogen transfer reaction,127 disproportionation of toluene and isomerization reaction.128 The supported boron oxide catalysts consist of tri-coordinated BO3 species and tetra-coordinated BO4 species, and the proportion of tetra-coordinated BO4 species is closely related to the enhanced Brnsted acidity when increasing the amount of loaded boron oxide.129,130 The morphology of the loaded boron oxide may be manipulated by vapor decomposition of B(OEt)3 onto silica gel126 to produce more active sites and uniformly distributed acidic sites for improved catalytic performance compared to the ordinary impregnation method using H3BO3. Unsupported boron oxide was rarely reported in catalysis.131
Owing to the exothermic feature of alkane oxidation, when used in the partial oxidation and ODH of light alkane, boron oxide was prepared in its supported form to avoid its leakage. In earlier studies, supported boron oxide catalysts on metal oxides (Al2O3, MgO, La2O3, ZnO, etc.) were prepared132,133 for the partial oxidation of ethane, where the B2O3(30 wt%)/Al2O3 exhibited the best catalytic performance in the production of acetaldehyde (selectivity: 2.7%, yield: 1.03%) and ethylene (selectivity: 58.0%, yield: 14.6%) with an ethane conversion of 38.0% at 550 C, but at the cost of emission of a large amount of CO (selectivity: 31.0%). The active site for the initial activation of ethane (CH bond cleavage) was suggested to be crystalline B2O3, but that for further oxidation to acetaldehyde could be different from the formation of ethylene. Similarly, Auroux et al.134 synthesized an alumina-boria catalyst by chemical vapor deposition and obtained more dispersed boron oxide on the support surface for ethane selective oxidation. The highest activity was observed with 30 wt% boron oxide loading on non-porous Al2O3 where the ethylene yield was 16.7% at 18.7% ethane conversion. CO and CH4 were the main by-products, coming from the decomposition of ethylene. Later, Buyevskaya et al.135137 reported selective oxidation of propane to olefins and oxygenates on supported boron oxide catalysts. The highest selectivity of propylene was 42% at 30% propane conversion on B2O3/Al2O3; in addition, the selectivity of C1C3 oxygenates was up to 28%. The trigonal BO3 species present in both crystalline and amorphous phases are active in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, and oxygenate formation was favored in the presence of Al6B8O21 phase. The above-mentioned alumina-boria catalysts also displayed catalytic activity for partial oxidation of light alkanes. However, for ODH of light alkanes to olefins, there still existed a significant amount of deep oxidation products, such as oxygenates, CO and CO2, due to the strong acidic sites generated by depositing boron oxide on amphoteric alumina. Besides, the leaching of boron under reaction conditions led to the instability of boron oxide catalysts.
These supported boron oxide catalysts are deficient in common in the nonnegligible deep oxidation. This is most possibly due to the supports which are intrinsically active to catalyze the oxidation of alkanes.
2.2.4.1 Boron oxide supported on silica In order to remove the influence of the support and figure out the origin of the catalytic ability of boron oxide, Lu's group44 reported a supported boron oxide catalyst synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of boric acid on the high specific area mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15, denoted as BOS catalyst) which showed remarkable selectivity to catalyze the ODH of propane. The BOS catalyst contained four types of boron species (Fig. 7a and b), i.e. boroxol ring (B(3a)), tri-coordinated hydroxylated linear BO3/2 (B(3b)), and tri-coordinated planar boron species (B(3c)) and a tetra-coordinated tetrahedral boron species (B(4)) which were fused into the silica matrix. This catalyst was active at a temperature as low as 405 C, which is about 100 C lower than that of the BN catalyst, showing a propane conversion of 2.8% and a propylene selectivity of 84.1% (C23: 94.6%). Increasing the temperature to 450 C raised the propane conversion to 14.8% with a selectivity of 73.3% for propylene and 87.4% for both propylene and ethylene (C23), and the BOS catalyst was stable during the 30 hours operation at 450 C. Both experimental and theoretical studies indicated that tri-coordinated boroxol ring and hydroxylated linear boron species were the active sites responsible for the low temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes. A study138 of the same catalytic system reported consistent results, in which similar responsible oxygenated boron species were proposed (Fig. 7c) and a selectivity of 77% for propylene and of 91% for overall olefin (C23) corresponding to a propane conversion of 5% at 500 C were obtained (Fig. 7d).

2.2.4.2 Boron oxide embedded in zeolites Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicate materials with three-dimensional network containing channels and cavities of molecular dimensions, and the presence of Al in tetrahedra makes the framework negatively charged.139 In their protonated form, they may be used for acid-catalyzed refining of biomass and crude oil.140 New types of zeolite may be created by means of the so-called isomorphous substitution, e.g. high silica zeolites141 and borosilicate zeolites,142,143 including RUT,144,145 Beta,143 MFI,146,147 MEL,148 MWW,149 CHA,150 FAU,151,152 and UTL.153 Compared with aluminosilicate, borosilicate zeolites exhibit lower acidity owing to the weaker BO bond that was protonated.154 This weaker BO bond can be broken upon dehydration and rebuilt upon hydration, enabling the boron atoms to be tetra-, tri-coordinated or both in the framework.143,155,156 Further hydrolysis leads to the leakage of boron from the framework in the form of boric acid, leaving silanol nests155 which can be used for isomorphous substitution of heteroatoms157,158 or generating mesopores.159
The weak Brnsted acid site of borosilicate zeolites has been confirmed vital to the improvement of selectivity in some reactions, e.g. xylene isomerization,160 olefin oligomerization,161 Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime162,163 and methanol conversion to hydrocarbons.164,165 In methanol to propylene (MTP) reaction, pure B-MFI zeolites were found to be insufficient to activate methanol,166 and those with weak acidity could catalyze methylation which is vital to olefin formation.165 Studies revealed that the acidity of the catalysts was a dominant factor in determining the key step of methanol converting to propylene in the process of olefin formation.167,168 However, strong acidity was shown to be a double-sided sword, e.g. for ZSM-5 zeolite, and may promote the conversion of methanol on one hand, while accelerating the side reaction on the other hand and lead to the deactivation of the catalysts. It was shown that the strong acidic sites of ZSM-5 zeolite may be modified by doping boron to give rise to weak Brnsted acidity, which prevented the formation of ethylene oligomers and resulted in higher propylene selectivity in methanol conversion.142,164,165 Isomorphous substitution of tri- or tetravalent metal atoms (Al, Ti, Fe and V) by borosilicate zeolites is a good route in the production of some new zeolites that need expensive organic structure directing agents (OSDAs), long crystallization time or co-presence of dopant.157,158,169 For example, the Ti-MWW with high crystallinity was successfully synthesized based on the ERB-1 (MWW topology) where the boron acid acted as a structure-supporting agent.170 Furthermore, taking advantage of the high propensity of boron to hydrolyze, its presence benefits the fabrication of mesoporous zeolite, and may increase the mesopore volume by 46%.159 Recently, layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, MWW structure) with defective trigonal boron species was reported as a highly active and selective catalyst for the ODH of propane to take advantage of their specific morphology inherent with large internal surface areas, micropore structure and high thermal stability.171 In these synthesized zeolites, the boron species were classified into five types according to solid-state 11B MAS NMR, i.e. framework trigonal B(OSi)xOH3x(x=1,2), B(OSi)3, tetrahedral B(OH)2(OSi)2, B(OSi)4 and aggregated terminal BOH species (Fig. 8a and b). The layered borosilicate zeolites showed comparable catalytic activity with h-BN in the ODH of propane, and increasing boron content resulted in higher propane conversion with the propane conversion of 5.6%, 9.3% and 30.6% corresponding to the boron content of 1.54 wt.% (BZEO-1), 2.48 wt.% (BZEO-2) and 4.88 wt.% (BZEO-3), respectively (Fig. 8c), among which the BZEO-2 was determined as the optimal recipe which afforded a C3 selectivity of 80.4% and C23 of 91.6% at 15.6% conversion of propane (Fig. 8d). Owing to the large surface area and micropore structure, the catalyst was stable for 20 h under ODH conditions without structural collapse (Fig. 8e). These recipes had similar active sites in view of their similar apparent activation energies in the ODH of propane (Fig. 8f). In ethane ODH, the layered borosilicate zeolite exhibits 30.6% ethylene yield at 37.6% ethane conversion. This catalyst provided a new platform to investigate the influence of the microporous structure on the transport of gaseous species and the construction of a specific chemical environment for boron in the ODH of light alkanes in order to achieve optimal performance.

2.3 Ternary boron-based catalyst: boron phosphate
Boron phosphate (BPO4) has superior thermal stability, high thermal conductivity (ka = 62.4 W m1 K1, kc = 51.5 W m1 K1), strong anisotropic thermal expansion and outstanding oxidation resistance.172175 The crystal structure of BPO4 is featured by a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra (Fig. 9a), isomorphous with α-quartz or β-cristobalite.176179 BPO4 is usually synthesized from precursors H3PO4 and H3BO3, B2O3 and (NH4)2HPO4, or B2O3 and P2O5 at a temperature ranging from 80 to 1200 C.180,181 Other methods e.g. solvothermal synthesis,182,183 top-seeding flux growth184,185 and microwave-assisted methods,181 were also reported.

Benefitting from the coexistence of Brnsted and Lewis acidic sites (Fig. 9b),186 BPO4 manifested itself as an effective solid acid catalyst in organic reactions, such as dehydration,187,188 oligomerization,189 decomposition,190,191 Beckmann rearrangement,192 and alkylation.193 In the study194 of selective dehydration of 1,2-propanediol to propanal by the evaporation method, BPO4 exhibited more durable activity and offered a higher yield of propanal over 95% at low temperature than conventional solid acid catalysts. It was also supported on silica by chemical vapor deposition using a mixture of boron triethoxide and phosphoryl trimethoxide and used in the isomerization of 1-butylene and simultaneous oligomerization of 1-butane.195 In an earlier study,196199 mixed oxides of boron and phosphorus were reported to show activity in the partial oxidation of light alkanes (CH4, C2H6, and C3H8), with high conversion of light alkanes and a wide spectrum of oxygenated products. When the C3H8 conversion approached 53%, the selectivity of C3-oxygenates, C3H6, C2 + C1 oxygenates and CO was 8.1%, 31.7%, 10.4% and 26.7%, respectively. In the CH4 or C2H6 partial oxidation, the selectivity of HCHO and CH3CHO could be obtained as high as 13.7% and 14.2%. In these studies, olefin products did not present as major products, showing that the responsible species in the catalytic system favored mono-oxygen insertion into the CH and CC bonds more than dehydrogenation of the alkane substrates. Note that these studies did not characterize the structure of the catalyst and it is unknown whether the mixed oxides were BPO4 or something else. It is worth carrying out an extensive study to solve these puzzles.
It is known that the preparation of BPO4 crystals often requires high temperature and produces bulk solids with low surface areas. This in general disfavors the exposure of active sites and the maximization of surface area. Methods developed to tackle this issue include the creation of ordered microporous morphology in the bulk of BPO4200 or loading it onto a support. In a recent work, in order to improve the exposure of active sites and the mass transfer, a three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed200 with a robust framework (Fig. 9c), which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with a selectivity of 91.5% for olefins (propylene: 82.5%, ethylene: 9.0%) at a propane conversion of 14.3% at 515 C and a selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product of less than 1.0%. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable olefin productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1, which well outperformed most ODH catalysts (Fig. 9d).
BPO4 was also used as a support in ODH catalytic systems. A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere (Fig. 9e) was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane,48 and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a selectivity of 66.4% for propylene and 18.4% for ethylene at a propane conversion of 24.7%. The loaded B2O3 was proposed in its molten state and worked as the active species, as in previous work of boron-containing catalytic systems, and BPO4 acted not only as a support, but also as a cocatalyst in the reaction.48 Compared to the performance of other boron-based ODH catalysts, this material remains to be improved in its operation stability and olefin productivity (Fig. 9f).
