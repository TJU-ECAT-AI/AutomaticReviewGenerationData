1.The embryonic borosilicate zeolite, with its abundant defective sites and large porosity, is designed to catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Solid-state NMR reveals that the defect-rich structure of this zeolite leads to the formation of boron sites in open coordination, ensuring the exposure of active centers. The enhanced contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, increasing the reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30.
