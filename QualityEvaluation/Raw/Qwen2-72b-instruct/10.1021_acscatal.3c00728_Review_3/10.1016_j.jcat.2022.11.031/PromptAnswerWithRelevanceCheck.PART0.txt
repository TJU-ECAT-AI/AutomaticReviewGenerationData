[1] "The embryonic borosilicate zeolite with abundant defective sites and developed large porosity is prepared for catalyzing ODH of propane reaction."
[2] "Solid-state NMR reveals the formation of boron sites in open coordination derived from the defect-rich structure of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, guaranteeing ample exposure of the active center."
[3] "The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, consequently resulting in the increase of reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30."

1.The embryonic borosilicate zeolite, with its abundant defective sites and large porosity, is designed to catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Solid-state NMR reveals that the defect-rich structure of this zeolite leads to the formation of boron sites in open coordination, ensuring the exposure of active centers. The enhanced contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, increasing the reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30.

1.The embryonic borosilicate zeolite, with its abundant defective sites and large porosity, is designed for catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. Solid-state NMR reveals that the boron sites in open coordination, derived from the defect-rich structure of the zeolite, ensure ample exposure of the active center. The enhanced contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, leading to an increase in the reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30. This indicates that the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites and improving mass transfer. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as the preparation of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for the ODH of propane.
