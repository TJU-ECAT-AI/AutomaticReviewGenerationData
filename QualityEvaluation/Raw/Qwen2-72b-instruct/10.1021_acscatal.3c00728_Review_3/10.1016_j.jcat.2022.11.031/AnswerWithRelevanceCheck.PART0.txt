          The embryonic borosilicate zeolite, with its abundant defective sites and large porosity, is designed for catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. Solid-state NMR reveals that the boron sites in open coordination, derived from the defect-rich structure of the zeolite, ensure ample exposure of the active center. The enhanced contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, leading to an increase in the reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30. This indicates that the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites and improving mass transfer. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as the preparation of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for the ODH of propane.

          胚胎硼硅酸盐沸石,以其丰富的缺陷位点和大孔隙度,被设计用于催化丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODH)。固体核磁共振揭示,源自沸石缺陷丰富的结构的开放配位硼位点,确保了活性中心的充分暴露。增强的气相反应贡献促进了丙烷的活化,导致丙烷反应级数从1.06增加到2.30。这表明,B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特性,通过提供更多的活性位点和改善质量传递,增强了催化性能。将B活性组分掺入这些结构中的方法,如胚胎硼硅酸盐沸石的制备,对于不同的催化应用,特别是丙烷的ODH,是有效的。
