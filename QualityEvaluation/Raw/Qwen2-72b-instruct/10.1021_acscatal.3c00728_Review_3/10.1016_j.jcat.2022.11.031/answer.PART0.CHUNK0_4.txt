1.The embryonic borosilicate zeolite, with its abundant defective sites and large porosity, is designed for catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Solid-state NMR reveals that the boron sites in open coordination, derived from the defect-rich structure of the zeolite, ensure ample exposure of the active center. The enhanced contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, leading to an increase in the reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30.
