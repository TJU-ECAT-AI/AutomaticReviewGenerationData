[1] "The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process."
[2] "Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites."
[3] "The 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability. (97)"
[4] "The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1."
[5] "The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites (Figure 5b)."
[6] "The boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes."
[7] "The 3-D B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramic (B2O3/SiO2@HC-p) catalysts were obtained. (88) With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized."
[8] "The 3-D BPO4 hollow sphere was formed after the attachment, self-assembling, and Ostwald ripening process. (100)"
[9] "The metal-free 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibited a propane conversion of 24.7% and 84.8% selectivity for total olefin (ethene and propene) with the productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C."
[10] "The 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite with surface defect tricoordination B species was synthesized via the hydrothermal method using boric acid and silica sol as the B precursor and silica precursor, respectively."
[11] "The 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite exhibited excellent catalytic performance. For example, when the B content was 4.8%, BZEO-3 could achieve a propane conversion of 30.6% with a propene selectivity >80%."
[12] "The resulting zeolite exhibited high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Unlike the agglomerated oxidized B species in BN and B/support, the active B species in the 3-D structure of the BS-1 catalyst were isolated B with a B[OH···O(H)Si]2 structure."
[13] "The 3-D zeolite structure was maintained and that B leaching was nearly negligible after the reaction."
[14] "The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate using a hard template method, (104) which possessed both rich pores and a high surface area."
[15] "The 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of 1.75 gC3H6·gcat1·h1."
