[1] "The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process."
[2] "Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites."
[3] "The SEM results (Figure 5a) showed that the catalytic film of the h-BN/cordierite catalyst with 4.2% h-BN loading was attached to the monolith wall with a thickness of 3 μm, enhancing the utilization of h-BN by forming a thin layer."
[4] "The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1."
[5] "The significant breakthrough of this catalyst system lies in the remarkable ODHP performance at a low temperature with high propene selectivity."
[6] "The boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes."
[7] "The 3-D B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramic (B2O3/SiO2@HC-p) catalysts were obtained. (88) With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized."
[8] "Moreover, the catalyst achieved excellent olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under a high gas hourly space velocity of 345600 mL·gB2O31·h1."
[9] "The high selectivity of propene might be attributed to the uniform flow distribution facilitating the utilization of the active component, and the catalytic layer wash-coated on the 3-D monolithic wall, which shortened the diffusion paths to alleviate the overoxidation."
[10] "The metal-free 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibited a propane conversion of 24.7% and 84.8% selectivity for total olefin (ethene and propene) with the productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, which is better than several metal-based oxidative dehydrogen catalysts."
[11] "The 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite exhibited excellent catalytic performance. For example, when the B content was 4.8%, BZEO-3 could achieve a propane conversion of 30.6% with a propene selectivity >80%."
[12] "The resulting zeolite exhibited high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Unlike the agglomerated oxidized B species in BN and B/support, the active B species in the 3-D structure of the BS-1 catalyst were isolated B with a B[OH···O(H)Si]2 structure."
[13] "The 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport."
[14] "The 3-D zeolite structure was maintained and that B leaching was nearly negligible after the reaction."
[15] "The resulting zeolite exhibited extraordinary performance in ODHP with an olefin productivity of 4.75 golefin gcat1 h1 at a low reaction temperature (445 C) and a high weighthourspacevelocity (37.6 gC3H8 gcat1 h1)."
[16] "The in situ IR and 2-D MAS NMR results showed that ultrathin B-containing MFI zeolite with a high specific surface area and abundant SiOH groups allowed dynamic self-dispersion of highly mobile B clusters through condensation with the surrounding SiOH groups, thereby contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance and stability in the ODHP process."
[17] "The pore structure of BPO4(OM) was a 3-D cross macropore network, which could effectively improve molecular diffusion and heat transfer."
[18] "The BPO4(OM) catalyst demonstrated an excellent propene yield, much higher than the catalysts reported to date, which had far exceeded the industrial demand of 1 golefin gcat1 h1 with a productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1 at a WHSV of 94 gC3H8 gcat1 h1 and a propane conversion of 20.8%."
[19] "This 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of 1.75 gC3H6·gcat1·h1."
