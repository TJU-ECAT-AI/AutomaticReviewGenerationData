[1] "The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas."
[2] "The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals."
[3] "Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process."
[4] "Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites."
[5] "The 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability."
[6] "An h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst with a well-developed 3-D straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer was prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using boric acid and urea as precursors."
[7] "The SEM results (Figure 5a) showed that the catalytic film of the h-BN/cordierite catalyst with 4.2% h-BN loading was attached to the monolith wall with a thickness of 3 μm, enhancing the utilization of h-BN by forming a thin layer."
[8] "The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1."

[14] "The high selectivity of propene might be attributed to the uniform flow distribution facilitating the utilization of the active component, and the catalytic layer wash-coated on the 3-D monolithic wall, which shortened the diffusion paths to alleviate the overoxidation."
[15] "The molten boron oxide acts as a homogeneous catalyst and suitable 3-D framework supports were chosen to heterogenize the homogeneous catalysts."
[16] "The metal-free 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibited a propane conversion of 24.7% and 84.8% selectivity for total olefin (ethene and propene) with the productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C."

1.B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites typically have porous structures and high specific surface areas, which provide numerous sites for active B species and confined space that influences radical reaction behavior. The pore structure also regulates mass transport during reactions. Loading B active components on the surface of 3-D porous structures or doping them into the framework of porous materials is an effective method for constructing 3-D B active sites. For example, h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts have a well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure that enhances mass transport and catalytic performance. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite can anchor boron oxide active sites, leading to high propene selectivity at low temperatures. The 3-D wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts with B2O3 loading achieve excellent olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production. The 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite, with molten boron oxide acting as a homogeneous catalyst, exhibits high stability and olefin selectivity. Doping B species into zeolite frameworks creates a 3-D dispersion of B active sites, resulting in high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate, synthesized using a hard template method, has rich pores and a high surface area, improving molecular diffusion and heat transfer. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam, with a large surface area and numerous mesopores, shows excellent activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
