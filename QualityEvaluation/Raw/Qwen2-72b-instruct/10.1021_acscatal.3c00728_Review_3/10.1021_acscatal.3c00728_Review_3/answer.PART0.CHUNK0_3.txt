[1] "The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas."
[2] "The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals."
[3] "Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process."
[4] "Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites."
[5] "To meet the heat and mass transfer requirements of industrial applications, the 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability."
[6] "An h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst with a well-developed 3-D straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer was prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using boric acid and urea as precursors."
[7] "The SEM results (Figure 5a) showed that the catalytic film of the h-BN/cordierite catalyst with 4.2% h-BN loading was attached to the monolith wall with a thickness of 3 μm, enhancing the utilization of h-BN by forming a thin layer."
[8] "The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1."
[9] "Recently, Lus group (63) reported a novel approach to load boron oxide with a high loading of up to 30%, with the assistance of the 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites."
[10] "The significant breakthrough of this catalyst system lies in the remarkable ODHP performance at a low temperature with high propene selectivity."
[11] "Therefore, 3-D wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts with B2O3 loading on 3-D cordierite have been designed to deal with this issue."
[12] "However, owing to the loss of surface hydroxyls under high temperature calcination (1400 C) during the cordierite production process, the interaction between bare cordierite and B was insufficient to immobilize the B species."
[13] "Therefore, the cordierite support was modified by an additional silica coating layer that could attach firmly to the cordierite substrate possibly by forming SiOAl, SiOMg, and SiOSi bonds and attach to the boron oxide layer via SiOB bonds."
[14] "Finally, the 3-D B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramic (B2O3/SiO2@HC-p) catalysts were obtained."
[15] "With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized."
[16] "Moreover, the catalyst achieved excellent olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under a high gas hourly space velocity of 345600 mL·gB2O31·h1."
[17] "The high selectivity of propene might be attributed to the uniform flow distribution facilitating the utilization of the active component, and the catalytic layer wash-coated on the 3-D monolithic wall, which shortened the diffusion paths to alleviate the overoxidation."
[18] "The molten boron oxide acts as a homogeneous catalyst and suitable 3-D framework supports were chosen to heterogenize the homogeneous catalysts."
[19] "Aiming at enhancing the catalytic stability of supported B2O3 in the range of 450550 C, the high-temperature SPLC strategy was also applied to prepare a B-based catalyst for an ODHP reaction."
[20] "The metal-free 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibited a propane conversion of 24.7% and 84.8% selectivity for total olefin (ethene and propene) with the productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, which is better than several metal-based oxidative dehydrogen catalysts."
[21] "By doping B species into zeolite frameworks, a 3-D dispersion of the B active site can be achieved."
[22] "Although the MWW borosilicate zeolite comprising intergrown flaky crystals and isolated B species were reported (58) to be inert for ODHP reactions, a new type of 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite with surface defect tricoordination B species was synthesized via the hydrothermal method using boric acid and silica sol as the B precursor and silica precursor, respectively."
[23] "The SEM, XRD, and FTIR results revealed that the MWW borosilicate zeolite was well formed with 3-D flaky crystals of 100 nm thickness and the heteroatom B inserted into zeolite frameworks."
[24] "In ODHP, the 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite exhibited excellent catalytic performance."
[25] "For example, when the B content was 4.8%, BZEO-3 could achieve a propane conversion of 30.6% with a propene selectivity >80%."
[26] "Moreover, after a long time on stream, the selectivity of MWW borosilicate zeolite could be maintained at a high level, but the activity decreased to some extent."
[27] "This is because of the decrease of crystallinity of zeolite, as the content of B could be kept constant before and after the reaction."
[28] "This also proved from another angle of view that the 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport."
[29] "Wang and co-workers (60) reported a B-silicate MFI zeolite (BS-1) prepared via a solvent-free method."
[30] "The resulting zeolite exhibited high activity and selectivity for ODHP."
[31] "Unlike the agglomerated oxidized B species in BN and B/support, the active B species in the 3-D structure of the BS-1 catalyst were isolated B with a B[OH···O(H)Si]2 structure."
[32] "Under the reaction temperatures of 540 and 560 C, the propane conversions could reach 23.8% and 41.4%, respectively."
[33] "In addition, when the conversion of propane was 5.4%, the selectivity of total olefins including ethene (25.7%) and propylene (60.9%) reached 86.6%, exhibiting a low selectivity for overoxidation products (<0.5%)."
[34] "For the 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite reported by Lus group, (59) a considerable loss of activity occurred after the washing treatment because of the decrease in the defective trigonal B species."
[35] "By contrast, the BS-1 catalyst could maintain the catalytic activity after water treatment."
[36] "The ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images verified that the 3-D zeolite structure was maintained and that B leaching was nearly negligible after the reaction."
[37] "Even after a reaction for 210 h, the olefin selectivity remained approximately constant, because the 3-D zeolite framework hindered the hydrolysis and/or dissolution of B species by water under a humid environment during the ODHP process."
