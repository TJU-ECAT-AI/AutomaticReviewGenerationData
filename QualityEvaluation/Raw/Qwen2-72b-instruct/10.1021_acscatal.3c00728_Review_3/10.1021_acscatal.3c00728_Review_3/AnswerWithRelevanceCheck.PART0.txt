          The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites. The 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability. (97) The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites (Figure 5b). The boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes. The 3-D B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramic (B2O3/SiO2@HC-p) catalysts were obtained. (88) With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized. The 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport. The resulting zeolite exhibited high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Unlike the agglomerated oxidized B species in BN and B/support, the active B species in the 3-D structure of the BS-1 catalyst were isolated B with a B[OH···O(H)Si]2 structure. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate using a hard template method, (104) which possessed both rich pores and a high surface area. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of 1.75 gC3H6·gcat1·h1.

          B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites typically have porous structures and high specific surface areas, which provide numerous sites for active B species and confined space that influences radical reaction behavior. The pore structure also regulates mass transport during reactions. Loading B active components on the surface of 3-D porous structures or doping them into the framework of porous materials is an effective method for constructing 3-D B active sites. For example, h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts have a well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure that enhances mass transport and catalytic performance. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite can anchor boron oxide active sites, leading to high propene selectivity at low temperatures. The 3-D wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts with B2O3 loading achieve excellent olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production. The 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite, with molten boron oxide acting as a homogeneous catalyst, exhibits high stability and olefin selectivity. Doping B species into zeolite frameworks creates a 3-D dispersion of B active sites, resulting in high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate, synthesized using a hard template method, has rich pores and a high surface area, improving molecular diffusion and heat transfer. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam, with a large surface area and numerous mesopores, shows excellent activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
