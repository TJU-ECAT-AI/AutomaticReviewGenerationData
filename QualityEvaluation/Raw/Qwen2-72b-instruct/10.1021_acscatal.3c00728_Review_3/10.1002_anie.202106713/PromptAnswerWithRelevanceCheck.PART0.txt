[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."
[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."
[4] "While the sintering effect of the BOx species in O2-treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4% conversion at 520C)."
[5] "Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism."
[6] "In this study, we have chosen four kinds of plasmas (e.g. N2,13 O2,14 H2,15 and Ar16 plasmas) to treat ball-milled BN (Note: in the following context, we use h-BN and BN to accordingly indicate the commercial and ball-milled boron nitride, respectively) thus to selectively construct boron sites with different local environments and investigated the relationship between structure and catalytic activity."
[7] "The different catalytic activity ascribed to plasma impelled us to further investigate the structure of the catalysts."
[8] "The FT-IR spectra of catalysts were given in Figure3a. Prior to the treatment of plasma, the spectrum of BN exhibited the characteristic in-plane B-N transverse stretching vibration at 1385cm1 and out-of-plane bending vibration at 803cm1, respectively."
[9] "After the treatment of plasma, the peak for O-H disappeared in N2-BN and Ar-BN, while a new peak at 3201cm1 was found in H2-BN, which was assigned to the N-H vibration."
[10] "One to note, the peaks at 2517cm1 and 2300cm1 in H2-BN corresponded to the stretching vibration of B-H,5e, 19 confirming the feasible chemical reaction between H2 plasma and h-BN."
[11] "The spectra of all spent catalysts apparently exhibited peaks belonging to O-H vibration, illustrating boron sites were hydroxylated during the ODH reaction."
[12] "Interestingly, peaks ascribed to the N-H and B-H vibration were also found after the ODH reaction."
[13] "UV/Vis DRS showed two absorption lines located at 205nm and 218nm for h-BN (Figure3c), whereas a new absorption line at 273nm was found for BN."
[14] "N2-BN exhibited the band gap of 2.6eV, lower than that of other catalysts, proving that N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
[15] "On the contrary, influenced by new species, O2-BN exhibited a wider band gap than BN, and the wider band got narrower after washing (O2-BN-wash: 2.7eV, FigureS11)."
[16] "As shown in Figure3d, two typical N-defect signals, whose structural models were shown in FigureS12, i.e., g1 and g2, at g=2.004 were observed on the EPR spectrum of BN, corresponding to three-boron center (TBC) and one-boron center (OBC), respectively."
[17] "The peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted (4.0cm1) relative to that of BN, with the obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum (BN: 12.3cm1 N2-BN: 14.8cm1)."
[18] "The result (TableS2) evidenced the increase of B/N ratio on the surface after the plasma treatment from 1.28 in BN up to 1.32 in N2-BN and O2-BN, indicating that the loss of nitrogen was greater than that of boron."
[19] "The concentrations of oxygen increased to 8.3% in O2-BN, illustrating that O2 plasma functionalized h-BN during treatment and remained on the surface in the form of oxygen-containing compounds."
[20] "The B 1s spectra showed that the ratio of B-O raised and the peak of BOx appeared in BN-spent and N2-BN-spent."
[21] "N2-BN-spent contained the most oxygen-containing boron species, corresponding to the best ODH activity."
[22] "The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN."
[23] "The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased as compared to the parent BN."
[24] "Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from 1.28 of BN to 1.29 of H2-BN and Ar-BN (TableS4), the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area."
[25] "The above results suggested the enhanced reactivity was closely related to the increased N-defects."

UV/Vis DRS showed that N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN, while O2-BN exhibited a wider band gap than BN. EPR spectra revealed two typical N-defect signals, g1 and g2, corresponding to three-boron center (TBC) and one-boron center (OBC), respectively. N2-BN showed a blue-shift in peak position and expansion of the full width at half-maximum. XPS results showed that plasma treatment increased the B/N ratio on the surface of BN, with the loss of nitrogen being greater than that of boron.

1.六方氮化硼（h-BN）因其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中将丙烷转化为丙烯的优异烯烃选择性，近年来受到了广泛关注，其性能优于金属氧化物。N2处理的BN表现出显著的活性，即在520C下丙烷转化率为26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%。光谱学研究表明，催化剂中的三硼中心N缺陷在促进丙烷转化中起着关键作用。O2处理的BN由于BOx物种的烧结效应，催化性能下降。催化剂表面的合理蚀刻和化学改性对于提高活性和理解反应机制至关重要。选择了四种等离子体（N2、O2、H2、Ar）来处理球磨BN，以选择性地构建具有不同局部环境的硼位点，并研究结构与催化活性之间的关系。FT-IR光谱显示，等离子体处理改变了BN的表面性质，N2-BN和Ar-BN中O-H峰消失，而H2-BN中出现了N-H和B-H振动。UV/Vis DRS显示N2等离子体能在BN中诱导更多缺陷，而O2-BN的带隙比BN宽。EPR光谱揭示了两种典型的N缺陷信号，g1和g2，分别对应于三硼中心（TBC）和一硼中心（OBC）。N2-BN的峰位置出现蓝移，半峰宽明显扩大。XPS结果表明，等离子体处理增加了BN表面的B/N比，氮的损失大于硼。O2等离子体在处理过程中功能化了h-BN，并以含氧化合物的形式保留在表面。B 1s光谱显示，BN-spent和N2-BN-spent中B-O的比例提高，BOx峰出现。N2-BN-spent含有最多的含氧硼物种，对应于最佳的ODH活性。O2-BN活性低是由于BOx物种引起的BN纳米片烧结，减少了活性B位点的利用。H2-BN和Ar-BN的表面积与母BN相比有所下降。H2-BN活性低可能归因于B-H物种的抑制，而Ar-BN活性不变可能是由于B/N比增加和比表面积减小之间的折衷效应。增强的反应性与N缺陷的增加密切相关。

1.Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has gained significant attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene due to its high olefin selectivity compared to metal oxides. N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C. Spectroscopy revealed that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion. The different catalytic activity attributed to plasma treatment prompted further investigation into the structure of the catalysts. N2 plasma was found to induce more defects in BN, and the peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted relative to BN, with an obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum. These changes were attributed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, indicating that N2 plasma could create more N-defects. The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN was similar, and O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content to N2-BN-spent. These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion under the same reaction conditions. The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sintering of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite having higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN. The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased compared to the parent BN. Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from BN to H2-BN and Ar-BN, the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area.

1.六方氮化硼（h-BN）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中，由于其与金属氧化物相比具有较高的烯烃选择性，最近受到了广泛关注。N2处理的BN显示出显著的活性，即在520C时，丙烷转化率为26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%。光谱学表明，催化剂中的三硼中心N缺陷在促进丙烷转化中起着关键作用。由于等离子体导致的不同催化活性促使我们进一步研究催化剂的结构。N2等离子体被发现能在BN中诱导更多的缺陷，N2-BN中的峰位置相对于BN发生了蓝移，全宽半高明显扩大。这些变化归因于平面内应力增强和层间相互作用减弱，表明N2等离子体能够创造更多的N缺陷。O2-BN-wash和N2-BN的B/N比相似，O2-BN-wash-spent生成的含氧硼物种含量与N2-BN-spent相似。这些结果表明，在相同的反应条件下，两种样品表现出相似的催化转化。O2-BN的低活性是由于BOx物种导致的BN纳米片烧结，减少了活性B位点的利用，尽管其具有较高的氧浓度和与N2-BN相同的B/N比。H2-BN和Ar-BN的表面积与母BN相比有所下降。尽管B/N比从BN略微增加到H2-BN和Ar-BN，但H2-BN的低活性可能归因于B-H物种的抑制，而Ar-BN的不变活性可能是由于增加的B/N比和减少的比表面积之间的折衷效应。
