[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."
[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."
[4] "The different catalytic activity ascribed to plasma impelled us to further investigate the structure of the catalysts."
[5] "N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
[6] "The peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted (4.0cm1) relative to that of BN, with the obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum (BN: 12.3cm1 N2-BN: 14.8cm1). These changes were ascribed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, which evidenced that N2 plasma could create more N-defects."
[7] "The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN is quite similar, accordingly 1.31 and 1.32."
[8] "Moreover, O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content (B-O: 18.2% BOx: 9.8%) to N2-BN-spent (B-O: 20.9%, BOx: 9.2%)."
[9] "These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion, i.e., 27.3% for O2-BN-wash and 26.0% for N2-BN, under the same reaction conditions."
[10] "The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN."
[11] "The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased as compared to the parent BN."
[12] "Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from 1.28 of BN to 1.29 of H2-BN and Ar-BN (TableS4), the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area."

1.Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has gained significant attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene due to its high olefin selectivity compared to metal oxides. N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C. Spectroscopy revealed that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion. The different catalytic activity attributed to plasma treatment prompted further investigation into the structure of the catalysts. N2 plasma was found to induce more defects in BN, and the peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted relative to BN, with an obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum. These changes were attributed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, indicating that N2 plasma could create more N-defects. The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN was similar, and O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content to N2-BN-spent. These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion under the same reaction conditions. The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sintering of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite having higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN. The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased compared to the parent BN. Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from BN to H2-BN and Ar-BN, the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area.

1.六方氮化硼（h-BN）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中，由于其与金属氧化物相比具有较高的烯烃选择性，最近受到了广泛关注。N2处理的BN显示出显著的活性，即在520C时，丙烷转化率为26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%。光谱学表明，催化剂中的三硼中心N缺陷在促进丙烷转化中起着关键作用。由于等离子体导致的不同催化活性促使我们进一步研究催化剂的结构。N2等离子体被发现能在BN中诱导更多的缺陷，N2-BN中的峰位置相对于BN发生了蓝移，全宽半高明显扩大。这些变化归因于平面内应力增强和层间相互作用减弱，表明N2等离子体能够创造更多的N缺陷。O2-BN-wash和N2-BN的B/N比相似，O2-BN-wash-spent生成的含氧硼物种含量与N2-BN-spent相似。这些结果表明，在相同的反应条件下，两种样品表现出相似的催化转化。O2-BN的低活性是由于BOx物种导致的BN纳米片烧结，减少了活性B位点的利用，尽管其具有较高的氧浓度和与N2-BN相同的B/N比。H2-BN和Ar-BN的表面积与母BN相比有所下降。尽管B/N比从BN略微增加到H2-BN和Ar-BN，但H2-BN的低活性可能归因于B-H物种的抑制，而Ar-BN的不变活性可能是由于增加的B/N比和减少的比表面积之间的折衷效应。
