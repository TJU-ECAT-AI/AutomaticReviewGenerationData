[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."
[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."
[4] "The different catalytic activity ascribed to plasma impelled us to further investigate the structure of the catalysts."
[5] "The FT-IR spectra of catalysts were given in Figure3a."
[6] "The spectra of all spent catalysts apparently exhibited peaks belonging to O-H vibration (Figure3b), illustrating boron sites were hydroxylated during the ODH reaction."
[7] "The UV/Vis DRS showed two absorption lines located at 205nm and 218nm for h-BN (Figure3c), whereas a new absorption line at 273nm was found for BN."
[8] "N2-BN exhibited the band gap of 2.6eV, lower than that of other catalysts, proving that N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
[9] "The peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted (4.0cm1) relative to that of BN, with the obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum (BN: 12.3cm1 N2-BN: 14.8cm1)."
[10] "The surface chemical properties of three typical samples were analyzed by using XPS measurement."
[11] "The result (TableS2) evidenced the increase of B/N ratio on the surface after the plasma treatment from 1.28 in BN up to 1.32 in N2-BN and O2-BN, indicating that the loss of nitrogen was greater than that of boron."
[12] "The concentrations of oxygen increased to 8.3% in O2-BN, illustrating that O2 plasma functionalized h-BN during treatment and remained on the surface in the form of oxygen-containing compounds."
[13] "The B 1s spectra showed that the ratio of B-O raised and the peak of BOx appeared in BN-spent and N2-BN-spent."
[14] "N2-BN-spent contained the most oxygen-containing boron species, corresponding to the best ODH activity."
[15] "The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased as compared to the parent BN."
[16] "Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from 1.28 of BN to 1.29 of H2-BN and Ar-BN (TableS4), the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area."
[17] "The above results suggested the enhanced reactivity was closely related to the increased N-defects."

1.Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has received significant attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene due to its high olefin selectivity compared to metal oxides.

Spectroscopy revealed that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion.

1.六方氮化硼(h-BN)因其与金属氧化物相比具有较高的烯烃选择性,在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中受到了广泛关注。N2处理的BN表现出显著的活性,即在520C时,丙烷转化率为26.0%,烯烃选择性为89.4%。光谱学表明,催化剂中的三硼中心N缺陷在促进丙烷转化中起着关键作用。由于等离子体导致的不同催化活性,我们进一步研究了催化剂的结构。FT-IR光谱显示,在ODH反应中,硼位点被羟基化。UV/Vis DRS表明,N2-BN的带隙低于其他催化剂,表明N2等离子体能够诱导BN中产生更多缺陷。拉曼光谱显示,N2-BN的峰位置相对于BN蓝移,全宽半高明显扩大。XPS分析表明,等离子体处理后,表面的B/N比增加,表明氮的损失大于硼。O2-BN中的氧浓度增加,表明O2等离子体在处理过程中功能化了h-BN,并以含氧化合物的形式留在表面。B 1s光谱显示,B-O的比例增加,BOx的峰出现在BN-spent和N2-BN-spent中。N2-BN-spent含有最多的含氧硼物种,对应于最佳的ODH活性。H2-BN和Ar-BN的表面积与母BN相比有所下降。H2-BN活性低可能归因于B-H物种的抑制,而Ar-BN活性不变可能是由于B/N比增加和表面积减小之间的折衷效应。增强的反应性与N缺陷的增加密切相关。
