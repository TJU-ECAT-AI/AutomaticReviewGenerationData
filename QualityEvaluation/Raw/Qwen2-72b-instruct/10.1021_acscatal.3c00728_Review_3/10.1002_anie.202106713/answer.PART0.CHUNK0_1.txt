[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."
[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."
[4] "The different catalytic activity ascribed to plasma impelled us to further investigate the structure of the catalysts."
[5] "The FT-IR spectra of catalysts were given in Figure3a."
[6] "The spectra of all spent catalysts apparently exhibited peaks belonging to O-H vibration (Figure3b), illustrating boron sites were hydroxylated during the ODH reaction."
[7] "The UV/Vis DRS showed two absorption lines located at 205nm and 218nm for h-BN (Figure3c), whereas a new absorption line at 273nm was found for BN."
[8] "N2-BN exhibited the band gap of 2.6eV, lower than that of other catalysts, proving that N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
[9] "The peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted (4.0cm1) relative to that of BN, with the obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum (BN: 12.3cm1 N2-BN: 14.8cm1)."

[11] "The result (TableS2) evidenced the increase of B/N ratio on the surface after the plasma treatment from 1.28 in BN up to 1.32 in N2-BN and O2-BN, indicating that the loss of nitrogen was greater than that of boron."
[12] "The species were detected by OES (FiguresS15,S16)."

[16] "The profiles of NH3 desorption during TPD indicated the presence of one acid site in BN and N2-BN, denominated weak acid, whose desorption temperature was 178C (B-O)."

1.Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has received significant attention for its high olefin selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene, outperforming metal oxides. N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% olefin selectivity at 520C. Spectroscopy revealed that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a critical role in enhancing propane conversion. The different catalytic activity attributed to plasma treatment prompted further investigation into the structure of the catalysts. FT-IR spectra showed that boron sites were hydroxylated during the ODH reaction. UV/Vis DRS indicated that N2-BN had a lower band gap than other catalysts, suggesting that N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN. Raman spectra showed that the peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted relative to BN, with an obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum, indicating the creation of more N-defects. XPS analysis revealed that the B/N ratio on the surface increased after plasma treatment, indicating the loss of nitrogen was greater than that of boron. Oxygen concentrations increased to 8.3% in O2-BN, showing that O2 plasma functionalized h-BN during treatment and remained on the surface as oxygen-containing compounds. The B 1s spectra showed that the ratio of B-O increased and the peak of BOx appeared in BN-spent and N2-BN-spent, with N2-BN-spent containing the most oxygen-containing boron species, corresponding to the best ODH activity. NH3-TPD profiles indicated the presence of one acid site in BN and N2-BN, denominated weak acid, with a desorption temperature of 178C (B-O). For O2-BN, the amount of acid increased, and a new strong acid site with a NH3 desorption temperature of 240C was introduced. The generation of N-defects and their evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed.

1.六方氮化硼（h-BN）因其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中将丙烷转化为丙烯的高烯烃选择性而受到广泛关注，其性能优于金属氧化物。N2处理的BN在520C时表现出显著的活性，即26.0%的丙烷转化率和89.4%的烯烃选择性。光谱学表明，催化剂中的三硼中心N缺陷在促进丙烷转化中起着关键作用。由于等离子体导致的不同催化活性，我们进一步研究了催化剂的结构。FT-IR光谱显示，在ODH反应中，硼位点被羟基化。UV/Vis DRS表明，N2-BN的带隙低于其他催化剂，表明N2等离子体能够诱导BN中产生更多缺陷。拉曼光谱显示，N2-BN的峰位置相对于BN发生了蓝移，全宽半高明显扩大，表明产生了更多N缺陷。XPS分析显示，等离子体处理后，表面的B/N比增加，表明氮的损失大于硼。O2-BN中的氧浓度增加到8.3%，表明O2等离子体在处理过程中功能化了h-BN，并以含氧化合物的形式保留在表面。B 1s光谱显示，BN-spent和N2-BN-spent中B-O的比例提高，BOx峰出现，其中N2-BN-spent含有最多的含氧硼物种，对应最佳的ODH活性。NH3-TPD谱图显示，BN和N2-BN中存在一个酸位点，称为弱酸，其脱附温度为178C（B-O）。对于O2-BN，酸量增加，引入了一个NH3脱附温度为240C的新强酸位点。提出了丙烷ODH反应中N缺陷的生成及其向BOx的演变。
