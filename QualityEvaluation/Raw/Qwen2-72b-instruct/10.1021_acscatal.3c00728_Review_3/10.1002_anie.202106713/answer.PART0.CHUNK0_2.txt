[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."
[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."
[4] "The different catalytic activity ascribed to plasma impelled us to further investigate the structure of the catalysts."
[5] "The FT-IR spectra of catalysts were given in Figure3a. Prior to the treatment of plasma, the spectrum of BN exhibited the characteristic in-plane B-N transverse stretching vibration at 1385cm1 and out-of-plane bending vibration at 803cm1, respectively."
[6] "The UV/Vis DRS showed two absorption lines located at 205nm and 218nm for h-BN (Figure3c), whereas a new absorption line at 273nm was found for BN."
[7] "The Raman spectra showed that only one peak was detected at 1363.6cm1 of BN (Figure3f), representing the high-frequency interlayer E2g vibration mode."
[8] "The XPS measurement was 100mg."
[9] "The surface chemical properties of three typical samples were analyzed by using XPS measurement."

1.The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), have been shown to enhance catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene. N2-treated BN, in particular, exhibited remarkable activity with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C. Spectroscopy revealed that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane. The different catalytic activity attributed to plasma treatment prompted further investigation into the structure of the catalysts. FT-IR spectra showed characteristic in-plane B-N transverse stretching vibration and out-of-plane bending vibration, while UV/Vis DRS showed absorption lines at 205nm and 218nm for h-BN and a new absorption line at 273nm for BN. Raman spectra showed a peak at 1363.6cm1 representing the high-frequency interlayer E2g vibration mode. XPS analysis revealed the surface chemical properties of the samples, showing a ratio of B-O and the appearance of BOx in BN-spent and N2-BN-spent. The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as plasma treatment, have been shown to be effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH reaction of propane to propylene.

1.具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架的B基材料的结构特性，如六方氮化硼（h-BN），已被证明可以增强丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中丙烯的催化性能。特别是N2处理的BN，在520C时表现出26.0%的丙烷转化率和89.4%的烯烃选择性，显示出显著的活性。光谱学显示，催化剂中的三硼中心N缺陷在促进丙烷转化中起着关键作用。归因于等离子体处理的不同催化活性促使我们进一步研究催化剂的结构。FT-IR光谱显示了平面内B-N横向拉伸振动和面外弯曲振动的特征，而UV/Vis DRS在h-BN中显示了205nm和218nm的吸收线，在BN中显示了一个新的吸收线在273nm。拉曼光谱显示了一个1363.6cm1的峰值，代表了高频层间E2g振动模式。XPS分析揭示了样品的表面化学性质，显示了B-O的比例和BN-spent和N2-BN-spent中BOx的出现。提出了丙烷ODH反应中N缺陷的生成及其向BOx的演变。用于将B活性成分掺入这些结构中的方法，如等离子体处理，已被证明对增强丙烷至丙烯的ODH反应中的催化性能是有效的。
