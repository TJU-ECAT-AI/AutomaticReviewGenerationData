Nanocrystalline-Graphene-Tailored Hexagonal Boron Nitride Thin Films†
Graphical Abstract
A hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin film with an atomically flat surface was obtained using unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G). A wafer-scale dielectric h-BN thin film was synthesized on a bare sapphire substrate with the assistance of nc-G, which prevented structural deformations during chemical vapor deposition. The sp3-hybridized edges of nc-G play a key role during these processes.
Abstract
Unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) can act as a useful seed for the large-area synthesis of a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin film with an atomically flat surface that is comparable to that of exfoliated single-crystal h-BN. A wafer-scale dielectric h-BN thin film was successfully synthesized on a bare sapphire substrate by assistance of nc-G, which prevented structural deformations in a chemical vapor deposition process. The growth mechanism of this nc-G-tailored h-BN thin film was systematically analyzed. This approach provides a novel method for preparing high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface.
Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an excellent dielectric material and may be used as a substrate for two-dimensional (2D) electronic devices.1–8 It exploits the superior electronic properties of graphene and other 2D materials without suffering from charge traps, impurities, and charge-carrier inhomogeneity at the interface.9, 10 Atomically flat h-BN nanosheets of micrometer scale are generally produced by the micromechanical cleavage of a bulk h-BN crystal.11 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been regarded as a promising technique for the synthesis of large-scale h-BN thin films.12–19 Although previous studies have demonstrated that an h-BN thin film could be grown on a metal substrate without impurities and BN allotropes by CVD, this thin film was not free from various structural deformations, such as ripples and wrinkles, owing to the submicrometer surface roughness of the metal catalyst and a large difference between the thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of the metal catalyst and h-BN.20–24
We herein present a promising breakthrough that prevents structural deformations in CVD-grown h-BN thin films by using nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as the catalytic seed layer. This h-BN thin film is atomically flat and without structural deformations, and thus comparable to exfoliated h-BN. We utilized nc-G that had been unintentionally obtained by absorption of carbon by a metal catalyst as the catalytic seed layer. Furthermore, a wafer-scale ultraflat h-BN thin film was successfully synthesized on a bare sapphire substrate by assistance of nc-G. For the growth of the h-BN thin film, we employed atmospheric-pressure CVD and a borazine (B3N3H6) precursor (see the Supporting Information). The surface roughness distribution (scan area: 5×5 μm2) of the grown h-BN thin film that was obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) is shown in Figure 1 a. It was thus found that the surface of the h-BN thin film has significantly fewer wrinkles, ripples, and impurity particles. Furthermore, the surface roughness of the h-BN thin film has a root mean square (RMS) roughness value of 0.38 nm, which is comparable to that of an h-BN nanosheet exfoliated from single-crystalline bulk h-BN.11

To investigate the structural properties of the h-BN thin film, it was analyzed by cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Interestingly, it was found that the thin film is composed of a long-range-ordered crystalline h-BN region (in red) and a short-range-ordered carbon region (in green; Figure 1 b). High-magnification HRTEM (white box in Figure 1 b) clearly indicates that the h-BN region has a well-aligned layered structure (Figure 1 c). This fact was further confirmed by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of the h-BN region (Figure 1 d). The interlayer distance between the h-BN layers is approximately 3.46 Å, which is almost same as that of single-crystalline bulk h-BN.12
Element maps that were obtained by energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) indicated that a distinct region of boron atoms (B) and a distinct region of carbon atoms (C) exist (Figure 1 e). The bright red area corresponds to the B mapping of the h-BN region, whereas the bright green area corresponds to the C mapping of the carbon layer region. The element maps further confirm that crystalline h-BN was grown on the short-range-ordered carbon-stacked structure with a very rough surface morphology. In addition, two peaks are observed at 1357 and 1598 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the h-BN thin film that was grown on the nc-G-stacked structure; these peaks are similar to those observed for graphene with a D mode at 1335 cm−1 and a G mode at 1590 cm−1. Considering that the general BN vibration mode (E2g) is located at 1367 cm−1, it can be suggested that the peak at 1357 cm−1 is due to the superposition of the E2g mode of h-BN and the G mode of graphene.25–27 Interestingly, the nc-G-stacked structure was formed on a Cu foil without using carbon precursors at the beginning of the h-BN growth (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Raman spectroscopy, AFM, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) consistently confirmed that the as-formed carbon layer is composed of nc-Gs (Figure S1 and S2).
It has previously been reported that graphene or a graphitic carbon layer can be formed on a transition-metal substrate without any carbon precursor owing to the segregation and precipitation of dissolved carbon into the metal substrate.28 However, the maximum carbon solubility in copper is quite small (ca. 0.04 at %), thus the segregation mechanism can be ruled out for the formation of the nc-Gs in this work. Nevertheless, we confirmed that the formation of the nc-G-stacked structure on copper is reproducible under atmospheric pressure. However, at pressures below 1 Torr, it was very difficult to observe the formation of nc-Gs (Figure S3). Therefore, we suggest that nc-G formation is caused by small amounts of carbon-containing gases in air, such as methane.
The h-BN thin film exhibits an ultraflat surface morphology, whereas the nc-G film exhibits a very rough surface morphology with a RMS roughness of 2.14 nm (Figure 2 a). Furthermore, the rough interface between the h-BN region and the nc-G region suggests that nc-G plays a very important role for the lateral growth of h-BN. AFM images describe the surface morphology evolution of the h-BN thin films that were grown with the B3N3H6 source as a function of growth time (Figure 2 a–d). After 60 minutes, the h-BN thin film exhibited a distinct ultraflat surface morphology, compared to the rough surface of the nc-G film without h-BN growth (at 0 min, Figure 2 a). The h-BN thin film obtained after growth for 90 minutes also revealed a similar flat surface morphology (Figure S4 a).

The current AFM images (i–l) correspond to the AFM images (a–d).
The more reactive sp3 carbon species at the edge of nc-G (Figure 2 e) are energetically favorable sites for edge-initiated lateral growth of h-BN29–35 owing to the relatively weak van der Waals interactions (sp2–sp2 interactions) between h-BN and graphene, which both feature sp2 hybridization and a hexagonal atom arrangement. Therefore, the B3N3H6 vapor reacts more easily with the activated edges of the nc-G owing to the lateral sp2 growth of h-BN (Figure 2 f) followed by the formation of the flat surface. With an increase in growth time, all domains of the nc-G effectively cause the lateral growth of h-BN (Figure 2 g). As a result, an ultraflat h-BN thin film is obtained on the nc-G film (Figure 2 h). However, it was found that h-BN nanoislands with a 3D growth mode and a low growth rate were formed on the ultraflat surface of the h-BN thin film, which led to a film with a rough surface morphology (Figure S4a). Once the ultraflat surface has been formed, only a small number of edges are available for lateral sp2 growth of h-BN. Therefore, the additional growth of h-BN follows the 3D growth mode on the h-BN surfaces16 (Figure S4 b). A current image of the nc-G that was analyzed by AFM (Figure 2 i) reveals irregular currents ranging from 1 to 1.529 μA (1 V sample bias). However, these films become more insulated for longer h-BN growth times. Finally, the optimized h-BN thin film (60 min growth, Figure 2 l) has an electrically insulating surface with a current of less than 143 nA.
To confirm that the growth of ultraflat h-BN thin films can be tailored by nc-G, we studied the direct growth of h-BN on c-plane sapphire (c-Al2O3) with an nc-G layer (Figure 3 a) and monolayer graphene. A h-BN thin film was perfectly formed on a two-inch c-Al2O3 substrate with the nc-G layer (Figure 3 b). Confocal Raman mapping of the superposition of the Raman D band of nc-G and the E2g vibration mode of h-BN (1335–1375 cm−1) showed that the h-BN thin film had been successfully grown (Figure 3 c). The Raman spectrum of the h-BN thin film that had been grown on the nc-G/c-Al2O3 substrate (Figure 3 d) revealed the same feature as that obtained from the h-BN sample on the nc-G/Cu foil (Figure 1 f). The surface of the h-BN thin film that had been grown on the c-Al2O3 substrate using the nc-G catalytic seed layer was atomically flat with a surface RMS roughness of 0.33 nm, which is similar to the surface RMS roughness of the h-BN thin film on the nc-G/Cu system (Figure 1 a) as shown in Figure 3 e. On the other hand, uniformly flat h-BN does not form on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under the equivalent growth conditions (Figure S5). This result indicates that nc-G can act as a useful seed for the growth of high-quality h-BN with an atomically flat surface on an arbitrary substrate.

Generally, 2D materials that have been grown using a metal catalyst in a CVD process contain a large number of structural deformations owing to the different TECs between the metallic catalyst and the 2D material, i.e., positive TECs for metals (TEC of Cu: +16.5×10−6 K−1) and negative TECs for the 2D materials (TEC of h-BN: −2.9×10−6 K−1).23, 24 Therefore, it can be proposed that the formation of the h-BN thin film on the nc-G-stacked structure with an ultraflat surface morphology with very few structural deformations (wrinkles or ripples) caused by thermal stress26, 27 is due to the similar negative TECs of nc-G and h-BN.
Figure 4 a–c presents the XPS spectra of the h-BN thin film for boron, nitrogen, and carbon. It was previously reported that the B 1s and N 1s core levels in bulk h-BN are detected at 190.1 and 398.1 eV, respectively.12 However, we observed that the h-BN thin film obtained in this work has two types of B 1s core-level peaks at 190.39 (BN) and 191.81 eV (BOx, partial boron–oxygen bonding; Figure 4 a). The N 1s peak is located at 397.97 eV (Figure 4 b), which is similar to the position reported for bulk h-BN. The C 1s core level has three types of C 1s core-level peaks, which are also observed for nc-G with no h-BN (Figure S2a) However, the intensity ratio of the CO and CO/COO bonds with sp3-hybridized carbon atoms is different in the nc-G-tailored h-BN thin film (Figure 4 c) and pristine nc-G. Furthermore, no BC and NC bonds were observed in the XPS measurements, indicating that a BCN phase had not been formed. Thus we suggest that the nc-G sp3 edges are not directly connected to the h-BN sp3 edges, and that BO and CO bond formation plays an important role for the lateral initiation of the growth of h-BN from the edges of nc-G.

The role of the nc-G sp3 edges for the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer can be understood by calculating the maximum stabilization energies of h-BN monolayers terminated with B, N, O, and H atoms using the Vienna ab initio simulation package, suggesting that the h-BN monolayers have H, OH, and OH/O terminated B edges (Figure 4 d–f). In a reducing atmosphere (abundant H2), the H-terminated N edge is more stable than the H-terminated B edge. However, in ambient atmosphere, both the B and N edges have a much higher probability of O termination than of H termination. It was found that the O-terminated B edge is more stable than the O-terminated N edge. Furthermore, the OH-terminated structure is more stable than the O-terminated structure when the B edge is terminated with an O atom. A B edge terminated with OH functional groups is the most stable situation. During the formation of h-BN on nc-G, O-rich sites are mainly localized along the edges of nc-G as the chamber is kept in the reducing atmospheric condition by injection of H2 gas and the dehydrogenation of borazine. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sp3 edges of nc-G play a key role in the initiation and lateral growth of h-BN on the nc-G layer without any help of metal catalysts. The maximum surface stabilization energies are summarized in Table 1.

The C 1s core level has three types of C 1s core-level peaks, which are also observed for nc-G with no h-BN (Figure S2a) However, the intensity ratio of the CO and CO/COO bonds with sp3-hybridized carbon atoms is different in the nc-G-tailored h-BN thin film (Figure 4 c) and pristine nc-G.
