Abstract
In this work, we report a simple “one pot” approach to prepare hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres via Ostwald ripening under hydrothermal conditions. Inner nanospace and highly organized crystallites in the shell structure and surface regions can be created with a wide range of controlling parameters. The formation mechanism has been investigated with TEM/ED/SEM/EDX/XRD/XPS methods. The approach shows a high versatility for structural engineering of various targeted morphological products, including inner material refills.

Introduction
In addition to the general core−shell nanostructures, (1−4) there has been an increasing interest in fabrication of hollow inorganic nanostructures owing to their important applications in optical, electronic, magnetic, catalytic, and sensing devices ranging from photonic crystals, to drug-delivery carriers, and nano-reactors. (5−8) The inner “nanospace” of these nanostructures, when coupled with chemical functionality of boundary materials, creates both aesthetic beauty and scientific attractions. Among the many investigations in this area, polymeric colloidal particles have been commonly utilized as templates to support the materials of interest via layer-by-layer technique. (5,6) Hollow interiors can be generated by removing the polymeric core supports. Recently, sacrificial metal templates have been introduced to prepare metal nanoshells that have higher standard reduction potentials. (7,8) During redox electrochemical reactions, these metal templates can be gradually evacuated through surface defects while the resultant metal shells preserve the shapes of original templates. In addition to the above two major methods, it would also be desirable to explore other wet-chemical means, aiming at a simple “one-pot” synthetic approach for important metal oxides. For example, hollow TiO2 microspheres in the diameter range of 10 to 20 micrometers had been recently synthesized in ionic liquids. (9) In addition to this, smaller TiO2 microspheres (ca. 3 μm in diameter) with mesoporous core−shell structures have also been prepared with a combination of wet (solvent used:  EtOH/H2O) and solid-state reactions very recently. (10) In this article, we will report an aqueous synthetic scheme for preparation of monodispersed hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres. With the hydrolysis of TiF4, solid TiO2 spheres can be formed; hollow interiors can be further created in 100% morphological yield via Ostwald ripening after a longer hydrothermal treatment. Owing to this new hollowing scheme, the crystallites formed in the nanosphere shell are well aligned; unique textural structures as well as inter-crystallite channels to the central interiors have been attained for the first time for the anatase hollow spheres. It is believed that the method will allow further preparations of other composite metal oxide nanospheres via a “refilling” process.
Experimental Section
The preparation of the tarting solution of TiF4 has been detailed in our previous report. (11) In a typical experiment, 30 mL of the TiF4 solution (1.33−2.67 mM) was added to a Teflon-lined autoclave, and the hydrothermal synthesis was conducted at 140−220 °C for 1.5−100 h in an electric oven. A total of 37 experiments were carried out to examine various synthetic parameters. In certain experiments, additives such as thiourea, urea, and HF were further mixed, respectively, with the starting TiF4 solution. After the reactions, white TiO2 products were harvested by centrifuging and washing with deionized water. The products were then characterized with a range of analytical techniques, as had been detailed in our previous publications. (11,12) In particular, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX, JSM-5600LV), transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction (TEM/SAED, JEM-2010F), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; AXIS−Hsi, Kratos), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-6000, Cu Kα radiation) were employed in the present investigation.
Results and Discussion
Figure 1A illustrates the formation process of hollow TiO2 nanospheres. As indicated, the solid TiO2 spheres are comprised of numerous smaller crystallites. Compared to those in the outer surfaces, the crystallites located in the inner cores have high surface energies, because they can also be visualized as a smaller sphere having a higher curvature (i.e., higher surface energies and thus easy to be dissolved). When the reaction time is short, the TiO2 spheres have a solid core (entirely dark; Figure 1B). A hollowing effect is observed for those with a longer reaction time. Reported in Figure 1C and 1D, the inner nanospace (the lighter part) of the spheres is further increased in comparison to the shell (darker spherical circle) when the reaction time is longer (20 h vs 100 h). Furthermore, a higher starting concentration of TiF4 will give a thicker shell due to a higher growth rate. It should be mentioned that there was no such hollowing effect observed in our previous work, (11) because those TiO2 nanospheres were single-crystalline (they were epitaxially grown on the (010) surface of α-MoO3). There are two basic types of hollowed spheres, type (i) and type (ii), as indicated in Figure 1A. The nanospheres reported in Figure 1D can be classified as the type (i) that has a relatively dense and smooth surface. The type (ii) spheres have a less compact surface where the extruding crystallites can be observed (will be shown soon). The XRD investigation shown in Figure 2 indicates that the crystallographic phase of all studied TiO2 nanospheres prepared in this work belongs to the anatase-type (SG:  I41/amd; JCPDS no. 21-1272), and the measured lattice constants of ao and co of this tetragonal phase are 3.79 and 9.51 Å respectively. In particular, the crystallinity of the products is indeed increased gradually with the reaction time (e.g., from 2 to 100 h; Figure 2), which indicates that Ostwald ripening (crystallites grow at the expense of the smaller ones) (13) is an underlying mechanism operative in this hollowing process. The stoichiometric composition of the anatase nano-products was further confirmed with our EDX analysis (atomic ratio of Ti/O, 1:2, see Supporting Information). As reported in Figure 3, XPS investigation on the titanium chemical state shows that the binding energy of Ti 2p3/2 is equal to 458.5 eV and the binding energy of Ti 2p1/2 is equal to 464.1 eV, which are identical to that reported in the literature for the same anatase phase. (14) The chemical state of TiIV is thus confirmed.

On the basis of above TEM/XRD/EDX/XPS investigations, it is suggestive that Ostwald ripening is also associated with the chemical nature of ionic species present in the solution during the synthesis. This point is further addressed in the following three different synthetic experiments. When the solid TiO2 nanospheres (2 h; Figure 1B) were separated from the mother liquor and heat-treated again in deionized water for another 18 h, no hollowing was observed. This is understandable, because there is no chemical species to generate necessary ionic transport in solution during the ripening process. When thiourea was added, as reported in Figure 4A−4C, the hollowing process could be accelerated, but no obvious effect was observed when using urea as an additive. The observed difference can be attributed to different chelating abilities of :S═C and :O═C to the titanium cations and different chemical natures of their hydrolysis products. Both EDX result (see Supporting Information) and XPS analysis on S 2p core electrons indicate that there is no sulfur contaminant on the samples synthesized with thiourea (see inset, Figure 3). It is interesting to note that the cellular crystallites of the TiO2 spherical shells are highly organized with respect to a common center (Figure 4B & 4C). The diameter and length of these crystallites are in the ranges of 30−50 nm and 150−250 nm, respectively. Confirmed with SAED in Figure 5, the individual elongated TiO2 crystallites are largely single-crystalline with their axes pointing along [001] of the crystal. It is also noted that the hydrolysis of TiF4 will generate HF, a corrosive chemical that may also be responsible for this ripening process. To investigate this effect, a two-step reaction was carried out with a deliberate addition of HF in the second step (Figure 4D). Indeed, the evacuation of the TiO2 solid core has been significantly speeded up with the additional HF, giving away thinner shells comprising of well-faceted TiO2 nanocrystallites (30−70 nm in size, Figure 4D). Note that some of the spheres are “fused” together forming a peanut-shell-like structure.

Note that there are inter-crystallite spaces formed perpendicularly to the surface of spheres (whiter areas in the central area of Image A and in the edge area of Image B (the framed area of A). Synthetic conditions:  30 mL of TiF4 solution (1.33 mM) at 180 °C for 50 h.
In addition to the above TEM observations, where the observation of hollow interiors is largely based on the image contrast, the hollow interiors of the TiO2 nanospheres is also directly reconfirmed with our SEM investigation of Figure 6 for the as-prepared nanospheres; the same hollow interiors are also observed more clearly for our crashed samples (not shown). Although size of these nanospheres may be relatively large (up to 1 μm in diameter), it has been recently shown that the TiO2 microspheres with hollow interiors are also highly demanded in the application of chemical reactors, etc. (9,10)
Regarding the formation of hollow interiors, it is recognized that the ripening process must involve the mass transfer between the solid core and outside chemical solution through inter-crystallite interstitials of the nanospheres. This is demonstrated in an evacuation-then-refilling process reported in Figure 7. With a high concentration of TiF4, type (ii) hollow spheres were readily formed after 10 h of reactions (Figure 7A). When more TiF4 nutrient was supplied in a second stage of synthesis, the nanospheres synthesized from the stage one could be “refilled” with the TiO2 solid through the shell surfaces (Figure 7B), noting that this process did not cause obvious size change. In view of the well-aligned shell texture attained in Figure 4C, furthermore, it can be deduced that there must exist inter-crystallite interstitials formed perpendicularly to the sphere surface. Indeed, this postulation is further confirmed with our TEM examination reported in Figure 8, where the electron beam of TEM was focused perpendicularly to the sphere center. Brighter contrasts (with a diameter of about 10−25 nm) in the central part of the sphere image reveal these “channels” for chemical entities traveling in and out of the sphere during either hollowing or refilling process. It should be mentioned that the oriented nanostructures fabricated and thus oriented nanochannels provide encapsulated materials with an easy access to the central cavities of the spheres. In addition to the general encapsulation application, this type of hollow nanospheres may also be utilized for synthesis of other composite nanospheres (or other core/shell nanostructures) with the refilling process investigated in Figure 7. Indeed, our recent preliminary investigations have shown that the same refilling process is applicable to other metal oxide inclusions. (15)
By varying the reaction temperature, it has been found that an appreciable hollowing process commences at ≥160 °C, although the TiO2 nanospheres with a solid core can be formed at much lower temperatures. (11) Furthermore, core evacuation time can be significantly shortened by choosing a higher reaction temperature (220 °C, 5 h), as exampled in Figure 9.

The present method also shows a high versatility for structural and morphological engineering. In addition to the hollow structures, the solid core and surface region of a sphere can be further differentiated with a higher dose of thiourea in the synthesis. As shown in Figure 10, an abrupt core−surface interface within the TiO2 spheres has been further attained. This structure can also be viewed as a variation of the type (ii) spheres with a solid core.

Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a simple “one-pot” method to prepare hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres via Ostwald ripening in aqueous mediums. Inner nanospace and highly organized crystallites in the shell and surface regions can be created with a wide range of controlling parameters. This approach shows a high versatility for structural engineering of various targeted morphological products. In addition to the general encapsulation, this type of hollow nanospheres could be utilized for synthesis of other composite core−shell nanostructures with a refilling process.
