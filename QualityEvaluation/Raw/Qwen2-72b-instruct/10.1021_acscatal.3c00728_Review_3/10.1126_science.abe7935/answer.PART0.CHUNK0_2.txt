[1] "Isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
[2] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."

[6] "The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage, which is further supported by the reaction rates under a different atmosphere (fig.

[10] "The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework (fig.

1.The isolated boron in the zeolite framework without oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere due to the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test. The isolated boron in the zeolite framework is inert for the reaction, but the isolated boron in BS-1 zeolite exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP. The 2D 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species. The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures. The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage. The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction. This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution, giving good durability in the reaction process. The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species, which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species.

1.在没有寡聚物的沸石框架中，孤立的硼表现出对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的高活性和选择性，同时由于BOSiOx键的作用，它还能阻止在潮湿气氛中硼的完全水解和泄漏，从而在长时间测试中表现出优异的耐久性。沸石框架中的孤立硼对于反应是惰性的，但BS-1沸石中的孤立硼表现出对ODHP的高活性和选择性。脱水BS-1的2D 11B1H异核相关(HETCOR)光谱提供了B和H物种之间空间接近性的见解。在不同温度下真空下对BS-1进行傅立叶变换红外(FTIR)光谱分析，进一步鉴定出框架硼物种。NMR和IR结果的结合表明，锚定在MFI沸石框架内的硼位点可能会发生水解，形成更多的B[OHO(H)Si]2基团，以促进催化作用，而这些物种可以逆转为SiOB键。同位素标记实验也证实了羟基对反应的重要性。这一特性同时为反应提供了必要的活性物种，并阻止了完全水解和溶解，从而在反应过程中表现出良好的耐久性。B-MWW具有单羟基[(SiO)2BOH]的硼位点，但检测不到B[OHO(H)-Si]2物种，这也支持了二羟基硼物种的活性位点。沸石微孔结构的限制效应也有助于反应活性。
