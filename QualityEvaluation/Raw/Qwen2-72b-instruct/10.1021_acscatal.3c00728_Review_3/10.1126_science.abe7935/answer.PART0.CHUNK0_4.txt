[1] "Isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
[2] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
[3] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A), where the fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework (3134)."
[4] "The dehydration treatment partially removed the water, resulting in the formation of tricoordinated boron (B[3]) with 11B signals at 0 to 15 ppm (fig. S23), which is very consistent with the isolated boron in the zeolite framework (31)."
[5] "The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures, showing bands at 905 to 915 and 1380 to 1400 cm1 (fig. S24), which characterize the isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework, respectively (31, 36)."
[6] "The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage, which is further supported by the reaction rates under a different atmosphere (fig. S36)."
[7] "The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction (fig. S36). This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."
[8] "The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species (29), which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species."
[9] "The B[OHO(H)Si]2 sites were absent in the inactive B-MWW catalyst (fig. S41) (29), and such active sites might be related to the B[4] species in the zeolite framework because B[4] was nearly absent in B-MWW but abundant in BS-1 (fig. S42)."
[10] "The B-Beta has abundant B[OHO(H)Si]2 sites exhibiting high activity and selectivity for ODHP (figs. S44 to S47)."
[11] "The kinetic parameters of B-Beta were in good agreement with those of BS-1 (fig. S48)."
[12] "The reaction pathway of propane dehydrogenation on BS-1 was explored using density functional theory calculation (figs. S51 to S54), where the catalyst framework was taken into account by the extended cluster model with isolated boron functionalized with one or two hydroxyl groups."
[13] "For the catalyst with a dihydroxyl group on boron, O2 and C3H8 were initially coadsorbed on one hydroxyl group through weak van der Waals interaction (R; figs. S51 and S52)."
[14] "The other hydroxyl group in boron was able to form a hydrogen bond with SiOH and further constrain O2, as shown in Fig. 3D."
[15] "In this case, the constructed eight-member ring in the transition state by three hydrogen bonds benefits the synergistic conversion of O2 (3Σg) and propane through the decreasing of energy barriers, indicating the importance of B(OH)2 groups and the nearby silanol species (figs. S53 and S54)."
[16] "By contrast, the catalyst with monohydroxyl group on boron formed a weaker interaction between BOH and O2, as confirmed by the HO distance and the interaction strength of 2.424 Å and 0.165 eV, which cannot build the desired transition state illustrated in the dihydroxyl system (fig. S55)."
[17] "The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework (fig. S56), which shows a higher TS1 energy barrier at 1.700 eV, as indicated by the stronger van der Waals interaction (fig. S57) in the reduced density gradient isosurface."

1.Isolated boron in a zeolite framework without oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere due to the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test. This is supported by 11B NMR spectroscopy showing tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework, and dehydration treatment resulting in the formation of tricoordinated boron (B[3]). FTIR spectroscopy further identifies isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework. The B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure is crucial for catalysis, which can reverse into the SiOB linkage, providing necessary active species for the reaction while hindering full hydrolysis and dissolution. The B-MWW catalyst, with boron sites having a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH], lacks the B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species, supporting the active site of dihydroxyl boron species. The B-Beta catalyst, with abundant B[OHO(H)Si]2 sites, exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the catalyst with a dihydroxyl group on boron facilitates the synergistic conversion of O2 and propane through the construction of an eight-member ring in the transition state by three hydrogen bonds, indicating the importance of B(OH)2 groups and nearby silanol species. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity.

1.在没有寡聚体的沸石框架中，孤立的硼表现出高活性和选择性，用于丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP），同时由于BOSiOx键的存在，它还能阻止在潮湿气氛中硼的完全水解和泄漏，从而在长时间测试中表现出优异的耐久性。这一点得到了11B NMR光谱的支持，显示沸石框架TO4位点的四配位硼（B[4]），以及脱水处理导致三配位硼（B[3]）的形成。FTIR光谱进一步识别出沸石框架中具有四面体和三角配位的孤立硼物种。B[OHO(H)Si]2结构对于催化至关重要，它可以逆转为SiOB键，为反应提供必要的活性物种，同时阻止完全水解和溶解。B-MWW催化剂，具有单羟基硼位点[(SiO)2BOH]，缺乏B[OHO(H)-Si]2物种，支持了二羟基硼物种的活性位点。B-Beta催化剂，具有丰富的B[OHO(H)Si]2位点，表现出高活性和选择性，用于ODHP。密度泛函理论计算揭示，具有硼上二羟基基团的催化剂通过三个氢键构建的八元环在过渡态中，促进了O2和丙烷的协同转化，表明了B(OH)2基团和邻近的硅醇物种的重要性。沸石微孔结构的限制效应也对反应活性有贡献。
