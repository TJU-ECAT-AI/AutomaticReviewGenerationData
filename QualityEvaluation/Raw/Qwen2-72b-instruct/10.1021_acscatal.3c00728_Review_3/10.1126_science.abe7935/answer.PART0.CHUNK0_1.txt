[1] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180C for 3 days."
[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."
[3] "The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures, showing bands at 905 to 915 and 1380 to 1400 cm1 (fig. S24), which characterize the isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework, respectively."
[4] "The 2D 11B11B proton driven spin diffusion (PDSD) homonuclear correlation spectrum (Fig. 2C), where the off-diagonal signal assigned to spatial correlations of different boron species was undetectable."
[5] "The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction (fig. S36)."
[6] "The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework (fig. S56), which shows a higher TS1 energy barrier at 1.700 eV, as indicated by the stronger van der Waals interaction (fig. S57) in the reduced density gradient isosurface."

1.The BS-1 catalyst, a borosilicate zeolite, was synthesized using a solvent-free crystallization method in the presence of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide at 180C for 3 days. The structure of the catalyst not only activates molecular oxygen and propane for dehydrogenation, but also prevents full hydrolysis of boron during catalysis. The framework boron species were identified by FTIR, showing isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework. The 2D 11B11B PDSD NMR spectrum showed no spatial correlations between different boron species, indicating isolated boron sites. The isotope-labeled experiment confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure contributes to the reaction activity, as evidenced by the higher energy barrier in a smaller model without a zeolite framework.

1. BS-1催化剂，一种硼硅酸盐沸石，是在180C下，使用溶剂自由结晶方法，在四丙基铵氢氧化物的存在下合成的。该催化剂的结构不仅激活了分子氧和丙烷进行脱氢，而且在催化过程中防止了硼的完全水解。通过FTIR鉴定框架硼物种，显示了沸石框架中具有四面体和三角形配位的孤立硼物种。2D 11B11B PDSD NMR光谱显示不同硼物种之间没有空间相关性，表明存在孤立的硼位点。同位素标记实验确认了羟基对反应的重要性。沸石微孔结构的限制效应有助于反应活性，正如在没有沸石框架的较小模型中显示的较高能量屏障所证明的那样。
