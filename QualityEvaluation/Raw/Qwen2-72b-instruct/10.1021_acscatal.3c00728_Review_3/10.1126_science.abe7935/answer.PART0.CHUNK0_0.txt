[1] "Isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."

[6] "The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage, which is further supported by the reaction rates under a different atmosphere (fig.

[10] "The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework (fig.

1.The isolated boron in the zeolite framework without oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere due to the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test.

The two-dimensional 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species.

1.在没有寡聚体的沸石框架中，孤立的硼表现出高活性和选择性，用于丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP），这还阻碍了在潮湿气氛中硼的完全水解和硼的浸出，由于BOSiOx的连接，实现了长期测试中的优异耐用性。在沸石框架（例如，BMWW）中，孤立的硼对于反应是惰性的。脱水BS-1的二维11B1H异核相关（HETCOR）光谱提供了B和H物种之间空间接近性的见解。在不同温度下，在真空下对BS-1进行傅立叶变换红外（FTIR）进一步识别了框架硼物种，显示了905至915和1380至1400 cm1的带，这分别表征了沸石框架中具有四面体和三角形配位的孤立硼物种。NMR和IR结果的结合表明，锚定在MFI沸石框架内的硼位点可能会发生水解，形成更多的B[OHO(H)Si]2基团，以增强催化作用，而这些物种可以逆转为SiOB连接。同位素标记实验也证实了羟基团对于反应的重要性。这一特性同时为反应提供了必要的活性物种，并阻碍了完全水解和溶解，从而在反应过程中具有良好的耐用性。B-MWW具有单羟基团[(SiO)2BOH]的硼位点，但检测不到B[OHO(H)-Si]2物种，这也支持了二羟基硼位点的活性。沸石微孔结构的限制效应也有助于反应活性。
