1.在没有寡聚体的沸石框架中，孤立的硼表现出高活性和选择性，用于丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP），这还阻碍了在潮湿气氛中硼的完全水解和硼的浸出，由于BOSiOx的连接，实现了长期测试中的优异耐用性。在沸石框架（例如，BMWW）中，孤立的硼对于反应是惰性的。脱水BS-1的二维11B1H异核相关（HETCOR）光谱提供了B和H物种之间空间接近性的见解。在不同温度下，在真空下对BS-1进行傅立叶变换红外（FTIR）进一步识别了框架硼物种，显示了905至915和1380至1400 cm1的带，这分别表征了沸石框架中具有四面体和三角形配位的孤立硼物种。NMR和IR结果的结合表明，锚定在MFI沸石框架内的硼位点可能会发生水解，形成更多的B[OHO(H)Si]2基团，以增强催化作用，而这些物种可以逆转为SiOB连接。同位素标记实验也证实了羟基团对于反应的重要性。这一特性同时为反应提供了必要的活性物种，并阻碍了完全水解和溶解，从而在反应过程中具有良好的耐用性。B-MWW具有单羟基团[(SiO)2BOH]的硼位点，但检测不到B[OHO(H)-Si]2物种，这也支持了二羟基硼位点的活性。沸石微孔结构的限制效应也有助于反应活性。

1.The BS-1 catalyst, a borosilicate zeolite, was synthesized using a solvent-free crystallization method in the presence of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide at 180C for 3 days. The structure of the catalyst not only activates molecular oxygen and propane for dehydrogenation, but also prevents full hydrolysis of boron during catalysis. The framework boron species were identified by FTIR, showing isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework. The 2D 11B11B PDSD NMR spectrum showed no spatial correlations between different boron species, indicating isolated boron sites. The isotope-labeled experiment confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure contributes to the reaction activity, as evidenced by the higher energy barrier in a smaller model without a zeolite framework.

1. BS-1催化剂，一种硼硅酸盐沸石，是在180C下，使用溶剂自由结晶方法，在四丙基铵氢氧化物的存在下合成的。该催化剂的结构不仅激活了分子氧和丙烷进行脱氢，而且在催化过程中防止了硼的完全水解。通过FTIR鉴定框架硼物种，显示了沸石框架中具有四面体和三角形配位的孤立硼物种。2D 11B11B PDSD NMR光谱显示不同硼物种之间没有空间相关性，表明存在孤立的硼位点。同位素标记实验确认了羟基对反应的重要性。沸石微孔结构的限制效应有助于反应活性，正如在没有沸石框架的较小模型中显示的较高能量屏障所证明的那样。

[3] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A), where the fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework (3134)."
[4] "The dehydration treatment partially removed the water, resulting in the formation of tricoordinated boron (B[3]) with 11B signals at 0 to 15 ppm (fig. S23), which is very consistent with the isolated boron in the zeolite framework (31)."
[5] "The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures, showing bands at 905 to 915 and 1380 to 1400 cm1 (fig.

[9] "The B[OHO(H)Si]2 sites were absent in the inactive B-MWW catalyst (fig. S41) (29), and such active sites might be related to the B[4] species in the zeolite framework because B[4] was nearly absent in B-MWW but abundant in BS-1 (fig. S42)."
[10] "The B-Beta has abundant B[OHO(H)Si]2 sites exhibiting high activity and selectivity for ODHP (figs. S44 to S47)."

[12] "The reaction pathway of propane dehydrogenation on BS-1 was explored using density functional theory calculation (figs. S51 to S54), where the catalyst framework was taken into account by the extended cluster model with isolated boron functionalized with one or two hydroxyl groups."
[13] "For the catalyst with a dihydroxyl group on boron, O2 and C3H8 were initially coadsorbed on one hydroxyl group through weak van der Waals interaction (R; figs. S51 and S52)."
[14] "The other hydroxyl group in boron was able to form a hydrogen bond with SiOH and further constrain O2, as shown in Fig. 3D."
[15] "In this case, the constructed eight-member ring in the transition state by three hydrogen bonds benefits the synergistic conversion of O2 (3Σg) and propane through the decreasing of energy barriers, indicating the importance of B(OH)2 groups and the nearby silanol species (figs. S53 and S54)."
[16] "By contrast, the catalyst with monohydroxyl group on boron formed a weaker interaction between BOH and O2, as confirmed by the HO distance and the interaction strength of 2.424 Å and 0.165 eV, which cannot build the desired transition state illustrated in the dihydroxyl system (fig. S55)."

1.Isolated boron in a zeolite framework without oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere due to the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test. This is supported by 11B NMR spectroscopy showing tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework, and dehydration treatment resulting in the formation of tricoordinated boron (B[3]). FTIR spectroscopy further identifies isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework. The B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure is crucial for catalysis, which can reverse into the SiOB linkage, providing necessary active species for the reaction while hindering full hydrolysis and dissolution. The B-MWW catalyst, with boron sites having a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH], lacks the B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species, supporting the active site of dihydroxyl boron species. The B-Beta catalyst, with abundant B[OHO(H)Si]2 sites, exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the catalyst with a dihydroxyl group on boron facilitates the synergistic conversion of O2 and propane through the construction of an eight-member ring in the transition state by three hydrogen bonds, indicating the importance of B(OH)2 groups and nearby silanol species. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity.
