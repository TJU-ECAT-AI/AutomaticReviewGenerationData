1. The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. This suggests that the pore structure of the support impacts the catalytic performance. The apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3, is also influenced by the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. These findings indicate that the spatial confinement of boron sites and the pore structure of the support play crucial roles in the catalytic activity of B-based materials.

1. 文献没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征，或用于将B活性组分掺入这些结构中的方法的具体细节。然而，它确实提到丙烯的形成速率随源自支撑物的活性硼位点的限制程度而降低。这表明支撑物的孔结构影响催化性能。明显的丙烷反应级数，从1到3变化，也受到支撑物孔结构、B2O3负载量和丙烷分压的影响。这些发现表明，硼位点的空间限制和支撑物的孔结构在B基材料的催化活性中起着关键作用。

The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. The trend in propane reaction order and apparent activation energy on B2O3 can be rationalized by the rate expression derived based on the proposed radical chain mechanism with three distinct pathways of propane activation.

However, it does mention that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. This suggests that the structural characteristics of the support and the degree of confinement of the active sites can impact the catalytic performance. The study of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures indicates that the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane can impact the apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3. This implies that the methods used to incorporate B active components into the structures can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity.
