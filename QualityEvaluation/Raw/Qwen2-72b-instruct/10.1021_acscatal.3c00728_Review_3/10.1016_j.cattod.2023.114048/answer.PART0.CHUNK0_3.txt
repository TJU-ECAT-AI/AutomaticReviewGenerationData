1.The literature does not provide specific details about the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. This suggests that the structural characteristics of the support and the degree of confinement of the active sites can impact the catalytic performance. The study of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures indicates that the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane can impact the apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3. This implies that the methods used to incorporate B active components into the structures can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity.

1.文献没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征或用于将B活性组分掺入这些结构中的方法的具体细节。然而，它确实提到丙烯的形成速率随源自支撑物的活性硼位点的限制程度的增加而降低。这表明支撑物的结构特征和活性位点的限制程度可能影响催化性能。对不同孔结构的二氧化硅上硼氧化物的空间限制对性能和动力学影响的研究表明，支撑物的孔结构、B2O3的负载量和丙烷的部分压力可以影响明显的丙烷反应级数，该级数从1到3不等。这表明用于将B活性组分掺入结构中的方法可能影响催化活性和选择性。
