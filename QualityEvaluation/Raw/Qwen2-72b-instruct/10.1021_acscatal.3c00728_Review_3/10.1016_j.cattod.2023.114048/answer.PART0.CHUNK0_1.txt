1.The literature does not provide specific details about the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it discuss the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support, indicating that the pore structure of the support impacts the catalytic performance. The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. The trend in propane reaction order and apparent activation energy on B2O3 can be rationalized by the rate expression derived based on the proposed radical chain mechanism with three distinct pathways of propane activation.

1.文献没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征的具体细节，也没有讨论将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法。但是，它确实提到丙烯的形成速率随着源自支撑的活性硼位点的限制程度的增加而降低，这表明支撑的孔结构影响催化性能。B2O3/SiO2的表观丙烷级数从1到3不等，受支撑的孔结构、B2O3的负载量和丙烷的部分压力的影响。在B2O3上丙烷反应级数和表观活化能的趋势可以通过基于提出的具有三种不同丙烷活化途径的自由基链机制的速率表达式来解释。
