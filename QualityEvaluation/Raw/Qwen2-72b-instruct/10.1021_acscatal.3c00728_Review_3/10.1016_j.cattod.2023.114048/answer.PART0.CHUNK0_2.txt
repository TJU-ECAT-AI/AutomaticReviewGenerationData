1. The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support, indicating that the pore structure of the support impacts the catalytic performance. The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. This suggests that the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into these structures for different catalytic applications may depend on the specific pore structure and loading of B2O3.

1. 文献没有提供关于B基材料的3-D分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征或用于将B活性组分掺入这些结构中的方法的具体细节。但是，它确实提到丙烯的形成速率随着源自支撑的活性硼位点的限制程度的增加而降低，这表明支撑的孔结构影响催化性能。B2O3/SiO2的表观丙烷级数从1到3不等，受支撑的孔结构、B2O3的负载量和丙烷的部分压力的影响。这表明将B活性组分掺入这些结构中的有效性可能取决于特定的孔结构和B2O3的负载量，这可能适用于不同的催化应用。
