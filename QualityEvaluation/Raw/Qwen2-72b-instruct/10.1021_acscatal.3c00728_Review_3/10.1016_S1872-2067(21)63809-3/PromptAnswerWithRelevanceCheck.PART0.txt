1.The electrospinning synthesis method ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework, which is beneficial for catalytic performance. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high WHSV in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, the porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts show higher olefin selectivity and stability. The electrospinning method is effective for incorporating boron active components into the porous framework, which is advantageous for catalytic applications such as the ODH of ethane and propane.

1.电纺丝合成方法确保了硼物种在开放的二氧化硅纤维框架上的均匀分散和稳定性，这对催化性能有益。具有开放孔结构的一维纳米纤维防止了扩散限制，并在烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中保证了高WHSV下的高催化活性。与其它支持的硼氧化物催化剂相比，多孔硼掺杂二氧化硅纳米纤维（PBSN）催化剂显示出更高的烯烃选择性和稳定性。电纺丝方法对于将硼活性组分掺入多孔框架中是有效的，这对催化应用如乙烷和丙烷的ODH是有利的。

1.The synthesized porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSNs) have a diameter of 100-150 nm and a one-dimensional open pore structure. The electrospinning synthesis method ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the silica fiber framework. The open pore structure not only prevents diffusion limitation but also ensures high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts exhibit higher olefin selectivity and stability. The presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts may cause low propylene selectivity during the ODH of propane. The PBSN catalysts were prepared by electrospinning followed by calcination in air. The TEM image shows a porous structure with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements. The XRD patterns indicate that the B2O3 species are highly dispersed in the fiber structure. The control sample B2O3/gel allows the aggregation of B2O3, while the PBSN-3 catalyst shows higher propylene selectivity than B2O3/gel. The PBSN catalyst is inactive for ethane dehydrogenation alone, but ethylene is formed immediately when a mixture of oxygen and ethane is pulsed into the chamber. The reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5 in both the ODH of ethane and propane, suggesting that molecular oxygen may dissociate on the surface of the catalyst.

1.合成的多孔硼掺杂二氧化硅纳米纤维（PBSNs）直径为100-150纳米，具有一维开放孔结构。电纺丝合成方法确保了硼物种在二氧化硅纤维框架上的均匀分散和稳定性。开放的孔结构不仅防止了扩散限制，而且在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中，在高重量每小时空间速度（WHSV）下保证了高催化活性。与其它支撑的硼氧化物催化剂相比，PBSN催化剂表现出更高的烯烃选择性和稳定性。在硅胶支撑的硼催化剂中存在SiOH基团可能会导致丙烷ODH过程中丙烯选择性降低。PBSN催化剂通过电纺丝后在空气中煅烧制备。TEM图像显示了具有Si、B和O元素均匀分布的多孔结构。XRD图谱表明B2O3物种在纤维结构中高度分散。对照样品B2O3/gel允许B2O3的聚集，而PBSN-3催化剂的丙烯选择性高于B2O3/gel。PBSN催化剂单独对乙烷脱氢不活跃，但当氧气和乙烷的混合物被脉冲到反应室中时，立即形成乙烯。在乙烷和丙烷的ODH中，氧气的反应级数约为0.5，表明分子氧可能在催化剂表面解离。
