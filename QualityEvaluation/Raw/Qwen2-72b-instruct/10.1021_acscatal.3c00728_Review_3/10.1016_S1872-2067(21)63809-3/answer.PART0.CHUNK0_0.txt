1.The electrospinning synthesis method ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework, which is beneficial for catalytic performance. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high WHSV in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, the porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts show higher olefin selectivity and stability. The electrospinning method is effective for incorporating boron active components into the porous framework, which is advantageous for catalytic applications such as the ODH of ethane and propane.

1.电纺丝合成方法确保了硼物种在开放的二氧化硅纤维框架上的均匀分散和稳定性，这对催化性能有益。具有开放孔结构的一维纳米纤维防止了扩散限制，并在烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中保证了高WHSV下的高催化活性。与其它支持的硼氧化物催化剂相比，多孔硼掺杂二氧化硅纳米纤维（PBSN）催化剂显示出更高的烯烃选择性和稳定性。电纺丝方法对于将硼活性组分掺入多孔框架中是有效的，这对催化应用如乙烷和丙烷的ODH是有利的。
