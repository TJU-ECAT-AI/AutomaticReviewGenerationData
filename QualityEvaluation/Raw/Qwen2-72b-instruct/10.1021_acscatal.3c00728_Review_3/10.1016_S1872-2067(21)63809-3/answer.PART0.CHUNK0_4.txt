1.The synthesized porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSNs) have a diameter of 100-150 nm and are produced by electrospinning. The electrospinning process ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts exhibit higher olefin selectivity and stability. The presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts may cause low propylene selectivity during the ODH of propane. The PBSN catalysts are obtained by electrospinning followed by calcination in air. The TEM image of PBSN-3 shows a porous structure with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements. The XRD patterns of the PBSN catalysts indicate the amorphous nature of SiO2 and the high dispersion of B2O3 species in the fiber structure. The B2O3/gel catalyst allows the aggregation of B2O3, as indicated by the XRD pattern. The PBSN-3 catalyst shows higher propylene selectivity than B2O3/gel. The PBSN catalyst is inactive for ethane dehydrogenation alone, but ethylene is formed immediately when a mixture of oxygen and ethane is pulsed into the chamber. The reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5 in both the ODH of ethane and propane, suggesting that molecular oxygen may dissociate on the surface of the catalyst.

1.合成的多孔硼掺杂二氧化硅纳米纤维（PBSNs）直径为100-150纳米，通过电纺丝制备。电纺丝过程确保了硼物种在开放的二氧化硅纤维框架上的均匀分散和稳定性。一维纳米纤维具有开放的孔结构，不仅可以防止扩散限制，还可以在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中保证在高重量每小时空间速度（WHSV）下的高催化活性。与其它支持的硼氧化物催化剂相比，PBSN催化剂表现出更高的烯烃选择性和稳定性。在二氧化硅支持的硼催化剂中存在SiOH基团可能会导致丙烷ODH过程中丙烯选择性降低。PBSN催化剂通过电纺丝后在空气中煅烧获得。PBSN-3的透射电镜图像显示了具有Si、B和O元素均匀分布的多孔结构。PBSN催化剂的XRD图谱表明SiO2的无定形性质和B2O3物种在纤维结构中的高分散性。B2O3/gel催化剂允许B2O3的聚集，如XRD图谱所示。PBSN-3催化剂的丙烯选择性高于B2O3/gel。PBSN催化剂仅对乙烷脱氢不具活性，但当氧气和乙烷的混合物被脉冲到反应室中时，立即形成乙烯。在乙烷和丙烷的ODH中，氧气的反应级数约为0.5，表明分子氧可能在催化剂表面解离。
