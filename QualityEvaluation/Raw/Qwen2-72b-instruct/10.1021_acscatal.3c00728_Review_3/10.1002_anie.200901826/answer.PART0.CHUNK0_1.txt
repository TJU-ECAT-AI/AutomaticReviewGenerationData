[1] "Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."
[2] "The effect of boron oxide was observed for a loading as low as 0.003wt% (Figure1b), thus clearly demonstrating that only a negligible fraction of surface functionalities detected by the applied characterization techniques are catalytically active."
[3] "The propene selectivity increases from 17% to 28% whereas the overall reaction rate decreases from 4.3 to 3.2mmolg1h1, resulting in an improved production of propene of up to 18%."
[4] "The maximum productivity of propene was found at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%."
[5] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs."
[6] "Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent."
[7] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

1.The electron-deficient nature of boron oxide inhibits the dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This effect was observed even at a low loading of 0.003wt%, demonstrating that a negligible fraction of surface functionalities are catalytically active. The propene selectivity increases from 17% to 28% with boron oxide modification, while the overall reaction rate decreases, resulting in an improved production of propene. The maximum productivity of propene is achieved at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%. The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, with only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface covered by an amorphous coating. The good thermal stability of the doped samples indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, with the B2O3/P2O5 filling acting as a backbone against oxidation.

1.硼氧化物的电子缺乏性质抑制了O2的解离吸附，维持了催化剂表面的活性氧物种。这种效应在低至0.003wt%的负载下就被观察到，这表明只有极小部分的表面功能团具有催化活性。通过硼氧化物的改性，丙烯的选择性从17%增加到28%，而总反应速率下降，导致丙烯产量的提高。在B2O3负载为0.01wt%时，丙烯的最大生产力被发现。大部分无定形B2O3沉积在CNT的空腔和尖端，而CNT外表面只有很小一部分被约12nm厚的无定形涂层覆盖。掺杂样品在TPO期间的良好热稳定性表明与CNT结构的共价键合，而B2O3/P2O5填充物作为抗氧化的骨架。
