          [1] "Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."
          [2] "The effect of boron oxide was observed for a loading as low as 0.003wt% (Figure1b), thus clearly demonstrating that only a negligible fraction of surface functionalities detected by the applied characterization techniques are catalytically active."
          [3] "The propene selectivity increases from 17% to 28% whereas the overall reaction rate decreases from 4.3 to 3.2mmolg1h1, resulting in an improved production of propene of up to 18%."
          [4] "The maximum productivity of propene was found at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%."
          [5] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs."
          [6] "Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent."
          [7] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

          Boron oxide, as an electron-deficient promoter, inhibits the dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This effect was observed even at a low loading of 0.003wt%, demonstrating that only a small fraction of surface functionalities are catalytically active. The propene selectivity increases significantly, while the overall reaction rate decreases slightly, resulting in an improved production of propene. The maximum productivity of propene is achieved at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%. The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, with only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface covered by an amorphous coating. The good thermal stability of the doped samples indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, acting as a backbone against oxidation.

          硼氧化物作为一种电子缺乏的促进剂，抑制了O2的解离吸附，从而在催化剂表面保持了选择性的氧物种。这种效果即使在低至0.003wt%的负载下也能观察到，这表明只有表面功能的一小部分是催化活性的。丙烯的选择性从17%增加到28%，而总反应速率下降，导致丙烯产量的提高。在B2O3负载为0.01wt%时，丙烯的最大生产力被发现。大多数无定形B2O3沉积在CNT的空腔和尖端，只有CNT外表面的一小部分被约12nm厚的无定形涂层覆盖。掺杂样品的良好热稳定性表明与CNT结构的共价键合，而B2O3/P2O5填充的CNT作为抗氧化的骨架。
