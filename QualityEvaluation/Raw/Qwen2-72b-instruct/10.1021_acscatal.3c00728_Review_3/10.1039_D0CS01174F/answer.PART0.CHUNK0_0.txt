1.Boron-based materials, such as boron nitrides, silicon borides, boron carbide, boron oxide, and boron phosphate, have unique structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) can be synthesized by various methods, including mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, and can be assembled into a 3D spherical superstructure to increase the number of active sites. Silicon borides have a complex morphology with a stoichiometric ratio of B:Si ranging from 3 to 6. Boron carbide is a compositionally disordered material with a rhombohedral phase. Boron oxide is mainly found in the vitreous form, featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles. Boron phosphate has a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra, with superior thermal stability, high thermal conductivity, strong anisotropic thermal expansion, and outstanding oxidation resistance. The development of three-dimensional ordered macroporous boron phosphate materials can improve the exposure of active sites and mass transfer. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere is an example of a liquid-phase catalyst in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The effectiveness of these methods for different catalytic applications depends on the specific requirements of the reaction, such as the need for high surface area, thermal stability, or specific active sites.
