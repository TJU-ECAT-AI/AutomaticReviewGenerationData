1.The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the edge sites, defect sites, and oxygenated groups (hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, and anhydride groups) of carbon may convert to carbonyl groups in the aerobic environment at increased temperature. It also discusses the importance of the crystallinity of carbon-based catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, and how doping with boron, nitrogen, and phosphorus can modulate the electron density, acidity, or basicity, and oxygen groups on the surface of nanocarbons to enhance catalytic performance.

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) can be synthesized by various methods, including mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, and can be assembled into a 3D spherical superstructure to increase the number of active sites. Silicon borides have a complex morphology with a stoichiometric ratio of B:Si ranging from 3 to 6. Boron carbide is a compositionally disordered material with a rhombohedral phase. Boron oxide is mainly found in the vitreous form, featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles.

1.硼基材料，如硼化氮、硅硼化物、硼化碳、硼氧化物和硼磷酸盐，具有独特的结构特性，可以增强其在氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中的催化性能。六方氮化硼（h-BN）具有层状结构，可以通过多种方法合成，包括机械或化学剥离、化学气相沉积（CVD）和固态反应，这可以增加活性位点的数量，提高催化性能。硅硼化物具有B:Si的范围比例和复杂的形态，为催化提供了大量的活性位点。硼化碳是一种组成无序的材料，具有菱形相，具有高硬度和化学惰性，适合催化应用。硼氧化物具有低熔点和低粘度，可以形成BO3三角形的随机三维网络，这可以通过操纵来创建更多的活性位点。硼磷酸盐具有优异的热稳定性和高热导率，具有由角共享BO4和PO4四面体组成的连续三维框架，可以用来创建有序的多孔形态或加载到支撑上，以增加活性位点的暴露和改善质量传递。用于将硼活性组分掺入这些结构中的方法，如化学气相沉积、固态反应和加载到支撑上，在不同的催化应用中具有不同程度的有效性。例如，在BPO4的主体中创建有序的多孔形态或将其加载到支撑上，可以显著提高活性位点的暴露和质量传递，从而在丙烷ODH中增强催化性能。
