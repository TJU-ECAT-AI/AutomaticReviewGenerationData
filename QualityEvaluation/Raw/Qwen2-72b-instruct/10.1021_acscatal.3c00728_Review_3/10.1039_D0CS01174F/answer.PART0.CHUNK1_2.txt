1.The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the presence of oxygenated boron species at the edge sites or defects is crucial for the catalytic activity of boron-based catalysts. The literature also discusses various strategies for enhancing the catalytic activity of boron-based materials, such as hydroxylation of BN edges, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures. These strategies aim to increase the surface area and exposure of oxygenated boron active sites, which can improve the catalytic performance of boron-based materials in the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

1.文献没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征的具体细节，也没有批判性地评估将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法。但是，它确实提到，在边缘位点或缺陷处存在氧化的硼物种对于硼基催化剂的催化活性至关重要。文献还讨论了增强硼基材料催化活性的各种策略，如BN边缘的羟基化、使用硼酸和二氰胺合成BN以及将2D BN纳米片组装成3D有序结构。这些策略旨在增加表面面积和氧化硼活性位点的暴露，这可以提高硼基材料在轻烷氧化脱氢中的催化性能。
