1.Boron-based materials used as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) catalysts have three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, which enhance catalytic performance by increasing the number of active sites and improving mass transfer. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), with its layered structure, can be synthesized through various methods such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions. The nanostructural engineering of h-BN into a 3D spherical superstructure increases the number of active sites. Silicon borides, with a stoichiometric ratio of B:Si ranging from 3 to 6, have complicated morphologies that can be manipulated to enhance catalytic activity. Boron carbide, a compositionally disordered material with a rhombohedral phase, can also serve as an ODH catalyst. Boron oxide (B2O3), with a low melting point and low viscosity, forms a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles that can be supported on high surface area materials to increase active sites. Boron phosphate (BPO4), with superior thermal stability and high thermal conductivity, has a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra. The creation of ordered microporous morphology in BPO4 or loading it onto a support improves the exposure of active sites and mass transfer.
