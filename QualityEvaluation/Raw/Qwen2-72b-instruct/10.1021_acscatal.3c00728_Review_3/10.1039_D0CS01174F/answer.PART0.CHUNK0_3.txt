[1] "Scheme 1 shows a typical structure of boron-based materials used as ODH catalysts."
[2] "Boron nitrides (BN) may exist in three crystalline forms: graphite-like hexagonal BN (h-BN), diamond-like cubic BN (c-BN), and wurtzite BN (w-BN)."
[3] "With the development of modern technology, h-BN has been synthesized through many methods, such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions."
[4] "The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues."
[5] "Boron carbide (B410.4C) is a compositionally disordered material with rhombohedral phase."
[6] "Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles with a comparatively high fraction of six-membered rings (boroxol rings) and a portion of non-ring BO3/2 units."
[7] "Boron phosphate (BPO4) has superior thermal stability, high thermal conductivity (ka = 62.4 W m1 K1, kc = 51.5 W m1 K1), strong anisotropic thermal expansion and outstanding oxidation resistance."
[8] "The crystal structure of BPO4 is featured by a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra."
[9] "In order to remove the influence of the support and figure out the origin of the catalytic ability of boron oxide, Lu's group reported a supported boron oxide catalyst synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of boric acid on the high specific area mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15, denoted as BOS catalyst) which showed remarkable selectivity to catalyze the ODH of propane."
[10] "A three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed with a robust framework, which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with a selectivity of 91.5% for olefins (propylene: 82.5%, ethylene: 9.0%) at a propane conversion of 14.3% at 515 C and a selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product of less than 1.0%."
[11] "A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane, and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a selectivity of 66.4% for propylene and 18.4% for ethylene at a propane conversion of 24.7%."

1.Boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), boron carbide, boron oxide, and boron phosphate, have been developed for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. These materials have unique structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance. For example, h-BN can be synthesized through various methods, including mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, which can increase the surface area and expose more active sites. The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst can improve heat and mass transfer, which is crucial for industrialization. Boron carbide has a rhombohedral phase and can be synthesized by various methods, including magnesiothermic reduction, carbothermic reduction, vapor phase reactions, synthesis from elements, and synthesis from polymer precursors. Boron oxide has a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles and can be supported on high specific area mesoporous silica to improve catalytic performance. Boron phosphate has a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra and can be developed into a three-dimensional ordered macroporous material with a robust framework to improve activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as impregnation, chemical vapor deposition, and synthesis from polymer precursors, have been shown to be effective for different catalytic applications.
