1.The literature does not provide specific information on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it detail the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the presence of oxygenated boron species at the edge sites or defects is crucial for the catalytic activity of boron-based catalysts. The literature also discusses the synthesis of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures as an effective way to enhance the catalytic activity of BN. By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes.

1.文献没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征的具体信息，也没有详细说明将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法。但是，它确实提到，在边缘位点或缺陷处存在氧合硼物种对于硼基催化剂的催化活性至关重要。文献还讨论了将2D BN纳米片组装成3D有序结构作为增强BN催化活性的有效方法。通过类似策略，功能化硅硼化物、在高表面积SBA-15上支撑的B2O3以及有序大孔硼磷酸盐也被报道在轻烷烃ODH中具有显著性能。
