1.Boron-based materials, such as boron nitrides, silicon borides, boron carbide, boron oxide, and boron phosphate, have unique structural characteristics that enhance their catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), with its layered structure, can be synthesized through various methods including mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, which can increase the number of active sites and improve catalytic performance. Silicon borides, with a range of B:Si stoichiometric ratios and complex morphologies, offer a large number of active sites for catalysis. Boron carbide, a compositionally disordered material with a rhombohedral phase, has high hardness and chemical inertness, making it suitable for catalytic applications. Boron oxide, with its low melting point and low viscosity, can form a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles, which can be manipulated to create more active sites. Boron phosphate, with its superior thermal stability and high thermal conductivity, has a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra, which can be used to create ordered microporous morphology or be loaded onto a support to increase the exposure of active sites and improve mass transfer. The methods used to incorporate boron active components into these structures, such as chemical vapor deposition, solid-state reactions, and loading onto supports, have varying degrees of effectiveness for different catalytic applications. For example, the creation of ordered microporous morphology in the bulk of BPO4 or loading it onto a support can significantly improve the exposure of active sites and the mass transfer, leading to enhanced catalytic performance in the ODH of propane.
