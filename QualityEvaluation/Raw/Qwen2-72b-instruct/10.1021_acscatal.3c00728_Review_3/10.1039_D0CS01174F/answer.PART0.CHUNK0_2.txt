[1] "Scheme 1 shows a typical structure of boron-based materials used as ODH catalysts."
[2] "Boron nitrides (BN) may exist in three crystalline forms: graphite-like hexagonal BN (h-BN), diamond-like cubic BN (c-BN), and wurtzite BN (w-BN)."
[3] "With the development of modern technology, h-BN has been synthesized through many methods, such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions."
[4] "The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues."
[5] "Boron carbide (B410.4C) is a compositionally disordered material with rhombohedral phase."
[6] "Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles with a comparatively high fraction of six-membered rings (boroxol rings) and a portion of non-ring BO3/2 units."
[7] "Boron phosphate (BPO4) has superior thermal stability, high thermal conductivity (ka = 62.4 W m1 K1, kc = 51.5 W m1 K1), strong anisotropic thermal expansion and outstanding oxidation resistance."
[8] "The crystal structure of BPO4 is featured by a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra."

1.Boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), boron carbide (B410.4C), boron oxide (B2O3), and boron phosphate (BPO4), have unique structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance. h-BN, which can be synthesized by mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, has a layered structure similar to graphite, which provides a large surface area for catalytic reactions. The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst not only improves olefin selectivity but also enhances heat and mass transfer, which is crucial for industrialization. Boron carbide, a compositionally disordered material with a rhombohedral phase, has a three-dimensional framework that can provide active sites for catalytic reactions. Boron oxide, with a low melting point and low viscosity, forms a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles, which can provide active sites for catalytic reactions. Boron phosphate, with superior thermal stability, high thermal conductivity, and strong anisotropic thermal expansion, has a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra, which can provide active sites for catalytic reactions. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as chemical vapor deposition, solid-state reactions, and the preparation of wash-coated monolithic catalysts, have different relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications. For example, chemical vapor deposition is suitable for the preparation of h-BN with a large surface area, while the preparation of wash-coated monolithic catalysts is suitable for improving heat and mass transfer.

1.具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中的硼基材料，如六方氮化硼（h-BN）、硼化碳（B410.4C）、硼氧化物（B2O3）和硼磷酸盐（BPO4），具有独特的结构特性，可以增强催化性能。h-BN可以通过机械或化学剥离、化学气相沉积（CVD）和固态反应合成，其层状结构类似于石墨，为催化反应提供了大面积的表面。硼氮化物涂层多孔催化剂的制备不仅提高了烯烃的选择性，而且增强了传热和传质，这对工业化至关重要。硼化碳是一种组成无序的材料，具有三方晶系，其三维框架可以为催化反应提供活性位点。硼氧化物，具有低熔点和低粘度，形成随机的三维BO3三角网络，可以为催化反应提供活性位点。硼磷酸盐，具有优异的热稳定性、高热导率和强烈的各向异性热膨胀，由角共享的BO4和PO4四面体组成的连续三维框架，可以为催化反应提供活性位点。将B活性组分掺入这些结构中的方法，如化学气相沉积、固态反应和洗涂多孔催化剂的制备，对不同的催化应用具有不同的相对有效性。例如，化学气相沉积适用于制备大面积表面的h-BN，而洗涂多孔催化剂的制备适用于改善传热和传质。
