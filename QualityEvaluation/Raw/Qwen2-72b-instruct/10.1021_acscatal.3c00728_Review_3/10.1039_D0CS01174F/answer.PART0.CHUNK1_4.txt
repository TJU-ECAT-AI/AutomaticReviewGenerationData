1.The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the presence of oxygenated boron species at the edge sites or defects is crucial for the catalytic activity of boron-based catalysts. The literature also discusses various strategies for increasing the surface area and exposure of oxygenated boron active sites, such as edge-hydroxylation of BN, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures. These strategies have been shown to enhance the catalytic activity of BN and other boron-based materials in the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

1.文献没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征的具体细节，也没有对将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法进行批判性评价。然而，它确实提到，在边缘位点或缺陷处存在氧合硼物种对于硼基催化剂的催化活性至关重要。文献还讨论了各种增加表面面积和暴露氧合硼活性位点的策略，如BN的边缘羟基化，使用硼酸和二氰胺合成BN，以及将2D BN纳米片组装成3D有序结构。这些策略已被证明能增强BN和其他硼基材料在轻烷氧化脱氢中的催化活性。
