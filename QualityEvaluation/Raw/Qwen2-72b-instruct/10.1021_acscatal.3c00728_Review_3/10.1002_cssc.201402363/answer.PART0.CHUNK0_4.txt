1.The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls, which could potentially enhance catalytic performance by increasing the surface area and pore volume. The effectiveness of different methods for incorporating B active components into structures for various catalytic applications is not discussed in the literature.

1.文献没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征的具体细节，也没有批判性地评估将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法。但是，它确实提到硼不会堵塞原始CNFs的孔，而是覆盖孔壁，这可能通过增加表面积和孔体积来增强催化性能。文献中没有讨论不同方法在各种催化应用中掺入B活性组分的有效性。
