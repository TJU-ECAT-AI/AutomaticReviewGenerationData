1.The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures for different catalytic applications. However, it does mention that boron doping of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) enhances the selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied. For the same reaction temperatures and conversions, B-doped CNFs exhibited higher selectivities to propene than pristine CNFs. The type of B precursor affects the selectivity to propene, and CNFs modified using boric acid as the precursor provided the highest selectivity at isoconversion. The literature does not provide a critical evaluation of the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures for different catalytic applications.

1.文献没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征的具体细节，也没有评估将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法，用于不同的催化应用。然而，它确实提到硼掺杂碳纳米纤维（CNFs）增强了丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的选择性。研究了硼负载量和煅烧温度对B物种和催化转化的影响。对于相同的反应温度和转化率，B掺杂CNFs对丙烯的选择性高于原始CNFs。B前体的类型影响对丙烯的选择性，使用硼酸作为前体改性的CNFs在等转化率下提供了最高的选择性。文献没有提供对用于不同催化应用的将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法的批判性评估。
