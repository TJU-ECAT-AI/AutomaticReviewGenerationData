If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls, which could potentially enhance catalytic performance by increasing the surface area and pore volume. The effectiveness of different methods for incorporating B active components into structures for various catalytic applications is not discussed.

1.文献没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征的具体细节，也没有批判性地评估将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法。但是，它确实提到硼不会堵塞原始CNFs的孔，而是覆盖孔壁，这可能通过增加表面积和孔体积来增强催化性能。对于将B活性组分掺入不同结构以用于各种催化应用的不同方法的有效性，文献中没有讨论。

1.The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures for different catalytic applications. However, it does mention that boron doping of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) enhances the selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied. For the same reaction temperatures and conversions, B-doped CNFs exhibited higher selectivities to propene than pristine CNFs. The type of B precursor affects the selectivity to propene, and CNFs modified using boric acid as the precursor provided the highest selectivity at isoconversion. The literature does not provide a critical evaluation of the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures for different catalytic applications.

1.文献没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征的具体细节，也没有评估将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法，用于不同的催化应用。然而，它确实提到硼掺杂碳纳米纤维（CNFs）增强了丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的选择性。研究了硼负载量和煅烧温度对B物种和催化转化的影响。对于相同的反应温度和转化率，B掺杂CNFs对丙烯的选择性高于原始CNFs。B前体的类型影响对丙烯的选择性，使用硼酸作为前体改性的CNFs在等转化率下提供了最高的选择性。文献没有提供对用于不同催化应用的将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法的批判性评估。
