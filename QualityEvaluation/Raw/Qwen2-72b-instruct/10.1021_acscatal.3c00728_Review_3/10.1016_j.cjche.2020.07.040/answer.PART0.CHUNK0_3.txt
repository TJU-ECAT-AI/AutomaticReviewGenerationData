[1] "The SiO2 and B2O3 sequentially coated honeycomb cordierite catalyst is designed by a two-step wash-coat method with different B2O3 loadings (0.1%10%) and calcination temperatures (600, 700, 800C)."
[2] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."
[3] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1, leading to a high propylene space time yield of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1 by suppressing the overoxidation."

1. The B2O3-SiO2 wash-coated monolithic catalyst was prepared by a two-step wash-coat method, with different B2O3 loadings and calcination temperatures. The honeycomb cordierite structure has well-developed straight channels, allowing for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and effective pore diffusion facilitated by the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer. This design leads to good catalytic performance, with high propylene and olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production, even at high GHSV, resulting in a high propylene space time yield.

1. B2O3-SiO2洗涂型整体催化剂通过两步洗涂法制备，具有不同的B2O3负载量和煅烧温度。蜂窝状堇青石结构具有发达的直通道，允许高气体小时空间速度（GHSV），并由薄的洗涂B2O3层有效地促进孔扩散。这种设计导致良好的催化性能，具有高丙烯和烯烃选择性，以及几乎可以忽略的CO2产生，即使在高GHSV下，也导致高丙烯空间时间产量。
