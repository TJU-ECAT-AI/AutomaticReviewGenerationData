[1] "The SiO2 and B2O3 sequentially coated honeycomb cordierite catalyst is designed by a two-step wash-coat method with different B2O3 loadings (0.1%10%) and calcination temperatures (600, 700, 800C)."
[2] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."
[3] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1, leading to a high propylene space time yield of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1 by suppressing the overoxidation."
[4] "The obtained results strongly indicate that the boron-based monolithic catalyst can be properly fabricated to warrant the high activity and high throughput with its high gas/surface ratio and straight channels."

1. The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are designed by a two-step wash-coat method, which involves the sequential coating of SiO2 and B2O3 on honeycomb cordierite. The honeycomb structure has well-developed straight channels that allow for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and effective pore diffusion. The thin wash-coated B2O3 layer facilitates the dispersion of active sites and improves catalytic performance. The catalyst exhibits high propylene and olefin selectivity, negligible CO2 production, and high propylene space time yield under high GHSV, indicating the effectiveness of the method for incorporating B active components into the structure for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The high gas/surface ratio and straight channels of the monolithic structure contribute to the high activity and throughput of the catalyst.

1. B基材料的3-D分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征是通过两步洗涤涂层法设计的，该方法涉及在蜂窝状堇青石上依次涂覆SiO2和B2O3。蜂窝结构具有发达的直通道，允许高气体小时空间速度（GHSV）和有效的孔扩散。薄的洗涤涂层B2O3层促进了活性位点的分散，提高了催化性能。催化剂在高GHSV下表现出高丙烯和烯烃选择性，CO2产量可忽略不计，丙烯空间时间产率高，表明该方法在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中将B活性组分掺入结构中的有效性。催化剂的高活性和高通量归因于其高气体/表面比和直通道的蜂窝状结构。
