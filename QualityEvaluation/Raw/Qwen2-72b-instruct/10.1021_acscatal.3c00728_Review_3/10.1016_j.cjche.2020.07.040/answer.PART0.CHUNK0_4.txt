[1] "The SiO2 and B2O3 sequentially coated honeycomb cordierite catalyst is designed by a two-step wash-coat method with different B2O3 loadings (0.1%10%) and calcination temperatures (600, 700, 800C)."
[2] "SiO2 obtained by TEOS hydrolysis acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups."
[3] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."
[4] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1, leading to a high propylene space time yield of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1 by suppressing the overoxidation."

1.The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst was designed and prepared by a two-step wash-coat method, with different B2O3 loadings and calcination temperatures. SiO2 acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups. The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst. The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity, olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production under high GHSV, leading to a high propylene space time yield by suppressing the overoxidation.

1.通过两步洗涤涂层法设计并制备了B2O3/SiO2@HC多孔催化剂，具有不同的B2O3负载量和煅烧温度。SiO2通过丰富的SiOH基团作为媒介层，连接了堇青石基底和硼氧化物。堇青石蜂窝状的发达直通道使其能够在高气体小时空间速度（GHSV）下进行反应，而薄层洗涤涂层的B2O3可以有效地促进催化剂上的孔扩散。在低硼氧化物负载下，制备的B2O3/SiO2@HC多孔催化剂表现出良好的催化性能，实现了优异的丙烯选择性、烯烃选择性和几乎可以忽略的CO2产生，在高GHSV下，通过抑制过度氧化，实现了高丙烯空间时间产率。
