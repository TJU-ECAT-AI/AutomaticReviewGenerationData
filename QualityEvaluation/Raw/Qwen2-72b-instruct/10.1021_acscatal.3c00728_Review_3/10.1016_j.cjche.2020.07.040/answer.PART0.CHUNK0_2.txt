[1] "The SiO2 and B2O3 sequentially coated honeycomb cordierite catalyst is designed by a two-step wash-coat method with different B2O3 loadings (0.1%10%) and calcination temperatures (600, 700, 800C)."
[2] "SiO2 obtained by TEOS hydrolysis acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups."
[3] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."
[4] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1, leading to a high propylene space time yield of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1 by suppressing the overoxidation."

1.The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are achieved through a two-step wash-coat method, where SiO2 acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups. The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite allow for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and effective pore diffusion on the catalyst. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst shows good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading, achieving high propylene and olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production under high GHSV, leading to a high propylene space time yield. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

1.具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料的多孔框架的结构特征是通过两步洗涤涂层方法实现的，其中SiO2作为介质层，通过丰富的SiOH基团将堇青石基底和硼氧化物连接起来。堇青石蜂窝结构的发达直通道允许高气体小时空间速度（GHSV）和催化剂上的有效孔扩散。B2O3/SiO2@HC蜂窝催化剂在低硼氧化物负载下表现出良好的催化性能，实现了高丙烯和烯烃选择性以及在高GHSV下可忽略的CO2产量，导致高丙烯空间时间产量。将B活性组分掺入这些结构中的方法对于不同的催化应用是有效的，特别是对于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）。
