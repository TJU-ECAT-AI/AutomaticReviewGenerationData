[1] "The SiO2 and B2O3 sequentially coated honeycomb cordierite catalyst is designed by a two-step wash-coat method with different B2O3 loadings (0.1%10%) and calcination temperatures (600, 700, 800C)."
[2] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."
[3] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1, leading to a high propylene space time yield of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1 by suppressing the overoxidation."

1. The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are designed by a two-step wash-coat method, which involves the sequential coating of SiO2 and B2O3 on honeycomb cordierite. The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite allow for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and effective pore diffusion facilitated by the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer. These features enhance catalytic performance, achieving excellent propylene and olefin selectivity, negligible CO2 production, and high propylene space time yield under high GHSV by suppressing overoxidation. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as the two-step wash-coat method, are effective for achieving high catalytic performance in different catalytic applications, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1. B基材料具有3-D分散的活性位点和多孔框架的结构特征，通过两步涂覆法设计，涉及在蜂窝状堇青石上依次涂覆SiO2和B2O3。蜂窝状堇青石的发达直通道允许高气体小时空间速度（GHSV），并由薄涂覆的B2O3层有效促进孔扩散。这些特征通过抑制过度氧化，在高GHSV下实现了优异的丙烯和烯烃选择性，可忽略的CO2产生，以及高丙烯空间时间产率，从而增强了催化性能。用于将B活性组分掺入这些结构中的方法，如两步涂覆法，对于在不同的催化应用中实现高催化性能是有效的，特别是在丙烷氧化脱氢中。
