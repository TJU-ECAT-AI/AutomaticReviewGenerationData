[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."
[2] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite."
[3] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species."
[4] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."
[5] "Enabling boron species to be uniformly anchored to hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix in oligomeric form may be a feasible way to construct highly active boron centers."

1.The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as borosilicate zeolites, enhance catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP, whereas defect boron sites and aggregated boron species are essential for catalyzing the reaction, with the latter being more efficient in CH bond activation of propane. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center for catalyzing ODHP at low temperatures. Uniformly anchoring boron species to a hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix in an oligomeric form is a feasible method to construct highly active boron centers.

1.具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架中的B基材料的结构特性，如硼硅酸盐沸石，在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中提高了催化性能。完全嵌入沸石框架的孤立B(OSi)3单元对ODHP是不活跃的，而缺陷硼位点和聚集的硼物种对于催化反应至关重要，后者在丙烷的CH键活化中更有效。在与相邻SiOH基团形成氢键的聚集BOx物种中的BOH基团被鉴定为在低温下催化ODHP的活性中心。将硼物种均匀地锚定在富含羟基的MFI型沸石基质中，形成寡聚形式，是构建高活性硼中心的一种可行方法。
