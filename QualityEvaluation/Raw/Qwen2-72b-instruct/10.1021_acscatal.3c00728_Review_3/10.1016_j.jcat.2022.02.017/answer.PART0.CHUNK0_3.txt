[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."
[2] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite."
[3] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species."
[4] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."
[5] "In this work, a series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared, and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction."
[6] "The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions."
[7] "It turned out to be that the catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature."
[8] "Structure characterizations revealed that the incomplete crystallization could enrich the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, which were responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts."

1.The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as borosilicate zeolites, enhance catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The isolated B(OSi)3 units incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP, whereas defect boron sites and aggregated boron species are essential for catalyzing the reaction, with the latter being more efficient in CH bond activation of propane. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center for catalyzing ODHP at low temperatures. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions to regulate crystallinity, with low crystallinity catalysts exhibiting superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperatures. The incomplete crystallization enriches the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, which are responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts.

1.具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架中B基材料的结构特性，如硼硅酸盐沸石，在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中增强了催化性能。完全融入沸石框架的孤立B(OSi)3单元对ODHP是不活跃的，而缺陷硼位点和聚集的硼物种对于催化反应是必不可少的，后者在丙烷的CH键活化中更有效。在与相邻SiOH基团形成氢键的聚集BOx物种中的BOH基团被鉴定为在低温下催化ODHP的活性中心。将B活性组分纳入这些结构的方法包括调整水热合成条件以调节结晶度，结晶度低的催化剂在低温下表现出优越的活性和更高的烯烃生产力。不完全结晶丰富了与相邻硅醇形成氢键的缺陷硼位点，这些位点对BMFI催化剂的优越催化活性负责。
