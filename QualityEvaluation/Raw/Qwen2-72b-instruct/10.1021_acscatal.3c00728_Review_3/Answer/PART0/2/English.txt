The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include the synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites, the presence of boron in the framework confirmed by FT-IR spectra, and the confirmation of the MWW structure by XRD patterns. The materials exhibit predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores, and the active sites are identified as defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) by 11B MAS NMR spectra. These features enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for active site dispersion, promoting the formation of the desired products, and maintaining stability under reaction conditions.
