[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."
          [2] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite."
          [3] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species."
          [4] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."
          [5] "In this work, a series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared, and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction."
          [6] "The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions."
          [7] "It turned out to be that the catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature."
          [8] "Structure characterizations revealed that the incomplete crystallization could enrich the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, which were responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts."

[1] "Isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
          [2] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
          [3] "The isolated boron in the zeolite framework (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."
          [4] "The two-dimensional (2D) 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species."
          [5] "The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures, showing bands at 905 to 915 and 1380 to 1400 cm1 (fig. S24), which characterize the isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework, respectively."
          [6] "The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage, which is further supported by the reaction rates under a different atmosphere (fig. S36)."
          [7] "The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction (fig. S36)."
          [8] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."
          [9] "The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species (29), which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species."
          [10] "The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework (fig. S56), which shows a higher TS1 energy barrier at 1.700 eV, as indicated by the stronger van der Waals interaction (fig. S57) in the reduced density gradient isosurface."

The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites. The 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability. (97) The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites (Figure 5b). The boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes. The 3-D B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramic (B2O3/SiO2@HC-p) catalysts were obtained. (88) With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized. The 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport. The resulting zeolite exhibited high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Unlike the agglomerated oxidized B species in BN and B/support, the active B species in the 3-D structure of the BS-1 catalyst were isolated B with a B[OH···O(H)Si]2 structure. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate using a hard template method, (104) which possessed both rich pores and a high surface area. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of 1.75 gC3H6·gcat1·h1.

Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized.
          The MWW borosilicate lamellar precursor was synthesized hydrothermally according to earlier report, with slight modifications.
          The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape, featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores.
          The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively, making it clear that the heteroatom boron inserted into the framework of zeolites.
          The layered borosilicate zeolite catalyze ethane ODH at a slightly higher temperature range of 560590 C, which is due to more energetically demanded activation of primary CH bonds in ethane.
          The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene.

          [11] "The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."
          [12] "The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion."
          [13] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction."

[1] "Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."
          [2] "The effect of boron oxide was observed for a loading as low as 0.003wt% (Figure1b), thus clearly demonstrating that only a negligible fraction of surface functionalities detected by the applied characterization techniques are catalytically active."

B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method.
          A phenomenon of tertiary aggregation was observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4.
          Melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species.
          B2O3@BPO4 exhibited excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability at 550 C.
          B2O3 is a typical inorganic oxide with a melting point of 450 C, and the viscosity of its melting phase changes with temperature.
          B2O3 is also an important catalyst component in hydrocarbon conversions.
          For traditional supported catalysts, to gain more active sites, hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports.
          The preparation process is tedious, including the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites.
          Therefore, it is expected to synthesize hollow sphere structures using a simple approach and make the best use of both sides of hollow spheres.
          At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a high stability at 550 C.
          The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts has been emerging as an important research trend because of their low cost and ecofriendly properties as compared with metal-based catalysts.
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature.
          In the process of formation, we found not only two conventional particle aggregations (primary and secondary aggregation) and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation (denoted as tertiary aggregation).
          A white particle was obtained through slightly finer grinding and labeled as B2O3@BPO4-800.
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.

          However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperature is considered a vital problem for B2O3-containing catalysts.
          Interestingly, from another angle, low volatility and high melting point make B2O3 possible for use as a high-temperature SPLC once a suitable support is available.
          Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures.
          Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing.
          The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature.
          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          A metal-free B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.
          Furthermore, the reaction follows EleyRideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to PC3H8.

[1] "Boron-containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins."
          [2] "It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06) layer."
          [3] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."
          [4] "However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."
          [5] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."
          [6] "The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides."
          [7] "The large distribution of boron sites in active materials and their dynamic nature under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s)."
          [8] "To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary."
          [9] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure."
          [10] "The successful synthesis of the MWW framework was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (FigureS1) and N2 physisorption (SBET=498m2g1)."
          [11] "The boron loading was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to be 1.10.1wt.%. This loading is within the 0.232.20wt.% range for B/SiO2 catalysts made by incipient wetness impregnation that all showed significant conversion under our ODH reaction conditions."
          [12] "The 11B isotropic chemical shift (δiso), electric field gradient asymmetry parameter (η) and quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species."
          [13] "The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."
          [14] "The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches our results very well, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species."
          [15] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
          [16] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
          [17] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
          [18] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site."
          [19] "Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

Scheme 1 shows a typical structure of boron-based materials used as ODH catalysts.
          Boron nitrides (BN) may exist in three crystalline forms: graphite-like hexagonal BN (h-BN), diamond-like cubic BN (c-BN), and wurtzite BN (w-BN).
          With the development of modern technology, h-BN has been synthesized through many methods, such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions.
          The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues.
          Silicon borides have a number of phases with a stoichiometric ratio of B:Si ranging from 3 to 6 with complicated morphologies varied from homogeneity to heterogeneity.

          Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles with a comparatively high fraction of six-membered rings (boroxol rings) and a portion of non-ring BO3/2 units.
          Boron phosphate (BPO4) has superior thermal stability, high thermal conductivity (ka = 62.4 W m1 K1, kc = 51.5 W m1 K1), strong anisotropic thermal expansion and outstanding oxidation resistance.
          The crystal structure of BPO4 is featured by a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra.
          In order to remove the influence of the support and figure out the origin of the catalytic ability of boron oxide, Lu's group reported a supported boron oxide catalyst synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of boric acid on the high specific area mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15, denoted as BOS catalyst) which showed remarkable selectivity to catalyze the ODH of propane.
          A three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed with a robust framework, which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with a selectivity of 91.5% for olefins (propylene: 82.5%, ethylene: 9.0%) at a propane conversion of 14.3% at 515 C and a selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product of less than 1.0%.
          A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane, and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a selectivity of 66.4% for propylene and 18.4% for ethylene at a propane conversion of 24.7%.
          Methods developed to tackle this issue include the creation of ordered microporous morphology in the bulk of BPO4 or loading it onto a support.

[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."
          [2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
          [3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."
          [4] "The different catalytic activity ascribed to plasma impelled us to further investigate the structure of the catalysts."
          [5] "N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
          [6] "The peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted (4.0cm1) relative to that of BN, with the obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum (BN: 12.3cm1 N2-BN: 14.8cm1). These changes were ascribed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, which evidenced that N2 plasma could create more N-defects."
          [7] "The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN is quite similar, accordingly 1.31 and 1.32."
          [8] "Moreover, O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content (B-O: 18.2% BOx: 9.8%) to N2-BN-spent (B-O: 20.9%, BOx: 9.2%)."
          [9] "These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion, i.e., 27.3% for O2-BN-wash and 26.0% for N2-BN, under the same reaction conditions."
          [10] "The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN."
          [11] "The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased as compared to the parent BN."
          [12] "Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from 1.28 of BN to 1.29 of H2-BN and Ar-BN (TableS4), the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area."

[1] "Ordered macroporous materials with rapid mass transport and enhanced active site accessibility are essential for achieving improved catalytic activity."
          [2] "Boron phosphate crystals with a three-dimensionally interconnected ordered macroporous structure and a robust framework were fabricated and used as stable and selective catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane."
          [3] "Due to the improved mass diffusion and higher number of exposed active sites in the ordered macroporous structure, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable olefin productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1, which is up to 2100 times higher than that of ODH catalysts reported to date."
          [4] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."

          [8] "The elemental mapping images ( Fig. 1(g) ) show a homogeneous distribution of the B, O, and P elements in the whole BPO4 crystals."
          [9] "The macropore sizes and the intergrown nanocrystals were essentially unchanged."
          [10] "The XRD pattern of the spent BPO4(OM) after the catalytic reaction ( Fig. 3(e) ) was identical to that of the fresh catalyst."
          [11] "The B and P species, with chemical shifts of ca. 5.3 and 31 ppm, respectively, were essentially retained after the reaction."
          [12] "The presence of abundant tetra-coordinated boron species in the catalysts had two consequences: on one hand, the boron sites were too crowded to be accessible to nucleophilic species; on the other hand, the electron density in the vicinity of the boron sites was enhanced."
          [13] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst."
          [14] "These results likely indicate that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane."
          [15] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."
          [16] "The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was further confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis (Fig. S1); the cumulative pore volume vs. pore diameter curve showed a continuous increase in mercury uptake with decreasing pore diameter (i.e., increasing Hg intrusion pressure)."
          [17] "The specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively."
          [18] "The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the ODH of propane."
          [19] "The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions."
          [20] "The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield."
          [21] "The atomic percentages of B in the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts were estimated to be ca. 33.1% and 33.7%, respectively. The B 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 193.6, 191.8, and 189.3 eV. These peaks were attributed to BO3 (tri-coordinated boron), BO4 (tetra-coordinated boron), and boron suboxides (BxOy, 1.5 < x/y < 3), respectively."



[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."
          [2] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite."
          [3] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species."
          [4] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."
          [5] "In this work, a series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared, and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction."
          [6] "The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions."
          [7] "It turned out to be that the catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature."
          [8] "Structure characterizations revealed that the incomplete crystallization could enrich the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, which were responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts."

[1] "Isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
          [2] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
          [3] "The isolated boron in the zeolite framework (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."
          [4] "The two-dimensional (2D) 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species."
          [5] "The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures, showing bands at 905 to 915 and 1380 to 1400 cm1 (fig. S24), which characterize the isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework, respectively."
          [6] "The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage, which is further supported by the reaction rates under a different atmosphere (fig. S36)."
          [7] "The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction (fig. S36)."
          [8] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."
          [9] "The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species (29), which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species."
          [10] "The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework (fig. S56), which shows a higher TS1 energy barrier at 1.700 eV, as indicated by the stronger van der Waals interaction (fig. S57) in the reduced density gradient isosurface."

The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites. The 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability. (97) The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites (Figure 5b). The boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes. The 3-D B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramic (B2O3/SiO2@HC-p) catalysts were obtained. (88) With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized. The 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport. The resulting zeolite exhibited high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Unlike the agglomerated oxidized B species in BN and B/support, the active B species in the 3-D structure of the BS-1 catalyst were isolated B with a B[OH···O(H)Si]2 structure. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate using a hard template method, (104) which possessed both rich pores and a high surface area. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of 1.75 gC3H6·gcat1·h1.

Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized.
          The MWW borosilicate lamellar precursor was synthesized hydrothermally according to earlier report, with slight modifications.
          The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape, featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores.
          The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively, making it clear that the heteroatom boron inserted into the framework of zeolites.
          The layered borosilicate zeolite catalyze ethane ODH at a slightly higher temperature range of 560590 C, which is due to more energetically demanded activation of primary CH bonds in ethane.
          The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene.

          [11] "The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."
          [12] "The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion."
          [13] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction."

[1] "Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."

B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method.
          A phenomenon of tertiary aggregation was observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4.
          Melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species.
          B2O3@BPO4 exhibited excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability at 550 C.
          B2O3 is a typical inorganic oxide with a melting point of 450 C, and the viscosity of its melting phase changes with temperature.
          B2O3 is also an important catalyst component in hydrocarbon conversions.
          For traditional supported catalysts, to gain more active sites, hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports.
          The preparation process is tedious, including the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites.
          Therefore, it is expected to synthesize hollow sphere structures using a simple approach and make the best use of both sides of hollow spheres.
          At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a high stability at 550 C.
          The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts has been emerging as an important research trend because of their low cost and ecofriendly properties as compared with metal-based catalysts.

          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature.
          In the process of formation, we found not only two conventional particle aggregations (primary and secondary aggregation) and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation (denoted as tertiary aggregation).
          A white particle was obtained through slightly finer grinding and labeled as B2O3@BPO4-800.
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.

          However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperature is considered a vital problem for B2O3-containing catalysts.
          Interestingly, from another angle, low volatility and high melting point make B2O3 possible for use as a high-temperature SPLC once a suitable support is available.
          Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures.
          Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing.

          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          A metal-free B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.
          Furthermore, the reaction follows EleyRideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to PC3H8.

[1] "Boron-containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins."
          [2] "It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06) layer."
          [3] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."
          [4] "However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."
          [5] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."
          [6] "The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides."
          [7] "The large distribution of boron sites in active materials and their dynamic nature under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s)."
          [8] "To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary."
          [9] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure."
          [10] "The successful synthesis of the MWW framework was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (FigureS1) and N2 physisorption (SBET=498m2g1)."
          [11] "The boron loading was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to be 1.10.1wt.%. This loading is within the 0.232.20wt.% range for B/SiO2 catalysts made by incipient wetness impregnation that all showed significant conversion under our ODH reaction conditions."
          [12] "The 11B isotropic chemical shift (δiso), electric field gradient asymmetry parameter (η) and quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species."
          [13] "The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."
          [14] "The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches our results very well, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species."
          [15] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
          [16] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
          [17] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
          [18] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site."
          [19] "Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

Scheme 1 shows a typical structure of boron-based materials used as ODH catalysts.
          Boron nitrides (BN) may exist in three crystalline forms: graphite-like hexagonal BN (h-BN), diamond-like cubic BN (c-BN), and wurtzite BN (w-BN).
          With the development of modern technology, h-BN has been synthesized through many methods, such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions.
          The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues.
          Silicon borides have a number of phases with a stoichiometric ratio of B:Si ranging from 3 to 6 with complicated morphologies varied from homogeneity to heterogeneity.
          Boron carbide (B410.4C) is a compositionally disordered material with rhombohedral phase.
          Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles with a comparatively high fraction of six-membered rings (boroxol rings) and a portion of non-ring BO3/2 units.
          Boron phosphate (BPO4) has superior thermal stability, high thermal conductivity (ka = 62.4 W m1 K1, kc = 51.5 W m1 K1), strong anisotropic thermal expansion and outstanding oxidation resistance.
          The crystal structure of BPO4 is featured by a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra.
          In order to remove the influence of the support and figure out the origin of the catalytic ability of boron oxide, Lu's group reported a supported boron oxide catalyst synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of boric acid on the high specific area mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15, denoted as BOS catalyst) which showed remarkable selectivity to catalyze the ODH of propane.
          A three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed with a robust framework, which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with a selectivity of 91.5% for olefins (propylene: 82.5%, ethylene: 9.0%) at a propane conversion of 14.3% at 515 C and a selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product of less than 1.0%.
          A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane, and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a selectivity of 66.4% for propylene and 18.4% for ethylene at a propane conversion of 24.7%.
          Methods developed to tackle this issue include the creation of ordered microporous morphology in the bulk of BPO4 or loading it onto a support.

[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."
          [2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
          [3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."
          [4] "The different catalytic activity ascribed to plasma impelled us to further investigate the structure of the catalysts."
          [5] "N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
          [6] "The peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted (4.0cm1) relative to that of BN, with the obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum (BN: 12.3cm1 N2-BN: 14.8cm1). These changes were ascribed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, which evidenced that N2 plasma could create more N-defects."
          [7] "The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN is quite similar, accordingly 1.31 and 1.32."
          [8] "Moreover, O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content (B-O: 18.2% BOx: 9.8%) to N2-BN-spent (B-O: 20.9%, BOx: 9.2%)."
          [9] "These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion, i.e., 27.3% for O2-BN-wash and 26.0% for N2-BN, under the same reaction conditions."
          [10] "The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN."
          [11] "The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased as compared to the parent BN."
          [12] "Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from 1.28 of BN to 1.29 of H2-BN and Ar-BN (TableS4), the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area."

[1] "Ordered macroporous materials with rapid mass transport and enhanced active site accessibility are essential for achieving improved catalytic activity."
          [2] "Boron phosphate crystals with a three-dimensionally interconnected ordered macroporous structure and a robust framework were fabricated and used as stable and selective catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane."
          [3] "Due to the improved mass diffusion and higher number of exposed active sites in the ordered macroporous structure, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable olefin productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1, which is up to 2100 times higher than that of ODH catalysts reported to date."
          [4] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."
          [5] "The synthesis of ordered macroporous BPO4 was conducted via hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a) ."
          [6] "Boric acid and phosphoric acid were employed as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres were used as the hard template."
          [7] "The ordered macroporous structure was an inverse replica of the template, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores."
          [8] "The elemental mapping images ( Fig. 1(g) ) show a homogeneous distribution of the B, O, and P elements in the whole BPO4 crystals."
          [9] "The macropore sizes and the intergrown nanocrystals were essentially unchanged."
          [10] "The XRD pattern of the spent BPO4(OM) after the catalytic reaction ( Fig. 3(e) ) was identical to that of the fresh catalyst."
          [11] "The B and P species, with chemical shifts of ca. 5.3 and 31 ppm, respectively, were essentially retained after the reaction."
          [12] "The presence of abundant tetra-coordinated boron species in the catalysts had two consequences: on one hand, the boron sites were too crowded to be accessible to nucleophilic species; on the other hand, the electron density in the vicinity of the boron sites was enhanced."
          [13] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst."
          [14] "These results likely indicate that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane."
          [15] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."
          [16] "The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was further confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis (Fig. S1); the cumulative pore volume vs. pore diameter curve showed a continuous increase in mercury uptake with decreasing pore diameter (i.e., increasing Hg intrusion pressure)."
          [17] "The specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively."
          [18] "The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the ODH of propane."
          [19] "The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions."
          [20] "The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield."
          [21] "The atomic percentages of B in the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts were estimated to be ca. 33.1% and 33.7%, respectively. The B 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 193.6, 191.8, and 189.3 eV. These peaks were attributed to BO3 (tri-coordinated boron), BO4 (tetra-coordinated boron), and boron suboxides (BxOy, 1.5 < x/y < 3), respectively."



[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."
          [2] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite."
          [3] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species."
          [4] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."
          [5] "In this work, a series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared, and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction."
          [6] "The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions."
          [7] "It turned out to be that the catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature."
          [8] "Structure characterizations revealed that the incomplete crystallization could enrich the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, which were responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts."

[1] "Isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
          [2] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
          [3] "The isolated boron in the zeolite framework (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."
          [4] "The two-dimensional (2D) 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species."
          [5] "The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures, showing bands at 905 to 915 and 1380 to 1400 cm1 (fig. S24), which characterize the isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework, respectively."
          [6] "The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage, which is further supported by the reaction rates under a different atmosphere (fig. S36)."
          [7] "The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction (fig. S36)."
          [8] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."
          [9] "The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species (29), which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species."
          [10] "The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework (fig. S56), which shows a higher TS1 energy barrier at 1.700 eV, as indicated by the stronger van der Waals interaction (fig. S57) in the reduced density gradient isosurface."

The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites. The 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability. (97) The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites (Figure 5b). The boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes. The 3-D B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramic (B2O3/SiO2@HC-p) catalysts were obtained. (88) With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized. The 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport. The resulting zeolite exhibited high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Unlike the agglomerated oxidized B species in BN and B/support, the active B species in the 3-D structure of the BS-1 catalyst were isolated B with a B[OH···O(H)Si]2 structure. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate using a hard template method, (104) which possessed both rich pores and a high surface area. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of 1.75 gC3H6·gcat1·h1.

Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized.
          The MWW borosilicate lamellar precursor was synthesized hydrothermally according to earlier report, with slight modifications.
          The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape, featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores.
          The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively, making it clear that the heteroatom boron inserted into the framework of zeolites.
          The layered borosilicate zeolite catalyze ethane ODH at a slightly higher temperature range of 560590 C, which is due to more energetically demanded activation of primary CH bonds in ethane.
          The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene.

          [2] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."
          [3] "The opening size can be adjusted by changing the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives that is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)."
          [4] "We believe the as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure."
          [5] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."



[1] "The SiO2 and B2O3 sequentially coated honeycomb cordierite catalyst is designed by a two-step wash-coat method with different B2O3 loadings (0.1%10%) and calcination temperatures (600, 700, 800C)."

[1] "In this study, we prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method. The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be tuned in the range of 150300nm through h-BN loading change."
          [2] "The obtained nanofibrous catalysts exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date."

          [7] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction."
          [8] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."
          [9] "The stability of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was superior, which was probably attributed to the SiO2 support anchoring effect."
          [10] "The abundant OH groups of SiO2 support can promote the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN."
          [11] "The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."
          [12] "The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion."
          [13] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction."

[1] "Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."
          [2] "The effect of boron oxide was observed for a loading as low as 0.003wt% (Figure1b), thus clearly demonstrating that only a negligible fraction of surface functionalities detected by the applied characterization techniques are catalytically active."

B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method.
          A phenomenon of tertiary aggregation was observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4.
          Melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species.
          B2O3@BPO4 exhibited excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability at 550 C.
          B2O3 is a typical inorganic oxide with a melting point of 450 C, and the viscosity of its melting phase changes with temperature.
          B2O3 is also an important catalyst component in hydrocarbon conversions.
          For traditional supported catalysts, to gain more active sites, hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports.
          The preparation process is tedious, including the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites.
          Therefore, it is expected to synthesize hollow sphere structures using a simple approach and make the best use of both sides of hollow spheres.
          At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a high stability at 550 C.
          The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts has been emerging as an important research trend because of their low cost and ecofriendly properties as compared with metal-based catalysts.
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature.
          In the process of formation, we found not only two conventional particle aggregations (primary and secondary aggregation) and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation (denoted as tertiary aggregation).
          A white particle was obtained through slightly finer grinding and labeled as B2O3@BPO4-800.
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.

          The B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.
          However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperature is considered a vital problem for B2O3-containing catalysts.
          Interestingly, from another angle, low volatility and high melting point make B2O3 possible for use as a high-temperature SPLC once a suitable support is available.
          Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures.
          Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing.
          The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature.
          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          A metal-free B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.
          Furthermore, the reaction follows EleyRideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to PC3H8.

[1] "Boron-containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins."
          [2] "It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06) layer."
          [3] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."
          [4] "However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."
          [5] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."
          [6] "The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides."
          [7] "The large distribution of boron sites in active materials and their dynamic nature under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s)."
          [8] "To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary."
          [9] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure."
          [10] "The successful synthesis of the MWW framework was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (FigureS1) and N2 physisorption (SBET=498m2g1)."
          [11] "The boron loading was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to be 1.10.1wt.%. This loading is within the 0.232.20wt.% range for B/SiO2 catalysts made by incipient wetness impregnation that all showed significant conversion under our ODH reaction conditions."
          [12] "The 11B isotropic chemical shift (δiso), electric field gradient asymmetry parameter (η) and quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species."
          [13] "The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."
          [14] "The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches our results very well, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species."
          [15] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
          [16] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
          [17] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
          [18] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site."
          [19] "Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

Scheme 1 shows a typical structure of boron-based materials used as ODH catalysts.
          Boron nitrides (BN) may exist in three crystalline forms: graphite-like hexagonal BN (h-BN), diamond-like cubic BN (c-BN), and wurtzite BN (w-BN).
          With the development of modern technology, h-BN has been synthesized through many methods, such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions.
          The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues.
          Silicon borides have a number of phases with a stoichiometric ratio of B:Si ranging from 3 to 6 with complicated morphologies varied from homogeneity to heterogeneity.
          Boron carbide (B410.4C) is a compositionally disordered material with rhombohedral phase.
          Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles with a comparatively high fraction of six-membered rings (boroxol rings) and a portion of non-ring BO3/2 units.
          Boron phosphate (BPO4) has superior thermal stability, high thermal conductivity (ka = 62.4 W m1 K1, kc = 51.5 W m1 K1), strong anisotropic thermal expansion and outstanding oxidation resistance.
          The crystal structure of BPO4 is featured by a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra.
          In order to remove the influence of the support and figure out the origin of the catalytic ability of boron oxide, Lu's group reported a supported boron oxide catalyst synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of boric acid on the high specific area mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15, denoted as BOS catalyst) which showed remarkable selectivity to catalyze the ODH of propane.
          A three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed with a robust framework, which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with a selectivity of 91.5% for olefins (propylene: 82.5%, ethylene: 9.0%) at a propane conversion of 14.3% at 515 C and a selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product of less than 1.0%.
          A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane, and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a selectivity of 66.4% for propylene and 18.4% for ethylene at a propane conversion of 24.7%.
          Methods developed to tackle this issue include the creation of ordered microporous morphology in the bulk of BPO4 or loading it onto a support.

[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."
          [2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
          [3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."
          [4] "The different catalytic activity ascribed to plasma impelled us to further investigate the structure of the catalysts."
          [5] "N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
          [6] "The peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted (4.0cm1) relative to that of BN, with the obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum (BN: 12.3cm1 N2-BN: 14.8cm1). These changes were ascribed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, which evidenced that N2 plasma could create more N-defects."
          [7] "The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN is quite similar, accordingly 1.31 and 1.32."
          [8] "Moreover, O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content (B-O: 18.2% BOx: 9.8%) to N2-BN-spent (B-O: 20.9%, BOx: 9.2%)."
          [9] "These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion, i.e., 27.3% for O2-BN-wash and 26.0% for N2-BN, under the same reaction conditions."
          [10] "The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN."
          [11] "The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased as compared to the parent BN."
          [12] "Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from 1.28 of BN to 1.29 of H2-BN and Ar-BN (TableS4), the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area."

[1] "Ordered macroporous materials with rapid mass transport and enhanced active site accessibility are essential for achieving improved catalytic activity."
          [2] "Boron phosphate crystals with a three-dimensionally interconnected ordered macroporous structure and a robust framework were fabricated and used as stable and selective catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane."
          [3] "Due to the improved mass diffusion and higher number of exposed active sites in the ordered macroporous structure, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable olefin productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1, which is up to 2100 times higher than that of ODH catalysts reported to date."

          [10] "The XRD pattern of the spent BPO4(OM) after the catalytic reaction ( Fig. 3(e) ) was identical to that of the fresh catalyst."
          [11] "The B and P species, with chemical shifts of ca. 5.3 and 31 ppm, respectively, were essentially retained after the reaction."
          [12] "The presence of abundant tetra-coordinated boron species in the catalysts had two consequences: on one hand, the boron sites were too crowded to be accessible to nucleophilic species; on the other hand, the electron density in the vicinity of the boron sites was enhanced."
          [13] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst."
          [14] "These results likely indicate that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane."
          [15] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."
          [16] "The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was further confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis (Fig. S1); the cumulative pore volume vs. pore diameter curve showed a continuous increase in mercury uptake with decreasing pore diameter (i.e., increasing Hg intrusion pressure)."
          [17] "The specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively."
          [18] "The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the ODH of propane."
          [19] "The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions."
          [20] "The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield."
          [21] "The atomic percentages of B in the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts were estimated to be ca. 33.1% and 33.7%, respectively. The B 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 193.6, 191.8, and 189.3 eV. These peaks were attributed to BO3 (tri-coordinated boron), BO4 (tetra-coordinated boron), and boron suboxides (BxOy, 1.5 < x/y < 3), respectively."



[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."
          [2] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite."
          [3] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species."
          [4] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."
          [5] "In this work, a series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared, and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction."
          [6] "The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions."
          [7] "It turned out to be that the catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature."
          [8] "Structure characterizations revealed that the incomplete crystallization could enrich the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, which were responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts."

[1] "Isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
          [2] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
          [3] "The isolated boron in the zeolite framework (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."
          [4] "The two-dimensional (2D) 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species."

S24), which characterize the isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework, respectively."
          [6] "The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage, which is further supported by the reaction rates under a different atmosphere (fig. S36)."
          [7] "The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction (fig. S36)."
          [8] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."
          [9] "The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species (29), which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species."
          [10] "The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework (fig. S56), which shows a higher TS1 energy barrier at 1.700 eV, as indicated by the stronger van der Waals interaction (fig. S57) in the reduced density gradient isosurface."

The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites. The 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability. (97) The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites (Figure 5b). The boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes. The 3-D B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramic (B2O3/SiO2@HC-p) catalysts were obtained. (88) With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized. The 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport. The resulting zeolite exhibited high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Unlike the agglomerated oxidized B species in BN and B/support, the active B species in the 3-D structure of the BS-1 catalyst were isolated B with a B[OH···O(H)Si]2 structure. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate using a hard template method, (104) which possessed both rich pores and a high surface area. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of 1.75 gC3H6·gcat1·h1.

Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized.
          The MWW borosilicate lamellar precursor was synthesized hydrothermally according to earlier report, with slight modifications.
          The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape, featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores.
          The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively, making it clear that the heteroatom boron inserted into the framework of zeolites.
          The layered borosilicate zeolite catalyze ethane ODH at a slightly higher temperature range of 560590 C, which is due to more energetically demanded activation of primary CH bonds in ethane.
          The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene.

          [11] "The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."
          [12] "The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion."
          [13] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction."

B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method.
          A phenomenon of tertiary aggregation was observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4.
          Melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species.
          B2O3@BPO4 exhibited excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability at 550 C.
          B2O3 is a typical inorganic oxide with a melting point of 450 C, and the viscosity of its melting phase changes with temperature.
          B2O3 is also an important catalyst component in hydrocarbon conversions.
          For traditional supported catalysts, to gain more active sites, hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports.
          The preparation process is tedious, including the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites.
          Therefore, it is expected to synthesize hollow sphere structures using a simple approach and make the best use of both sides of hollow spheres.
          At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a high stability at 550 C.
          The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts has been emerging as an important research trend because of their low cost and ecofriendly properties as compared with metal-based catalysts.
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature.
          In the process of formation, we found not only two conventional particle aggregations (primary and secondary aggregation) and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation (denoted as tertiary aggregation).
          A white particle was obtained through slightly finer grinding and labeled as B2O3@BPO4-800.
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.

          However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperature is considered a vital problem for B2O3-containing catalysts.
          Interestingly, from another angle, low volatility and high melting point make B2O3 possible for use as a high-temperature SPLC once a suitable support is available.
          Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures.
          Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing.
          The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature.
          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          A metal-free B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.
          Furthermore, the reaction follows EleyRideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to PC3H8.

[1] "Boron-containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins."
          [2] "It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06) layer."
          [3] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."
          [4] "However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."
          [5] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."
          [6] "The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides."
          [7] "The large distribution of boron sites in active materials and their dynamic nature under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s)."
          [8] "To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary."
          [9] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure."
          [10] "The successful synthesis of the MWW framework was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (FigureS1) and N2 physisorption (SBET=498m2g1)."
          [11] "The boron loading was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to be 1.10.1wt.%. This loading is within the 0.232.20wt.% range for B/SiO2 catalysts made by incipient wetness impregnation that all showed significant conversion under our ODH reaction conditions."
          [12] "The 11B isotropic chemical shift (δiso), electric field gradient asymmetry parameter (η) and quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species."
          [13] "The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."
          [14] "The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches our results very well, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species."
          [15] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
          [16] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
          [17] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
          [18] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site."
          [19] "Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

Scheme 1 shows a typical structure of boron-based materials used as ODH catalysts.
          Boron nitrides (BN) may exist in three crystalline forms: graphite-like hexagonal BN (h-BN), diamond-like cubic BN (c-BN), and wurtzite BN (w-BN).
          With the development of modern technology, h-BN has been synthesized through many methods, such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions.
          The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues.
          Silicon borides have a number of phases with a stoichiometric ratio of B:Si ranging from 3 to 6 with complicated morphologies varied from homogeneity to heterogeneity.
          Boron carbide (B410.4C) is a compositionally disordered material with rhombohedral phase.
          Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles with a comparatively high fraction of six-membered rings (boroxol rings) and a portion of non-ring BO3/2 units.
          Boron phosphate (BPO4) has superior thermal stability, high thermal conductivity (ka = 62.4 W m1 K1, kc = 51.5 W m1 K1), strong anisotropic thermal expansion and outstanding oxidation resistance.
          The crystal structure of BPO4 is featured by a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra.
          In order to remove the influence of the support and figure out the origin of the catalytic ability of boron oxide, Lu's group reported a supported boron oxide catalyst synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of boric acid on the high specific area mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15, denoted as BOS catalyst) which showed remarkable selectivity to catalyze the ODH of propane.
          A three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed with a robust framework, which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with a selectivity of 91.5% for olefins (propylene: 82.5%, ethylene: 9.0%) at a propane conversion of 14.3% at 515 C and a selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product of less than 1.0%.
          A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane, and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a selectivity of 66.4% for propylene and 18.4% for ethylene at a propane conversion of 24.7%.
          Methods developed to tackle this issue include the creation of ordered microporous morphology in the bulk of BPO4 or loading it onto a support.

[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."
          [2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
          [3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."
          [4] "The different catalytic activity ascribed to plasma impelled us to further investigate the structure of the catalysts."
          [5] "N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
          [6] "The peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted (4.0cm1) relative to that of BN, with the obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum (BN: 12.3cm1 N2-BN: 14.8cm1). These changes were ascribed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, which evidenced that N2 plasma could create more N-defects."
          [7] "The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN is quite similar, accordingly 1.31 and 1.32."
          [8] "Moreover, O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content (B-O: 18.2% BOx: 9.8%) to N2-BN-spent (B-O: 20.9%, BOx: 9.2%)."
          [9] "These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion, i.e., 27.3% for O2-BN-wash and 26.0% for N2-BN, under the same reaction conditions."
          [10] "The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN."
          [11] "The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased as compared to the parent BN."
          [12] "Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from 1.28 of BN to 1.29 of H2-BN and Ar-BN (TableS4), the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area."

[1] "Ordered macroporous materials with rapid mass transport and enhanced active site accessibility are essential for achieving improved catalytic activity."
          [2] "Boron phosphate crystals with a three-dimensionally interconnected ordered macroporous structure and a robust framework were fabricated and used as stable and selective catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane."
          [3] "Due to the improved mass diffusion and higher number of exposed active sites in the ordered macroporous structure, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable olefin productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1, which is up to 2100 times higher than that of ODH catalysts reported to date."
          [4] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."

          [10] "The XRD pattern of the spent BPO4(OM) after the catalytic reaction ( Fig. 3(e) ) was identical to that of the fresh catalyst."
          [11] "The B and P species, with chemical shifts of ca. 5.3 and 31 ppm, respectively, were essentially retained after the reaction."
          [12] "The presence of abundant tetra-coordinated boron species in the catalysts had two consequences: on one hand, the boron sites were too crowded to be accessible to nucleophilic species; on the other hand, the electron density in the vicinity of the boron sites was enhanced."
          [13] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst."
          [14] "These results likely indicate that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane."

          [17] "The specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively."
          [18] "The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the ODH of propane."
          [19] "The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions."
          [20] "The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield."
          [21] "The atomic percentages of B in the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts were estimated to be ca. 33.1% and 33.7%, respectively. The B 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 193.6, 191.8, and 189.3 eV.

[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."
          [2] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite."
          [3] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species."
          [4] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."
          [5] "In this work, a series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared, and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction."
          [6] "The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions."
          [7] "It turned out to be that the catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature."
          [8] "Structure characterizations revealed that the incomplete crystallization could enrich the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, which were responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts."

[1] "Isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."

S24), which characterize the isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework, respectively."
          [6] "The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage, which is further supported by the reaction rates under a different atmosphere (fig. S36)."
          [7] "The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction (fig. S36)."
          [8] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."
          [9] "The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species (29), which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species."
          [10] "The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework (fig. S56), which shows a higher TS1 energy barrier at 1.700 eV, as indicated by the stronger van der Waals interaction (fig. S57) in the reduced density gradient isosurface."

The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites. The 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability. (97) The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites (Figure 5b). The boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes. The 3-D B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramic (B2O3/SiO2@HC-p) catalysts were obtained. (88) With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized. The 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport. The resulting zeolite exhibited high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Unlike the agglomerated oxidized B species in BN and B/support, the active B species in the 3-D structure of the BS-1 catalyst were isolated B with a B[OH···O(H)Si]2 structure. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate using a hard template method, (104) which possessed both rich pores and a high surface area. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of 1.75 gC3H6·gcat1·h1.

Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized.
          The MWW borosilicate lamellar precursor was synthesized hydrothermally according to earlier report, with slight modifications.
          The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape, featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores.
          The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively, making it clear that the heteroatom boron inserted into the framework of zeolites.
          The layered borosilicate zeolite catalyze ethane ODH at a slightly higher temperature range of 560590 C, which is due to more energetically demanded activation of primary CH bonds in ethane.
          The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene.

B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method.
          A phenomenon of tertiary aggregation was observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4.
          Melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species.
          B2O3@BPO4 exhibited excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability at 550 C.
          B2O3 is a typical inorganic oxide with a melting point of 450 C, and the viscosity of its melting phase changes with temperature.
          B2O3 is also an important catalyst component in hydrocarbon conversions.
          For traditional supported catalysts, to gain more active sites, hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports.
          The preparation process is tedious, including the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites.
          Therefore, it is expected to synthesize hollow sphere structures using a simple approach and make the best use of both sides of hollow spheres.
          At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a high stability at 550 C.
          The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts has been emerging as an important research trend because of their low cost and ecofriendly properties as compared with metal-based catalysts.
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature.
          In the process of formation, we found not only two conventional particle aggregations (primary and secondary aggregation) and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation (denoted as tertiary aggregation).
          A white particle was obtained through slightly finer grinding and labeled as B2O3@BPO4-800.
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.

          However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperature is considered a vital problem for B2O3-containing catalysts.
          Interestingly, from another angle, low volatility and high melting point make B2O3 possible for use as a high-temperature SPLC once a suitable support is available.
          Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures.
          Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing.
          The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature.
          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          A metal-free B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.
          Furthermore, the reaction follows EleyRideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to PC3H8.

          [15] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
          [16] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
          [17] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
          [18] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site."
          [19] "Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

Scheme 1 shows a typical structure of boron-based materials used as ODH catalysts.
          Boron nitrides (BN) may exist in three crystalline forms: graphite-like hexagonal BN (h-BN), diamond-like cubic BN (c-BN), and wurtzite BN (w-BN).
          With the development of modern technology, h-BN has been synthesized through many methods, such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions.
          The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues.
          Silicon borides have a number of phases with a stoichiometric ratio of B:Si ranging from 3 to 6 with complicated morphologies varied from homogeneity to heterogeneity.
          Boron carbide (B410.4C) is a compositionally disordered material with rhombohedral phase.
          Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles with a comparatively high fraction of six-membered rings (boroxol rings) and a portion of non-ring BO3/2 units.
          Boron phosphate (BPO4) has superior thermal stability, high thermal conductivity (ka = 62.4 W m1 K1, kc = 51.5 W m1 K1), strong anisotropic thermal expansion and outstanding oxidation resistance.
          The crystal structure of BPO4 is featured by a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra.
          In order to remove the influence of the support and figure out the origin of the catalytic ability of boron oxide, Lu's group reported a supported boron oxide catalyst synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of boric acid on the high specific area mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15, denoted as BOS catalyst) which showed remarkable selectivity to catalyze the ODH of propane.
          A three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed with a robust framework, which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with a selectivity of 91.5% for olefins (propylene: 82.5%, ethylene: 9.0%) at a propane conversion of 14.3% at 515 C and a selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product of less than 1.0%.
          A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane, and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a selectivity of 66.4% for propylene and 18.4% for ethylene at a propane conversion of 24.7%.
          Methods developed to tackle this issue include the creation of ordered microporous morphology in the bulk of BPO4 or loading it onto a support.

[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."
          [2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
          [3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."
          [4] "The different catalytic activity ascribed to plasma impelled us to further investigate the structure of the catalysts."
          [5] "N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
          [6] "The peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted (4.0cm1) relative to that of BN, with the obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum (BN: 12.3cm1 N2-BN: 14.8cm1). These changes were ascribed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, which evidenced that N2 plasma could create more N-defects."
          [7] "The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN is quite similar, accordingly 1.31 and 1.32."
          [8] "Moreover, O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content (B-O: 18.2% BOx: 9.8%) to N2-BN-spent (B-O: 20.9%, BOx: 9.2%)."
          [9] "These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion, i.e., 27.3% for O2-BN-wash and 26.0% for N2-BN, under the same reaction conditions."
          [10] "The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN."
          [11] "The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased as compared to the parent BN."
          [12] "Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from 1.28 of BN to 1.29 of H2-BN and Ar-BN (TableS4), the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area."

[1] "Ordered macroporous materials with rapid mass transport and enhanced active site accessibility are essential for achieving improved catalytic activity."
          [2] "Boron phosphate crystals with a three-dimensionally interconnected ordered macroporous structure and a robust framework were fabricated and used as stable and selective catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane."
          [3] "Due to the improved mass diffusion and higher number of exposed active sites in the ordered macroporous structure, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable olefin productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1, which is up to 2100 times higher than that of ODH catalysts reported to date."
          [4] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."
          [5] "The synthesis of ordered macroporous BPO4 was conducted via hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a) ."
          [6] "Boric acid and phosphoric acid were employed as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres were used as the hard template."

          [8] "The elemental mapping images ( Fig. 1(g) ) show a homogeneous distribution of the B, O, and P elements in the whole BPO4 crystals."
          [9] "The macropore sizes and the intergrown nanocrystals were essentially unchanged."
          [10] "The XRD pattern of the spent BPO4(OM) after the catalytic reaction ( Fig. 3(e) ) was identical to that of the fresh catalyst."
          [11] "The B and P species, with chemical shifts of ca. 5.3 and 31 ppm, respectively, were essentially retained after the reaction."
          [12] "The presence of abundant tetra-coordinated boron species in the catalysts had two consequences: on one hand, the boron sites were too crowded to be accessible to nucleophilic species; on the other hand, the electron density in the vicinity of the boron sites was enhanced."
          [13] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst."
          [14] "These results likely indicate that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane."
          [15] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."
          [16] "The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was further confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis (Fig. S1); the cumulative pore volume vs. pore diameter curve showed a continuous increase in mercury uptake with decreasing pore diameter (i.e., increasing Hg intrusion pressure)."
          [17] "The specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively."
          [18] "The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the ODH of propane."
          [19] "The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions."
          [20] "The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield."
          [21] "The atomic percentages of B in the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts were estimated to be ca. 33.1% and 33.7%, respectively. The B 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 193.6, 191.8, and 189.3 eV. These peaks were attributed to BO3 (tri-coordinated boron), BO4 (tetra-coordinated boron), and boron suboxides (BxOy, 1.5 < x/y < 3), respectively."



[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."
          [2] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite."
          [3] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species."
          [4] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."
          [5] "In this work, a series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared, and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction."
          [6] "The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions."
          [7] "It turned out to be that the catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature."
          [8] "Structure characterizations revealed that the incomplete crystallization could enrich the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, which were responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts."

[1] "Isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
          [2] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
          [3] "The isolated boron in the zeolite framework (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."
          [4] "The two-dimensional (2D) 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species."
          [5] "The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures, showing bands at 905 to 915 and 1380 to 1400 cm1 (fig. S24), which characterize the isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework, respectively."
          [6] "The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage, which is further supported by the reaction rates under a different atmosphere (fig. S36)."
          [7] "The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction (fig. S36)."
          [8] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."
          [9] "The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species (29), which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species."
          [10] "The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework (fig. S56), which shows a higher TS1 energy barrier at 1.700 eV, as indicated by the stronger van der Waals interaction (fig. S57) in the reduced density gradient isosurface."

The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites. The 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability. (97) The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites (Figure 5b). The boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes. The 3-D B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramic (B2O3/SiO2@HC-p) catalysts were obtained. (88) With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized. The 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport. The resulting zeolite exhibited high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Unlike the agglomerated oxidized B species in BN and B/support, the active B species in the 3-D structure of the BS-1 catalyst were isolated B with a B[OH···O(H)Si]2 structure. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate using a hard template method, (104) which possessed both rich pores and a high surface area. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of 1.75 gC3H6·gcat1·h1.

Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized.
          The MWW borosilicate lamellar precursor was synthesized hydrothermally according to earlier report, with slight modifications.
          The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape, featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores.
          The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively, making it clear that the heteroatom boron inserted into the framework of zeolites.
          The layered borosilicate zeolite catalyze ethane ODH at a slightly higher temperature range of 560590 C, which is due to more energetically demanded activation of primary CH bonds in ethane.
          The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene.

          [11] "The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."

          [13] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction."

          [28] "The structural characterization of the control sample B2O3/gel is shown in Fig. S2. In the XRD pattern, the B2O3 signal can be detected, indicating that the supported catalyst allows the aggregation of B2O3."
          [29] "The PBSN-3 catalyst showed higher propylene selectivity than B2O3/gel."
          [30] "The PBSN catalyst was unreactive for ethane dehydrogenation only. However, ethylene was formed immediately when a mixture of oxygen and ethane was pulsed into the chamber."
          [31] "The reaction order of oxygen approached 0.5 in both the ODH of ethane and propane (Figs. 8(b) and (d)), suggesting that molecular oxygen may dissociate on the surface of the catalyst."

B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method.
          A phenomenon of tertiary aggregation was observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4.
          Melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species.
          B2O3@BPO4 exhibited excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability at 550 C.
          B2O3 is a typical inorganic oxide with a melting point of 450 C, and the viscosity of its melting phase changes with temperature.
          B2O3 is also an important catalyst component in hydrocarbon conversions.
          For traditional supported catalysts, to gain more active sites, hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports.
          The preparation process is tedious, including the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites.
          Therefore, it is expected to synthesize hollow sphere structures using a simple approach and make the best use of both sides of hollow spheres.
          At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a high stability at 550 C.
          The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts has been emerging as an important research trend because of their low cost and ecofriendly properties as compared with metal-based catalysts.
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature.
          In the process of formation, we found not only two conventional particle aggregations (primary and secondary aggregation) and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation (denoted as tertiary aggregation).
          A white particle was obtained through slightly finer grinding and labeled as B2O3@BPO4-800.
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.

          The B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.
          However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperature is considered a vital problem for B2O3-containing catalysts.
          Interestingly, from another angle, low volatility and high melting point make B2O3 possible for use as a high-temperature SPLC once a suitable support is available.
          Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures.
          Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing.
          The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature.
          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          A metal-free B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.
          Furthermore, the reaction follows EleyRideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to PC3H8.

[1] "Boron-containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins."
          [2] "It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06) layer."
          [3] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."
          [4] "However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."
          [5] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."
          [6] "The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides."
          [7] "The large distribution of boron sites in active materials and their dynamic nature under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s)."
          [8] "To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary."
          [9] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure."
          [10] "The successful synthesis of the MWW framework was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (FigureS1) and N2 physisorption (SBET=498m2g1)."
          [11] "The boron loading was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to be 1.10.1wt.%. This loading is within the 0.232.20wt.% range for B/SiO2 catalysts made by incipient wetness impregnation that all showed significant conversion under our ODH reaction conditions."
          [12] "The 11B isotropic chemical shift (δiso), electric field gradient asymmetry parameter (η) and quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species."
          [13] "The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."
          [14] "The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches our results very well, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species."
          [15] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
          [16] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
          [17] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
          [18] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site."
          [19] "Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

Scheme 1 shows a typical structure of boron-based materials used as ODH catalysts.
          Boron nitrides (BN) may exist in three crystalline forms: graphite-like hexagonal BN (h-BN), diamond-like cubic BN (c-BN), and wurtzite BN (w-BN).
          With the development of modern technology, h-BN has been synthesized through many methods, such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions.
          The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues.
          Silicon borides have a number of phases with a stoichiometric ratio of B:Si ranging from 3 to 6 with complicated morphologies varied from homogeneity to heterogeneity.
          Boron carbide (B410.4C) is a compositionally disordered material with rhombohedral phase.
          Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles with a comparatively high fraction of six-membered rings (boroxol rings) and a portion of non-ring BO3/2 units.
          Boron phosphate (BPO4) has superior thermal stability, high thermal conductivity (ka = 62.4 W m1 K1, kc = 51.5 W m1 K1), strong anisotropic thermal expansion and outstanding oxidation resistance.
          The crystal structure of BPO4 is featured by a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra.
          In order to remove the influence of the support and figure out the origin of the catalytic ability of boron oxide, Lu's group reported a supported boron oxide catalyst synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of boric acid on the high specific area mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15, denoted as BOS catalyst) which showed remarkable selectivity to catalyze the ODH of propane.
          A three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed with a robust framework, which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with a selectivity of 91.5% for olefins (propylene: 82.5%, ethylene: 9.0%) at a propane conversion of 14.3% at 515 C and a selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product of less than 1.0%.
          A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane, and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a selectivity of 66.4% for propylene and 18.4% for ethylene at a propane conversion of 24.7%.
          Methods developed to tackle this issue include the creation of ordered microporous morphology in the bulk of BPO4 or loading it onto a support.

[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."
          [2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
          [3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."
          [4] "The different catalytic activity ascribed to plasma impelled us to further investigate the structure of the catalysts."
          [5] "N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
          [6] "The peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted (4.0cm1) relative to that of BN, with the obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum (BN: 12.3cm1 N2-BN: 14.8cm1). These changes were ascribed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, which evidenced that N2 plasma could create more N-defects."
          [7] "The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN is quite similar, accordingly 1.31 and 1.32."
          [8] "Moreover, O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content (B-O: 18.2% BOx: 9.8%) to N2-BN-spent (B-O: 20.9%, BOx: 9.2%)."
          [9] "These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion, i.e., 27.3% for O2-BN-wash and 26.0% for N2-BN, under the same reaction conditions."
          [10] "The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN."
          [11] "The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased as compared to the parent BN."
          [12] "Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from 1.28 of BN to 1.29 of H2-BN and Ar-BN (TableS4), the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area."

[1] "Ordered macroporous materials with rapid mass transport and enhanced active site accessibility are essential for achieving improved catalytic activity."
          [2] "Boron phosphate crystals with a three-dimensionally interconnected ordered macroporous structure and a robust framework were fabricated and used as stable and selective catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane."
          [3] "Due to the improved mass diffusion and higher number of exposed active sites in the ordered macroporous structure, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable olefin productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1, which is up to 2100 times higher than that of ODH catalysts reported to date."
          [4] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."
          [5] "The synthesis of ordered macroporous BPO4 was conducted via hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a) ."
          [6] "Boric acid and phosphoric acid were employed as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres were used as the hard template."
          [7] "The ordered macroporous structure was an inverse replica of the template, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores."
          [8] "The elemental mapping images ( Fig. 1(g) ) show a homogeneous distribution of the B, O, and P elements in the whole BPO4 crystals."
          [9] "The macropore sizes and the intergrown nanocrystals were essentially unchanged."
          [10] "The XRD pattern of the spent BPO4(OM) after the catalytic reaction ( Fig. 3(e) ) was identical to that of the fresh catalyst."
          [11] "The B and P species, with chemical shifts of ca. 5.3 and 31 ppm, respectively, were essentially retained after the reaction."
          [12] "The presence of abundant tetra-coordinated boron species in the catalysts had two consequences: on one hand, the boron sites were too crowded to be accessible to nucleophilic species; on the other hand, the electron density in the vicinity of the boron sites was enhanced."
          [13] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst."
          [14] "These results likely indicate that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane."
          [15] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."
          [16] "The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was further confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis (Fig. S1); the cumulative pore volume vs. pore diameter curve showed a continuous increase in mercury uptake with decreasing pore diameter (i.e., increasing Hg intrusion pressure)."
          [17] "The specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively."
          [18] "The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the ODH of propane."
          [19] "The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions."
          [20] "The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield."
          [21] "The atomic percentages of B in the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts were estimated to be ca. 33.1% and 33.7%, respectively. The B 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 193.6, 191.8, and 189.3 eV. These peaks were attributed to BO3 (tri-coordinated boron), BO4 (tetra-coordinated boron), and boron suboxides (BxOy, 1.5 < x/y < 3), respectively."



[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."
          [2] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite."
          [3] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species."
          [4] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."
          [5] "In this work, a series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared, and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction."
          [6] "The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions."
          [7] "It turned out to be that the catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature."
          [8] "Structure characterizations revealed that the incomplete crystallization could enrich the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, which were responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts."

[1] "Isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
          [2] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
          [3] "The isolated boron in the zeolite framework (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."
          [4] "The two-dimensional (2D) 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species."
          [5] "The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures, showing bands at 905 to 915 and 1380 to 1400 cm1 (fig. S24), which characterize the isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework, respectively."
          [6] "The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage, which is further supported by the reaction rates under a different atmosphere (fig. S36)."
          [7] "The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction (fig. S36)."
          [8] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."
          [9] "The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species (29), which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species."
          [10] "The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework (fig. S56), which shows a higher TS1 energy barrier at 1.700 eV, as indicated by the stronger van der Waals interaction (fig. S57) in the reduced density gradient isosurface."

The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites. The 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability. (97) The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites (Figure 5b). The boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes. The 3-D B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramic (B2O3/SiO2@HC-p) catalysts were obtained. (88) With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized. The 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport. The resulting zeolite exhibited high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Unlike the agglomerated oxidized B species in BN and B/support, the active B species in the 3-D structure of the BS-1 catalyst were isolated B with a B[OH···O(H)Si]2 structure. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate using a hard template method, (104) which possessed both rich pores and a high surface area. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of 1.75 gC3H6·gcat1·h1.

Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized.
          The MWW borosilicate lamellar precursor was synthesized hydrothermally according to earlier report, with slight modifications.
          The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape, featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores.
          The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively, making it clear that the heteroatom boron inserted into the framework of zeolites.
          The layered borosilicate zeolite catalyze ethane ODH at a slightly higher temperature range of 560590 C, which is due to more energetically demanded activation of primary CH bonds in ethane.
          The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene.

[1] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."
          [2] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."
          [3] "The opening size can be adjusted by changing the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives that is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)."
          [4] "We believe the as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure."
          [5] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."



[1] "The SiO2 and B2O3 sequentially coated honeycomb cordierite catalyst is designed by a two-step wash-coat method with different B2O3 loadings (0.1%10%) and calcination temperatures (600, 700, 800C)."

[1] "In this study, we prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method. The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be tuned in the range of 150300nm through h-BN loading change."
          [2] "The obtained nanofibrous catalysts exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date."
          [3] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."

          [11] "The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."
          [12] "The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion."

[1] "Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."
          [2] "The effect of boron oxide was observed for a loading as low as 0.003wt% (Figure1b), thus clearly demonstrating that only a negligible fraction of surface functionalities detected by the applied characterization techniques are catalytically active."

B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method.
          A phenomenon of tertiary aggregation was observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4.
          Melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species.
          B2O3@BPO4 exhibited excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability at 550 C.
          B2O3 is a typical inorganic oxide with a melting point of 450 C, and the viscosity of its melting phase changes with temperature.
          B2O3 is also an important catalyst component in hydrocarbon conversions.
          For traditional supported catalysts, to gain more active sites, hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports.
          The preparation process is tedious, including the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites.
          Therefore, it is expected to synthesize hollow sphere structures using a simple approach and make the best use of both sides of hollow spheres.
          At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a high stability at 550 C.
          The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts has been emerging as an important research trend because of their low cost and ecofriendly properties as compared with metal-based catalysts.
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature.
          In the process of formation, we found not only two conventional particle aggregations (primary and secondary aggregation) and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation (denoted as tertiary aggregation).
          A white particle was obtained through slightly finer grinding and labeled as B2O3@BPO4-800.
          The B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.

          However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperature is considered a vital problem for B2O3-containing catalysts.
          Interestingly, from another angle, low volatility and high melting point make B2O3 possible for use as a high-temperature SPLC once a suitable support is available.
          Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures.
          Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing.
          The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature.
          Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
          A metal-free B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts.
          Furthermore, the reaction follows EleyRideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to PC3H8.

[1] "Boron-containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins."
          [2] "It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06) layer."
          [3] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."
          [4] "However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."
          [5] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."
          [6] "The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides."
          [7] "The large distribution of boron sites in active materials and their dynamic nature under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s)."
          [8] "To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary."
          [9] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure."
          [10] "The successful synthesis of the MWW framework was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (FigureS1) and N2 physisorption (SBET=498m2g1)."
          [11] "The boron loading was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to be 1.10.1wt.%. This loading is within the 0.232.20wt.% range for B/SiO2 catalysts made by incipient wetness impregnation that all showed significant conversion under our ODH reaction conditions."
          [12] "The 11B isotropic chemical shift (δiso), electric field gradient asymmetry parameter (η) and quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species."
          [13] "The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."
          [14] "The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches our results very well, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species."
          [15] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
          [16] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
          [17] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
          [18] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site."
          [19] "Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

Scheme 1 shows a typical structure of boron-based materials used as ODH catalysts.
          Boron nitrides (BN) may exist in three crystalline forms: graphite-like hexagonal BN (h-BN), diamond-like cubic BN (c-BN), and wurtzite BN (w-BN).
          With the development of modern technology, h-BN has been synthesized through many methods, such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions.
          The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues.
          Silicon borides have a number of phases with a stoichiometric ratio of B:Si ranging from 3 to 6 with complicated morphologies varied from homogeneity to heterogeneity.
          Boron carbide (B410.4C) is a compositionally disordered material with rhombohedral phase.
          Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles with a comparatively high fraction of six-membered rings (boroxol rings) and a portion of non-ring BO3/2 units.
          Boron phosphate (BPO4) has superior thermal stability, high thermal conductivity (ka = 62.4 W m1 K1, kc = 51.5 W m1 K1), strong anisotropic thermal expansion and outstanding oxidation resistance.
          The crystal structure of BPO4 is featured by a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra.
          In order to remove the influence of the support and figure out the origin of the catalytic ability of boron oxide, Lu's group reported a supported boron oxide catalyst synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of boric acid on the high specific area mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15, denoted as BOS catalyst) which showed remarkable selectivity to catalyze the ODH of propane.
          A three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed with a robust framework, which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with a selectivity of 91.5% for olefins (propylene: 82.5%, ethylene: 9.0%) at a propane conversion of 14.3% at 515 C and a selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product of less than 1.0%.
          A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane, and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a selectivity of 66.4% for propylene and 18.4% for ethylene at a propane conversion of 24.7%.
          Methods developed to tackle this issue include the creation of ordered microporous morphology in the bulk of BPO4 or loading it onto a support.

[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."
          [2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
          [3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."
          [4] "The different catalytic activity ascribed to plasma impelled us to further investigate the structure of the catalysts."
          [5] "N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
          [6] "The peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted (4.0cm1) relative to that of BN, with the obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum (BN: 12.3cm1 N2-BN: 14.8cm1). These changes were ascribed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, which evidenced that N2 plasma could create more N-defects."
          [7] "The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN is quite similar, accordingly 1.31 and 1.32."
          [8] "Moreover, O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content (B-O: 18.2% BOx: 9.8%) to N2-BN-spent (B-O: 20.9%, BOx: 9.2%)."
          [9] "These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion, i.e., 27.3% for O2-BN-wash and 26.0% for N2-BN, under the same reaction conditions."
          [10] "The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN."
          [11] "The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased as compared to the parent BN."
          [12] "Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from 1.28 of BN to 1.29 of H2-BN and Ar-BN (TableS4), the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area."

[1] "Ordered macroporous materials with rapid mass transport and enhanced active site accessibility are essential for achieving improved catalytic activity."
          [2] "Boron phosphate crystals with a three-dimensionally interconnected ordered macroporous structure and a robust framework were fabricated and used as stable and selective catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane."
          [3] "Due to the improved mass diffusion and higher number of exposed active sites in the ordered macroporous structure, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable olefin productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1, which is up to 2100 times higher than that of ODH catalysts reported to date."
          [4] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."

          [6] "Boric acid and phosphoric acid were employed as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres were used as the hard template."
          [7] "The ordered macroporous structure was an inverse replica of the template, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores."
          [8] "The elemental mapping images ( Fig. 1(g) ) show a homogeneous distribution of the B, O, and P elements in the whole BPO4 crystals."
          [9] "The macropore sizes and the intergrown nanocrystals were essentially unchanged."
          [10] "The XRD pattern of the spent BPO4(OM) after the catalytic reaction ( Fig. 3(e) ) was identical to that of the fresh catalyst."
          [11] "The B and P species, with chemical shifts of ca. 5.3 and 31 ppm, respectively, were essentially retained after the reaction."
          [12] "The presence of abundant tetra-coordinated boron species in the catalysts had two consequences: on one hand, the boron sites were too crowded to be accessible to nucleophilic species; on the other hand, the electron density in the vicinity of the boron sites was enhanced."
          [13] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst."
          [14] "These results likely indicate that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane."
          [15] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."
          [16] "The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was further confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis (Fig. S1); the cumulative pore volume vs. pore diameter curve showed a continuous increase in mercury uptake with decreasing pore diameter (i.e., increasing Hg intrusion pressure)."
          [17] "The specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively."
          [18] "The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the ODH of propane."
          [19] "The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions."
          [20] "The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield."
          [21] "The atomic percentages of B in the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts were estimated to be ca. 33.1% and 33.7%, respectively. The B 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 193.6, 191.8, and 189.3 eV. These peaks were attributed to BO3 (tri-coordinated boron), BO4 (tetra-coordinated boron), and boron suboxides (BxOy, 1.5 < x/y < 3), respectively."
