Borosilicate zeolites serve as active catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), providing a platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts and the construction of highly active boron centers. The isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP over B-MWW zeolite. In contrast, defect boron sites are crucial for catalyzing the ODHP reaction, with aggregated boron species being more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than isolated species. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center for catalyzing the ODHP reaction at low temperature. A series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction. The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature. Structure characterizations revealed that incomplete crystallization could enrich defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts.

The isolated boron in the zeolite framework without oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere due to the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test. The isolated boron in the zeolite framework is inert for the reaction, but the isolated boron in BS-1 zeolite exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP. The 2D 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species. The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures. The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage. The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction. This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution, giving good durability in the reaction process. The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species, which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity.

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites typically have porous structures and high specific surface areas, which provide numerous sites for active B species and confined space that influences radical reaction behavior. The pore structure also regulates mass transport during reactions. Loading B active components on the surface of 3-D porous structures or doping them into the framework of porous materials is an effective method for constructing 3-D B active sites. For example, h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts have a well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure that enhances mass transport and catalytic performance. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite can anchor boron oxide active sites, leading to high propene selectivity at low temperatures. The 3-D wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts with B2O3 loading achieve excellent olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production. The 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite, with molten boron oxide acting as a homogeneous catalyst, exhibits high stability and olefin selectivity. Doping B species into zeolite frameworks creates a 3-D dispersion of B active sites, resulting in high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate, synthesized using a hard template method, has rich pores and a high surface area, improving molecular diffusion and heat transfer. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam, with a large surface area and numerous mesopores, shows excellent activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites was achieved through hydrothermal methods, with modifications to previous reports. The zeolites have a type-I N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, indicating predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores. The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by FT-IR spectra, showing bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 corresponding to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron. The defective trigonal boron structures (BO3) were identified as the active sites for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene, while the activation of primary CH bonds in ethane required a higher temperature range of 560-590 C for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The bowl-like structures of B-based materials have a large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space, which enhance their potential in catalysis, environmental remediation, and energy storage. The BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure is constructed from numerous oriented bowl-like blocks, forming a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. The size of the openings can be adjusted by varying the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives, which is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The generated h-BN enhances the gas trapping capacity of the liquid B2O3 environment foam, allowing for precise control of the pressure differential between large and small bubbles, which favors the oriented opening of the bowl-like structure. The pure h-BN monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure, prepared at higher temperatures, possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure, which results in excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls, which could potentially enhance catalytic performance by increasing the surface area and pore volume. The effectiveness of different methods for incorporating B active components into structures for various catalytic applications is not discussed. Additionally, boron doping of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) enhances the selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied. For the same reaction temperatures and conversions, B-doped CNFs exhibited higher selectivities to propene than pristine CNFs. The type of B precursor affects the selectivity to propene, and CNFs modified using boric acid as the precursor provided the highest selectivity at isoconversion.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are achieved through a two-step wash-coat method, where SiO2 acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups. The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite allow for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and effective pore diffusion on the catalyst. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst shows good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading, achieving high propylene and olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production under high GHSV, leading to a high propylene space time yield. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it discuss the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that silicon boride, a metal-free material rich in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance properties at high temperatures and can be a potential catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensures catalytic stability. The origin of catalytic activity is attributed to the BOH groups generated from BO species with the assistance of steam. This suggests that the dispersion of boron active sites in a porous framework could enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites for reactions and improving the stability of the catalyst under high-temperature conditions.

The study prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method, which exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1. This is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date. One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure. The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process. There is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contained more defects and edge sites with abundant BOH groups, which facilitated the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction. The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion. The stability of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was superior, which was probably attributed to the SiO2 support anchoring effect. The abundant OH groups of SiO2 support can promote the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN. The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed. The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction.

Boron oxide, as an electron-deficient promoter, inhibits the dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This effect was observed even at a low loading of 0.003wt%, demonstrating that only a small fraction of surface functionalities are catalytically active. The propene selectivity increases significantly, while the overall reaction rate decreases slightly, resulting in an improved production of propene. The maximum productivity of propene is achieved at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%. The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, with only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface covered by an amorphous coating. The good thermal stability of the doped samples indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, acting as a backbone against oxidation.

The embryonic borosilicate zeolite, with its abundant defective sites and large porosity, is designed for catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. Solid-state NMR reveals that the boron sites in open coordination, derived from the defect-rich structure of the zeolite, ensure ample exposure of the active center. The enhanced contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, leading to an increase in the reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30. This indicates that the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites and improving mass transfer. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as the preparation of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for the ODH of propane.

The electrospinning synthesis method ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework, which is beneficial for catalytic performance. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high WHSV in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, the porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts show higher olefin selectivity and stability. The electrospinning method is effective for incorporating boron active components into the porous framework, which is advantageous for catalytic applications such as the ODH of ethane and propane. The synthesized porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSNs) have a diameter of 100-150 nm and are produced by electrospinning. The electrospinning process ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts exhibit higher olefin selectivity and stability. The presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts may cause low propylene selectivity during the ODH of propane. The PBSN catalysts are obtained by electrospinning followed by calcination in air. The TEM image of PBSN-3 shows a porous structure with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements. The XRD patterns of the PBSN catalysts indicate the amorphous nature of SiO2 and the high dispersion of B2O3 species in the fiber structure. The B2O3/gel catalyst allows the aggregation of B2O3, as indicated by the XRD pattern. The PBSN-3 catalyst shows higher propylene selectivity than B2O3/gel. The PBSN catalyst is inactive for ethane dehydrogenation alone, but ethylene is formed immediately when a mixture of oxygen and ethane is pulsed into the chamber. The reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5 in both the ODH of ethane and propane, suggesting that molecular oxygen may dissociate on the surface of the catalyst.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, increasing the number of active sites, and improving the diffusion of reactants and products. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and effective way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The phenomenon of tertiary aggregation observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4 contributes to the formation of a stable and active catalyst. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, which is a key factor in the excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability of B2O3@BPO4 at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The melting point of B2O3 and the change in viscosity of its melting phase with temperature make it a suitable candidate for high-temperature catalytic applications. The use of hollow micro-/nanostructured materials as supports for traditional supported catalysts can increase the number of active sites and improve the loading capacity of the catalyst. However, the preparation process can be tedious, involving the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites. The one-step template-free method used to synthesize B2O3@BPO4 hollow sphere structures is a simple approach that makes the best use of both sides of hollow spheres. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The B2O3@BPO4 composite demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into porous frameworks with 3-D dispersed active sites, enhancing catalytic performance for different catalytic applications. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and efficient way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability at high temperatures. The formation process involves not only conventional particle aggregations and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation, which contributes to the formation of the unique sandwich-like structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibits excellent activity and selectivity, with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. This method of incorporating B active components into the structure is effective for high-temperature catalytic applications, especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The unique structure of the B2O3@BPO4 composite, consisting of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires, enhances catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for active sites and efficient mass transfer. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at high temperatures (>450 C), demonstrating excellent productivity and stability. The synthesis process involves primary and secondary particle aggregations, Ostwald ripening, and an additional tertiary aggregation, leading to the formation of the sandwich-like hollow sphere structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite outperforms many metal-based catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability, making it a promising metal-free catalyst for high-temperature applications. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which allowed for the formation of a unique tertiary aggregation phenomenon. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, enhancing the catalytic activity and long-time stability of the material at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. B2O3, with its melting point of 450 C and changing viscosity at high temperatures, is a key component in hydrocarbon conversions. However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperatures poses a challenge for B2O3-containing catalysts. Interestingly, the low volatility and high melting point of B2O3 make it suitable for use as a high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalyst (SPLC) when supported by a suitable material. Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports for traditional supported catalysts to gain more active sites. Sandwich-like structures are commonly used to maximize the utilization of planar supports. The B2O3@BPO4 composite, with its sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method, demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperatures, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. The reaction follows Eley-Rideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane.

Boron-containing materials have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins. The surface of these catalysts oxidizes and hydrolyzes under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) layer. The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption. The boron loading was quantified by ICP-MS to be 1.10.1wt.%. The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are not active for propane ODH. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the boron species in B-MWW. The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites. The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species matches the results, verifying that B-MWW contains primarily framework species. The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.

Boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), boron carbide, boron oxide, and boron phosphate, have been developed for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. These materials have unique structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance. For example, h-BN can be synthesized through various methods, including mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, which can increase the surface area and expose more active sites. The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst can improve heat and mass transfer, which is crucial for industrialization. Boron carbide has a rhombohedral phase and can be synthesized by various methods, including magnesiothermic reduction, carbothermic reduction, vapor phase reactions, synthesis from elements, and synthesis from polymer precursors. Boron oxide has a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles and can be supported on high specific area mesoporous silica to improve catalytic performance. Boron phosphate has a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra and can be developed into a three-dimensional ordered macroporous material with a robust framework to improve activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as impregnation, chemical vapor deposition, and synthesis from polymer precursors, have been shown to be effective for different catalytic applications.

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has gained significant attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene due to its high olefin selectivity compared to metal oxides. N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C. Spectroscopy revealed that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion. The different catalytic activity attributed to plasma treatment prompted further investigation into the structure of the catalysts. N2 plasma was found to induce more defects in BN, and the peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted relative to BN, with an obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum. These changes were attributed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, indicating that N2 plasma could create more N-defects. The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN was similar, and O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content to N2-BN-spent. These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion under the same reaction conditions. The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sintering of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite having higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN. The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased compared to the parent BN. Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from BN to H2-BN and Ar-BN, the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area.

The ordered macroporous structure of boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by improving mass transport and increasing the accessibility of active sites. The synthesis of ordered macroporous boron phosphate (BPO4) was achieved through hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, using boric acid and phosphoric acid as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as the hard template. The ordered macroporous structure, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores, was an inverse replica of the template. The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited remarkable structural stability, and the content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane. The ordered macroporous structure and the presence of tri-coordinated boron species in the framework were effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH of propane. The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter. The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis, and the specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield. The structural stability of the BPO4(OM) catalyst is evidenced by unchanged macropore sizes and intergrown nanocrystals, as well as an identical XRD pattern before and after the catalytic reaction. The active sites are identified as tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species, which are retained after the reaction, as confirmed by FTIR, NMR, and XPS measurements. The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increases from 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating their role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. This suggests that the pore structure of the support impacts the catalytic performance. The apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3, is also influenced by the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. These findings indicate that the spatial confinement of boron sites and the pore structure of the support play crucial roles in the catalytic activity of B-based materials. The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. This suggests that the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into these structures for different catalytic applications may depend on the specific pore structure and loading of B2O3. The study of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures indicates that the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane can impact the apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3. This implies that the methods used to incorporate B active components into the structures can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity.

Borosilicate zeolites serve as active catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), providing a platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts and the construction of highly active boron centers. The isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP over B-MWW zeolite. In contrast, defect boron sites are crucial for catalyzing the ODHP reaction, with aggregated boron species being more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than isolated species. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center for catalyzing the ODHP reaction at low temperature. A series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction. The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature. Structure characterizations revealed that incomplete crystallization could enrich defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts.

The isolated boron in the zeolite framework without oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere due to the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test. The isolated boron in the zeolite framework is inert for the reaction, but the isolated boron in BS-1 zeolite exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP. The 2D 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species. The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures. The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage. The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction. This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution, giving good durability in the reaction process. The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species, which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity.

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites typically have porous structures and high specific surface areas, which provide numerous sites for active B species and confined space that influences radical reaction behavior. The pore structure also regulates mass transport during reactions. Loading B active components on the surface of 3-D porous structures or doping them into the framework of porous materials is an effective method for constructing 3-D B active sites. For example, h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts have a well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure that enhances mass transport and catalytic performance. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite can anchor boron oxide active sites, leading to high propene selectivity at low temperatures. The 3-D wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts with B2O3 loading achieve excellent olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production. The 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite, with molten boron oxide acting as a homogeneous catalyst, exhibits high stability and olefin selectivity. Doping B species into zeolite frameworks creates a 3-D dispersion of B active sites, resulting in high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate, synthesized using a hard template method, has rich pores and a high surface area, improving molecular diffusion and heat transfer. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam, with a large surface area and numerous mesopores, shows excellent activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites was achieved through hydrothermal methods, with modifications to previous reports. The zeolites have a type-I N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, indicating predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores. The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by FT-IR spectra, showing bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 corresponding to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron. The defective trigonal boron structures (BO3) were identified as the active sites for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene, while the activation of primary CH bonds in ethane required a higher temperature range of 560-590 C for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The bowl-like structures of B-based materials have a large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space, which enhance their potential in catalysis, environmental remediation, and energy storage. The BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure is constructed from numerous oriented bowl-like blocks, forming a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. The size of the openings can be adjusted by varying the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives, which is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The generated h-BN enhances the gas trapping capacity of the liquid B2O3 environment foam, allowing for precise control of the pressure differential between large and small bubbles, which favors the oriented opening of the bowl-like structure. The pure h-BN monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure, prepared at higher temperatures, possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure, which results in excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls, which could potentially enhance catalytic performance by increasing the surface area and pore volume. The effectiveness of different methods for incorporating B active components into structures for various catalytic applications is not discussed. Additionally, boron doping of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) enhances the selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied. For the same reaction temperatures and conversions, B-doped CNFs exhibited higher selectivities to propene than pristine CNFs. The type of B precursor affects the selectivity to propene, and CNFs modified using boric acid as the precursor provided the highest selectivity at isoconversion.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are achieved through a two-step wash-coat method, where SiO2 acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups. The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite allow for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and effective pore diffusion on the catalyst. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst shows good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading, achieving high propylene and olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production under high GHSV, leading to a high propylene space time yield. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it discuss the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that silicon boride, a metal-free material rich in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance properties at high temperatures and can be a potential catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensures catalytic stability. The origin of catalytic activity is attributed to the BOH groups generated from BO species with the assistance of steam. This suggests that the dispersion of boron active sites in a porous framework could enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites for reactions and improving the stability of the catalyst under high-temperature conditions.

The study prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method, which exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1. This is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date. One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure. The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process. There is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contained more defects and edge sites with abundant BOH groups, which facilitated the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction. The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion. The stability of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was superior, which was probably attributed to the SiO2 support anchoring effect. The abundant OH groups of SiO2 support can promote the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN. The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed. The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction.

Boron oxide, as an electron-deficient promoter, inhibits the dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This effect was observed even at a low loading of 0.003wt%, demonstrating that only a small fraction of surface functionalities are catalytically active. The propene selectivity increases significantly, while the overall reaction rate decreases slightly, resulting in an improved production of propene. The maximum productivity of propene is achieved at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%. The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, with only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface covered by an amorphous coating. The good thermal stability of the doped samples indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, acting as a backbone against oxidation.

The embryonic borosilicate zeolite, with its abundant defective sites and large porosity, is designed for catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. Solid-state NMR reveals that the boron sites in open coordination, derived from the defect-rich structure of the zeolite, ensure ample exposure of the active center. The enhanced contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, leading to an increase in the reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30. This indicates that the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites and improving mass transfer. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as the preparation of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for the ODH of propane.

The electrospinning synthesis method ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework, which is beneficial for catalytic performance. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high WHSV in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, the porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts show higher olefin selectivity and stability. The electrospinning method is effective for incorporating boron active components into the porous framework, which is advantageous for catalytic applications such as the ODH of ethane and propane. The synthesized porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSNs) have a diameter of 100-150 nm and are produced by electrospinning. The electrospinning process ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts exhibit higher olefin selectivity and stability. The presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts may cause low propylene selectivity during the ODH of propane. The PBSN catalysts are obtained by electrospinning followed by calcination in air. The TEM image of PBSN-3 shows a porous structure with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements. The XRD patterns of the PBSN catalysts indicate the amorphous nature of SiO2 and the high dispersion of B2O3 species in the fiber structure. The B2O3/gel catalyst allows the aggregation of B2O3, as indicated by the XRD pattern. The PBSN-3 catalyst shows higher propylene selectivity than B2O3/gel. The PBSN catalyst is inactive for ethane dehydrogenation alone, but ethylene is formed immediately when a mixture of oxygen and ethane is pulsed into the chamber. The reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5 in both the ODH of ethane and propane, suggesting that molecular oxygen may dissociate on the surface of the catalyst.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, increasing the number of active sites, and improving the diffusion of reactants and products. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and effective way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The phenomenon of tertiary aggregation observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4 contributes to the formation of a stable and active catalyst. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, which is a key factor in the excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability of B2O3@BPO4 at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The melting point of B2O3 and the change in viscosity of its melting phase with temperature make it a suitable candidate for high-temperature catalytic applications. The use of hollow micro-/nanostructured materials as supports for traditional supported catalysts can increase the number of active sites and improve the loading capacity of the catalyst. However, the preparation process can be tedious, involving the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites. The one-step template-free method used to synthesize B2O3@BPO4 hollow sphere structures is a simple approach that makes the best use of both sides of hollow spheres. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The B2O3@BPO4 composite demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into porous frameworks with 3-D dispersed active sites, enhancing catalytic performance for different catalytic applications. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and efficient way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability at high temperatures. The formation process involves not only conventional particle aggregations and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation, which contributes to the formation of the unique sandwich-like structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibits excellent activity and selectivity, with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. This method of incorporating B active components into the structure is effective for high-temperature catalytic applications, especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The unique structure of the B2O3@BPO4 composite, consisting of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires, enhances catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for active sites and efficient mass transfer. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at high temperatures (>450 C), demonstrating excellent productivity and stability. The synthesis process involves primary and secondary particle aggregations, Ostwald ripening, and an additional tertiary aggregation, leading to the formation of the sandwich-like hollow sphere structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite outperforms many metal-based catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability, making it a promising metal-free catalyst for high-temperature applications. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which allowed for the formation of a unique tertiary aggregation phenomenon. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, enhancing the catalytic activity and long-time stability of the material at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. B2O3, with its melting point of 450 C and changing viscosity at high temperatures, is a key component in hydrocarbon conversions. However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperatures poses a challenge for B2O3-containing catalysts. Interestingly, the low volatility and high melting point of B2O3 make it suitable for use as a high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalyst (SPLC) when supported by a suitable material. Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports for traditional supported catalysts to gain more active sites. Sandwich-like structures are commonly used to maximize the utilization of planar supports. The B2O3@BPO4 composite, with its sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method, demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperatures, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. The reaction follows Eley-Rideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane.

Boron-containing materials have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins. The surface of these catalysts oxidizes and hydrolyzes under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) layer. The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption. The boron loading was quantified by ICP-MS to be 1.10.1wt.%. The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are not active for propane ODH. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the boron species in B-MWW. The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites. The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species matches the results, verifying that B-MWW contains primarily framework species. The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.

Boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), boron carbide, boron oxide, and boron phosphate, have been developed for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. These materials have unique structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance. For example, h-BN can be synthesized through various methods, including mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, which can increase the surface area and expose more active sites. The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst can improve heat and mass transfer, which is crucial for industrialization. Boron carbide has a rhombohedral phase and can be synthesized by various methods, including magnesiothermic reduction, carbothermic reduction, vapor phase reactions, synthesis from elements, and synthesis from polymer precursors. Boron oxide has a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles and can be supported on high specific area mesoporous silica to improve catalytic performance. Boron phosphate has a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra and can be developed into a three-dimensional ordered macroporous material with a robust framework to improve activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as impregnation, chemical vapor deposition, and synthesis from polymer precursors, have been shown to be effective for different catalytic applications.

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has gained significant attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene due to its high olefin selectivity compared to metal oxides. N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C. Spectroscopy revealed that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion. The different catalytic activity attributed to plasma treatment prompted further investigation into the structure of the catalysts. N2 plasma was found to induce more defects in BN, and the peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted relative to BN, with an obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum. These changes were attributed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, indicating that N2 plasma could create more N-defects. The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN was similar, and O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content to N2-BN-spent. These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion under the same reaction conditions. The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sintering of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite having higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN. The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased compared to the parent BN. Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from BN to H2-BN and Ar-BN, the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area.

The ordered macroporous structure of boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by improving mass transport and increasing the accessibility of active sites. The synthesis of ordered macroporous boron phosphate (BPO4) was achieved through hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, using boric acid and phosphoric acid as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as the hard template. The ordered macroporous structure, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores, was an inverse replica of the template. The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited remarkable structural stability, and the content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane. The ordered macroporous structure and the presence of tri-coordinated boron species in the framework were effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH of propane. The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter. The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis, and the specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield. The structural stability of the BPO4(OM) catalyst is evidenced by unchanged macropore sizes and intergrown nanocrystals, as well as an identical XRD pattern before and after the catalytic reaction. The active sites are identified as tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species, which are retained after the reaction, as confirmed by FTIR, NMR, and XPS measurements. The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increases from 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating their role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. This suggests that the pore structure of the support impacts the catalytic performance. The apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3, is also influenced by the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. These findings indicate that the spatial confinement of boron sites and the pore structure of the support play crucial roles in the catalytic activity of B-based materials. The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. This suggests that the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into these structures for different catalytic applications may depend on the specific pore structure and loading of B2O3. The study of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures indicates that the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane can impact the apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3. This implies that the methods used to incorporate B active components into the structures can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity.

Borosilicate zeolites serve as active catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), providing a platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts and the construction of highly active boron centers. The isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP over B-MWW zeolite. In contrast, defect boron sites are crucial for catalyzing the ODHP reaction, with aggregated boron species being more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than isolated species. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center for catalyzing the ODHP reaction at low temperature. A series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction. The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature. Structure characterizations revealed that incomplete crystallization could enrich defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts.

The isolated boron in the zeolite framework without oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere due to the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test. The isolated boron in the zeolite framework is inert for the reaction, but the isolated boron in BS-1 zeolite exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP. The 2D 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species. The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures. The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage. The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction. This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution, giving good durability in the reaction process. The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species, which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity.

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites typically have porous structures and high specific surface areas, which provide numerous sites for active B species and confined space that influences radical reaction behavior. The pore structure also regulates mass transport during reactions. Loading B active components on the surface of 3-D porous structures or doping them into the framework of porous materials is an effective method for constructing 3-D B active sites. For example, h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts have a well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure that enhances mass transport and catalytic performance. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite can anchor boron oxide active sites, leading to high propene selectivity at low temperatures. The 3-D wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts with B2O3 loading achieve excellent olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production. The 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite, with molten boron oxide acting as a homogeneous catalyst, exhibits high stability and olefin selectivity. Doping B species into zeolite frameworks creates a 3-D dispersion of B active sites, resulting in high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate, synthesized using a hard template method, has rich pores and a high surface area, improving molecular diffusion and heat transfer. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam, with a large surface area and numerous mesopores, shows excellent activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites was achieved through hydrothermal methods, with modifications to previous reports. The zeolites have a type-I N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, indicating predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores. The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by FT-IR spectra, showing bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 corresponding to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron. The defective trigonal boron structures (BO3) were identified as the active sites for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene, while the activation of primary CH bonds in ethane required a higher temperature range of 560-590 C for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The bowl-like structures of B-based materials have a large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space, which enhance their potential in catalysis, environmental remediation, and energy storage. The BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure is constructed from numerous oriented bowl-like blocks, forming a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. The size of the openings can be adjusted by varying the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives, which is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The generated h-BN enhances the gas trapping capacity of the liquid B2O3 environment foam, allowing for precise control of the pressure differential between large and small bubbles, which favors the oriented opening of the bowl-like structure. The pure h-BN monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure, prepared at higher temperatures, possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure, which results in excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls, which could potentially enhance catalytic performance by increasing the surface area and pore volume. The effectiveness of different methods for incorporating B active components into structures for various catalytic applications is not discussed. Additionally, boron doping of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) enhances the selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied. For the same reaction temperatures and conversions, B-doped CNFs exhibited higher selectivities to propene than pristine CNFs. The type of B precursor affects the selectivity to propene, and CNFs modified using boric acid as the precursor provided the highest selectivity at isoconversion.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are achieved through a two-step wash-coat method, where SiO2 acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups. The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite allow for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and effective pore diffusion on the catalyst. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst shows good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading, achieving high propylene and olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production under high GHSV, leading to a high propylene space time yield. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it discuss the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that silicon boride, a metal-free material rich in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance properties at high temperatures and can be a potential catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensures catalytic stability. The origin of catalytic activity is attributed to the BOH groups generated from BO species with the assistance of steam. This suggests that the dispersion of boron active sites in a porous framework could enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites for reactions and improving the stability of the catalyst under high-temperature conditions.

The study prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method, which exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1. This is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date. One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure. The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process. There is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contained more defects and edge sites with abundant BOH groups, which facilitated the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction. The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion. The stability of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was superior, which was probably attributed to the SiO2 support anchoring effect. The abundant OH groups of SiO2 support can promote the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN. The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed. The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction.

Boron oxide, as an electron-deficient promoter, inhibits the dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This effect was observed even at a low loading of 0.003wt%, demonstrating that only a small fraction of surface functionalities are catalytically active. The propene selectivity increases significantly, while the overall reaction rate decreases slightly, resulting in an improved production of propene. The maximum productivity of propene is achieved at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%. The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, with only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface covered by an amorphous coating. The good thermal stability of the doped samples indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, acting as a backbone against oxidation.

The embryonic borosilicate zeolite, with its abundant defective sites and large porosity, is designed for catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. Solid-state NMR reveals that the boron sites in open coordination, derived from the defect-rich structure of the zeolite, ensure ample exposure of the active center. The enhanced contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, leading to an increase in the reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30. This indicates that the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites and improving mass transfer. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as the preparation of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for the ODH of propane.

The electrospinning synthesis method ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework, which is beneficial for catalytic performance. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high WHSV in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, the porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts show higher olefin selectivity and stability. The electrospinning method is effective for incorporating boron active components into the porous framework, which is advantageous for catalytic applications such as the ODH of ethane and propane. The synthesized porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSNs) have a diameter of 100-150 nm and are produced by electrospinning. The electrospinning process ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts exhibit higher olefin selectivity and stability. The presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts may cause low propylene selectivity during the ODH of propane. The PBSN catalysts are obtained by electrospinning followed by calcination in air. The TEM image of PBSN-3 shows a porous structure with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements. The XRD patterns of the PBSN catalysts indicate the amorphous nature of SiO2 and the high dispersion of B2O3 species in the fiber structure. The B2O3/gel catalyst allows the aggregation of B2O3, as indicated by the XRD pattern. The PBSN-3 catalyst shows higher propylene selectivity than B2O3/gel. The PBSN catalyst is inactive for ethane dehydrogenation alone, but ethylene is formed immediately when a mixture of oxygen and ethane is pulsed into the chamber. The reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5 in both the ODH of ethane and propane, suggesting that molecular oxygen may dissociate on the surface of the catalyst.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, increasing the number of active sites, and improving the diffusion of reactants and products. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and effective way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The phenomenon of tertiary aggregation observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4 contributes to the formation of a stable and active catalyst. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, which is a key factor in the excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability of B2O3@BPO4 at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The melting point of B2O3 and the change in viscosity of its melting phase with temperature make it a suitable candidate for high-temperature catalytic applications. The use of hollow micro-/nanostructured materials as supports for traditional supported catalysts can increase the number of active sites and improve the loading capacity of the catalyst. However, the preparation process can be tedious, involving the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites. The one-step template-free method used to synthesize B2O3@BPO4 hollow sphere structures is a simple approach that makes the best use of both sides of hollow spheres. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The B2O3@BPO4 composite demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into porous frameworks with 3-D dispersed active sites, enhancing catalytic performance for different catalytic applications. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and efficient way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability at high temperatures. The formation process involves not only conventional particle aggregations and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation, which contributes to the formation of the unique sandwich-like structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibits excellent activity and selectivity, with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. This method of incorporating B active components into the structure is effective for high-temperature catalytic applications, especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The unique structure of the B2O3@BPO4 composite, consisting of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires, enhances catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for active sites and efficient mass transfer. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at high temperatures (>450 C), demonstrating excellent productivity and stability. The synthesis process involves primary and secondary particle aggregations, Ostwald ripening, and an additional tertiary aggregation, leading to the formation of the sandwich-like hollow sphere structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite outperforms many metal-based catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability, making it a promising metal-free catalyst for high-temperature applications. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which allowed for the formation of a unique tertiary aggregation phenomenon. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, enhancing the catalytic activity and long-time stability of the material at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. B2O3, with its melting point of 450 C and changing viscosity at high temperatures, is a key component in hydrocarbon conversions. However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperatures poses a challenge for B2O3-containing catalysts. Interestingly, the low volatility and high melting point of B2O3 make it suitable for use as a high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalyst (SPLC) when supported by a suitable material. Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports for traditional supported catalysts to gain more active sites. Sandwich-like structures are commonly used to maximize the utilization of planar supports. The B2O3@BPO4 composite, with its sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method, demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperatures, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. The reaction follows Eley-Rideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane.

Boron-containing materials have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins. The surface of these catalysts oxidizes and hydrolyzes under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) layer. The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption. The boron loading was quantified by ICP-MS to be 1.10.1wt.%. The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are not active for propane ODH. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the boron species in B-MWW. The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites. The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species matches the results, verifying that B-MWW contains primarily framework species. The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.

Boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), boron carbide, boron oxide, and boron phosphate, have been developed for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. These materials have unique structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance. For example, h-BN can be synthesized through various methods, including mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, which can increase the surface area and expose more active sites. The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst can improve heat and mass transfer, which is crucial for industrialization. Boron carbide has a rhombohedral phase and can be synthesized by various methods, including magnesiothermic reduction, carbothermic reduction, vapor phase reactions, synthesis from elements, and synthesis from polymer precursors. Boron oxide has a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles and can be supported on high specific area mesoporous silica to improve catalytic performance. Boron phosphate has a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra and can be developed into a three-dimensional ordered macroporous material with a robust framework to improve activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as impregnation, chemical vapor deposition, and synthesis from polymer precursors, have been shown to be effective for different catalytic applications.

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has gained significant attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene due to its high olefin selectivity compared to metal oxides. N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C. Spectroscopy revealed that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion. The different catalytic activity attributed to plasma treatment prompted further investigation into the structure of the catalysts. N2 plasma was found to induce more defects in BN, and the peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted relative to BN, with an obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum. These changes were attributed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, indicating that N2 plasma could create more N-defects. The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN was similar, and O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content to N2-BN-spent. These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion under the same reaction conditions. The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sintering of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite having higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN. The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased compared to the parent BN. Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from BN to H2-BN and Ar-BN, the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area.

The ordered macroporous structure of boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by improving mass transport and increasing the accessibility of active sites. The synthesis of ordered macroporous boron phosphate (BPO4) was achieved through hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, using boric acid and phosphoric acid as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as the hard template. The ordered macroporous structure, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores, was an inverse replica of the template. The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited remarkable structural stability, and the content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane. The ordered macroporous structure and the presence of tri-coordinated boron species in the framework were effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH of propane. The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter. The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis, and the specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield. The structural stability of the BPO4(OM) catalyst is evidenced by unchanged macropore sizes and intergrown nanocrystals, as well as an identical XRD pattern before and after the catalytic reaction. The active sites are identified as tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species, which are retained after the reaction, as confirmed by FTIR, NMR, and XPS measurements. The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increases from 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating their role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. This suggests that the pore structure of the support impacts the catalytic performance. The apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3, is also influenced by the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. These findings indicate that the spatial confinement of boron sites and the pore structure of the support play crucial roles in the catalytic activity of B-based materials. The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. This suggests that the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into these structures for different catalytic applications may depend on the specific pore structure and loading of B2O3. The study of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures indicates that the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane can impact the apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3. This implies that the methods used to incorporate B active components into the structures can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity.

Borosilicate zeolites serve as active catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), providing a platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts and the construction of highly active boron centers. The isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP over B-MWW zeolite. In contrast, defect boron sites are crucial for catalyzing the ODHP reaction, with aggregated boron species being more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than isolated species. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center for catalyzing the ODHP reaction at low temperature. A series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction. The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature. Structure characterizations revealed that incomplete crystallization could enrich defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts.

The isolated boron in the zeolite framework without oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere due to the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test. The isolated boron in the zeolite framework is inert for the reaction, but the isolated boron in BS-1 zeolite exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP. The 2D 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species. The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures. The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage. The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction. This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution, giving good durability in the reaction process. The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species, which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity.

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites typically have porous structures and high specific surface areas, which provide numerous sites for active B species and confined space that influences radical reaction behavior. The pore structure also regulates mass transport during reactions. Loading B active components on the surface of 3-D porous structures or doping them into the framework of porous materials is an effective method for constructing 3-D B active sites. For example, h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts have a well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure that enhances mass transport and catalytic performance. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite can anchor boron oxide active sites, leading to high propene selectivity at low temperatures. The 3-D wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts with B2O3 loading achieve excellent olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production. The 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite, with molten boron oxide acting as a homogeneous catalyst, exhibits high stability and olefin selectivity. Doping B species into zeolite frameworks creates a 3-D dispersion of B active sites, resulting in high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate, synthesized using a hard template method, has rich pores and a high surface area, improving molecular diffusion and heat transfer. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam, with a large surface area and numerous mesopores, shows excellent activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites was achieved through hydrothermal methods, with modifications to previous reports. The zeolites have a type-I N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, indicating predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores. The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by FT-IR spectra, showing bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 corresponding to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron. The defective trigonal boron structures (BO3) were identified as the active sites for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene, while the activation of primary CH bonds in ethane required a higher temperature range of 560-590 C for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The bowl-like structures of B-based materials have a large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space, which enhance their potential in catalysis, environmental remediation, and energy storage. The BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure is constructed from numerous oriented bowl-like blocks, forming a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. The size of the openings can be adjusted by varying the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives, which is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The generated h-BN enhances the gas trapping capacity of the liquid B2O3 environment foam, allowing for precise control of the pressure differential between large and small bubbles, which favors the oriented opening of the bowl-like structure. The pure h-BN monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure, prepared at higher temperatures, possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure, which results in excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls, which could potentially enhance catalytic performance by increasing the surface area and pore volume. The effectiveness of different methods for incorporating B active components into structures for various catalytic applications is not discussed. Additionally, boron doping of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) enhances the selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied. For the same reaction temperatures and conversions, B-doped CNFs exhibited higher selectivities to propene than pristine CNFs. The type of B precursor affects the selectivity to propene, and CNFs modified using boric acid as the precursor provided the highest selectivity at isoconversion.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are achieved through a two-step wash-coat method, where SiO2 acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups. The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite allow for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and effective pore diffusion on the catalyst. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst shows good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading, achieving high propylene and olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production under high GHSV, leading to a high propylene space time yield. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it discuss the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that silicon boride, a metal-free material rich in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance properties at high temperatures and can be a potential catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensures catalytic stability. The origin of catalytic activity is attributed to the BOH groups generated from BO species with the assistance of steam. This suggests that the dispersion of boron active sites in a porous framework could enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites for reactions and improving the stability of the catalyst under high-temperature conditions.

The study prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method, which exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1. This is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date. One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure. The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process. There is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contained more defects and edge sites with abundant BOH groups, which facilitated the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction. The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion. The stability of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was superior, which was probably attributed to the SiO2 support anchoring effect. The abundant OH groups of SiO2 support can promote the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN. The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed. The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction.

Boron oxide, as an electron-deficient promoter, inhibits the dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This effect was observed even at a low loading of 0.003wt%, demonstrating that only a small fraction of surface functionalities are catalytically active. The propene selectivity increases significantly, while the overall reaction rate decreases slightly, resulting in an improved production of propene. The maximum productivity of propene is achieved at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%. The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, with only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface covered by an amorphous coating. The good thermal stability of the doped samples indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, acting as a backbone against oxidation.

The embryonic borosilicate zeolite, with its abundant defective sites and large porosity, is designed for catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. Solid-state NMR reveals that the boron sites in open coordination, derived from the defect-rich structure of the zeolite, ensure ample exposure of the active center. The enhanced contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, leading to an increase in the reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30. This indicates that the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites and improving mass transfer. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as the preparation of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for the ODH of propane.

The electrospinning synthesis method ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework, which is beneficial for catalytic performance. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high WHSV in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, the porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts show higher olefin selectivity and stability. The electrospinning method is effective for incorporating boron active components into the porous framework, which is advantageous for catalytic applications such as the ODH of ethane and propane. The synthesized porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSNs) have a diameter of 100-150 nm and are produced by electrospinning. The electrospinning process ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts exhibit higher olefin selectivity and stability. The presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts may cause low propylene selectivity during the ODH of propane. The PBSN catalysts are obtained by electrospinning followed by calcination in air. The TEM image of PBSN-3 shows a porous structure with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements. The XRD patterns of the PBSN catalysts indicate the amorphous nature of SiO2 and the high dispersion of B2O3 species in the fiber structure. The B2O3/gel catalyst allows the aggregation of B2O3, as indicated by the XRD pattern. The PBSN-3 catalyst shows higher propylene selectivity than B2O3/gel. The PBSN catalyst is inactive for ethane dehydrogenation alone, but ethylene is formed immediately when a mixture of oxygen and ethane is pulsed into the chamber. The reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5 in both the ODH of ethane and propane, suggesting that molecular oxygen may dissociate on the surface of the catalyst.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, increasing the number of active sites, and improving the diffusion of reactants and products. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and effective way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The phenomenon of tertiary aggregation observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4 contributes to the formation of a stable and active catalyst. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, which is a key factor in the excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability of B2O3@BPO4 at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The melting point of B2O3 and the change in viscosity of its melting phase with temperature make it a suitable candidate for high-temperature catalytic applications. The use of hollow micro-/nanostructured materials as supports for traditional supported catalysts can increase the number of active sites and improve the loading capacity of the catalyst. However, the preparation process can be tedious, involving the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites. The one-step template-free method used to synthesize B2O3@BPO4 hollow sphere structures is a simple approach that makes the best use of both sides of hollow spheres. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance.

The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability at high temperatures. The formation process involves not only conventional particle aggregations and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation, which contributes to the formation of the unique sandwich-like structure.

The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, enhancing the catalytic activity and long-time stability of the material at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. B2O3, with its melting point of 450 C and changing viscosity at high temperatures, is a key component in hydrocarbon conversions. However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperatures poses a challenge for B2O3-containing catalysts. Interestingly, the low volatility and high melting point of B2O3 make it suitable for use as a high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalyst (SPLC) when supported by a suitable material. Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports for traditional supported catalysts to gain more active sites. Sandwich-like structures are commonly used to maximize the utilization of planar supports. The B2O3@BPO4 composite, with its sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method, demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperatures, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. The reaction follows Eley-Rideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane.

Boron-containing materials have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins. The surface of these catalysts oxidizes and hydrolyzes under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) layer. The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption. The boron loading was quantified by ICP-MS to be 1.10.1wt.%. The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are not active for propane ODH. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the boron species in B-MWW. The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites. The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species matches the results, verifying that B-MWW contains primarily framework species. The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.

Boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), boron carbide, boron oxide, and boron phosphate, have been developed for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. These materials have unique structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance. For example, h-BN can be synthesized through various methods, including mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, which can increase the surface area and expose more active sites. The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst can improve heat and mass transfer, which is crucial for industrialization. Boron carbide has a rhombohedral phase and can be synthesized by various methods, including magnesiothermic reduction, carbothermic reduction, vapor phase reactions, synthesis from elements, and synthesis from polymer precursors. Boron oxide has a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles and can be supported on high specific area mesoporous silica to improve catalytic performance. Boron phosphate has a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra and can be developed into a three-dimensional ordered macroporous material with a robust framework to improve activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as impregnation, chemical vapor deposition, and synthesis from polymer precursors, have been shown to be effective for different catalytic applications.

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has gained significant attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene due to its high olefin selectivity compared to metal oxides. N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C. Spectroscopy revealed that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion. The different catalytic activity attributed to plasma treatment prompted further investigation into the structure of the catalysts. N2 plasma was found to induce more defects in BN, and the peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted relative to BN, with an obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum. These changes were attributed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, indicating that N2 plasma could create more N-defects. The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN was similar, and O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content to N2-BN-spent. These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion under the same reaction conditions. The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sintering of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite having higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN. The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased compared to the parent BN. Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from BN to H2-BN and Ar-BN, the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area.

The ordered macroporous structure of boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by improving mass transport and increasing the accessibility of active sites. The synthesis of ordered macroporous boron phosphate (BPO4) was achieved through hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, using boric acid and phosphoric acid as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as the hard template. The ordered macroporous structure, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores, was an inverse replica of the template. The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited remarkable structural stability, and the content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane. The ordered macroporous structure and the presence of tri-coordinated boron species in the framework were effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH of propane. The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter. The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis, and the specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield. The structural stability of the BPO4(OM) catalyst is evidenced by unchanged macropore sizes and intergrown nanocrystals, as well as an identical XRD pattern before and after the catalytic reaction. The active sites are identified as tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species, which are retained after the reaction, as confirmed by FTIR, NMR, and XPS measurements. The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increases from 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating their role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. This suggests that the pore structure of the support impacts the catalytic performance. The apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3, is also influenced by the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. These findings indicate that the spatial confinement of boron sites and the pore structure of the support play crucial roles in the catalytic activity of B-based materials. The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. This suggests that the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into these structures for different catalytic applications may depend on the specific pore structure and loading of B2O3. The study of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures indicates that the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane can impact the apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3. This implies that the methods used to incorporate B active components into the structures can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity.

Borosilicate zeolites serve as active catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), providing a platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts and the construction of highly active boron centers. The isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP over B-MWW zeolite. In contrast, defect boron sites are crucial for catalyzing the ODHP reaction, with aggregated boron species being more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than isolated species. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center for catalyzing the ODHP reaction at low temperature. A series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction. The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature. Structure characterizations revealed that incomplete crystallization could enrich defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts.

The isolated boron in the zeolite framework without oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere due to the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test. The isolated boron in the zeolite framework is inert for the reaction, but the isolated boron in BS-1 zeolite exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP. The 2D 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species. The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures. The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage. The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction. This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution, giving good durability in the reaction process. The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species, which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity.

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites typically have porous structures and high specific surface areas, which provide numerous sites for active B species and confined space that influences radical reaction behavior. The pore structure also regulates mass transport during reactions. Loading B active components on the surface of 3-D porous structures or doping them into the framework of porous materials is an effective method for constructing 3-D B active sites. For example, h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts have a well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure that enhances mass transport and catalytic performance. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite can anchor boron oxide active sites, leading to high propene selectivity at low temperatures. The 3-D wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts with B2O3 loading achieve excellent olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production. The 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite, with molten boron oxide acting as a homogeneous catalyst, exhibits high stability and olefin selectivity. Doping B species into zeolite frameworks creates a 3-D dispersion of B active sites, resulting in high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate, synthesized using a hard template method, has rich pores and a high surface area, improving molecular diffusion and heat transfer. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam, with a large surface area and numerous mesopores, shows excellent activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites was achieved through hydrothermal methods, with modifications to previous reports. The zeolites have a type-I N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, indicating predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores. The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by FT-IR spectra, showing bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 corresponding to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron. The defective trigonal boron structures (BO3) were identified as the active sites for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene, while the activation of primary CH bonds in ethane required a higher temperature range of 560-590 C for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The bowl-like structures of B-based materials have a large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space, which enhance their potential in catalysis, environmental remediation, and energy storage. The BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure is constructed from numerous oriented bowl-like blocks, forming a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. The size of the openings can be adjusted by varying the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives, which is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The generated h-BN enhances the gas trapping capacity of the liquid B2O3 environment foam, allowing for precise control of the pressure differential between large and small bubbles, which favors the oriented opening of the bowl-like structure. The pure h-BN monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure, prepared at higher temperatures, possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure, which results in excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls, which could potentially enhance catalytic performance by increasing the surface area and pore volume. The effectiveness of different methods for incorporating B active components into structures for various catalytic applications is not discussed. Additionally, boron doping of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) enhances the selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied. For the same reaction temperatures and conversions, B-doped CNFs exhibited higher selectivities to propene than pristine CNFs. The type of B precursor affects the selectivity to propene, and CNFs modified using boric acid as the precursor provided the highest selectivity at isoconversion.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are achieved through a two-step wash-coat method, where SiO2 acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups. The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite allow for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and effective pore diffusion on the catalyst. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst shows good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading, achieving high propylene and olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production under high GHSV, leading to a high propylene space time yield. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it discuss the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that silicon boride, a metal-free material rich in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance properties at high temperatures and can be a potential catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensures catalytic stability. The origin of catalytic activity is attributed to the BOH groups generated from BO species with the assistance of steam. This suggests that the dispersion of boron active sites in a porous framework could enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites for reactions and improving the stability of the catalyst under high-temperature conditions.

The study prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method, which exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1. This is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date. One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure. The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process. There is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contained more defects and edge sites with abundant BOH groups, which facilitated the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction. The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion. The stability of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was superior, which was probably attributed to the SiO2 support anchoring effect. The abundant OH groups of SiO2 support can promote the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN. The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed. The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction.

Boron oxide, as an electron-deficient promoter, inhibits the dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This effect was observed even at a low loading of 0.003wt%, demonstrating that only a small fraction of surface functionalities are catalytically active. The propene selectivity increases significantly, while the overall reaction rate decreases slightly, resulting in an improved production of propene. The maximum productivity of propene is achieved at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%. The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, with only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface covered by an amorphous coating. The good thermal stability of the doped samples indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, acting as a backbone against oxidation.

The embryonic borosilicate zeolite, with its abundant defective sites and large porosity, is designed for catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. Solid-state NMR reveals that the boron sites in open coordination, derived from the defect-rich structure of the zeolite, ensure ample exposure of the active center. The enhanced contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, leading to an increase in the reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30. This indicates that the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites and improving mass transfer. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as the preparation of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for the ODH of propane.

The electrospinning synthesis method ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework, which is beneficial for catalytic performance. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high WHSV in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, the porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts show higher olefin selectivity and stability. The electrospinning method is effective for incorporating boron active components into the porous framework, which is advantageous for catalytic applications such as the ODH of ethane and propane. The synthesized porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSNs) have a diameter of 100-150 nm and are produced by electrospinning. The electrospinning process ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts exhibit higher olefin selectivity and stability. The presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts may cause low propylene selectivity during the ODH of propane. The PBSN catalysts are obtained by electrospinning followed by calcination in air. The TEM image of PBSN-3 shows a porous structure with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements. The XRD patterns of the PBSN catalysts indicate the amorphous nature of SiO2 and the high dispersion of B2O3 species in the fiber structure. The B2O3/gel catalyst allows the aggregation of B2O3, as indicated by the XRD pattern. The PBSN-3 catalyst shows higher propylene selectivity than B2O3/gel. The PBSN catalyst is inactive for ethane dehydrogenation alone, but ethylene is formed immediately when a mixture of oxygen and ethane is pulsed into the chamber. The reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5 in both the ODH of ethane and propane, suggesting that molecular oxygen may dissociate on the surface of the catalyst.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, increasing the number of active sites, and improving the diffusion of reactants and products. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and effective way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The phenomenon of tertiary aggregation observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4 contributes to the formation of a stable and active catalyst. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, which is a key factor in the excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability of B2O3@BPO4 at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The melting point of B2O3 and the change in viscosity of its melting phase with temperature make it a suitable candidate for high-temperature catalytic applications. The use of hollow micro-/nanostructured materials as supports for traditional supported catalysts can increase the number of active sites and improve the loading capacity of the catalyst. However, the preparation process can be tedious, involving the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites. The one-step template-free method used to synthesize B2O3@BPO4 hollow sphere structures is a simple approach that makes the best use of both sides of hollow spheres. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability.

The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability at high temperatures. The formation process involves not only conventional particle aggregations and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation, which contributes to the formation of the unique sandwich-like structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibits excellent activity and selectivity, with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. This method of incorporating B active components into the structure is effective for high-temperature catalytic applications, especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The synthesis process involves primary and secondary particle aggregations, Ostwald ripening, and an additional tertiary aggregation, leading to the formation of the sandwich-like hollow sphere structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite outperforms many metal-based catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability, making it a promising metal-free catalyst for high-temperature applications.

The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, enhancing the catalytic activity and long-time stability of the material at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. B2O3, with its melting point of 450 C and changing viscosity at high temperatures, is a key component in hydrocarbon conversions. However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperatures poses a challenge for B2O3-containing catalysts. Interestingly, the low volatility and high melting point of B2O3 make it suitable for use as a high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalyst (SPLC) when supported by a suitable material. Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports for traditional supported catalysts to gain more active sites. Sandwich-like structures are commonly used to maximize the utilization of planar supports.

The reaction follows Eley-Rideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane.

Boron-containing materials have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins. The surface of these catalysts oxidizes and hydrolyzes under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) layer. The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption. The boron loading was quantified by ICP-MS to be 1.10.1wt.%. The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are not active for propane ODH. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the boron species in B-MWW. The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites. The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species matches the results, verifying that B-MWW contains primarily framework species. The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.

Boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), boron carbide, boron oxide, and boron phosphate, have been developed for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. These materials have unique structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance. For example, h-BN can be synthesized through various methods, including mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, which can increase the surface area and expose more active sites. The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst can improve heat and mass transfer, which is crucial for industrialization. Boron carbide has a rhombohedral phase and can be synthesized by various methods, including magnesiothermic reduction, carbothermic reduction, vapor phase reactions, synthesis from elements, and synthesis from polymer precursors. Boron oxide has a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles and can be supported on high specific area mesoporous silica to improve catalytic performance. Boron phosphate has a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra and can be developed into a three-dimensional ordered macroporous material with a robust framework to improve activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as impregnation, chemical vapor deposition, and synthesis from polymer precursors, have been shown to be effective for different catalytic applications.

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has gained significant attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene due to its high olefin selectivity compared to metal oxides. N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C. Spectroscopy revealed that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion. The different catalytic activity attributed to plasma treatment prompted further investigation into the structure of the catalysts. N2 plasma was found to induce more defects in BN, and the peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted relative to BN, with an obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum. These changes were attributed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, indicating that N2 plasma could create more N-defects. The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN was similar, and O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content to N2-BN-spent. These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion under the same reaction conditions. The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sintering of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite having higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN. The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased compared to the parent BN. Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from BN to H2-BN and Ar-BN, the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area.

The ordered macroporous structure of boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by improving mass transport and increasing the accessibility of active sites. The synthesis of ordered macroporous boron phosphate (BPO4) was achieved through hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, using boric acid and phosphoric acid as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as the hard template. The ordered macroporous structure, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores, was an inverse replica of the template. The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited remarkable structural stability, and the content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane. The ordered macroporous structure and the presence of tri-coordinated boron species in the framework were effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH of propane. The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter. The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis, and the specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield. The structural stability of the BPO4(OM) catalyst is evidenced by unchanged macropore sizes and intergrown nanocrystals, as well as an identical XRD pattern before and after the catalytic reaction. The active sites are identified as tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species, which are retained after the reaction, as confirmed by FTIR, NMR, and XPS measurements. The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increases from 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating their role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. This suggests that the pore structure of the support impacts the catalytic performance. The apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3, is also influenced by the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. These findings indicate that the spatial confinement of boron sites and the pore structure of the support play crucial roles in the catalytic activity of B-based materials. The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. This suggests that the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into these structures for different catalytic applications may depend on the specific pore structure and loading of B2O3. The study of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures indicates that the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane can impact the apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3. This implies that the methods used to incorporate B active components into the structures can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity.

Borosilicate zeolites serve as active catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), providing a platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts and the construction of highly active boron centers. The isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP over B-MWW zeolite. In contrast, defect boron sites are crucial for catalyzing the ODHP reaction, with aggregated boron species being more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than isolated species. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center for catalyzing the ODHP reaction at low temperature. A series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction. The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature. Structure characterizations revealed that incomplete crystallization could enrich defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts.

The isolated boron in the zeolite framework without oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere due to the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test. The isolated boron in the zeolite framework is inert for the reaction, but the isolated boron in BS-1 zeolite exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP. The 2D 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species. The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures. The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage. The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction. This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution, giving good durability in the reaction process. The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species, which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity.

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites typically have porous structures and high specific surface areas, which provide numerous sites for active B species and confined space that influences radical reaction behavior. The pore structure also regulates mass transport during reactions. Loading B active components on the surface of 3-D porous structures or doping them into the framework of porous materials is an effective method for constructing 3-D B active sites. For example, h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts have a well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure that enhances mass transport and catalytic performance. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite can anchor boron oxide active sites, leading to high propene selectivity at low temperatures. The 3-D wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts with B2O3 loading achieve excellent olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production. The 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite, with molten boron oxide acting as a homogeneous catalyst, exhibits high stability and olefin selectivity. Doping B species into zeolite frameworks creates a 3-D dispersion of B active sites, resulting in high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate, synthesized using a hard template method, has rich pores and a high surface area, improving molecular diffusion and heat transfer. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam, with a large surface area and numerous mesopores, shows excellent activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites was achieved through hydrothermal methods, with modifications to previous reports. The zeolites have a type-I N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, indicating predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores. The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by FT-IR spectra, showing bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 corresponding to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron. The defective trigonal boron structures (BO3) were identified as the active sites for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene, while the activation of primary CH bonds in ethane required a higher temperature range of 560-590 C for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The bowl-like structures of B-based materials have a large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space, which enhance their potential in catalysis, environmental remediation, and energy storage. The BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure is constructed from numerous oriented bowl-like blocks, forming a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. The size of the openings can be adjusted by varying the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives, which is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The generated h-BN enhances the gas trapping capacity of the liquid B2O3 environment foam, allowing for precise control of the pressure differential between large and small bubbles, which favors the oriented opening of the bowl-like structure. The pure h-BN monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure, prepared at higher temperatures, possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure, which results in excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls, which could potentially enhance catalytic performance by increasing the surface area and pore volume. The effectiveness of different methods for incorporating B active components into structures for various catalytic applications is not discussed. Additionally, boron doping of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) enhances the selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied. For the same reaction temperatures and conversions, B-doped CNFs exhibited higher selectivities to propene than pristine CNFs. The type of B precursor affects the selectivity to propene, and CNFs modified using boric acid as the precursor provided the highest selectivity at isoconversion.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are achieved through a two-step wash-coat method, where SiO2 acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups. The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite allow for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and effective pore diffusion on the catalyst. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst shows good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading, achieving high propylene and olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production under high GHSV, leading to a high propylene space time yield. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it discuss the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that silicon boride, a metal-free material rich in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance properties at high temperatures and can be a potential catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensures catalytic stability. The origin of catalytic activity is attributed to the BOH groups generated from BO species with the assistance of steam. This suggests that the dispersion of boron active sites in a porous framework could enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites for reactions and improving the stability of the catalyst under high-temperature conditions.

The study prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method, which exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1. This is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date. One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure. The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process. There is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contained more defects and edge sites with abundant BOH groups, which facilitated the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction. The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion. The stability of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was superior, which was probably attributed to the SiO2 support anchoring effect. The abundant OH groups of SiO2 support can promote the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN. The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed. The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction.

Boron oxide, as an electron-deficient promoter, inhibits the dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This effect was observed even at a low loading of 0.003wt%, demonstrating that only a small fraction of surface functionalities are catalytically active. The propene selectivity increases significantly, while the overall reaction rate decreases slightly, resulting in an improved production of propene. The maximum productivity of propene is achieved at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%. The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, with only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface covered by an amorphous coating. The good thermal stability of the doped samples indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, acting as a backbone against oxidation.

The embryonic borosilicate zeolite, with its abundant defective sites and large porosity, is designed for catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. Solid-state NMR reveals that the boron sites in open coordination, derived from the defect-rich structure of the zeolite, ensure ample exposure of the active center. The enhanced contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, leading to an increase in the reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30. This indicates that the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites and improving mass transfer. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as the preparation of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for the ODH of propane.

The electrospinning synthesis method ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework, which is beneficial for catalytic performance. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high WHSV in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, the porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts show higher olefin selectivity and stability. The electrospinning method is effective for incorporating boron active components into the porous framework, which is advantageous for catalytic applications such as the ODH of ethane and propane. The synthesized porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSNs) have a diameter of 100-150 nm and are produced by electrospinning. The electrospinning process ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts exhibit higher olefin selectivity and stability. The presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts may cause low propylene selectivity during the ODH of propane. The PBSN catalysts are obtained by electrospinning followed by calcination in air. The TEM image of PBSN-3 shows a porous structure with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements. The XRD patterns of the PBSN catalysts indicate the amorphous nature of SiO2 and the high dispersion of B2O3 species in the fiber structure. The B2O3/gel catalyst allows the aggregation of B2O3, as indicated by the XRD pattern. The PBSN-3 catalyst shows higher propylene selectivity than B2O3/gel. The PBSN catalyst is inactive for ethane dehydrogenation alone, but ethylene is formed immediately when a mixture of oxygen and ethane is pulsed into the chamber. The reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5 in both the ODH of ethane and propane, suggesting that molecular oxygen may dissociate on the surface of the catalyst.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, increasing the number of active sites, and improving the diffusion of reactants and products. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and effective way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The phenomenon of tertiary aggregation observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4 contributes to the formation of a stable and active catalyst. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, which is a key factor in the excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability of B2O3@BPO4 at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The melting point of B2O3 and the change in viscosity of its melting phase with temperature make it a suitable candidate for high-temperature catalytic applications. The use of hollow micro-/nanostructured materials as supports for traditional supported catalysts can increase the number of active sites and improve the loading capacity of the catalyst. However, the preparation process can be tedious, involving the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites. The one-step template-free method used to synthesize B2O3@BPO4 hollow sphere structures is a simple approach that makes the best use of both sides of hollow spheres. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The B2O3@BPO4 composite demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into porous frameworks with 3-D dispersed active sites, enhancing catalytic performance for different catalytic applications. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and efficient way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability at high temperatures. The formation process involves not only conventional particle aggregations and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation, which contributes to the formation of the unique sandwich-like structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibits excellent activity and selectivity, with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. This method of incorporating B active components into the structure is effective for high-temperature catalytic applications, especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The unique structure of the B2O3@BPO4 composite, consisting of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires, enhances catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for active sites and efficient mass transfer. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at high temperatures (>450 C), demonstrating excellent productivity and stability. The synthesis process involves primary and secondary particle aggregations, Ostwald ripening, and an additional tertiary aggregation, leading to the formation of the sandwich-like hollow sphere structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite outperforms many metal-based catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability, making it a promising metal-free catalyst for high-temperature applications. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which allowed for the formation of a unique tertiary aggregation phenomenon. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, enhancing the catalytic activity and long-time stability of the material at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. B2O3, with its melting point of 450 C and changing viscosity at high temperatures, is a key component in hydrocarbon conversions. However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperatures poses a challenge for B2O3-containing catalysts. Interestingly, the low volatility and high melting point of B2O3 make it suitable for use as a high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalyst (SPLC) when supported by a suitable material. Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports for traditional supported catalysts to gain more active sites. Sandwich-like structures are commonly used to maximize the utilization of planar supports. The B2O3@BPO4 composite, with its sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method, demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperatures, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. The reaction follows Eley-Rideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane.

Boron-containing materials have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins. The surface of these catalysts oxidizes and hydrolyzes under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) layer. The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption. The boron loading was quantified by ICP-MS to be 1.10.1wt.%. The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are not active for propane ODH. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the boron species in B-MWW. The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites. The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species matches the results, verifying that B-MWW contains primarily framework species. The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.

Boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), boron carbide, boron oxide, and boron phosphate, have been developed for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. These materials have unique structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance. For example, h-BN can be synthesized through various methods, including mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, which can increase the surface area and expose more active sites. The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst can improve heat and mass transfer, which is crucial for industrialization. Boron carbide has a rhombohedral phase and can be synthesized by various methods, including magnesiothermic reduction, carbothermic reduction, vapor phase reactions, synthesis from elements, and synthesis from polymer precursors. Boron oxide has a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles and can be supported on high specific area mesoporous silica to improve catalytic performance. Boron phosphate has a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra and can be developed into a three-dimensional ordered macroporous material with a robust framework to improve activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as impregnation, chemical vapor deposition, and synthesis from polymer precursors, have been shown to be effective for different catalytic applications.

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has gained significant attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene due to its high olefin selectivity compared to metal oxides. N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C. Spectroscopy revealed that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion. The different catalytic activity attributed to plasma treatment prompted further investigation into the structure of the catalysts. N2 plasma was found to induce more defects in BN, and the peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted relative to BN, with an obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum. These changes were attributed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, indicating that N2 plasma could create more N-defects. The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN was similar, and O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content to N2-BN-spent. These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion under the same reaction conditions. The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sintering of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite having higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN. The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased compared to the parent BN. Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from BN to H2-BN and Ar-BN, the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area.

The ordered macroporous structure of boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by improving mass transport and increasing the accessibility of active sites. The synthesis of ordered macroporous boron phosphate (BPO4) was achieved through hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, using boric acid and phosphoric acid as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as the hard template. The ordered macroporous structure, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores, was an inverse replica of the template. The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited remarkable structural stability, and the content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane. The ordered macroporous structure and the presence of tri-coordinated boron species in the framework were effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH of propane. The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter. The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis, and the specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield. The structural stability of the BPO4(OM) catalyst is evidenced by unchanged macropore sizes and intergrown nanocrystals, as well as an identical XRD pattern before and after the catalytic reaction. The active sites are identified as tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species, which are retained after the reaction, as confirmed by FTIR, NMR, and XPS measurements. The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increases from 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating their role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. This suggests that the pore structure of the support impacts the catalytic performance. The apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3, is also influenced by the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. These findings indicate that the spatial confinement of boron sites and the pore structure of the support play crucial roles in the catalytic activity of B-based materials. The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. This suggests that the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into these structures for different catalytic applications may depend on the specific pore structure and loading of B2O3. The study of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures indicates that the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane can impact the apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3. This implies that the methods used to incorporate B active components into the structures can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity.

Borosilicate zeolites serve as active catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), providing a platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts and the construction of highly active boron centers. The isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP over B-MWW zeolite. In contrast, defect boron sites are crucial for catalyzing the ODHP reaction, with aggregated boron species being more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than isolated species. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center for catalyzing the ODHP reaction at low temperature. A series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction. The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature. Structure characterizations revealed that incomplete crystallization could enrich defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts.

The isolated boron in the zeolite framework without oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere due to the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test. The isolated boron in the zeolite framework is inert for the reaction, but the isolated boron in BS-1 zeolite exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP. The 2D 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species. The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures. The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage. The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction. This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution, giving good durability in the reaction process. The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species, which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity.

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites typically have porous structures and high specific surface areas, which provide numerous sites for active B species and confined space that influences radical reaction behavior. The pore structure also regulates mass transport during reactions. Loading B active components on the surface of 3-D porous structures or doping them into the framework of porous materials is an effective method for constructing 3-D B active sites. For example, h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts have a well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure that enhances mass transport and catalytic performance. The 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite can anchor boron oxide active sites, leading to high propene selectivity at low temperatures. The 3-D wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts with B2O3 loading achieve excellent olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production. The 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite, with molten boron oxide acting as a homogeneous catalyst, exhibits high stability and olefin selectivity. Doping B species into zeolite frameworks creates a 3-D dispersion of B active sites, resulting in high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate, synthesized using a hard template method, has rich pores and a high surface area, improving molecular diffusion and heat transfer. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam, with a large surface area and numerous mesopores, shows excellent activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites was achieved through hydrothermal methods, with modifications to previous reports. The zeolites have a type-I N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, indicating predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores. The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by FT-IR spectra, showing bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 corresponding to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron. The defective trigonal boron structures (BO3) were identified as the active sites for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene, while the activation of primary CH bonds in ethane required a higher temperature range of 560-590 C for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The bowl-like structures of B-based materials have a large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space, which enhance their potential in catalysis, environmental remediation, and energy storage. The BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure is constructed from numerous oriented bowl-like blocks, forming a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. The size of the openings can be adjusted by varying the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives, which is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The generated h-BN enhances the gas trapping capacity of the liquid B2O3 environment foam, allowing for precise control of the pressure differential between large and small bubbles, which favors the oriented opening of the bowl-like structure. The pure h-BN monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure, prepared at higher temperatures, possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure, which results in excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls, which could potentially enhance catalytic performance by increasing the surface area and pore volume. The effectiveness of different methods for incorporating B active components into structures for various catalytic applications is not discussed. Additionally, boron doping of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) enhances the selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied. For the same reaction temperatures and conversions, B-doped CNFs exhibited higher selectivities to propene than pristine CNFs. The type of B precursor affects the selectivity to propene, and CNFs modified using boric acid as the precursor provided the highest selectivity at isoconversion.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are achieved through a two-step wash-coat method, where SiO2 acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups. The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite allow for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and effective pore diffusion on the catalyst. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst shows good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading, achieving high propylene and olefin selectivity and negligible CO2 production under high GHSV, leading to a high propylene space time yield. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it discuss the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that silicon boride, a metal-free material rich in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance properties at high temperatures and can be a potential catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensures catalytic stability. The origin of catalytic activity is attributed to the BOH groups generated from BO species with the assistance of steam. This suggests that the dispersion of boron active sites in a porous framework could enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites for reactions and improving the stability of the catalyst under high-temperature conditions.

The study prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method, which exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1. This is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date. One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure. The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process. There is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contained more defects and edge sites with abundant BOH groups, which facilitated the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction. The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion. The stability of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was superior, which was probably attributed to the SiO2 support anchoring effect. The abundant OH groups of SiO2 support can promote the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN. The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed. The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction.

Boron oxide, as an electron-deficient promoter, inhibits the dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This effect was observed even at a low loading of 0.003wt%, demonstrating that only a small fraction of surface functionalities are catalytically active. The propene selectivity increases significantly, while the overall reaction rate decreases slightly, resulting in an improved production of propene. The maximum productivity of propene is achieved at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%. The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, with only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface covered by an amorphous coating. The good thermal stability of the doped samples indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, acting as a backbone against oxidation.

The embryonic borosilicate zeolite, with its abundant defective sites and large porosity, is designed for catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. Solid-state NMR reveals that the boron sites in open coordination, derived from the defect-rich structure of the zeolite, ensure ample exposure of the active center. The enhanced contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, leading to an increase in the reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30. This indicates that the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites and improving mass transfer. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as the preparation of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly for the ODH of propane.

The electrospinning synthesis method ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework, which is beneficial for catalytic performance. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high WHSV in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, the porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts show higher olefin selectivity and stability. The electrospinning method is effective for incorporating boron active components into the porous framework, which is advantageous for catalytic applications such as the ODH of ethane and propane. The synthesized porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSNs) have a diameter of 100-150 nm and are produced by electrospinning. The electrospinning process ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and guarantee high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts exhibit higher olefin selectivity and stability. The presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts may cause low propylene selectivity during the ODH of propane. The PBSN catalysts are obtained by electrospinning followed by calcination in air. The TEM image of PBSN-3 shows a porous structure with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements. The XRD patterns of the PBSN catalysts indicate the amorphous nature of SiO2 and the high dispersion of B2O3 species in the fiber structure. The B2O3/gel catalyst allows the aggregation of B2O3, as indicated by the XRD pattern. The PBSN-3 catalyst shows higher propylene selectivity than B2O3/gel. The PBSN catalyst is inactive for ethane dehydrogenation alone, but ethylene is formed immediately when a mixture of oxygen and ethane is pulsed into the chamber. The reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5 in both the ODH of ethane and propane, suggesting that molecular oxygen may dissociate on the surface of the catalyst.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, increasing the number of active sites, and improving the diffusion of reactants and products. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and effective way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The phenomenon of tertiary aggregation observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4 contributes to the formation of a stable and active catalyst. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, which is a key factor in the excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability of B2O3@BPO4 at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The melting point of B2O3 and the change in viscosity of its melting phase with temperature make it a suitable candidate for high-temperature catalytic applications. The use of hollow micro-/nanostructured materials as supports for traditional supported catalysts can increase the number of active sites and improve the loading capacity of the catalyst. However, the preparation process can be tedious, involving the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites. The one-step template-free method used to synthesize B2O3@BPO4 hollow sphere structures is a simple approach that makes the best use of both sides of hollow spheres. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The B2O3@BPO4 composite demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into porous frameworks with 3-D dispersed active sites, enhancing catalytic performance for different catalytic applications. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and efficient way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability at high temperatures. The formation process involves not only conventional particle aggregations and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation, which contributes to the formation of the unique sandwich-like structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibits excellent activity and selectivity, with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. This method of incorporating B active components into the structure is effective for high-temperature catalytic applications, especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The unique structure of the B2O3@BPO4 composite, consisting of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires, enhances catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for active sites and efficient mass transfer. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at high temperatures (>450 C), demonstrating excellent productivity and stability. The synthesis process involves primary and secondary particle aggregations, Ostwald ripening, and an additional tertiary aggregation, leading to the formation of the sandwich-like hollow sphere structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite outperforms many metal-based catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability, making it a promising metal-free catalyst for high-temperature applications. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which allowed for the formation of a unique tertiary aggregation phenomenon. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, enhancing the catalytic activity and long-time stability of the material at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. B2O3, with its melting point of 450 C and changing viscosity at high temperatures, is a key component in hydrocarbon conversions. However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperatures poses a challenge for B2O3-containing catalysts. Interestingly, the low volatility and high melting point of B2O3 make it suitable for use as a high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalyst (SPLC) when supported by a suitable material. Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports for traditional supported catalysts to gain more active sites. Sandwich-like structures are commonly used to maximize the utilization of planar supports. The B2O3@BPO4 composite, with its sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method, demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperatures, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. The reaction follows Eley-Rideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane.

Boron-containing materials have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins. The surface of these catalysts oxidizes and hydrolyzes under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) layer. The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption. The boron loading was quantified by ICP-MS to be 1.10.1wt.%. The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are not active for propane ODH. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the boron species in B-MWW. The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites. The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species matches the results, verifying that B-MWW contains primarily framework species. The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.

Boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), boron carbide, boron oxide, and boron phosphate, have been developed for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. These materials have unique structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance. For example, h-BN can be synthesized through various methods, including mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, which can increase the surface area and expose more active sites. The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst can improve heat and mass transfer, which is crucial for industrialization. Boron carbide has a rhombohedral phase and can be synthesized by various methods, including magnesiothermic reduction, carbothermic reduction, vapor phase reactions, synthesis from elements, and synthesis from polymer precursors. Boron oxide has a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles and can be supported on high specific area mesoporous silica to improve catalytic performance. Boron phosphate has a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra and can be developed into a three-dimensional ordered macroporous material with a robust framework to improve activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as impregnation, chemical vapor deposition, and synthesis from polymer precursors, have been shown to be effective for different catalytic applications.

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has gained significant attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene due to its high olefin selectivity compared to metal oxides. N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C. Spectroscopy revealed that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion. The different catalytic activity attributed to plasma treatment prompted further investigation into the structure of the catalysts. N2 plasma was found to induce more defects in BN, and the peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted relative to BN, with an obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum. These changes were attributed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, indicating that N2 plasma could create more N-defects. The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN was similar, and O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content to N2-BN-spent. These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion under the same reaction conditions. The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sintering of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite having higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN. The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased compared to the parent BN. Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from BN to H2-BN and Ar-BN, the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area.

The ordered macroporous structure of boron-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by improving mass transport and increasing the accessibility of active sites. The synthesis of ordered macroporous boron phosphate (BPO4) was achieved through hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, using boric acid and phosphoric acid as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as the hard template. The ordered macroporous structure, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores, was an inverse replica of the template. The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited remarkable structural stability, and the content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane. The ordered macroporous structure and the presence of tri-coordinated boron species in the framework were effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH of propane. The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter. The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis, and the specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield. The structural stability of the BPO4(OM) catalyst is evidenced by unchanged macropore sizes and intergrown nanocrystals, as well as an identical XRD pattern before and after the catalytic reaction. The active sites are identified as tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species, which are retained after the reaction, as confirmed by FTIR, NMR, and XPS measurements. The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increases from 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating their role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. This suggests that the pore structure of the support impacts the catalytic performance. The apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3, is also influenced by the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. These findings indicate that the spatial confinement of boron sites and the pore structure of the support play crucial roles in the catalytic activity of B-based materials. The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. This suggests that the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into these structures for different catalytic applications may depend on the specific pore structure and loading of B2O3. The study of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures indicates that the pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane can impact the apparent propane reaction order, which varies from 1 to 3. This implies that the methods used to incorporate B active components into the structures can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity.
