The surface of these catalysts oxidizes and hydrolyzes under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) layer. The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption. The boron loading was quantified by ICP-MS to be 1.10.1wt.%. The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are not active for propane ODH. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the boron species in B-MWW. The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites.

Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site.

The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis, and the specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield. The structural stability of the BPO4(OM) catalyst is evidenced by unchanged macropore sizes and intergrown nanocrystals, as well as an identical XRD pattern before and after the catalytic reaction. The active sites are identified as tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species, which are retained after the reaction, as confirmed by FTIR, NMR, and XPS measurements.

One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure. The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process. There is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contained more defects and edge sites with abundant BOH groups, which facilitated the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction. The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion.

The abundant OH groups of SiO2 support can promote the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN.

Interestingly, the low volatility and high melting point of B2O3 make it suitable for use as a high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalyst (SPLC) when supported by a suitable material. Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports for traditional supported catalysts to gain more active sites. Sandwich-like structures are commonly used to maximize the utilization of planar supports. The B2O3@BPO4 composite, with its sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method, demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperatures, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts.

The surface of these catalysts oxidizes and hydrolyzes under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) layer. The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption. The boron loading was quantified by ICP-MS to be 1.10.1wt.%. The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are not active for propane ODH. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the boron species in B-MWW. The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites.

Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site.

The ordered macroporous structure and the presence of tri-coordinated boron species in the framework were effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH of propane. The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter. The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis, and the specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield.

The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at high temperatures (>450 C), demonstrating excellent productivity and stability. The synthesis process involves primary and secondary particle aggregations, Ostwald ripening, and an additional tertiary aggregation, leading to the formation of the sandwich-like hollow sphere structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite outperforms many metal-based catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability, making it a promising metal-free catalyst for high-temperature applications. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which allowed for the formation of a unique tertiary aggregation phenomenon. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, enhancing the catalytic activity and long-time stability of the material at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. B2O3, with its melting point of 450 C and changing viscosity at high temperatures, is a key component in hydrocarbon conversions. However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperatures poses a challenge for B2O3-containing catalysts. Interestingly, the low volatility and high melting point of B2O3 make it suitable for use as a high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalyst (SPLC) when supported by a suitable material. Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports for traditional supported catalysts to gain more active sites. Sandwich-like structures are commonly used to maximize the utilization of planar supports. The B2O3@BPO4 composite, with its sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method, demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperatures, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts.

The surface of these catalysts oxidizes and hydrolyzes under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) layer. The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption. The boron loading was quantified by ICP-MS to be 1.10.1wt.%. The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are not active for propane ODH. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the boron species in B-MWW. The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites. The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species matches the results, verifying that B-MWW contains primarily framework species. The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site.

The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption.

Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts exhibit higher olefin selectivity and stability. The presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts may cause low propylene selectivity during the ODH of propane. The PBSN catalysts are obtained by electrospinning followed by calcination in air. The TEM image of PBSN-3 shows a porous structure with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements. The XRD patterns of the PBSN catalysts indicate the amorphous nature of SiO2 and the high dispersion of B2O3 species in the fiber structure. The B2O3/gel catalyst allows the aggregation of B2O3, as indicated by the XRD pattern. The PBSN-3 catalyst shows higher propylene selectivity than B2O3/gel. The PBSN catalyst is inactive for ethane dehydrogenation alone, but ethylene is formed immediately when a mixture of oxygen and ethane is pulsed into the chamber.

The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts.

The surface of these catalysts oxidizes and hydrolyzes under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) layer. The majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption. The boron loading was quantified by ICP-MS to be 1.10.1wt.%. The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are not active for propane ODH. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the boron species in B-MWW. The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites.

Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms.

The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites. The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species matches the results, verifying that B-MWW contains primarily framework species. The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.", "Chinese": "含硼材料已被识别为烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)到烯烃的高选择性催化剂。这些催化剂的表面在反应条件下氧化和水解，形成B2(OH)xO(3x/2)的无定形层。B-MWW中的大多数硼物种以孤立的BO3单元的形式存在，完全被整合到沸石框架中。然而，这种材料对丙烷到丙烯的ODH没有催化活性。B-MWW对丙烷ODH的催化不活性否定了孤立BO3位点是基于硼的催化剂的活性位点的假设。硼位点在反应条件下的动态性质排除了对活性位点的精确实验识别。为了理解活性位点形成的要求，有必要合成具有更受控、更均匀的硼氧化物特性的材料。B-MWW是根据既定的程序合成的，成功的合成通过粉末X射线衍射和N2物理吸附得到确认。硼的负载量通过ICP-MS量化为1.10.1wt.%。催化不活性表明沸石框架中的硼物种对丙烷ODH没有活性。使用固态NMR光谱表征B-MWW中的硼物种。11B各向同性化学位移、电场梯度不对称参数和四极耦合常数的值是三配位硼物种的特征。δiso(11B)=15ppm的峰被分配给B(OSi)2(OH)物种。这些发现与以前对硼掺杂沸石的研究一致。B(OSi)3和B(OSi)2(OH)物种的δiso(11B)与结果相匹配，验证了B-MWW主要包含框架物种。通过对B-MWW的多维1H和11B SSNMR光谱的详细表征，发现硼主要以孤立的B(OSi)3单元的形式存在，这些单元邻近硅醇基团。尽管B-MWW的硼含量足以催化活性，但测试确定它在背景水平上没有表现出丙烷的ODH转化。催化活性的B/B-MWW、B/SiO2和硼化氮ODH催化剂含有在反应条件下重组的聚集硼位点，而B-MWW在反应条件下是稳定的，硼原子没有重组。B-MWW和其他含硼材料中硼位点的差异使我们得出了一个重要的结论，即硼催化的丙烷ODH不会在孤立的BO3位点上进行。相反，活性的基于硼的ODH催化剂可能需要具有一定程度的B-O-B连接性的硼物种。", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.201914696"},
