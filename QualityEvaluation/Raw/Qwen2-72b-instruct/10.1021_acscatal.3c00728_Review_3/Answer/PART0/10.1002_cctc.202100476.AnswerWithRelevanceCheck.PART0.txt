          [1] "In this study, we prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method. The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be tuned in the range of 150300nm through h-BN loading change."
          [2] "The obtained nanofibrous catalysts exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date."
          [3] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."
          [4] "The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process."
          [5] "There is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."
          [6] "The exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contained more defects and edge sites with abundant BOH groups, which facilitated the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution."
          [7] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction."
          [8] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."
          [9] "The stability of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was superior, which was probably attributed to the SiO2 support anchoring effect."
          [10] "The abundant OH groups of SiO2 support can promote the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN."
          [11] "The one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."
          [12] "The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion."
          [13] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction."

          本研究通过电纺丝方法制备了一维六方氮化硼/二氧化硅(h-BN/SiO2)纳米纤维催化剂，该催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出12.4%的丙烷转化率和85.1%的丙烯选择性，具有显著的24.9golefinsgBN1h1烯烃生产力，比迄今为止报道的块体ODHP催化剂高出5倍以上。一维纳米材料因其有利于物质传输和潜在的高活性位点暴露，在催化应用中引起了广泛关注。通过电纺丝方法制备的纳米纤维的化学和物理性质可以通过改变电纺丝过程中的条件轻松调整。在通过电纺丝方法制备的纳米催化剂中，纳米颗粒和载体之间有良好的相互作用，进一步确保了它们的活性、选择性和长期稳定性。通过球磨制备的剥离h-BN含有更多的缺陷和边缘位点，具有丰富的BOH基团，这有利于h-BN在水溶液中的分散。h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在ODHP反应中明显表现出比块体h-BN催化剂更高的丙烷转化率。h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂的较高活性主要是因为一维结构促进了活性位点的暴露，参与催化并实现了更高的转化率。h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂的稳定性优越，可能归因于SiO2支撑体的锚定效应。SiO2支撑体上的大量OH基团促进了h-BN的锚定和分散性。具有良好分散的h-BN的一维h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在高空间速度条件下表现出更好的催化效率，可能是因为它增强了质量传递，使活性位点容易暴露。h-BN负载量对C3H8转化率有明显影响，随着h-BN负载量的增加，丙烷转化率线性增加，这证明转化率不受分子扩散的限制。h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在500C和48000mlgcat1h1的空间速度下表现出24.9golefinsgBN1h1的生产力。这个值明显高于块体h-BN催化剂和大多数在ODHP反应中使用的硼基催化剂。
