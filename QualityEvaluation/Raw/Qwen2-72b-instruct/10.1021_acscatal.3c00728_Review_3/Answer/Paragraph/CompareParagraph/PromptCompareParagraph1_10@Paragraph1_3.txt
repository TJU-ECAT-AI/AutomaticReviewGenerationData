Boron-based materials, particularly those featuring three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites within porous frameworks, have garnered significant attention in the field of catalysis due to their unique structural characteristics and catalytic advantages. These materials offer a high surface area and tunable pore sizes, which facilitate the efficient diffusion of reactants and products. The 3-D dispersion of active sites ensures a high density of catalytic centers, maximizing the material's catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the incorporation of boron into the framework introduces additional electronic effects that can modulate the reactivity of the active sites, enhancing the selectivity and activity of the catalyst. Various methods have been developed for the incorporation of boron into porous materials, including co-condensation, post-synthetic modification, and templating strategies, each offering distinct advantages in terms of control over the structure and functionality of the final material. These B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites have shown promise in a range of catalytic applications, from petrochemical processing to the conversion of biomass and the production of fine chemicals, demonstrating their potential to revolutionize industrial catalysis.

The catalytic performance of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for propane dehydrogenation is significantly enhanced by structural characteristics that provide numerous sites for B species and regulate radical reaction behavior \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_3\]. These materials, featuring high specific surface areas and porous structures, offer improved mass transport and molecular diffusion, crucial for catalytic applications. Incorporation methods, such as the two-step wash-coat technique \[10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040\], effectively integrate B components into these structures, enhancing catalytic performance for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP). The effectiveness of these methods is influenced by the specific pore structure and B2O3 loading, affecting the apparent propane reaction order and catalytic activity \[10.1016/j.cattod.2023.114048\].

                    Defect boron sites, especially those hydrogen-bonded to silanols, are key for low-temperature ODHP \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\]. Aggregated boron species, not isolated B(OSi)3 units, prove to be active for propane oxidative dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\]. Isolated boron in zeolite frameworks, without oligomers, shows high activity and selectivity for ODHP, with BOSiOx linkages preventing hydrolysis and leaching, ensuring durability \[10.1126/science.abe7935\]. Spectroscopic evidence confirms the presence of isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination, crucial for catalysis \[10.1126/science.abe7935\].

                    Layered borosilicate zeolites, synthesized hydrothermally, exhibit predominantly microporous structures with minor mesopores, confirmed by type-I N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021\]. Defective trigonal boron structures (BO3) act as active sites for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021\]. Embryonic borosilicate zeolites, with their defective sites and large porosity, effectively catalyze propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.11.031\]. Solid-state NMR confirms the presence of open-coordinate boron sites, ensuring ample active center exposure \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.11.031\].

                    B-based materials with bowl-like structures offer large surface areas and porous frameworks, enhancing catalytic performance and environmental remediation potential \[10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.156743\]. Boron doping of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) boosts selectivity to propene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation, influenced by boron loading, calcination temperature, and the type of B precursor \[10.1002/cssc.201402363\]. Using boric acid as the precursor maximizes selectivity at isoconversion \[10.1002/cssc.201402363\]. Silicon boride, a boron-rich material, exhibits high-temperature oxidation resistance, making it a promising catalyst for light alkanes' oxidative dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.014\]. Its antioxidant ability ensures catalytic stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.014\].

                    h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts, prepared by electrospinning, exhibit superior catalytic performance in propane conversion to propylene, achieving 12.4% conversion and 85.1% selectivity, with olefins productivity 5 times higher than bulk ODHP catalysts \[10.1002/cctc.202100476\]. The one-dimensional structure facilitates active site exposure, enhancing catalytic efficiency \[10.1002/cctc.202100476\]. Boron oxide, as an electron-deficient promoter, sustains selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface by inhibiting O2 adsorption, even at a low 0.003wt% loading \[10.1002/anie.200901826\]. Maximum propene productivity is achieved at 0.01wt% B2O3 \[10.1002/anie.200901826\].

                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in B-based materials for propane dehydrogenation catalysis, grounded in the structural characteristics and catalytic advantages of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, open avenues for exploring innovative methodologies and emerging fields. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel synthesis techniques that enhance the dispersion and stability of B species within porous structures, aiming to further improve catalytic activity and selectivity. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts like B2O3, with its low cost and eco-friendly properties, is a promising trend for high-temperature applications. The synthesis of materials with controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary to understand active site formation and optimize catalytic performance. The investigation of the dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions and the identification of the active site(s) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation remain critical challenges. The development of advanced characterization techniques to monitor these dynamic changes in real-time could provide valuable insights. Moreover, the exploration of B-based materials in other catalytic applications, such as environmental remediation and energy storage, could broaden their impact and utility.
