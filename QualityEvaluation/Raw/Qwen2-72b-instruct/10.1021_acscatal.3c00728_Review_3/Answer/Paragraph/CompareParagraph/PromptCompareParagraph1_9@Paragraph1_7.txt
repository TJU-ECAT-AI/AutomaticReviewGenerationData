2.3. B Active Sites Located in or Bonded to the 3-D Framework of Porous Materials
The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites.
2.3.1. 3-D Supported BN Active Sites
To meet the heat and mass transfer requirements of industrial applications, the 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability. (97) An h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst with a well-developed 3-D straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer was prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using boric acid and urea as precursors. (61) The SEM results (Figure 5a) showed that the catalytic film of the h-BN/cordierite catalyst with 4.2% h-BN loading was attached to the monolith wall with a thickness of ∼3 μm, enhancing the utilization of h-BN by forming a thin layer. The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a ∼16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 °C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576 000 mL gBN&ndash;1 h&ndash;1 (Figure 5). According to the evaluation and characterization results, the h-BN/cordierite catalyst with 3-D supported BN active species achieved high C3H8 throughput owing to the excellent mass transfer process and highly efficient utilization of the active phase.

2.3.2. 3-D Supported BOx Active Sites
When preparing a supported BOx catalyst on a 2-D carrier, because of the volatility and rapid loss of the B precursor, the maximum B loading on SiO2 is ∼2%, which restricts the improvement of the propene yield. Recently, Lu’s group (63) reported a novel approach to load boron oxide with a high loading of up to 30%, with the assistance of the 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites (Figure 5b). The significant breakthrough of this catalyst system lies in the remarkable ODHP performance at a low temperature with high propene selectivity. Typically, when the B2O3 loading was 10%, a propane conversion of 14.8% could be achieved with a selectivity of 73.3% toward propene or 87.4% for both propene and ethene (C2&ndash;3=) at the reaction temperature of 450 °C. In particular, as the reaction temperature decreased to 405 °C, a much lower operating temperature than that required for the BN catalysts, a propane conversion of 2.8% was obtained for the 10% B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst with a propene selectivity of 84.1% (C2&ndash;3=, 94.6%). The boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes.
Although the aforementioned B2O3-supported catalysts on commercial SiO2 or SBA-15 support show excellent catalytic performance with high activity and olefin selectivity as well as industrialization potential, problems such as a high-pressure drop of the catalyst packing and poor mass transfer in the catalyst pellets may limit their large-scale application. Therefore, 3-D wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts with B2O3 loading on 3-D cordierite have been designed to deal with this issue (64) (Figure 5b). However, owing to the loss of surface hydroxyls under high temperature calcination (∼1400 °C) during the cordierite production process, the interaction between bare cordierite and B was insufficient to immobilize the B species. Therefore, the cordierite support was modified by an additional silica coating layer that could attach firmly to the cordierite substrate possibly by forming Si&ndash;O&ndash;Al, Si&ndash;O&ndash;Mg, and Si&ndash;O&ndash;Si bonds and attach to the boron oxide layer via Si&ndash;O&ndash;B bonds. Finally, the 3-D B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramic (B2O3/SiO2@HC-p) catalysts were obtained. (88) With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized. Moreover, the catalyst achieved excellent olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under a high gas hourly space velocity of 345 600 mL·gB2O3&ndash;1·h&ndash;1.
To explore the effect of the porous support, the catalytic performances of B2O3/SiO2@HC and the B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst (63) with the same B2O3 loading were compared under the same conditions. The results showed that the propene selectivity of B2O3/SiO2@HC was higher than that of the B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst under the same C3H8 conversion, indicating that the structure and physicochemical properties of the 3-D support exert considerable impact on the product distribution of the resultant catalysts. The high selectivity of propene might be attributed to the uniform flow distribution facilitating the utilization of the active component, and the catalytic layer wash-coated on the 3-D monolithic wall, which shortened the diffusion paths to alleviate the overoxidation. Notably, both of these catalysts were considerably more selective to propene than traditional B2O3/SiO2 (51) owing to the higher density of B-containing active sites. The higher coverage of B species also prevented the undesirable side reactions that occurred on the bare SiO2 support.
In the past few decades, supported liquid-phase catalysts (SLPCs), featuring a liquid-phase catalyst film or droplet adsorbed onto the surface of a 3-D porous support, have been developed to integrate the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. (98,99) Aiming at enhancing the catalytic stability of supported B2O3 in the range of 450&ndash;550 °C, the high-temperature SPLC strategy was also applied to prepare a B-based catalyst for an ODHP reaction. The molten boron oxide acts as a homogeneous catalyst and suitable 3-D framework supports were chosen to “heterogenize” the homogeneous catalysts. Huang and co-workers prepared a B2O3@BPO4 composite as a supported liquid-phase catalyst for the ODHP reaction with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure using a one-step template-free method (65) (Figure 5b). Boron oxide (B2O3) and diammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH4)2HPO4) were used as precursors to prepare the SLPCs. Under a high temperature above the melting point of B2O3, the 3-D BPO4 hollow sphere was formed after the attachment, self-assembling, and Ostwald ripening process. (100) During the cooling process, liquid B2O3 cooled and solidified into nanowires covering both the inside and outside of the 3-D BPO4 hollow sphere, forming sandwich-type B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres. The metal-free 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibited a propane conversion of 24.7% and 84.8% selectivity for total olefin (ethene and propene) with the productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat&ndash;1 h&ndash;1 and high stability at 550 °C, which is better than several metal-based oxidative dehydrogen catalysts. (2,101,102)
2.3.3. Bulk B-Based Catalysts with 3-D Dispersed Active Site Doped in the Framework of Porous Materials
Zeolites, a family of porous materials with a high specific surface area and uniform and tunable pore structure, are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis. By doping B species into zeolite frameworks, a 3-D dispersion of the B active site can be achieved. Although the MWW borosilicate zeolite comprising intergrown flaky crystals and isolated B species were reported (58) to be inert for ODHP reactions, a new type of 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite with surface defect tricoordination B species was synthesized via the hydrothermal method using boric acid and silica sol as the B precursor and silica precursor, respectively. (59) The SEM, XRD, and FTIR results revealed that the MWW borosilicate zeolite was well formed with 3-D flaky crystals of 100 nm thickness and the heteroatom B inserted into zeolite frameworks. In ODHP, the 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite exhibited excellent catalytic performance. For example, when the B content was 4.8%, BZEO-3 could achieve a propane conversion of 30.6% with a propene selectivity >80% (Figure 5c). Moreover, after a long time on stream, the selectivity of MWW borosilicate zeolite could be maintained at a high level, but the activity decreased to some extent. This is because of the decrease of crystallinity of zeolite, as the content of B could be kept constant before and after the reaction. This also proved from another angle of view that the 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport. Based on the radical-based mechanism of the gas-phase chemistry reported in the previous literature, (103) the surface radical formation and termination may be influenced by the microscopic environment in which the reactant molecules are located. Figure 5c shows that the activity was significantly increased with the increasing reaction temperature, just like the other catalysts used for ODHP. The enhancement of propane conversion would lead to a decrease in selectivity. As the reaction temperature increased from 500 to 530 °C, the conversion of propane increased by nearly 30%, while the propene selectivity decreased by only about 10%, and the total olefin selectivity decreased slightly. Thus, the 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite is a promising B-containing catalyst for ODHP with surface defect tricoordination B species as active sites.
Wang and co-workers (60) reported a B-silicate MFI zeolite (BS-1) prepared via a solvent-free method. The resulting zeolite exhibited high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Unlike the agglomerated oxidized B species in BN and B/support, the active B species in the 3-D structure of the BS-1 catalyst were isolated B with a −B[OH···O(H)&ndash;Si]2 structure. Under the reaction temperatures of 540 and 560 °C, the propane conversions could reach 23.8% and 41.4%, respectively. In addition, when the conversion of propane was 5.4%, the selectivity of total olefins including ethene (25.7%) and propylene (60.9%) reached 86.6%, exhibiting a low selectivity for overoxidation products (<0.5%) (Figure 5c). For the 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite reported by Lu’s group, (59) a considerable loss of activity occurred after the washing treatment because of the decrease in the defective trigonal B species. By contrast, the BS-1 catalyst could maintain the catalytic activity after water treatment. The ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images verified that the 3-D zeolite structure was maintained and that B leaching was nearly negligible after the reaction. Even after a reaction for 210 h, the olefin selectivity remained approximately constant, because the 3-D zeolite framework hindered the hydrolysis and/or dissolution of B species by water under a humid environment during the ODHP process. To obtain an improved low-temperature ODHP performance of B-containing MFI-type zeolite, Qiu et al. (69) regulated the crystallinity of the zeolite by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions and prepared an incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalyst. The resulting zeolite exhibited extraordinary performance in ODHP with an olefin productivity of 4.75 golefin gcat&ndash;1 h&ndash;1 at a low reaction temperature (445 °C) and a high weight&ndash;hour&ndash;space&ndash;velocity (37.6 gC3H8 gcat&ndash;1 h&ndash;1). During the reaction, the isolated B dynamically transformed into an aggregated B species, in which the B&ndash;OH groups that hydrogen bonded with the adjacent Si&ndash;OH groups were identified as the active centers and demonstrated high efficiency in catalyzing the ODHP reaction at low temperatures. Moreover, the crystal size of B-containing MFI zeolite could also be regulated. A self-pillared B-containing MFI zeolite with an ultrathin b-axis was synthesized using tetrabutylammonium hydroxide as the structure-directing agent. (68) The in situ IR and 2-D MAS NMR results showed that ultrathin B-containing MFI zeolite with a high specific surface area and abundant Si&ndash;OH groups allowed dynamic self-dispersion of highly mobile B clusters through condensation with the surrounding Si&ndash;OH groups, thereby contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance and stability in the ODHP process.
During the ODHP reaction, the mass transport behaviors play an important role in the enhancement of catalytic performance, which makes the design of suitable 3D pore structures crucial. Lu and co-workers synthesized a 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate using a hard template method, (104) which possessed both rich pores and a high surface area. Primarily, polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as the hard template were synthesized by a self-assembly process using resorcinol, formaldehyde, 1,6-diaminohexane, and ammonia solution, thus obtaining the highly ordered 3-D monoliths. Subsequently, the BPO4 precursor of the ethanol&ndash;water solutions of boric acid and phosphoric acid was introduced with polybenzoxazine polymer spheres under the hydrothermal treatment for nucleation. The carbonization process was performed at 550 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere, forming the BPO4@carbon product. Finally, the ordered 3-D macroporous boron phosphate BPO4(OM) was obtained by calcining the sample in the air to remove the hard template (Figure 5c). The pore structure of BPO4(OM) was a 3-D cross macropore network, which could effectively improve molecular diffusion and heat transfer. In the ODHP reaction, BPO4(OM) exhibited better catalytic performance than bulk BPO4 materials. For instance, to achieve a propane conversion of 14.3%, the operation temperature required for the BPO4(OM) catalyst was 515 °C, which is much lower than that for the BPO4 (bulk, 550 °C) catalyst (Figure 5c). As the surface specific rate of propane consumption is similar between BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk), it suggested that the difference in the number of active sites in unit surface area results in the varying performance of the two catalysts. However, the BPO4(OM) catalyst exhibited excellent stability, and the propane conversion and propene selectivity were constant during the 20 h catalyst test. The BPO4(OM) catalyst demonstrated an excellent propene yield, much higher than the catalysts reported to date, which had far exceeded the industrial demand of 1 golefin gcat&ndash;1 h&ndash;1 with a productivity of ∼16 golefin gcat&ndash;1 h&ndash;1 at a WHSV of 94 gC3H8 gcat&ndash;1 h&ndash;1 and a propane conversion of 20.8%. The suitable 3-D pore structures render ordered macroporous boron phosphate a very promising catalyst for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, and it is expected to meet the industrial standard. Liu and co-workers (66) developed a unique approach to synthesize BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure via a self-assembly strategy. Thereafter, by raising the annealing temperature and prolonging the annealing time, the pure h-BN monolithic foam with a 3-D bowl-like structure was obtained. This 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g&ndash;1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of ∼1.75 gC3H6·gcat&ndash;1·h&ndash;1.
2.3.4. Exploration of Active Sites on 3-D B Materials
The study of active sites on the surface of 2-D materials has shown that the agglomerated tricoordination oxidized B species are responsible for ODHP catalytic performance, which are further explored in 3-D B materials, such as supported boron oxide catalysts, (63,64) boron phosphate catalyst, (104) etc. The B2O3 supported on 3-D mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15) and 3-D honeycomb cordierite (B2O3/SiO2@HC) catalysts were thoroughly studied. The 11B NMR measurement of the fresh and spent B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts showed that the features of tricoordination B ring B3O9/2 (B(3a)) increased with the decrease of tricoordination B BO3/2 (B(3b)) and tricoordination B on the framework silicon oxide B(3c) after the ODHP reaction, which was owing to the enthalpy-driven transformations of B(3b) and B(3c) to B(3a) species. (87,105) For the 3-D B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst system, the agglomerated oxidized B species of the boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 were considered the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity, while the tetra-coordinated species (B(4)) acted as insert. In addition, the catalytic effects of tricoordination B and the inset of tetra-coordinated were also confirmed by the studies of ODHP over boron phosphate (BPO4), (104) silicon boride (SiB6), (53) and B2O3@BPO4 (65) catalysts. Considering BPO4 as an example, a reduction of the XPS features of the tetracoordinated species was observed after the reaction accompanied by aan increase of that of the tricoordination B species, which, under the reaction conditions, activated gaseous oxygen and participated in the dehydrogenation of alkanes.
Conversely, the recent study of ODHP over B-containing zeolites (MFI framework, BS-1) by Wang and co-workers (60) proposed an active site of isolated B in a 3-D zeolite framework without B oligomers, exhibiting high activity and selectivity for ODHP. This is an exception to the hypothesis that stated the agglomerated oxidized B species (B&ndash;O&ndash;B oligomers) are responsible for the catalytic activity. The 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy and 2-D 11B → 1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectra revealed that B species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework were isolated and that the B4 sites could convert to B3 sites by dehydration of a portion of the B4 sites, which was a reversible and stochastic process. This was in agreement with the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results. Further, the time-of-flight mass spectra showed that B-containing clusters of BO2 and BO3 and a variety of borosilicate ions [SizB1OyHx, z = 1, 2] could be detected. However, the clusters containing the B&ndash;O&ndash;B structure were completely undetectable. The hydroxyl groups on the isolated B were also identified by 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy, 2-D 11B → 1H HETCOR spectrum, and in situ FTIR, revealing that the isolated B in the zeolite framework (Si&ndash;O&ndash;B linkage) could hydrolyze to form more −B[OH···O(H)&ndash;Si]2 groups that hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (Figure 5c), resulting in the good durability of the BS-1 catalyst in the ODHP. By contrast, the isolated B in MWW-type borosilicate zeolite (B-MWW) was inactive and the NMR characterization studies showed that −B[OH···O(H)&ndash;Si]2 sites were absent in the inactive B-MWW catalyst. In addition, the borosilicate zeolite with a *BEA structure (B-Beta) also had abundant −B[OH···O(H)&ndash;Si]2 sites exhibiting high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Thus, the −B[OH···O(H)&ndash;Si]2 sites were the necessary active sites for ODHP over the BS-1 catalyst.
In summary, the evolution of B-based catalysts with active sites dispersed in different spatial dimensions has been well developed in the past decade. The oxygen-functionalized B sites and clusters were demonstrated to achieve high olefin and very low COx selectivity. By classifying the reported catalysts from the perspective of the B dispersion dimension, the potential strategies to enhance the catalytic performances are revealed. The increasing active site dispersion dimension from 1-D to 2-D and 3-D significantly increases the density of available centers for the ODHP reaction. However, the loading of B active species in the 3-D porous materials or doping into the zeolite frameworks not only provides a higher utility of B active sites but also constructs confined space which regulates the reaction behaviors of active radical intermediates and mass transport behaviors (Figure 6a). Considering that the ODHP reaction involves both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways, controlling the interplay between the on-surface and off-surface channels through the whole reaction from the radical initiation stage to the termination stage is highly important for catalyst design. In this sense, the introduction of confined walls is able to directly increase the wall termination possibility of the gas-phase radicals, which exhibits a negative effect on the reaction rate. (106,107) However, as the confinement also influences the diffusion of reactants, radical intermediates, and products, predicting the net effect of the 3-D dispersion of active sites on the apparent catalytic performances is difficult. The decoupling of this multiparameter system is highly challenging but crucial for the rational design of porous B-based ODHP catalysts.

The conversion&ndash;selectivity and space&ndash;time yield of the representative B-based catalysts are summarized in Figure 6b and 6c. A conversion&ndash;selectivity trade-off relationship clearly exists for all catalysts, and the maximum yield of propylene over B catalysts is still below 30%. The yields of B catalysts with 1-D active sites are relatively similar (between 10% and 20%). By contrast, the yields of catalysts with 2-D and 3-D active sites are more discrete, probably owing to the stronger structure diversity and complexity of these systems. We summarize the catalytic performance of typical B-based catalysts with 1-D to 3-D dispersed active sites in ODH reactions in Table 1. Some of the reported catalysts have already exhibited considerable propene and total olefin productivity beyond the industrial standard (1 golefinsg&ndash;1 h&ndash;1). In future studies, in addition to the enhancement of the intrinsic activity of B species, understanding and optimizing the spatial interaction of the surface-active sites with the gas-phase key intermediates can also provide good opportunities to develop catalysts for industrial applications.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, as established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1126/science.abe7935\] and \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_3\] reveals that these materials, featuring high specific surface areas and numerous sites for B species, regulate radical reaction behavior and mass transport, crucial for catalytic applications. 
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel synthesis techniques for B-based materials with enhanced structural characteristics, such as increased surface area and optimized pore size distribution. Moreover, the investigation of the dynamic behavior of boron sites under reaction conditions could provide deeper insights into the active site formation, guiding the design of more efficient catalysts. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, like B2O3, is a growing trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties, suggesting a promising direction for the development of sustainable catalytic systems. Additionally, the study of the interaction between B species and support materials could lead to the discovery of new mechanisms for improving catalytic stability and activity. The exploration of these areas could potentially open up new avenues for the enhancement of catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation and other catalytic applications.
