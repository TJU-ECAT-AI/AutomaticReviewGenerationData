There is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability.

The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption. The boron loading was quantified by ICP-MS to be 1.10.1wt.%. The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are not active for propane ODH. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the boron species in B-MWW. The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites. The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species matches the results, verifying that B-MWW contains primarily framework species. The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.201914696"},

The synthesis process involves primary and secondary particle aggregations, Ostwald ripening, and an additional tertiary aggregation, leading to the formation of the sandwich-like hollow sphere structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite outperforms many metal-based catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability, making it a promising metal-free catalyst for high-temperature applications. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which allowed for the formation of a unique tertiary aggregation phenomenon. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, enhancing the catalytic activity and long-time stability of the material at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. B2O3, with its melting point of 450 C and changing viscosity at high temperatures, is a key component in hydrocarbon conversions. However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperatures poses a challenge for B2O3-containing catalysts. Interestingly, the low volatility and high melting point of B2O3 make it suitable for use as a high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalyst (SPLC) when supported by a suitable material. Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports for traditional supported catalysts to gain more active sites. Sandwich-like structures are commonly used to maximize the utilization of planar supports. The B2O3@BPO4 composite, with its sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method, demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperatures, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. The reaction follows Eley-Rideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.028"},

The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage. The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction. This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution, giving good durability in the reaction process. The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species, which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species.

The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis, and the specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively. The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield. The structural stability of the BPO4(OM) catalyst is evidenced by unchanged macropore sizes and intergrown nanocrystals, as well as an identical XRD pattern before and after the catalytic reaction. The active sites are identified as tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species, which are retained after the reaction, as confirmed by FTIR, NMR, and XPS measurements. The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increases from 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst, indicating their role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.", "Doi": "10.1016/S1872-2067(20)63654-3"},

There is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability.

The dynamic nature of boron sites under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. B-MWW was synthesized according to an established procedure, and the successful synthesis was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 physisorption. The boron loading was quantified by ICP-MS to be 1.10.1wt.%. The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are not active for propane ODH. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the boron species in B-MWW. The 11B isotropic chemical shift, electric field gradient asymmetry parameter, and quadrupolar coupling constant values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species. The findings are consistent with previous studies on boron-doped zeolites. The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species matches the results, verifying that B-MWW contains primarily framework species. The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. Catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.201914696"},

The synthesis process involves primary and secondary particle aggregations, Ostwald ripening, and an additional tertiary aggregation, leading to the formation of the sandwich-like hollow sphere structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite outperforms many metal-based catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability, making it a promising metal-free catalyst for high-temperature applications. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which allowed for the formation of a unique tertiary aggregation phenomenon. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, enhancing the catalytic activity and long-time stability of the material at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. B2O3, with its melting point of 450 C and changing viscosity at high temperatures, is a key component in hydrocarbon conversions. However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperatures poses a challenge for B2O3-containing catalysts. Interestingly, the low volatility and high melting point of B2O3 make it suitable for use as a high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalyst (SPLC) when supported by a suitable material. Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports for traditional supported catalysts to gain more active sites. Sandwich-like structures are commonly used to maximize the utilization of planar supports. The B2O3@BPO4 composite, with its sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method, demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperatures, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. The reaction follows Eley-Rideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.028"},

The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts.
