1.The literature does not provide specific details on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it discuss the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention that silicon boride, a metal-free material rich in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance properties at high temperatures and can be a potential catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensures catalytic stability. The origin of catalytic activity is attributed to the BOH groups generated from BO species with the assistance of steam. This suggests that the dispersion of boron active sites in a porous framework could enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites for reactions and improving the stability of the catalyst under high-temperature conditions.

1.文献没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征的具体细节，也没有讨论将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法。但是，它确实提到硅硼化物，一种富含硼位点的无金属材料，在高温下具有良好的抗氧化性能，可以作为轻烷氧化脱氢的潜在催化剂。硅硼化物的抗氧化能力确保了催化稳定性。催化活性的起源归因于在蒸汽辅助下从BO物种生成的BOH基团。这表明，在多孔框架中分散硼活性位点可以增强催化性能，通过为反应提供更多的活性位点，并在高温条件下提高催化剂的稳定性。
