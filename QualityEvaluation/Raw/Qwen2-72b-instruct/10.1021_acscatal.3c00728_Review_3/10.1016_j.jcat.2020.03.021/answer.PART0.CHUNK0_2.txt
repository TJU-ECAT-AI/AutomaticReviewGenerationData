[1] "Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized."
[2] "The MWW borosilicate lamellar precursor was synthesized hydrothermally according to earlier report, with slight modifications."
[3] "The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape, featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores."
[4] "The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively, making it clear that the heteroatom boron inserted into the framework of zeolites."
[5] "The layered borosilicate zeolite catalyze ethane ODH at a slightly higher temperature range of 560590 C, which is due to more energetically demanded activation of primary CH bonds in ethane."
[6] "The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene."

1.The synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites was carried out using a hydrothermal method, with modifications to the precursor synthesis. The zeolites have a predominantly microporous structure with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores, which is beneficial for catalytic performance. The insertion of boron into the zeolite framework was confirmed by FT-IR spectra, indicating the presence of both trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron. The catalytic performance of the zeolites for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) was observed at a slightly higher temperature range due to the higher energy demand for the activation of primary CH bonds in ethane. The defective trigonal boron structures were identified as the active sites for propane ODH to propylene, consistent with previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species are required for this reaction.

1.层状硼硅酸盐沸石的合成采用了水热法，对前体的合成进行了修改。沸石具有主要的微孔结构和少量的中间孔隙，这对催化性能有益。通过FT-IR光谱确认了硼插入沸石框架，表明存在三角和四面体配位的硼。沸石对乙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)的催化性能在略高的温度范围内被观察到，这是由于乙烷中初级CH键的激活需要更高的能量。三角缺陷硼结构被鉴定为丙烷ODH至丙烯的活性位点，与先前的报道一致，即BO3而不是BO4物种是该反应所必需的。
