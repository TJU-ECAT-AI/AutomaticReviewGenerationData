[1] "Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized."
[2] "The MWW borosilicate lamellar precursor was synthesized hydrothermally according to earlier report, with slight modifications."
[3] "The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape, featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores."
[4] "The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively, making it clear that the heteroatom boron inserted into the framework of zeolites."
[5] "The layered borosilicate zeolite catalyze ethane ODH at a slightly higher temperature range of 560590 C, which is due to more energetically demanded activation of primary CH bonds in ethane."
[6] "The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene."

1.The synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites was achieved through hydrothermal methods, with modifications to previous reports. The zeolites have a type-I N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, indicating predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores. The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by FT-IR spectra, showing bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 corresponding to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron. The defective trigonal boron structures (BO3) were identified as the active sites for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene, while the activation of primary CH bonds in ethane required a higher temperature range of 560-590 C for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

1.通过水热方法合成了层状硼硅酸盐沸石，对先前的报道进行了修改。沸石具有I型N2吸附-解吸等温线，表明主要为微孔，少量的孔隙间介孔。通过FT-IR光谱确认了框架中存在硼，光谱中1405和926 cm1处的带对应于三角配位和四面体配位的硼。缺陷三角硼结构(BO3)被鉴定为丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯的活性位点，而乙烷中一级CH键的活化在560-590 C的较高温度范围内进行乙烷氧化脱氢。
