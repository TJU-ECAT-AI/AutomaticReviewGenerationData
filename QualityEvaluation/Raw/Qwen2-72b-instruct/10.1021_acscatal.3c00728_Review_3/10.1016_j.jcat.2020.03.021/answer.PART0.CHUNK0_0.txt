[1] "Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized."
[2] "The MWW borosilicate lamellar precursor was synthesized hydrothermally according to earlier report, with slight modifications."
[3] "The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape, featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores."
[4] "The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively, making it clear that the heteroatom boron inserted into the framework of zeolites."
[5] "The layered borosilicate zeolite catalyze ethane ODH at a slightly higher temperature range of 560590 C, which is due to more energetically demanded activation of primary CH bonds in ethane."
[6] "The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene."

1.The synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites was achieved through a hydrothermal process, with modifications to the precursor synthesis. The zeolites exhibit a type-I N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, indicating predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores. The presence of boron in the framework is confirmed by FT-IR spectra, showing bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 corresponding to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron. The catalytic performance of the zeolites is demonstrated in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) at a slightly higher temperature range of 560-590°C, due to the more energetically demanding activation of primary CH bonds in ethane. The active sites for propane ODH to propylene are identified as defective trigonal boron structures (BO3), rather than tetrahedral boron (BO4) species.
2.The methods used to incorporate boron active components into porous frameworks include hydrothermal synthesis, which allows for the creation of well-defined structures with dispersed active sites. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the catalytic application. For propane ODH, the presence of defective trigonal boron structures (BO3) is crucial for high catalytic performance. The synthesis process must be carefully controlled to ensure the formation of these active sites. The type-I N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm indicates a high surface area and microporous structure, which is beneficial for catalytic applications. The FT-IR spectra confirm the insertion of boron into the zeolite framework, which is essential for the catalytic activity. The higher temperature range for ethane ODH suggests that the zeolites may have different active sites or require more energy for the activation of primary CH bonds in ethane.

1.通过水热过程合成了层状硼硅酸盐沸石，对前体合成进行了修改。沸石表现出I型N2吸附-解吸等温线，表明主要为微孔，少量为孔隙间介孔。FT-IR光谱证实了框架中存在硼，1405和926 cm1处的带对应于三角形和四面体配位的硼。沸石在560-590°C的稍高温度范围内催化乙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)，这是由于乙烷中初级CH键的激活需要更多的能量。丙烷ODH至丙烯的活性位点被鉴定为有缺陷的三角硼结构(BO3)，而不是四面体硼(BO4)物种。
2.将硼活性组分掺入多孔框架中的方法包括水热合成，这允许创建具有分散活性位点的明确定义的结构。这些方法的有效性根据催化应用的不同而不同。对于丙烷ODH，有缺陷的三角硼结构(BO3)的存在对于高催化性能至关重要。合成过程必须仔细控制，以确保活性位点的形成。I型N2吸附-解吸等温线表明具有高表面积和微孔结构，这对催化应用有益。FT-IR光谱确认了硼插入沸石框架，这对催化活性至关重要。乙烷ODH的较高温度范围表明沸石可能具有不同的活性位点，或者需要更多的能量来激活乙烷中的初级CH键。
