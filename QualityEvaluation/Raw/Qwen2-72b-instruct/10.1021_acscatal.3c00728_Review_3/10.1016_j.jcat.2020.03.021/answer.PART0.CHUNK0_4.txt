[1] "Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized."
[2] "The MWW borosilicate lamellar precursor was synthesized hydrothermally according to earlier report, with slight modifications."
[3] "The actual boron content of the zeolites before and after various treatments was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)."
[4] "Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was recorded on PANalytical XPert3 Powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm)."
[5] "N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured with an ASAP 2020 sorption analyzer (Micromeritics)."
[6] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a Hitachi HT7700, operating at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV."
[7] "IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector."
[8] "11B MAS NMR spectra were recorded on Agilent DD2-500 MHz spectrometer with an 11.7T magnet and Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz spectrometer with a 14.1T magnet, using a 4-mm MAS NMR probe with a spinning rate of 10 kHz."
[9] "The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively."
[10] "The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by the FT-IR spectra."
[11] "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed four main diffraction peaks at 2θ = 7.21, 8.02, 10.10 and 26.33, corresponding to the known (1 0 0), (1 0 1), (1 0 2) and (3 1 0) reflections of ERB-1, which confirmed the MWW structure."
[12] "The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape, featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores."
[13] "The layered borosilicate zeolite catalyze ethane ODH at a slightly higher temperature range of 560590 C, which is due to more energetically demanded activation of primary CH bonds in ethane."
[14] "The major products of propane ODH consist of C3H6, C2H4, and CO, with very small amount of CO2 (<1%)."
[15] "The selectivity towards the desired product, propylene, decreases slightly with elevated temperatures."
[16] "However, the total selectivity for light olefins (ethylene + propylene, C2-3=) remained almost unchanged up to 530 C."
[17] "The kinetic analysis exhibited that the reaction order is approximately 0.5 for oxygen and a near second-order dependence of propane concentration."
[18] "One-dimensional 11B MAS NMR were performed to distinguish the B species and identify the active sites."
[19] "Each spectrum can be deconvoluted into five peaks with chemical shifts at ca.18, 15, 11, 0 and 2.8 ppm."
[20] "The peaks at 18, 15 and 11 ppm were ascribed to tri-coordinated boron which denoted as B[3]a, B[3]b and B[3]c respectively."
[21] "The sharp peaks at around 0 ppm and 2.8 ppm were accordingly assigned to B(OH)2(OSi)2 and B(OSi)4 tetrahedral framework, donated as B[4]a and B[4]b."
[22] "The relative amounts of boron sites in fresh and spent catalyst at 1 h TOS were similar."
[23] "After 20 h reaction, there was no significant change of B[3]c species, while the presence of B[3]a was increased at the cost of B[3]b species."
[24] "The significant loss of activity by about 87% after washing implicated that there was a correlation between the amount of defective trigonal boron species and the propane conversion."
[25] "The TOF value of BZEO-1, BZEO-2 and BZEO-3 were 4.3, 4.3 and 3.8 h1, respectively, indicated the intrinsic catalytic activities for the BZEO catalysts are identical under same reaction conditions."
[26] "The tetrahedral boron can be transformed to trigonal structure with carefully dehydration treatment."
[27] "The defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene."

1.The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include the synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites, the presence of boron in the framework confirmed by FT-IR spectra, and the confirmation of the MWW structure by XRD patterns. The materials exhibit predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores, and the active sites are identified as defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) by 11B MAS NMR spectra. These features enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for active site dispersion, promoting the formation of the desired products, and maintaining stability under reaction conditions.
2.The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include hydrothermal synthesis of the MWW borosilicate lamellar precursor, with slight modifications, and the measurement of actual boron content by ICP-OES. The effectiveness of these methods for different catalytic applications is demonstrated by the high propylene selectivity and total light olefins selectivity achieved at a propane conversion of 15.6% and 530 C, respectively. The methods are also effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, although at a slightly higher temperature range of 560590 C due to the more energetically demanded activation of primary CH bonds in ethane.

1.B基材料的3-D分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征包括层状硼硅酸盐沸石的合成，通过FT-IR光谱确认框架中存在硼，以及通过XRD图案确认MWW结构。这些材料主要表现出微孔，少量的中间孔，通过11B MAS NMR光谱识别的活性位点是缺陷三角硼物种（B[3]a和B[3]b）。这些特征通过为活性位点分散提供大面积，促进所需产物的形成，并在反应条件下保持稳定性，从而提高催化性能。
2.将B活性组分掺入这些结构中的方法包括MWW硼硅酸盐层状前体的水热合成，稍作修改，以及通过ICP-OES测量实际硼含量。这些方法对不同催化应用的有效性通过在丙烷转化率为15.6%和530 C时分别实现的高丙烯选择性和总轻烯烃选择性得到证明。这些方法也适用于乙烷的氧化脱氢，尽管由于乙烷中主要CH键的更耗能激活，温度范围略高，为560590 C。
