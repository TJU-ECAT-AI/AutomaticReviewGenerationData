1.The synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites was achieved through hydrothermal synthesis, with modifications to the precursor synthesis process. The boron content of the zeolites was measured using ICP-OES, and the structure was characterized using XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, TEM, IR, and 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy. The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by FT-IR spectra, with the bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively. The zeolite catalyzed ethane ODH at a slightly higher temperature range of 560590 C, due to the more energetically demanding activation of primary CH bonds in ethane. The relative amounts of B[4]a+b in the fresh catalysts were much lower compared with that of B[3]a and B[3]b, which significantly increased after 20 h running on stream. The defective trigonal structures were identified as the active sites, consistent with previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene.

1.通过水热合成实现了层状硼硅酸盐沸石的合成，对前体合成过程进行了修改。使用ICP-OES测量了沸石的硼含量，并使用XRD、N2吸附-解吸等温线、TEM、IR和11B MAS NMR光谱对结构进行了表征。通过FT-IR光谱确认了框架中存在硼，1405和926 cm1处的带分别被分配给三角形和四面体配位的硼。沸石在560590 C的略高温度范围内催化乙烷ODH，这是由于乙烷中初级CH键的激活需要更多的能量。新鲜催化剂中B[4]a+b的相对量远低于B[3]a和B[3]b，但在20 h运行后显著增加。结果很好地表明，有缺陷的三角形结构是活性位点，与以前的报道一致，即需要BO3而不是BO4物种将丙烷ODH转化为丙烯。
