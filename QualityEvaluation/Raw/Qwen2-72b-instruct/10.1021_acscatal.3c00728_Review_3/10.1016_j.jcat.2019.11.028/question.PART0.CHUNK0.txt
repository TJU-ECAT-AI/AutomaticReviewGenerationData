B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres as metal-free supported liquid-phase catalysts Highlights • B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method. • A phenomenon of tertiary aggregation was observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4. • Melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species. • B2O3@BPO4 exhibited excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability at 550 C.
Abstract Supported liquid-phase catalysts (SLPCs) combine the advantages of homogenous liquid-phase catalysts and heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., controllability of active centers and efficient productcatalyst separation). Generally, SLPCs manifest as a liquid-phase catalyst film or droplet adsorbed onto the surface of a porous support, such as ionic liquid-phase catalysts. Here, we extend this idea and develop a solvent-free liquid-phase catalyst supported on hollow spheres. We report sandwich-like B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres synthesized through a one-step template-free method. At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a high stability at 550 C. We also found a phenomenon of tertiary aggregation during the formation of this sandwich-like hollow sphere. Additionally, the kinetic experiments indicate oxygen activation on the B2O3@BPO4 surface and second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane. This work may open a new avenue for the design and construction of metal-free oxides used as high-temperature SLPCs.

1. Introduction
Superior catalytic technology is a goal of general concern, involving ease of processing, high selectivity, productivity, and good robustness. The rapid growth of homogeneous catalysis is mainly due to its selectivity, activity performance, and relatively mild reaction conditions. However, homogeneous catalysts suffer from an obvious problem of separation between catalyst and products. In contrast, although efficient productcatalyst separation is one of the distinctive features of heterogeneous catalysis, active sites such as defects and irregularities of the solid surface remain difficult to control and design for heterogeneous catalysts. Thus, a strategy to heterogenize homogeneous catalysts onto solid supports has been attempted to achieve the salient features of both types of catalysis.
Supported liquid-phase catalysts (SLPCs) have been developed over decades to integrate the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis [1] ,[2] . SLPCs feature a liquid-phase catalyst film or droplet adsorbed onto the surface of a porous support, such as an ionic liquid-phase catalysts\. Since the late 1930s, research on SLPC has been formally reported [1] . The first example of a metal complex solution in a high-boiling-point organic solvent or aqueous medium as a supported catalyst phase was given in the 1960s [3] . In 2002, the concept of supported ionic liquid phase catalysis was proposed, and many examples have been achieved [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] . Schneider and co-workers demonstrated an RhH(CO)2(L)2 ionic liquid film on the surface of porous silica for hydroaminomethylation with very high selectivity by efficient product/catalyst separation [8] . The immobilization of ionic liquid and ionic liquid metal triflate catalysts onto a mesoporous MCM-41 surface exhibited efficient activity for the acylation of amines with very high atom economy [9] . In spite of the advantages of liquid-phase catalysts, supported ionic liquid-phase catalysts are typically used below 200 C due to the limited thermal stability of either the dissolved transition metal complex or the liquid organic salt solvent. Very recently, a new type of supported liquid metal catalyst, a gallium-rich PdGa phase, was reported to achieve stable activity in butane dehydrogenation at 445 C [10] . Therefore, high-temperature-stable catalysts are still highly desirable to extend the application of SPLC.
The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts has been emerging as an important research trend because of their low cost and ecofriendly properties as compared with metal-based catalysts. B2O3 is a typical inorganic oxide with a melting point of 450 C, and the viscosity of its melting phase changes with temperature. B2O3 is also an important catalyst component in hydrocarbon conversions [11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] . However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperature is considered a vital problem for B2O3-containing catalysts [15] . Interestingly, from another angle, low volatility and high melting point make B2O3 possible for use as a high-temperature SPLC once a suitable support is available.
For traditional supported catalysts, to gain more active sites, hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports [16] ,[17] ,[18] . Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures [19] ,[20] , but sandwich-like structures are rarely used in hollow-sphere structures due to the difficulty of capsulation at micro-/nanoscale. Moreover, the preparation process is tedious, including the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites [21] ,[22] . Therefore, it is expected to synthesize hollow sphere structures using a simple approach and make the best use of both sides of hollow spheres.
Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing. The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature. In the process of formation, we found not only two conventional particle aggregations (primary and secondary aggregation) and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation (denoted as tertiary aggregation). Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C).
Propene, one of the important chemical intermediates, has been widely used as a raw material for polypropylene, acrylonitrile, isopropanol, acetone, epoxypropane, etc.
[23] . Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene is regarded as a promising approach to producing propene relative to steam cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation, being coking-free and having no equilibrium limit [24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] . In this work, a metal-free B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts [28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] . Furthermore, the reaction follows EleyRideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to PC3H8.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of B2O3@BPO4-x sandwich-like hollow spheres
Boron oxide (B2O3) and diammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH4)2HPO4) were mixed at a 2:1 M ratio and ground in an agate mortar. Then the mixture was put into an Al2O3 boat and heated for 2 h at 800 C in the ambient atmosphere in a tube furnace. A white particle was obtained through slightly finer grinding and labeled as B2O3@BPO4-800. By changing annealing temperatures, a series of samples prepared at 600, 1000, and 1200CC were named B2O3@BPO4-x (x = 600, 1000, and 1200, respectively). The annealing time for B2O3@BPO4-800 was also changed to investigate the formation mechanism. The B2O3 mass content of the B2O3@BPO4-800 sample was measured to be 38.1 wt% by comparing the sample weight before and after washing. For comparison, a B2O3/SiO2 sample was prepared by physical mixture of B2O3 and SiO2 with different mass ratios. B2O3 and BPO4 hollow spheres (washed B2O3@BPO4-800) were physically mixed with different mass ratios of B2O3 to total mass and marked as α wt.% B2O3/BPO4-800 (α = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50). FePO4 was synthesized by annealing a mixture of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and (NH4)H2PO4 in a 1:2.6 mass ratio at 800 C for 2 h. The powder catalysts CeO2, MoO3, Fe2O3, and V2O5 were purchased from Sinopharm Co. Hexagonal boron nitride (BN) came from Sigma-Aldrich Co.
2.2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. Attenuated total internal reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was studied on a Nicolet IS 50 apparatus. N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherm measurements were carried out at 77 K on a Micromeritics 3 Flex 3500 instrument. A field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi New Generation SU8100) and a field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM) (TECNAI F30) were used to study the microstructures of samples. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Photos of the B2O3 melting process on the surface of the BPO4 tablet were captured by contact angle measurements (Dataphysics OCA20).
2.3. Catalytic activity test
The selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed reactor. The sample (150 mg) was put into a U-type quartz tube (4 mm inner diameter and 6 mm external diameter) between two quartz wools. The as-prepared B2O3@BPO4-x catalysts were sieved to collect particles of 2040 mesh for the activity test. The catalysts B2O3/SiO2 and B2O3/γ-Al2O3 were compressed using a pellet press and sieved to obtain the particles of 2040 mesh. The other powder catalysts, including washed B2O3@BPO4-x, were mixed with inert SiO2 (2040 mesh) for the activity test. Then the tube was placed in a vertical furnace and heated to the target reaction temperature. Each target reaction temperature was maintained for 30 min for the precise analysis of products. A feed gas consisting of nitrogen, oxygen, and propane was controlled by a Sevenstar mass flow meter (flow rate 20 mL/min). The product was analyzed using a Pannatek A90 online gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a nickel reformer. The nickel reformer was used to transfer COx to CH4, which can be detected by FID. Two molecular sieve columns and one HP-PLOT/Q column were used to separate the C1 products (CO, CO2, and CH4) and hydrocarbon products (CH4, C2H4, C3H6, C3H8, etc.), respectively. Furthermore, the concentration of O2 was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) on an Agilent gas chromatograph equipped with a 13X molecular sieve column.
The conversion, selectivity, and carbon balance were calculated as follows, Propane conversion: Selectivity: Carbon balance: Oxygen conversion:where s represents reactants, p is products, n is the carbon atom number of species (such as C3H8 equal to 3, CO equal to 1), c represents the molar concentration, and i and j are counting signs of species. is the O2 concentration at the reactor outlet, and represents the O2 concentration at the reactor inlet.The consumption rate of C3H8 ( ) was calculated as follows,where is the molar flow rate of C3H8 at the inlet of the reactor,represents the conversion of C3H8, and is the weight of the catalyst. can be obtained from the partial pressure of C3H8 and the total gas flow rate (20 mL/min) as where represents the partial pressure of C3H8 and is the molar volume of ideal gas at 298 K.
2.4. Turnover frequency calculation
Turnover frequency (TOF) in terms of exposed surface B atoms of B2O3@BPO4-x was estimated according to the partial molar volume of melted B2O3 (39.69 cm3 mol1) from Knoches report [32] and the supports BET results. For simplification, we choose exposed B atoms as countable active sites in light of the case of metal oxide catalysts and assume that each B2O3 molecule occupies a cubic space and exposes one B atom at the surface. The exposed area per B2O3 molecule (i.e., area per B atom) was calculated to be 0.1632 nm2 from (39.69 cm3/6.02 1023)2/3. Therefore, the total number of exposed B atoms can be written as Accordingly, (1) for the B2O3@BPO4-x and 40 wt% B2O3/SiO2 samples, the TOF can be obtained using the equation (2) For 40 wt% B2O3/γ-Al2O3, according to the exposed area of per B2O3 molecule, 90 mg Al2O3 with 113.6 m2/g BET surface area can disperse 1.73 104 mol B2O3, molecules, which is more than the loaded 60 mg B2O3 (1.42 104 mol). Therefore, all B2O3 molecules were assumed to be exposed. The TOF for 40 wt% B2O3/γ-Al2O3 can be gained using the equation
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Schematic illustration of sample preparation
Fig. 1 schematically describes the synthesis procedure of the B2O3@BPO4 sample. In the initial stage, BPO4 particles are produced in molten B2O3 at 800 C, exceeding the melting point of B2O3 (450 C). In the attachment process, the individual BPO4 particles directly merge with their neighboring crystallites to form agglomerations. Then some agglomerated particles are induced to generate BPO4 solid spheres through self-assembly. Once the solid spheres form, an Ostwald ripening process occurs (i.e., the smaller crystallites in the central parts are dissolved and redeposited on the larger crystallites at outer parts), resulting in the formation of BPO4 hollow sphere structures [33] . During the cooling process, liquid B2O3 cools down and solidifies into nanowires covering both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow sphere, forming sandwich-type B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres.
