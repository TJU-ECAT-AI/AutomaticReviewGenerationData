1.The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The hollow spheres have a large surface area and high loading capacity, which provides more active sites for catalytic reactions. The B2O3@BPO4 composite, consisting of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires, acts as a supported liquid-phase catalyst (SPLC) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at high temperatures. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species, showing excellent productivity and high stability. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The B2O3@BPO4 composite demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into porous frameworks with 3-D dispersed active sites, enhancing catalytic performance for different catalytic applications.
