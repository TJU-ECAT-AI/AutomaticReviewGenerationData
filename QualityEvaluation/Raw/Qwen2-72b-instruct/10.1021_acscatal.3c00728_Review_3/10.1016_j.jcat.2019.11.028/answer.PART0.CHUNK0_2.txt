1.The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and efficient way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The unique structure of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires provides a large surface area and high loading capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showing excellent productivity and high stability at high temperatures. The formation process involves not only conventional particle aggregations and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation, which contributes to the formation of the unique sandwich-like structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibits excellent activity and selectivity, with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. This method of incorporating B active components into the structure is effective for high-temperature catalytic applications, especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
