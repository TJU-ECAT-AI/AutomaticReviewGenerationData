1.The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method, which allowed for the formation of a unique tertiary aggregation phenomenon. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, enhancing the catalytic activity and long-time stability of the material at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. B2O3, with its melting point of 450 C and changing viscosity at high temperatures, is a key component in hydrocarbon conversions. However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperatures poses a challenge for B2O3-containing catalysts. Interestingly, the low volatility and high melting point of B2O3 make it suitable for use as a high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalyst (SPLC) when supported by a suitable material. Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports for traditional supported catalysts to gain more active sites. Sandwich-like structures are commonly used to maximize the utilization of planar supports. The B2O3@BPO4 composite, with its sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method, demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperatures, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts. The reaction follows Eley-Rideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane.

1.B2O3@BPO4三明治状空心球采用一步无模板法合成，形成了独特的三级聚集现象。熔融的B2O3由BPO4支撑，作为活性物种，提高了材料在高温下的催化活性和长时间稳定性。非金属催化剂（如B2O3）的开发是一个重要的研究趋势，因为它们与金属基催化剂相比具有低成本和环保特性。B2O3是一种典型的无机氧化物，熔点为450 C，其熔融相的粘度随温度变化，在烃类转化中是重要的催化剂组分。然而，B2O3在高温下的熔化对含B2O3的催化剂来说是一个关键问题。有趣的是，B2O3的低挥发性和高熔点使其在得到合适的支撑材料时，有可能用作高温支持液相催化剂（SPLC）。对于传统的支撑催化剂，为了获得更多的活性位点，通常使用低密度、大表面积和高负载能力的空心微/纳米结构材料作为支撑。通常，三明治状结构允许最大限度地利用平面支撑的两面。B2O3@BPO4复合材料，采用一步无模板法生产的三明治状空心球结构，在高温下对丙烷的氧化脱氢显示出优异的催化活性和选择性，生产力高达0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1，在550 C下具有高稳定性，优于许多金属基催化剂。反应遵循Eley-Rideal动力学，对丙烷的分压表现出二级速率依赖性。
