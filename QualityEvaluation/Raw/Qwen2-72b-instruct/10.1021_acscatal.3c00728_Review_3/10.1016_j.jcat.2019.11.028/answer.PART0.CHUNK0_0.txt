1.The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, increasing the number of active sites, and improving the diffusion of reactants and products. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and effective way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The phenomenon of tertiary aggregation observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4 contributes to the formation of a stable and active catalyst. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, which is a key factor in the excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability of B2O3@BPO4 at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The melting point of B2O3 and the change in viscosity of its melting phase with temperature make it a suitable candidate for high-temperature catalytic applications. The use of hollow micro-/nanostructured materials as supports for traditional supported catalysts can increase the number of active sites and improve the loading capacity of the catalyst. However, the preparation process can be tedious, involving the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites. The one-step template-free method used to synthesize B2O3@BPO4 hollow sphere structures is a simple approach that makes the best use of both sides of hollow spheres.

1.B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散的活性位点的结构特性通过提供大的反应表面积、增加活性位点的数量和改善反应物和产物的扩散，增强了催化性能。B2O3@BPO4三明治状空心球通过一步无模板法合成，这是一种将B活性组分纳入结构的简单有效的方法。在B2O3@BPO4形成过程中观察到的三级聚集现象有助于形成稳定和活性催化剂。由BPO4支持的熔融B2O3作为活性物种，这是B2O3@BPO4在高温下表现出优异催化活性和长期稳定性的关键因素。非金属催化剂，如B2O3的开发，是一个重要的研究趋势，因为与金属基催化剂相比，它们的成本较低，对环境友好。B2O3的熔点和其熔融相的粘度随温度的变化使其成为高温催化应用的合适候选者。传统支撑催化剂中空微/纳米结构材料的使用可以增加活性位点的数量并提高催化剂的负载能力。然而，制备过程可能很繁琐，包括去除硬或软模板和添加活性位点。用于合成B2O3@BPO4空心球结构的一步无模板法是一种简单的方法，可以充分利用空心球的两面。
