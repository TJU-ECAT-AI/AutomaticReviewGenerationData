1.The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, increasing the number of active sites, and improving the diffusion of reactants and products. The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method, which is a simple and effective way to incorporate B active components into the structure. The phenomenon of tertiary aggregation observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4 contributes to the formation of a stable and active catalyst. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, which is a key factor in the excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability of B2O3@BPO4 at high temperatures. The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts, such as B2O3, is an important research trend due to their low cost and eco-friendly properties compared to metal-based catalysts. The melting point of B2O3 and the change in viscosity of its melting phase with temperature make it a suitable candidate for high-temperature catalytic applications. The use of hollow micro-/nanostructured materials as supports for traditional supported catalysts can increase the number of active sites and improve the loading capacity of the catalyst. However, the preparation process can be tedious, involving the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites. The one-step template-free method used to synthesize B2O3@BPO4 hollow sphere structures is a simple approach that makes the best use of both sides of hollow spheres.
