1.The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-step template-free method. The unique structure of the B2O3@BPO4 composite, consisting of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires, enhances catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for active sites and efficient mass transfer. The melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at high temperatures (>450 C), demonstrating excellent productivity and stability. The synthesis process involves primary and secondary particle aggregations, Ostwald ripening, and an additional tertiary aggregation, leading to the formation of the sandwich-like hollow sphere structure. The B2O3@BPO4 composite outperforms many metal-based catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability, making it a promising metal-free catalyst for high-temperature applications.
