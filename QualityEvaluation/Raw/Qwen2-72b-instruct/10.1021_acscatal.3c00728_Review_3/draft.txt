1. Structural characteristics, catalytic advantages, and incorporation methods of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for enhanced catalytic applications

        The catalytic performance of B-based materials in propane dehydrogenation is significantly enhanced by the structural characteristics of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_3\]. These materials, featuring high specific surface areas and porous structures, provide numerous sites for active B species, regulating radical reaction behavior and improving mass transport. Loading B components on 3-D porous surfaces or doping them into frameworks creates effective 3-D B active sites, as demonstrated in h-BN/cordierite monoliths, SBA-15 zeolite anchoring boron oxide, and B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramics \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_3\]. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam, with a large surface area and numerous mesopores, shows excellent activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_3\].
        Incorporation methods for B active components into these structures can significantly affect catalytic activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cattod.2023.114048\]. The apparent propane reaction order, varying from 1 to 3, is influenced by the pore structure, B2O3 loading, and propane partial pressure, indicating the crucial role of these factors in catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.cattod.2023.114048\]. The effectiveness of incorporating B active components depends on the specific pore structure and loading of B2O3, impacting catalytic activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cattod.2023.114048\].
        The two-step wash-coat method, involving SiO2 as a media layer between cordierite substrate and boron oxide, facilitates the incorporation of B active components \[10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040\]. Honeycomb cordierite's straight channels allow high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and effective pore diffusion, enhancing catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040\]. The B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic activity at low boron oxide loading, achieving high propylene and olefin selectivity with negligible CO2 production under high GHSV, leading to a high propylene space time yield \[10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040\].
        Silicon boride, a B-rich material, shows promise as a catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes due to its high-temperature oxidation resistance and catalytic stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.014\]. The catalytic activity is attributed to BOH groups formed with steam assistance, suggesting that the dispersion of boron active sites in a porous framework enhances catalytic performance by providing more active sites and improving stability under high-temperature conditions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.014\].
        Electrospinning synthesis creates PBSN catalysts with uniform boron dispersion and stability on an open silica fiber framework, enhancing catalytic performance \[10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3\]. One-dimensional nanofibers with open pores prevent diffusion limitations, ensuring high activity at high WHSV in ODH of alkanes \[10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3\]. PBSN catalysts outperform other boron oxides in olefin selectivity and stability \[10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3\]. The method ensures boron's uniform distribution, preventing diffusion limitations and guaranteeing high catalytic activity \[10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3\].
        B2O3@BPO4, synthesized via a one-step template-free method, exhibits enhanced catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation due to its 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks \[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.028\].
