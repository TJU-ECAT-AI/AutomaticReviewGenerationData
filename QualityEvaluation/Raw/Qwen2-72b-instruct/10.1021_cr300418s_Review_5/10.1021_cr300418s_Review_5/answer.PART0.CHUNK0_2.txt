[1] "In studies of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalyst for methane oxidation, Cr was substituted by Ce from 2% to 100%, and the material was characterized by Raman, XRD, and XPS. XRD suggested that a single phase solid solution was produced up to 10% substitution. Raman spectra were used to identify vibrations associated with pure phase materials and with the doped chromite."
[2] "In situ measurements of Raman spectra under reaction conditions were combined with catalyst reactivity characterizations to evaluate the effect of alkali doping on the reducibility of vanadia supported on titania. (136) It was found that reducibility of the vanadia correlates with the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group."

1.Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with XRD and XPS, was used to study Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalysts for methane oxidation, identifying vibrations associated with the doped chromite and confirming the formation of a single phase solid solution up to 10% Ce substitution. In another study, in situ Raman spectroscopy combined with reactivity characterizations revealed the correlation between the reducibility of vanadia supported on titania and the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group, providing insights into the effect of alkali doping on catalyst properties.

1.拉曼光谱与XRD和XPS结合使用，研究了铈掺杂的CoCr2O4催化剂在甲烷氧化中的应用，识别了与掺杂铬酸盐相关的振动，并确认了高达10%铈替代时形成单相固溶体。在另一项研究中，原位拉曼光谱与反应性表征相结合，揭示了钛酸盐上钒酸盐的还原性与钒氧基团的拉曼光谱之间的相关性，为碱金属掺杂对催化剂性能的影响提供了见解。
