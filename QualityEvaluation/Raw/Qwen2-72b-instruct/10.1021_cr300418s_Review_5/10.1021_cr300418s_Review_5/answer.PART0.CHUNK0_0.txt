[1] "In studies of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalyst for methane oxidation, Cr was substituted by Ce from 2% to 100%, and the material was characterized by Raman, XRD, and XPS. XRD suggested that a single phase solid solution was produced up to 10% substitution. Raman spectra were used to identify vibrations associated with pure phase materials and with the doped chromite."
[2] "In situ measurements of Raman spectra under reaction conditions were combined with catalyst reactivity characterizations to evaluate the effect of alkali doping on the reducibility of vanadia supported on titania. (136) It was found that reducibility of the vanadia correlates with the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group."

1.Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with XRD and XPS, was used to study Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalysts for methane oxidation, identifying vibrations associated with the pure phase materials and the doped chromite. It was found that a single phase solid solution could be produced up to 10% substitution. In another study, in situ Raman spectroscopy was combined with catalyst reactivity characterizations to evaluate the effect of alkali doping on the reducibility of vanadia supported on titania, revealing a correlation between the reducibility of vanadia and the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group.

1.拉曼光谱法与XRD和XPS结合使用，研究了Ce掺杂CoCr2O4催化剂在甲烷氧化中的应用，识别了与纯相材料和掺杂铬酸盐相关的振动。研究发现，单相固溶体可生产至10%的替代。在另一项研究中，原位拉曼光谱与催化剂反应性表征相结合，评估了碱金属掺杂对二氧化钛上钒酸盐还原性的影响，揭示了钒酸盐还原性与钒氧基团的拉曼光谱之间的相关性。
