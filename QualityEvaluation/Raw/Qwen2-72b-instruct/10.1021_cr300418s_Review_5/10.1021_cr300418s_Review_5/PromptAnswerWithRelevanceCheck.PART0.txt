How does Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contribute to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts, particularly in terms of their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity, and what insights can it provide about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility, as exemplified by studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania?

[1] "In studies of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalyst for methane oxidation, Cr was substituted by Ce from 2% to 100%, and the material was characterized by Raman, XRD, and XPS. XRD suggested that a single phase solid solution was produced up to 10% substitution. Raman spectra were used to identify vibrations associated with pure phase materials and with the doped chromite."
[2] "In situ measurements of Raman spectra under reaction conditions were combined with catalyst reactivity characterizations to evaluate the effect of alkali doping on the reducibility of vanadia supported on titania. (136) It was found that reducibility of the vanadia correlates with the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group."
