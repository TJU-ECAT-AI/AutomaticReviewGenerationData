Highly dispersed gold supported on metal oxides is an active catalyst for several reactions,1 including CO oxidation at low temperatures. 2 Although it is accepted that factors, such as gold particle size, synthesis method, pretreatment conditions, and support, influence the reactivity of the supported gold catalysts, 3 the nature of the active sites and the reaction mechanism for CO oxidation are still subjects of debate. In particular, the role of the support and the oxygen supply for the catalytic reaction remain controversial. 4-9 We recently reported that the characteristics of the cerium oxide surface are extremely important in determining whether a CeO2-supported gold catalyst is active or not for CO oxidation. 10 It was found that nanocrystalline CeO2 increases the activity of gold for CO oxidation by 2 orders of magnitude with respect to a conventionally precipitated CeO2 support. In the present work, we report for the first time spectroscopic evidence that nanocrystalline CeO2 supplies reactive oxygen in the form of surface η1 superoxide species and peroxide adspecies at the one-electron defect site to the supported active species of gold for the oxidation of CO.
Nanocrystalline CeO2 was prepared from a colloidal dispersion of CeO2 nanoparticles (Supporting Information). 11 Gold on a nanoparticulated cerium oxide catalyst was prepared by deposition precipitation of HAuCl4 using NaOH following a procedure described elsewhere.10 The catalyst was not calcined. The total Au content of the final catalyst was 1.92 wt % as determined by chemical analysis. The catalyst was tested for CO oxidation. Expecting that the characteristics of the cerium oxide surface might affect the stabilization of different reactive gold and oxygen species, we characterized the gold catalysts prepared on nanocrystalline and conventionally precipitated CeO2 with CO−TPR, XPS, and in situ infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy during CO and O2 adsorption−reaction experiments.
IR spectroscopy characterizing CO adsorption on gold supported on nanocrystalline CeO2 demonstrates the presence of Au3+, Au+, and Au0 species as indicated by their characteristic Aux−CO frequency at 2148, 2130, and 2104 cm-1, respectively (Supporting Information).8,9 An additional band was observed at 2175 cm-1, which is assigned to Ce4+−CO (this band was the only one observed under our experimental conditions when CO was adsorbed on nanocrystalline CeO2). Interestingly, during CO adsorption experiments and without any oxygen in the gas stream, CO2 was formed as indicated by the band at 2350 cm-1. This result indicates that nanocrystalline CeO2 is able to supply reactive oxygen to the gold active species for the oxidation of CO, consistent with the idea of CeO2 acting as an oxygen buffer by releasing−uptaking oxygen through redox processes involving the Ce4+/Ce3+ couple. 12 In contrast, when gold was deposited on precipitated CeO2, only Au0 (band at 2110 cm-1) and a small fraction of Au+ (band at 2135 cm-1) species were detected by IR spectroscopy during CO adsorption. Furthermore, no CO2 formation was detected during CO adsorption experiments. XPS results (Supporting Information) confirm our assignments of gold oxidation states in the Au/CeO2 samples and provide evidence of the presence of Ce3+ ions on the surface of the nanocrystalline CeO2-supported gold catalyst, consistent with previous results showing Ce3+ in nanocrystalline CeO2. 13
When O2 was introduced in the IR cell containing a sample of gold supported on nanocrystalline CeO2 that had been pretreated with CO, the intensity of the IR bands at 2148 and 2130 cm-1 decreased at a faster rate than that of the intensity of the band at 2104 cm-1 (Supporting Information), suggesting that although both cationic and metallic gold participate in the oxidation of CO, the catalytic active sites incorporate cationic gold, consistent with previous reports of the enhanced catalytic activity of cationic gold for CO oxidation and water−gas shift reactions. 14,15 Furthermore, the results presented in Figure 1 clearly show a direct correlation between the concentration of Au3+ species and catalytic activity. No correlation was found between catalytic activity and the concentration of Au+ or Au0 (Supporting Information).
Figure 1 Correlation between Au3+ and Au0 species and specific rate for CO oxidation catalyzed by gold supported on nanocrystalline CeO2. Infrared band frequency and intensity of CO adsorption on gold catalysts were used to identify Au3+ (band at 2148 cm-1 representing Au3+−CO) and Au0 (band at 2104 cm-1 representing Au0−CO).
Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the nature of the CeO2 support and the oxygen species formed on it. It is well established that the first-order Raman band near 464 cm-1 in CeO2-x nanoparticles, which is assigned to the vibrational mode of the F2g symmetry in a cubic fluorite lattice, shifts to lower energies, and the line shape of this feature gets broader as the particle size gets smaller. 16 Consistently, we observed this behavior when we compared the Raman spectra characterizing the conventionally precipitated (464 cm-1) and nanocrystalline (457 cm-1) CeO2 supports (Supporting Information). In addition to the first-order band, a series of second-order bands were observed at 1174, 598, 422, 258, and 170 cm-1 (Supporting Information).
Because of the differences in crystallite size and surface properties between precipitated and nanocrystalline CeO2, we thought that the oxygen species formed on them might be different, as well. Indeed, the Raman spectrum characterizing O2 adsorption on conventionally prepared CeO2 shows bands at 1314, 1361, 1408, 1428, 1470, 1527, and 1571 cm-1, whereas the spectrum characterizing O2 adsorption on nanocrystalline CeO2 shows bands at 1123, 964, 871, and 831 cm-1 (Supporting Information). The band at 1571 cm-1 is assigned to adsorption of molecular O2, and the bands above 1300 cm-1 may be assigned to O2δ- (0 < δ < 1) adspecies. 17,18 The band at 1123 cm-1 is assigned to η1 superoxide species. 19,20 In the peroxide range, the band at 964 cm-1 is assigned to peroxide adspecies at the one-electron defect site, whereas the bands at 871 and 831 cm-1 may be attributed to nonplanar bridging peroxide species and to the η2 peroxide species, respectively.17-20 These results indicate that nanocrystalline CeO2 stabilizes O2 as superoxide and peroxide species, whereas the conventionally precipitated CeO2 tends to stabilize O2δ- (0 < δ < 1) adspecies and molecular O2. This might explain the enhanced reactivity of gold supported on nanocrystalline CeO2 in comparison with that prepared with conventionally precipitated CeO2.
To investigate the reactivity of the oxygen species observed on the highly active gold catalyst, a sample of gold supported on nanocrystalline CeO2 was placed in contact with a flow of O2 and was followed by CO + O2 under reaction conditions. The Raman spectra characterizing the sample at the beginning and at the end of the CO oxidation are shown in Figure 2. The fresh catalyst shows Raman bands at 1123, 966, 870, and 831 cm-1, which are assigned as before to η1 superoxide species, peroxide adspecies at the one-electron defect site, nonplanar bridging peroxide species, and η2 peroxide species, respectively.17-20 However, when the catalyst was characterized after CO oxidation, the intensity of the Raman band at 1123 cm-1 decreased and the band at 966 cm-1 disappeared, indicating the involvement of η1 superoxide species and peroxide adspecies at the one-electron defect site in the oxidation of CO. Furthermore, the results provide evidence that nonplanar bridging peroxide species, η2 peroxide species, molecular oxygen, or lattice oxygen do not participate in the direct oxidation of CO, consistent with postulated CO oxidation mechanisms.3,4,10,20 Our results infer that cationic gold is stabilized on nanoparticulated CeO2 by creating Ce3+ and oxygen vacancy sites, where peroxide species could be eventually formed for the oxidation of CO.
Figure 2 Raman spectra characterizing the 1.92 wt % Au/CeO2 sample (a) at the beginning and (b) at the end of CO oxidation reaction.
Results of CO−TPR confirm the oxidation of CO to CO2, even at room temperature, and the participation of four different surface oxygen species with different operating conditions (Supporting Information). The high-temperature oxygen species (548 °C) are associated with lattice oxygen, which do not participate in the catalytic oxidation of CO at low temperatures.15 The oxygen species with a maximum uptake at 113 and 201 °C may be attributed to surface oxygen species (superoxide and peroxide adspecies, respectively), in agreement with Raman results.15 Furthermore, cyclic TPR experiments (Supporting Information) demonstrate the regeneration of the gold active sites during reduction and oxidation of the catalyst.
In summary, the data demonstrate that both cationic and metallic gold are present in the gold catalyst prepared with nanocrystalline CeO2, and that the catalytic active sites incorporate cationic gold. Nanocrystalline CeO2 stabilizes O2 as superoxide and peroxide species, whereas the precipitated CeO2 tends to stabilize O2δ- and molecular O2. Furthermore, nanocrystalline CeO2 supplies reactive oxygen in the form of surface η1 superoxide species and peroxide adspecies at the one-electron defect site to the supported active species of gold for the oxidation of CO.

Abstract
Figure 1 Correlation between Au3+ and Au0 species and specific rate for CO oxidation catalyzed by gold supported on nanocrystalline CeO2. Infrared band frequency and intensity of CO adsorption on gold catalysts were used to identify Au3+ (band at 2148 cm-1 representing Au3+−CO) and Au0 (band at 2104 cm-1 representing Au0−CO).
