Abstract
We use density functional theory to study the chemistry of oxides doped substitutionally with cations having lower valence than that of the host. We document two rules. (1) The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant. (2) Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts strongly the effect of the dopant. We discuss how these rules affect methane activation by doped-oxide catalysts.

I Introduction
Oxides catalyze many interesting reactions but the yield or the selectivity are often too low for commercial applications. It is sensible to assume that their catalytic performance might be improved if some of the cations in their surface layer are replaced with cations of different kind (cation doping). We cite here, for illustration, a small sample of the experimental work performed along these lines. (1-44) Most often, but not always, (18, 20) the experiments have found that replacing some of oxide’s cations with other cations improved its catalytic performance.
In this article, we concentrate on the properties of those doped oxides in which the valence of the dopant is lower than that of the cation it substitutes (e.g., trivalent La replacing tetravalent Ce to form LaxCe1−xO2). We call such dopants “low valence dopants” (LVDs).
Because of its lower valence, the LVD creates an “electron deficit” in its neighborhood, which causes the oxygen atoms in the surface layer to bind more weakly to the doped oxide than to the undoped one. An oxygen atom that has a weaker bond to the surface is likely to be more reactive. Therefore, the net effect of the LVD is to make the doped oxide be a much more reactive oxidant than the undoped one. This crude argument is supported by previous DFT calculations. (45-61) Here we give more examples and postulate that the effect is general: it takes place for all oxides and for all LVDs.
If an LVD acts by creating an electron deficit, then its effect should be counteracted by adsorbing on the surface of the doped oxide an atom or a molecule that donates electrons to the surface. The DFT calculations presented here show that this crude guess works in numerous cases (we found no exception). We call this a chemical compensation effect, and discovering and documenting it is the main contribution of this article.
We characterize the reactivity of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide by four quantities: the energy ΔEv to make an oxygen vacancy in the surface; the binding energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 of a H atom or a CH3 radical to a surface oxygen atom; and the energy ΔECH4 of dissociative adsorption of methane (to form a hydroxyl and a methoxy group). In all examples that we have examined, the presence of an LVD in the surface of an oxide makes ΔEv much smaller and ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4 much larger than in the case of the undoped oxide. We postulate that this is the case for all low valence dopants of a reducible or an irreducible host oxide.
The calculations presented here also show that when a H atom or a CH3 radical are adsorbed on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD, the chemistry of the surface becomes very similar to that of the undoped oxide. In particular, the values of ΔEv, ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4 become very close to the values they have for the undoped oxide. We postulate that this is true for all electron donors adsorbed on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD.
This article is organized as follows. Section II describes the methods of computation. Section III discusses oxygen activation and chemical compensation for LaCeO2(111). Section IV presents results on the activation of the oxygen atoms in CaO(001) and La2O3(001) by doping with LVD1s and on the chemical compensation by H adsorption on these doped surfaces. Up to that point we examined dopants whose valence is smaller, by one, than that of the cation they replace in the host oxide (LVD1). Section V examines oxygen activation and its compensation in the case of a surface doped with a dopant whose valence is lower by two than the valence of the cation it replaces (LVD2), such as Na-doped La2O3. Section VI examines activation and compensation in the case of CuLa2O3, which is an example of a reducible dopant that could, in principle, be either an LVD1 or an LVD2. In section VII we point out the connection between compensation and coadsorption on oxides doped with LVDs; if one of the adsorbates is a charge donor, the interaction energy between the coadsorbed molecules is very large. A summary of the results and a discussion of their implications for catalysis by doped oxides are given in section VIII.
II Methods of Computation
It is believed (62-68) that the GGA version of DFT does not provide a good description of CeO2 and it is hoped that the DFT+U method (69) is a better alternative. The goal of the calculations presented here is to test whether the two rules proposed in the Introduction are valid. This qualitative question can be answered even if we do not use a highly accurate method of computation. It is therefore likely that the DFT+U method is satisfactory for achieving our goal. Since our conclusions depend entirely on the values of the total energy, we use LDA+U with U − J = 5.5 eV, since this reproduces the energy of the reaction Ce2O3 + 1/2O2 → 2CeO2 and gives accurate values for the lattice parameters. (64, 65) We have used this value of U previously with satisfactory results. (70) The calculations were performed with the VASP program. (71-74) The cores were represented by PAW pseudopotentials having the electron configurations [Kr4d]5s25p64f15d16s2, [Kr4d] 5s25p65d16s2, [He]2s22p4, and [He]2s22p2 for Ce, La, O, and C atoms, respectively. For all calculations involving CeO2, we used a Γ-centered 2 × 2 × 1 k-point mesh and 400 eV cut off. To calculate the properties of CeO2(111) (doped or undoped) we have used a slab having a p(3 × 3) supercell with the dimensions 11.45 Å × 11.45(× 1/2(3)1/2) Å × 22.79 Å. This consists of 9 atomic layers (3 stoichiometric layers) and a 15 Å vacuum layer in the z direction. Top and side views of the supercell for the CeO2 slab doped with La and with an adsorbed H atom are shown in Figure 1a. All calculations were performed with spin-polarized DFT. When optimizing the geometry, we held the oxygen atoms in the bottom layer fixed at the positions they would have in the bulk. The atoms in the other 8 atomic layers were allowed to relax until the force on each atom was less than 0.02 eV/Å and the energy difference between two iteration steps was less than 10−4 eV. The iterations in the total energy were considered converged when the energy difference between two iteration steps was less or equal to 10−5 eV.

The atomic configurations used for the calc4ulating the properties of the H/LaCeO2(111) surface: (a) supercell used for the calculations on the H/LaCeO2(111) surface (top view and side view); (b) H/LaCeO2(111) with an O vacancy; (c) H adsorbed on H/LaCeO2(111); (d) CH3 adsorbed on H/LaCeO2(111); (e) CH4 dissociative adsorption on H/LaCeO2(111). The arrow points to the compensating H atom.
The supercell used for calculating the properties of the La2O3(001) surface (Figure 2) has 10 atomic layers, a 15 Å vacuum region, and a 3 × 3 surface cell. Given the large size of the supercell, only the Γ-point was used. During structure optimization, all ions in the unit cell were allowed to relax and no symmetry was imposed. The optimization was stopped when the force on the atoms was smaller than 0.02 eV/Å. We used spin-polarized DFT with the rPBE functional of Hammer, Hansen, and Norskov (75) and a plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 eV. The spin-polarization of the states having the lowest energy was Ns = 0 for La2O3(001), Ns = 1 for Mg-doped La2O3(001), Ns = 2 for Na-doped La2O3(001), and Ns = 0 for Cu-doped La2O3(001). Ns is the difference between the number of electrons with spin-up and the number of electrons with spin-down. We have performed a few exploratory calculations for La2O3 with rPBE+U. We picked (49) for La the value of U = 7.5 eV for which we get the correct energy of the reaction LaCl3(s) + H2O(g) → LaOCl(s) + 2HCl(g). We found that the total energies calculated with DFT+U are qualitatively in agreement with those given by DFT; therefore, we did not use DFT+U in the calculations presented here for La2O3.

The Mg dopant replaces the La atom labeled 1, the compensating H atom is always placed on the oxygen atom labeled 2, the probe H and CH3 fragments are placed on the oxygen labeled 3, and the dissociative adsorption of CH4 creates a hydroxyl on oxygen 2 and a methoxy (O−CH3) on oxygen 3.
The slab used to describe the surface of CaO(001) (pure or doped) has three atomic layers and a 15 Å vacuum region. A few calculations with six layers gave the same results. The surface unit cell was 3 × 3 (see Figure 3). Given the large size of the unit cell, we used only the Γ-point. The functional was PBE, and the plane wave basis set had a 400-eV cutoff energy. During structure optimization, all ions in the unit cell were allowed to relax and no symmetry was imposed. The optimization stopped when the force on the atoms was smaller than 0.05 eV/Å. The spin polarization giving the lowest energy was Ns = 0, for pure CaO(001) and Ns = 1 for CaO(001) doped with Li, Na, or K.

To probe the chemical activity of the oxygen atoms on an oxide surface, we use four reactions. The first is the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface
(1)
Here “oxide” can be one of the following: a pure oxide, a doped oxide, or a H-compensated doped oxide. In the right-hand side of the equation, “reduced oxide” represents the oxide present in the left-hand side with an oxygen vacancy on its surface. The energy of this reaction is
(2)
A specific example of eq 1 is
(3)
where H/LaCeO2-δ is H/LaCeO2 having one oxygen vacancy in the surface oxygen layer of the supercell.
A second probe of the activity of the oxygen atoms is the formation of a hydroxyl on the surface of a given oxide (undoped, doped, or compensated):
(4)
Here “H/oxide” is the oxide in the left-hand side with a H atom bonded to a surface oxygen atom to form a hydroxyl. The energy of this reaction is
(5)
The third probe of the activity of the surface oxygen atoms is the adsorption of a methyl radical from the gas phase:
(6)
Here “CH3/oxide” is the oxide present in the left-hand side with a CH3 radical adsorbed on a surface oxygen atom to form a methoxide. The energy of this reaction is
(7)
The last probe of the activity of the oxygen atoms in the surface layer of a given oxide is the dissociative adsorption of methane:
(8)
where (CH3+H)/oxide is the oxide in the left-hand side with a CH3 radical bound to the surface oxygen and a H atom bound to another surface oxygen. The energy of this reaction is

III Chemical Compensation in La-Doped CeO2(111)
III.1 Chemical Compensation Effect
To test the idea of chemical compensation, we start with a study of La-doped ceria. As a descriptor of reactivity of the oxygen atoms in the surface layer we use the magnitude of ΔEv, ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4 (defined in section II). These reaction energies are calculated for clean ceria CeO2(111), for ceria doped with La (denoted by LaCeO2), and for ceria doped with La and having a hydroxyl on the surface (denoted by H/LaCeO2). The results of the calculations are shown in rows 1−3 of Table 1.

aThe following notation is used: an oxide formula (e.g. La2O3) indicates a pure oxide; MOxide (e.g. LaCeO2) indicates the oxide doped with the cation M; H/MOxide (e.g. H/MgLa2O3) indicates an oxide doped with M and having a H atom on it bound to an oxygen atom. ΔEv is the energy to make 1/2O2(g) and an oxygen vacancy in the surface layer; ΔEH is the energy of forming a hydroxyl on the surface by adsorbing 1/2H2(g); ΔECH3 is the energy of binding CH3(g) to an oxygen atom on the surface; ΔECH4 is the energy to dissociate CH4(g) into a hydroxyl and a methoxy group on the surface. LaCeO2(111) + e is ceria doped with La and having an additional electron (the supercell is a negative ion). For example, the energy to bind CH3 to an oxygen atom on the surface of ceria doped with La having a hydroxyl on it is −2.91 eV (row 2, fifth column). All energies are in electronvolts. A negative value means that the reaction produces energy (exoergic process). Bold face is used to highlight the compensation; the results on CeO2(111) are close to those on H/LaCeO2(111).
For example, examination of the energy of making a surface oxygen vacancy in the top oxygen layer of CeO2(111) (row 1, column 3 of Table 1) is 3.00 eV. The energy of making an oxygen vacancy on LaCeO2(111), at the position shown in Figure 1b (ignore the H atom present in that figure), is 1.36 eV (row 3, column 3 of Table 1). It is much easier to make an oxygen vacancy on the surface of the doped oxide than on the surface of the pure oxide. This illustrates the first rule: the presence of the LVD makes the surface a better oxidant.
If we add a H atom on the surface of LaCeO2(111), to make H/LaCeO2(111), the energy ΔEv to make an oxygen vacancy changes from 1.36 eV (for LaCeO2(111)) to 2.99 eV (for H/LaCeO2(111)). The positions of the H atom, of the La dopant, and of the O-vacancy are shown in Figure 1b. CeO2 and H/LaCeO2 bind the surface oxygen atom much more strongly than does LaCeO2(111); the energy to make an oxygen vacancy on H/LaCeO2 is almost equal to the energy to make it on CeO2. The effect of the dopant is strongly counteracted by the addition of an H atom on the surface, in agreement with the prediction made by the chemical compensation rule formulated in the Introduction.
By examining Table 1, one can see that, in agreement with the first rule, ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4 are much more exoergic for LaCeO2 than for CeO2. Also, in agreement with the chemical compensation rule, the reactions are much less exoergic on H/LaCeO2 than on LaCeO2.
The guiding idea in formulating the chemical compensation rule was that La creates a deficit of electrons and the adsorption of H compensates the deficit. This compensation diminishes the effect of La dopant on the chemistry of the surface. If this is true, then the effect of adding an extra electron to LaCeO2(111) should be similar to that of adsorbing a H atom to form H/LaCeO2(111). In row 4 of Table 1, we show the values of ΔEv, ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4 for LaCeO2(111) with an extra electron in it (this system is denoted by LaCeO2 + e). In the calculation of these quantities, we have used a charge-compensating, uniform, positive background, as implemented in the VASP program, to remove the Coulomb interaction between the periodic images of the extra electron. The chemical compensation effect occurs in this case also: the values of ΔEv, ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4 for LaCeO2 + e are much closer to those for CeO2(111) than to those for LaCeO2(111).
III.2 Compensation Effect Independent of the H−La Distance and Affects All Oxygen Atoms
Previous work (45-52) examined the effect of the dopant on the oxygen atoms in its neighborhood because chemical intuition suggests that the presence of the dopant disrupts bonding locally. The calculations described below show that the dopant affects all oxygen atoms in the supercell.
To determine whether the effect of the dopant is local or long-ranged, we calculated ΔEv for making one oxygen vacancy on the surface of LaCeO2(111), at site 1, site 4, or site 7 (the sites are defined in Figure 4a). These vacancies are located at different distances from the dopant. We find that ΔEv for LaCeO2(111) is 1.36 eV when we remove atom 1, 1.46 eV when we remove atom 4, and 1.50 eV when we remove atom 7. These values are close to each other and all are substantially smaller than the value of ΔEv for a pure ceria surface (3.00 eV, Table 1). As far as the formation of an oxygen vacancy is concerned, the dopant strongly, and almost equally, affects all oxygen atoms in the supercell. The same is true for the energy ΔEH for chemisorbing a hydrogen atom on LaCeO2(111). We find that ΔEH is −2.92 eV when H is chemisorbed on the oxygen atom 1, −2.92 eV when H is on atom 4, and −2.83 eV when H is on atom 7; contrast this with −1.24 eV, which is the binding energy of H to undoped ceria (Table 1).
Figure 4
Figure 4. (a) La/CeO2(111) surface with labels on the oxygen atoms; (b) the labels of the oxygen atoms for the La/CeO2(111) surface on which CH4 is dissociated. Ce atoms are gray, O atoms in the top surface layer are magenta, O atoms in the second layer are orange, C atom is dark green, H atoms are white, La atoms are blue.
Next, we ask whether the compensation effect takes place only when the compensating H atom is chemisorbed on an oxygen atom in the neighborhood of the dopant (i.e., 1, 2, or 3 in Figure 2a), or does it also occur when the compensating H atom is chemisorbed farther away? The results in Table 2 show that ΔE2H, the energy for creating an additional hydroxyl on H/LaCeO2(111), is practically independent of the positions of the two H atoms. The notation ΔE2H is used only in this section: it is the energy ΔEH for making a hydroxyl on H/LaCeO2. In the table we use the symbol (i,j) to specify the positions of the oxygen atoms to which the two H atoms are bonded on the surface of LaCeO2. The labels i and j are defined in Figure 2a. The columns 2−6 of Table 2 give ΔE2H for the case when one H atom (the one in H/LaCeO2) is chemisorbed on the oxygen atom i = 1 and the second hydrogen is placed on the oxygen atoms j = 2, 4, 5, 8, 7. ΔE2H varies between −1.12 and −1.26 eV when we change the location of the second H atom. Small variations are also observed when the compensating H atom is on site 4 and the second H atom is bound on site 5, 9, or 7. The values of the binding energies in Table 2 are much smaller than the value of −2.92 eV when H binds to LaCeO2. As far as H adsorption is concerned, the compensation effect works no matter where the compensating and the probe H atoms are located.

ΔE2H −1.20 −1.12 −1.22 −1.16 −1.26 −1.10 −1.29 −1.05 −1.23
aThe positions of the two H atoms in 2H/LaCeO2(111) are specified by the symbol (i, j) which indicates the oxygen atom to which the two H atoms bind (see Figure 1b).
In summary, we conclude that, in the case of La-doped ceria, doping with La affects all surface oxygen atoms in the supercell and adsorbing a H atom compensates the effect of La on all oxygen atoms. Moreover, this compensation takes place regardless of the site on which the compensating H is adsorbed.
Given the unexpected nature of these results, it seemed prudent to test whether they hold when we probe the surface with the dissociative adsorption of methane. In Table 3 we show the energies ΔECH4 of the reaction CH4(g) + H/LaCeO2(111) → (CH3 + H)H/LaCeO2(111), where the latter symbol indicates that methane is dissociated (to form a methoxy group and a hydroxyl) on the compensated H/LaCeO2(111) surface. The positions of the hydroxyl and the methoxy group are shown in Figure 4b, which also indicates the labels used to describe various positions of the compensating H atom. In all calculations, the methoxy radical and the hydroxyl formed by methane dissociation were kept on the positions shown in Figure 4b. It is striking how little ΔECH4 changes with the position of the compensating H atom (see Table 3).

aThe labeling of these positions is defined in Figure 4b, which also shows the location of the H and CH3 formed by CH4 dissociation.
The fact that the La dopant affects all O atoms on the surface suggests that the “electron deficit” created by doping is delocalized over all the oxygen atoms in the supercell. This is confirmed by our calculations of the projected density of states (PDOS). We do not show the plots because the only thing of interest about them can be easily explained in words. We find that LaCeO2(111) has a partially occupied, delocalized orbital at the top of the valence band. This “hole” consists mostly of atomic orbitals located on the oxygen atoms, and it is fully occupied in both CeO2(111) and H/LaCeO2(111). This is why the dopant affects all oxygen atoms in the supercell.
Except for some low-energy states (below the valence band) associated with the adsorbed H atom, the PDOS of H/LaCeO2(111) is practically identical to that of undoped ceria and to that of e + LaCeO2; in particular, the hole present in LaCeO2 is filled in all three compounds. This explains why the chemistry of the oxygen atoms on the surface of H/LaCeO2 or LaCeO2 + e is very similar to that of the oxygen atoms on pure ceria and differs substantially from the chemistry of the oxygen atoms of LaCeO2. It also explains why all oxygen atoms in the surface of the supercell are affected equally by these modifications (i.e., adsorbing a H atom or adding an electron) of ceria.
We have explained that the long-range effect of the dopant or of the compensating H atom occurs because a delocalized orbital, involving the atomic orbitals of the surface oxygen atoms, is filled or empty. It is often suspected that in GGA-DFT the delocalization of an orbital is caused by the self-interaction error. The DFT+U method was introduced to cure such delocalization. Usually this U correction is used for the cations in transition metal or alkaline earth oxides, whose d or f orbitals are delocalized when they should not be. Yeriskin and Nolan (57) proposed that a U correction should also be used for the p-orbitals of oxygen atoms in La-doped ceria. We have no opinion whether such a correction is warranted or not. However, we wanted to know whether using U for the oxygen atoms may suppress the delocalization of the orbital at the top of the valence band, thus invalidating our explanation for the long-range effect of the dopant. To see whether this is the case, we recalculated the binding energy of H to oxygen atoms in LaCeO2(111), located at various distances from the dopant, by using LDA+U with U for Ce and LDA+U with U for Ce and O. For oxygen we used the value U = 7 eV recommended Yeriskin and Nolan. (57) The results are shown in Table 4. In all calculations, the La dopant affects almost equally the reactivity (as measured by H adsorption) of all O atoms in the supercell. Using U = 7 eV for oxygen does not affect the delocalized orbital used in our explanation.

aThe labels in the first column indicate the oxygen atom on which H is adsorbed and are defined in Figure 2a. We show ΔEH obtained with LDA (second column), with LDA+U when we use U only for the Ce atom (third column), and with LDA with U for Ce and for O. Regardless of the method of computation, the La dopant strongly affects the reactivity of all oxygen atoms in the supercell.
In Figure 5, we show the effect of compensation on the electron charges in the system. Most often, the charges are calculated for individual atoms, by using Bader’s definition. (76, 77) Here we calculate the total Bader charge of the valence electrons (the core electrons are not included) for groups of atoms. The first group consists of the La dopant, seven oxygen atoms surrounding the dopant, and a compensating H atom (these are atoms of the H/LaCeO2(111) system). The total Bader charge on this group is 59.87 electron. The second group contains a Ce atom and the seven oxygen atoms next to it, and this is part of the pure ceria slab. Its Bader charge is 59.89 electron. Thus, there is a complete similarity between the charge in H/LaCeO2 and in CeO2 suggesting, again, that these two system should behave similarly.

IV Activation by LVD1 Dopants and Chemical Compensation in CaO(001) Doped with Li, Na, or K and of La2O3(001) Doped with Mg
The next question we address is whether the two rules proposed here (the activation of the oxygen by LVD1 and the compensation by H or CH3) are peculiar to lanthanum-doped ceria or take place on other doped oxides. To answer this question we have examined whether these rules hold for La2O3(001) doped with Mg and for CaO(001) doped with Li, Na, or K. We chose these two oxides because, unlike ceria, they are irreducible. The dopants considered in this section are LVD1s, just like La in ceria. La2O3 and CaO, pure or doped with alkali, are of interest because, among others, they catalyze methane activation. (78-83)
As in the case of ceria, we compensate the effect of the dopant by adsorbing a H atom to form a hydroxyl. Adsorbing CH3 has practically the same effect. To document the compensation effect, we study the chemical properties of the pure oxide (denoted La2O3 or CaO), the doped oxide (denoted by MLa2O3 or MCaO, where M is the dopant), and the doped oxide with a hydroxyl on it (denoted by H/MLa2O3 or H/MCaO). The chemical properties of these surfaces are probed by calculating the energies ΔEv, ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4. The results are given in rows 5−16 of Table 1. We use bold font for the reaction energies for the pure and the compensated doped oxide to highlight their similarity. The table shows that, as we have conjectured, the presence of the LVD1 makes the oxygen atoms on the surface of the doped oxide much more active: on the doped oxide it is easier to make oxygen vacancies and H, CH3, and CH4 bind more strongly than on the undoped one.
The chemical compensation rule says that by placing on the surface a compensating H atom (or any other charge donor), we make the probe energies shift away from the value they have on the doped oxide and get closer to the values obtained for the undoped oxide. This means that in any group of three rows referring to the same oxide, in Table 1, the bold font values in the second row should be much closer to the bold font values in the first row and be different from the italic font values in the third row. This is true for all the systems in the table.
Here is an example of what the numbers in Table 1 tell us. To make an oxygen vacancy on La2O3(001) costs 6.44 eV (row 5, column 3). To make an oxygen vacancy on Mg-doped La2O3(001), we need to spend only 2.59 eV (row 7, column 3). As anticipated by our rule, Mg (which is an LVD1) activates the oxygen atom very substantially. If we place a hydroxyl on oxygen atom 1, to create a compensated MgLa2O3(001) surface, we must provide 5.33 eV to make an oxygen vacancy. To make this vacancy, we must provide 5.33 eV. As conjectured by the chemical compensation rule, ΔEv for the compensated surface (H/MgLa2O3) is much closer to the value for the pure lanthana than to the value for Mg-doped lanthana. The same behavior is observed for ΔEv, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4.
Positive binding energies (such as ΔEH = 1.53 eV) have been sometimes reported in the literature without comment. To clarify the nature of such a state we pulled the H atom away from the surface, and found that the energy goes up. Therefore, this is a bound state, which is metastable with respect to the oxide and 1/2 H2 in the gas. We did not check whether this is true for the other cases in which the adsorption energy is positive, since this has no bearing on the rules proposed here.
V Activation by an LVD2 and Chemical Compensation
This article is primarily concerned with oxygen activation by an LVD1 and chemical compensation by charge donors (H or CH3 in particular). Nevertheless, we explore briefly how these rules work for an LVD2. To this end, we examined La2O3 doped with Na, and the results are shown in Table 5. In all cases, doping with Na (our representative for LVD2) activates a surface oxygen atom next to the dopant, as evidenced by a substantial decrease in ΔEv and an increase in ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4, as compared to the undoped La2O3 (see rows 4 and 6 of Table 5). For example, ΔEv for NaLa2O3(001) is −0.03 eV, compared to 6.44 eV for undoped La2O3(001).

aThe values for MgLa2O3 are taken from Table 1. The numbers in bold font are used to point out the similarity between H/NaLa2O3 and MgLa2O3.
We expected, perhaps naively, that an LVD2 would activate the oxygen more than an LVD1. To see to what extent this is true we compare the energies of the probe reactions on NaLa2O3 (row 6 in Table 5) to those on MgLa2O3 (row 7 in Table 5). From the values of these energies, the oxygen atoms on NaLa2O3 are more active than those on MgLa2O3. However, the effect of changing the dopant from Mg to Na is not uniform. ΔEv changes from 2.59 eV for MgLa2O3 to −0.03 eV for NaLa2O3; ΔECH4 changes from 0.34 eV for MgLa2O3 to −3.70 eV for NaLa2O3. In contrast, ΔEH and ΔECH3 change very little when Mg is replaced with Na. ΔEH changes from −2.35 eV on MgLa2O3 to −2.63 eV on NaLa2O3. ΔECH3 changes from −3.26 for MgLa2O3 to −3.58 eV for NaLa2O3). Continuing the comparison of MgLa2O3 to NaLa2O3, we ask why are ΔEH and ΔECH3 almost the same on the two surfaces and why are ΔEv and ΔECH4 very different? The qualitative answer is simple. Na creates a two-electron deficit in the system being an LVD2, while Mg, which is an LVD1, creates a one-electron deficit. This means that there are two incompletely filled Kohn−Sham orbitals in the valence band of NaLa2O3 and only one in MgLa2O3. Upon adsorption, H or CH3 donate one electron to the system, filling one of these orbitals, and the effect on the reaction energy is roughly the same on NaLa2O3 and MgLa2O3. In contrast, making an oxygen vacancy or adsorbing methane dissociatively provides the surface with two electrons. On NaLa2O3, both electrons can go at the top of the valence band into the two “holes” created by the dopant. On MgLa2O3 there is only one “hole” and the second electron cannot go into the valence band and will have to populate an orbital having higher energy. This explains qualitatively why making an oxygen vacancy requires more energy on MgLa2O3 than on NaLa2O3 and why the fragments made by the dissociative adsorption of methane bind more strongly to NaLa2O3 than to MgLa2O3. NaLa2O3 can easily accommodate the two electrons supplied by these reactions but MgLa2O3 cannot.
We examine next the compensation effect of adsorbing H on NaLa2O3. A comparison of the numbers in columns 5 and 6 of Table 5 shows that the compensation effect is present, but it is uneven. It is pronounced for the vacancy formation energy ΔEv (which changes from −0.03 eV on the doped oxide to 2.62 eV on the compensated one) and for the energy of methane dissociation ΔECH4 (which changes from −3.70 eV on the doped oxide to 0.28 eV on the compensated one). On the other hand the compensation is minor for the adsorption energy of H (ΔEH is −2.63 eV on the doped oxide and −2.45 eV on the compensated one) and that of CH3 (ΔECH3 is −3.58 eV on the doped oxide and −3.42 eV on the compensated one). This behavior is explained by our crude, hole-counting model. Doping with Mg creates one “hole” while doping with Na creates two. When H is adsorbed on NaLa2O3, it donates an electron and therefore H/NaLa2O3 has one hole left; H/NaLa2O3 is not fully compensated. The presence of the compensating H atom does not much affect the adsorption of H or that of CH3 because these adsorbates donate one electron, which is accommodated by the remaining hole in NaLa2O3. In contrast, forming an oxygen vacancy or dissociating CH4 provides the surface with two electrons. One can be accommodated by the existing hole in H/NaLa2O3 but the other one is not and it has to go into an empty high energy orbital. This causes a substantial increase of ΔEv and ΔECH4 when adsorbed on H/NaLa2O3 as compared to adsorption on NaLa2O3.
The same crude, qualitative model based on formal charge transfer to the surface explains another unexpected regularity in the values presented in Table 5. The energies of all four probe reactions on MgLa2O3 are very close to those on H/NaLa2O3 (see the rows in bold font in Table 5). Formally, a Na dopant in La2O3 creates a deficit of two electrons and adsorbing H on the surface restores one of them. Therefore, H/NaLa2O3 has one hole, just as MgLa2O3 does. Because of this, H/NaLa2O3 is very similar to MgLa2O3; both have a one-electron deficit and have similar surface chemistry. We believe that the remarkable closeness of the reaction energies for H/NaLa2O3 and MgLa2O3 is accidental. We do not expect the same closeness for ZnLa2O3 or CaLa2O3 but we do expect the same trend: the energies of the probe reactions on H/NaLa2O3 are much closer to those of MLa2O3 (where M is an irreducible divalent cation) than to those on NaLa2O3.
VI Activation and Compensation on La2O3 with a Reducible Dopant
We have discussed so far the effect of doping La2O3 by replacing a trivalent La atom with a divalent or a monovalent dopant. What happens if the dopant is a reducible atom, which can be either monovalent or divalent? Will it behave like an LVD1, an LVD2, or something in between? We looked at lanthana doped with Cu, and the results are shown in Table 5, rows 1−3. The results make it clear that the effect of the Cu dopant is between that of Na and that of Mg. For example, ΔEv for CuLa2O3 is 0.52 eV (row 3, Table 4), for MgLa2O3 is 2.59 eV (row 7, Table 4), and for NaLa2O3 is −0.03 eV (row 6, Table 4). If we look at ΔECH4 we find 0.34 eV for MgLa2O3, −1.96 eV for CuLa2O3, and −3.70 eV for NaLa2O3.
The compensation effect is present when we adsorb H on CuLa2O3, and it is easy to see that the values of the energies of the probe reactions on the compensated CuLa2O3 surface fall between those of H/NaLa2O3 and H/MgLa2O3. H is better able to compensate the effect of a Cu dopant than that of a Na dopant but less able to compensate the effect of a Cu dopant than that of a Mg dopant.
VII Compensation Effect and Coadsorption
It is tempting to simplify a computational study of a catalytic process by calculating the binding energy of each reactant, intermediate, and product molecule alone on the surface and assuming that these binding energies do not change much when the molecules are coadsorbed. This approach has worked fairly well for metal surfaces where, because of screening, the interaction between adsorbates tends to be small. We have found that this procedure may fail dramatically for adsorption on oxides. For example, the presence of a charge-donating species on a TiO2(110) surface changes very substantially the adsorption energy of a Au atom or an O2 molecule. (84) This change does not occur because the charge donor occupies the site favored by Au or O2 and forces them to bind elsewhere. The binding energy of Au or O2 changes, in the presence of a charge donor, because the donated electron ends up in an orbital composed mainly of the atomic orbitals of the five-coordinated Ti atoms. The presence of this orbital facilitates the bonding of the electrophilic O2 or Au at the five-coordinated Ti sites. (84)
The compensation effect leads to a similar coadsorption behavior. Let us look, for illustration, at the dissociative adsorption of CH4 on LaCeO2. We can think of this as being the result of the following succession of reactions:
Here (g) indicates a gas-phase species and (s) an adsorbed species. Let us use these successive reactions to examine the dissociative adsorption of methane on LaCeO2. The DFT value for ΔE1 is 2.90 eV. The energies for adsorbing H or CH3 separately (we have two unconnected surfaces and adsorb H on one and CH3 on the other), on LaCeO2(111), are −2.92 and −4.65 eV, respectively (see Table 1). If there were no interactions between H and CH3 (i.e., they are adsorbed on two disconnected LaCeO2 surfaces), the energy of dissociative adsorption of CH4 would be 2.90 − 2.92 − 4.56 = −4.58 eV. However, the energy for dissociative adsorption of CH4, calculated by allowing the fragments to coexist on the surface of the supercell, is ΔECH4 = −2.93 eV. The energy of the dissociative adsorption with the fragments in the same supercell is lower by 1.65 eV than the energy of dissociating CH4 and placing the fragments on two different LaCeO2 surfaces. There is a strong “repulsion” between the coadsorbates, which destabilizes the final state of the dissociative adsorption. This large difference appears because when we adsorb H on the doped surface, we compensate the effect of the dopant, and the adsorption energy of CH3 (on the H/LaCeO2 surface) is altered: it changes from −4.56 to −2.91 eV (see Table 1).
This “repulsion” between the fragments of CH4 dissociation is very small on undoped ceria. From Table 1 we see that the binding energy of H (alone on the surface) is −1.24 eV and that of CH3 (alone on the surface) is −2.71 eV. The energy to dissociate CH4 and bind the fragments on two separate, undoped ceria surfaces is 2.90 − 1.24 − 2.71 = −1.05 eV. The energy of dissociating CH4 and placing the fragments on the same supercell of undoped ceria is −1.31 eV. The change in the dissociative adsorption energy, when the fragments are allowed to interact, is much smaller than on LaCeO2. The difference in behavior is caused by the compensation effect, which allows H adsorption to substantially alter the properties of the doped ceria but not those of undoped ceria.
This behavior is not peculiar to LaCeO2; we see the same behavior for MgLa2O3. The dissociation energy of CH4 to produce separated fragments is 2.90 − 2.35 − 3.26 = −2.71 eV (the numbers from Table 5). The dissociation energy of CH4 with both fragments placed in the same supercell is 0.34 eV.
All systems examined here behave similarly. We generalize these results as follows: if dissociative adsorption takes place on a surface doped with an LVD1, and if one of the fragments is an electron donor, the compensation effect will make the dissociation energy much smaller than the value expected by assuming that the fragments do not interact with each other. The fragments behave as if they repel each other strongly.
VIII Summary
The goal of these calculations is to document several aspects of the chemistry of oxides doped substitutionally with dopants whose valence is lower by one than the valence of the cation they substitute (LVD1). First, we extrapolate numerous computations (by us and by others) and propose that all LVD1 dopants substantially activate the oxygen atoms at the surface of any doped oxide. To probe the change in oxygen activity caused by the dopant, we used the energy ΔEv of making an oxygen vacancy, the energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 to bind a H atom or a CH3 radical to an oxygen atom in the surface layer, and the energy ΔECH4 of the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide. On an oxide doped with an LVD, it is much easier (than on the undoped oxide) to remove an oxygen atom from the surface to form 1/2 O2 in the gas phase and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. Furthermore, H and CH3 bind much more strongly to an oxide doped with an LVD than on the undoped oxide. Finally, the energy produced by the dissociative adsorption of methane on an oxide doped with an LVD (to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide) is much larger than on the undoped oxide. All of these are indications that an LVD activates the surface oxygen atoms.
Second, we extrapolate the present calculations to postulate that the adsorption of an electron donor (H or CH3, in the examples given here) on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD1 counteracts the effect of the dopant. We call this a chemical compensation effect.
The reason for this chemical compensation effect can be understood as follows: having a lower valence than the cation it substitutes, an LVD creates a deficit of electrons in the surface. The oxygen atoms, which are very electrophilic, no longer bind as strongly to the doped surface and are therefore more inclined to react with adsorbates. Adsorbing an electron donor on the doped oxide heals (in full or in part) the electron deficit, increasing the strength of the oxygen bond to the oxide and making it less reactive. This crude picture is reinforced by the analysis of the partial density of states for all the systems studied here. The presence of an LVD on the surface produces a partially filled orbital in the valence band and the adsorption of a compensating electron donor fills this orbital, making the density of states of the compensated surface very similar to that of the undoped oxide. In the case of LaCeO2 the molecular orbital in question is delocalized and consists mainly of oxygen atomic orbitals. This is why doping with La equally affects the reactivity of all oxygen atoms in the supercell used for calculations. We are tempted to think that all LVDs have the ability to induce long-range modifications in the chemistry of the oxygen atoms on the surface, but we have not performed calculations that would back up this guess.
We conclude this section by discussing the implications that our findings have for catalysis by oxides doped with LVD1s. The compensation effect proposed here introduces interesting complications in those reactions, catalyzed by an oxide doped with an LVD1, that involve the formation of electron-donating adsorbates (e.g., hydroxyls or organic radicals). Consider, for example, the activation of methane by an oxide catalyst doped with an LVD1. The presence of the LVD1 substantially increases the energy gained by the dissociative adsorption of methane. Assuming that the Evans−Polanyi rules work for this case, this will lower the activation energy for breaking the C−H bond and oxides doped with LVD1 should be better catalysts for methane activation than the undoped oxides. However, the dissociation produces H and CH3 bonded to the oxygen atoms of the surface, which act as compensating agents. If these two species are not removed promptly from the surface, their presence substantially lower the activity of the surface (by the chemical compensation effect) and they poison the catalyst. We may have a situation where the rate-limiting step is not the breaking of the C−H bond but the removal of H and CH3 from the surface.
