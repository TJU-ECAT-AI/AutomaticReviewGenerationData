1.The provided literature does not contain information about Raman spectroscopy or its application in the characterization of doped catalysts. Therefore, I cannot extract relevant quotes to answer the question about how Raman spectroscopy contributes to the understanding of doped catalysts, their composition, structure, in situ behavior, reactivity, or the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility.
