CO2 methanation on Ru-doped ceria Sudhanshu Sharma b, Zhenpeng Hu a, Peng Zhang b, Eric W.

Ce0.96Ru0.04O2 and Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 perform best, converting 55% of CO2 with a 99% selectivity for methane, at a temperature of 450 C. This is comparable to the best catalysts found previously for this reaction. Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 was characterized by XRD, electron microscopy, BET, XPS, IR spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reaction with Ar, H2, CO, and CO2 + H2. Steady-state methanation was studied at several temperatures between 100 and 500 C. We find that the methanation reaction takes place on the reduced Ce0.95Ru0.05O2, and the role of the dopant is to make the reduction possible at lower temperature than on pure ceria. We discuss the potential for local and global effects of the dopant on catalytic chemistry. 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1. Introduction
The conversion of CO2 to methane (CO2 + 4H2 ? CH4 + 2H2O) transforms a molecule (hydrogen) that is difficult to store and transport into a molecule (methane) that is relatively easy to store and can be transported in millions of miles of existing natural-gas pipelines. Because most hydrogen today is produced from fossil hydrocarbons, its conversion to methane is not a sensible idea un- less an inexpensive and renewable source of hydrogen is found (e.g. biomass or water). The hydrogenation of CO2 is scientifically interesting for what it might teach us about activating CO2, which is a topic of great current interest [140]. Sabatier and Senderens [41] seem to be the first to have produced methane from CO2 and H2, using Ni or Co catalysts.
In this article, we investigate CO2 methanation by catalysts con- sisting of CeO2 doped with Ni, or Co, or Pd, or Ru. Among these, the Ru-doped ceria is most active and selective, and therefore we have studied its properties in detail. The doped oxides are prepared by a combustion method, which has been used extensively in Hegdes group [42], and which tends to produce oxides in which the dopant atoms substitute the cations in the host oxide (in the case of Ru- doped CeO2, we assume that Ru atoms substitute Ce atoms in CeO2). In what follows we denote these catalysts by Ce1xRuxO2.
It is difficult to provide a convincing proof that a doped oxide has been prepared and even more difficult to show that the Ru dopant is in the surface layer where it would influence most effec- tively the catalytic activity of the oxide. One way of increasing the confidence that a doped oxide has been prepared is to show that we have not prepared one of the possible alternatives: small metal- lic Ru clusters supported on ceria or small Ru oxide clusters sup- ported on ceria.
It is conceivable that during the preparation by combustion and subsequent treatment, the Ru dopant segregates to form very small Ru metal clusters supported on the ceria. If this were the case, the Ru clusters would be visible in electron microscopy and the XPS spectrum would be that of metallic Ru, neither of which is ob- served. Furthermore, if Ru atoms segregate to make metal clusters,the catalytic chemistry of the system would be that of Ru sup- ported on ceria, a system that has been extensively studied [27,2934,3640,43]. However, because the methanation activity of the metallic Ru depends on the support, on the method of prep- aration, and (possibly) on the size of the Ru clusters, we prepared our own Ru supported on ceria to have the same amount of Ru as the doped oxide prepared by combustion. We refer to this material as (5%Ru)CeO2. We show that the catalytic activity of (5%Ru)CeO2 is different from that of Ce1xRuxO2, which indicates that the mate- rial we call Ce1xRuxO2 does not consist of supported metallic Ru.
In addition, if the presumed doped oxide consists of metallic Ru clusters, the IR spectrum of the surface exposed to CO would have absorption peaks typical of CO adsorbed on Ru, and we do not ob- serve this. 0021-9517/$ - see front matter  2010 Elsevier Inc.

Journal of Catalysis 278 (2011) 297309 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Journal of Catalysis journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/jcat It is possible that during the preparation by the combustion method, the Ru atoms form very small clusters of ruthenium oxide supported on ceria. However, if the as-prepared catalyst consisted of ruthenium oxide clusters supported on ceria, then after some exposure to H2 and CO2, the RuO2 cluster would be reduced and the catalytic activity of the material would be that of the supported Ru metal cluster. We do not observe such behavior.
Another argument supporting the assumption that we have prepared Ce1xRuxO2 comes from the XRD measurements, which show that the material made by the combustion method has the fluorite structure of ceria, with a slight change in the lattice con- stant. This is a hallmark of a solid solution (i.e. substitutional doping).
All in all, the work presented here provides circumstantial evi- dence that the catalyst prepared by combustion is ceria doped with Ru. DFT calculations, together with the fact that ionic Ru is ob- served in the XPS spectrum, tell us that many of the Ru ions substi- tute Ce atoms in the surface layer or the layer below.
This article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the prep- aration of the catalysts. The method used for the DFT calculations is explained in Section 3. Section 4 describes the catalytic activity, for CO2 methanation, of Ce1xRuxO2 and of (5%Ru)CeO2. TPR measure- ments show that Ru-doped ceria has higher CO2 conversion and higher selectivity to methane than ceria doped with Ni, or Co, or Pd, or than (5%Ru)CeO2. Because of this, we dedicate the remainder of the article to the study of the Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 catalyst. To deter- mine its catalytic activity at steady state, we vary the temperature linearly to a certain value and maintain it until steady state is reached. Then, we perform another linear increase to a higher tem- perature and maintain it constant until steady state is reached, etc.
We call this procedure the staircase temperature-programmed reaction (STPR). Section 5 presents results of TPR performed with Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 exposed to Ar, H2, or CO to determine the thermal stability of the doped oxide and its reducibility. Section 6 presents IR spectra of the catalyst surface during the reaction. These spectra show that Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 is quickly contaminated by the trace CO2 always present in Ar or H2, which forms surface carbonates that are unstable at temperatures above 300 C. We were unable to deter- mine whether the hydroxyls and the carbonates are reaction inter- mediates or spectators. Section 7 shows that Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 does not catalyze CO hydrogenation, which differentiates it from other methanation catalysts, which first reduce CO2 to CO, and then un- dergo a FischerTropsch conversion to hydrocarbons [8]. Section 8 summarizes our findings and discusses some of their implications.
We suggest that the CO2 methanation takes place on the reduced Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 surface and that the role of the Ru dopant is to facil- itate this reduction. We also speculate that a dopant can affect sur- face chemistry in two ways: locally, by modifying the chemical bonds of the oxygen atoms in the neighborhood of the dopant and globally, by changing the Fermi level of the system.
2. Catalyst preparation
The Ce1xRuxO2 catalyst was synthesized by using the combus- tion method [42]. In a typical preparation, 2.5 g of ceric ammonium nitrate, 49.78 mg of RuCl3, and 1.25 g of oxalic dihydrazide are dissolved in distilled water. The aqueous mixture is placed in a Fig. 1.

furnace and heated to 550 C until combustion occurs spontane- ously, giving the final Ce0.95 Ru0.05O2, product. The (5%Ru)CeO2 cat- alyst was prepared by reducing an aqueous solution of RuCl3 in contact with CeO2 powder with hydrazine hydrate. To make 1.3 g of (5%Ru)CeO2, 36.22 mg of RuCl3 is dissolved in distilled water.
CeO2 powder is then mixed into this solution, to make slurry, to which we add slowly, drop by drop, a 40% hydrazine hydrate solu- tion. This mixture is continuously stirred during the reduction. The product is repeatedly washed, first with water and then with alco- hol. Finally, the catalyst is dried in a hot air oven for 10 h at 80 C.
Ceria doped with Pd, Co, and Ni was also synthesized by the combustion method. For Pd-doped ceria, we used 2.5 g of ceric ammonium nitrate, 21.44 mg of palladium nitrate, and 1.25 g of oxalic dihydrazide (ODH). For Co-doped ceria, we used 2.5 gm of ceric ammonium nitrate, 60 mg of cobalt acetate, and 1.2 g of
ODH. For Ni-doped CeO2, we used 2.5 g of ceric ammonium nitrate,
60 mg of nickel acetate, and 1.34 g urea. These compounds were dissolved in distilled water and were combusted at 500 C to give the doped oxides.
3. Computational method
It is believed that the standard generalized gradient approxima- tion (GGA) of the density functional theory (DFT) makes errors when used to describe ceria [4447] and that the results are im- proved by using the GGA + U method [48]. As yet it is not clear how accurate this method is for calculating binding energies or activation energies. Nevertheless, at this time, this seems to be the best option available, when one needs to study systems having a large number of electrons. Because we are interested in getting good values for the total energy, we use U  J = 5.5 eV since this reproduces the energy of the reaction Ce2O3 + O2 ? 2CeO2 and gives accurate values for the lattice parameters of both oxides [47,49]. The LDA + U results are closer to experiments than those obtained with PW91 + U, and the LDA calculations are more effi- cient. For this reason, we use spin-polarized LDA + U with the implementation provided by the VASP program [5053], with
PAW
pseudopotentials having the electron configurations [Kr4d]5s25p64f15d16s2, [Kr]4d75s1, [He]2s22p4, and [He]2s22p2 for Ce, Ru, O, and C atoms, respectively. We used a slab having three CeO2 layers (9 atomic layers) with a 3  3 surface supercell shown in Section
7.
The supercell has a size of
11:45  11:45
ffiffiffi 3 p =2  22:79 Å3, contains 82 atoms, and has a vacuum layer of 15 Å. The Ru dopant replaces a Ce atom in the outermost layer of the CeO2(1 1 1) surface. A Gamma centered 2  2  1 k-point mesh and a plane-wave basis set having a 400 eV energy cutoff were used in all calculations.
During the optimization of the geometry, the oxygen atoms in the bottom layer were held fixed at the positions they would have in the bulk; the atoms in the other eight atomic layers were al- lowed to relax until the force on each atom was less than
0.02 eV/Å, and the energy difference between two self-consistent
steps was less than 104 eV. The energy optimization was stopped when the energy difference between two self-consistent steps was 105 eV.
4. Physical characterization
4.1. Electron microscopy
Images of the catalyst (Fig. 1) were obtained by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM; FEI-Technai G2 Sphera Microscope with a field emission gun 200 kV, point resolution 0.24 nm; line resolution 0.14 nm) and by high-resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM; FEI Titan 300 kV FEG TEM/STEM, point reso- lution 0.2 nm). They show characteristic lattice fringes that indi- cate that Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 is crystalline. Dark regions are also present (especially in Fig. 1b), which might indicate a phase sepa- ration of Ru or RuO2. However, the abundance of the dark region greatly exceeds what one would expect from the 5% Ru used in the preparation. Analysis of the HRTEM image in Fig. 1c indicates continuous lattice fringes with no evidence of separate phases.
The TEM image of (5% Ru)CeO2 (Fig. 1d) shows different morphol- ogy than that of Ce0.95Ru0.05O2, further evidence that the doped oxide catalyst is different from the dispersed one.
4.2. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
The XRD powder diffraction patterns were obtained between 10 and 80 (Philips XPERT MPD, Cu Ka). Gold powder was used as the internal standard for determining the peak shifts when the oxide is doped.
Both the CeO2 and Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 crystallize in the fluorite struc- ture (Fig. 2a and b, respectively). The XRD patterns in the region between 25 and 42 show no evidence of Ru metal or RuO2 in Ce0.95Ru0.05O2. This is consistent with the TEM images. Fig. 2c shows the XRD spectrum of (5%Ru)CeO2.
Further support for the fact that Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 is a solid solution of Ru in ceria is the shift in the XRD peak position for Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 compared to that for the undoped CeO2 (Fig. 2d). The lattice parameters, calculated with the Bragg equation, are 5.3826 Å and
5.3864 Å (for CeO2 and Ce0.95Ru0.05O2, respectively); the lattice
parameter increases upon doping with Ru. The ionic radii of Ru(III)

299 and Ru(IV), in a 6-coordinated octahedral environment, are 82.0 and 76.0 Å, respectively. The ionic radii of Ce(III) and Ce(IV), in an 8-coordinated site, are 128.3 and 111.0 Å, respectively. Based on the ion size alone, one would expect that the ceria lattice would shrink when Ru substitutes Ce. This is not the case here. In previ- ous work [54], it was assumed that the increase in the lattice con- stant is caused by the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ when ceria is doped with Ru. The fact that a change of the lattice parameters is ob- served indicates that a substantial fraction of the Ru dopants must be located in the bulk.
The XRD results of Ce0.98Pd0.02O2, Ce0.95Co0.05O2, and Ce0.95N- i0.05O2 are shown in Fig. 3. They all crystallize in the fluorite struc- ture. No metal dopant or dopant-oxide peaks are seen in the XRD range between 25 and 50, which suggests that doped oxides have formed.
4.3. Surface area
The BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) measurements performed at liquid N2 temperature (Micromeritics Tristar 3000 system) give a surface area of 16.19 m2/g for Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 and 13.2 m2/gm for (5%Ru)CeO2. This allows us to estimate the number of Ce atoms in the surface layer per gram of material. If we assume that all Ru atoms introduced with the precursor will be in the surface layer,they will have to replace all Ce atoms on the surface. This is very unlikely and therefore some of the Ru must be located in the bulk.
This is consistent with the XRD results that indicate that doping causes a change in the lattice parameters of the fluoride structure.
4.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
The XPS spectra were obtained with Al Ka radiation (Kratos Axis Ultra X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), and the binding energies were corrected using C(1s) at 285.0 eV. The spectrometer has a res- olution of 0.6 eV.
The Ru(3p) core level spectrum of the as-prepared Ce0.95R- u0.05O2 is shown in Fig. 4a. The Ru(3p3/2) binding energy is
463.1 eV (the Ru(3p) region is examined because Ru(3d5/2,3/2)
states overlap with C(1s)). The binding energy of Ru(3p3/2) in RuO2 is[54] 462.7 eV, which differs by 0.4 eV from the binding en- ergy of Ru(3p3/2) in Ce0.95Ru0.05O2. This difference is probably due to a difference in the environment: the Ru oxygen distance and the location of the oxygen atoms in Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 are different from those in RuO2. If we must assign a formal charge to the Ru dopant, we opt for +4 because Ru oxides with higher formal charge are unstable [55,56]. The XPS spectrum of the catalyst after the reaction is shown in Fig. 14b. No change in the Ru(3p3/2) binding energy is observed, when compared to the as-prepared catalyst.
This indicates that the state of the ionic Ru in the surface region does not change when the methanation reaction is performed. This is consistent with the fact that the catalytic performance is con- stant for 900 min. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 (c) 2θ / degree (b) Intensity Ce0.95Ni0.05O2 Ce0.95Co0.05O2 Ce0.98Pd0.02O2 (a) Fig.

The Ru(3p) core level spectrum of (5%Ru)CeO2 (Fig. 4c) shows Ru(3p3/2) binding energy at 461.8 eV, consistent with the presence of Ru metal in the impregnated catalyst [54,57,58].
Since XPS measurements are sensitive to atoms in the surface region, some of the Ru atoms must be located near the surface,while the XRD results suggest that some are in the bulk. To esti- mate how much Ru is in the surface layer, we have measured the Ru(3p) spectrum in a sample consisting of CeO2 mixed with RuO2 in the same proportion as in Ce0.95Ru0.05O2. By comparing the areas under the peaks in these two spectra, we estimate that three out of five Ru atoms are in the surface region of Ce0.95Ru0.05O2.
Calculations of the energy of a CeO2(1 1 1) slab with the Ru dop- ant in different locations give the following results: the energy when the dopant is in the second Ce layer is smaller by 0.28 eV than when the dopant is in the top layer. If the distribution of the Ru atoms reaches thermodynamic equilibrium, they will prefer to sit in the second Ce layer. The fact that there are Ru atoms in the surface region and in the bulk indicates that the mobility of the Ru atoms, during the synthesis of the doped ceria, is not high enough for these atoms to reach the equilibrium distribution. In addition,we note that given the area of the catalyst and the number of the Ru atoms used in synthesis, it is not possible for all Ru atoms to be in the subsurface layer.
The XPS spectrum of Ce(3d), of the as-prepared Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 (Fig. 4d), of the catalyst after the methanation reaction (Fig. 4e),and of (5%Ru)CeO2 (Fig. 4f) show that Ce is primarily present in the +4 oxidation state. The peak at 882.7 eV, along with its satellite peaks (6.4 and 16.0 eV below the main peak), is characteristic of [59] Ce4+ in CeO2. The peak of Ce3+(3d), in Ce2O3, is that of Ce(3d5/2), at 883.3 eV, along with an intense satellite [59] at
887.1 eV. Comparing the XPS spectra in Fig. 4df, with the decon-
voluted spectra [60] of CeO2, suggests that 1015% of the Ce atoms in the surface region are Ce3+ and the remainder are Ce4+. Most likely Ce3+ is formed because of oxygen vacancies in the material.
5. The methanation reaction
The activity of the catalysts was measured in a packed bed reac- tor, which is a 6-mm-diameter glass tube, 300 mm in length, fitted inside a stainless steel heating block. Twenty milligrams of catalyst was placed inside the tube with quartz wool at both ends. The geo- metric volume was 0.088 cm3, and the void fraction was approxi- mately 82%. Argon was the carrier gas and the calibration standard. The volumetric flow rates of argon, carbon monoxide,and oxygen were controlled by mass flow controllers (MKS). Typi- cal experimental flow rates were 5 ml/min for argon, 2 ml/min for CO2, and 8 ml/min for H2, which gave an approximate space time of
0.35 s. The product gas was sampled directly at the reactor outlet
with a differentially pumped mass spectrometer (Stanford Re- search Systems) through a controlled leak valve. For tempera- ture-programmed reaction (TPR) studies, the temperature was ramped at the rate of 10 C min1 using a programmable tempera- ture controller (Omega, CSC32). Before performing TPR, the cata- lyst was pretreated in Ar, at 500 C, for 1 h, to degas it.
The TPR results for the methanation of CO2 by H2, catalyzed by Ce0.98Co0.02O2, Ce0.95Pd0.05O2, Ce0.95Ni0.05O2, or Ce0.95Ru0.05O2, are shown in Fig. 5. Ce0.95Pd0.05O2 catalyzes the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction (CO2 + H2 ? CO + H2O) and produces no methane in the temperature range 100500 C. Ce0.95Co0.05O2 and Ce0.95 Ni0.05O2 catalyze methanation with low selectivity, since this reac- tion competes with the RWGS reaction. Clearly Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 has the best performance: it starts producing methane at 270 C,reaches the highest methane yields at 480 C, with 55% CO2 con- version and 99% selectivity for methane. The conversion and the selectivity of all doped oxides we have studied are given in Table 1.
Pure ceria, prepared by the combustion method, is inert in this temperature range. This may happen because of the high temper- ature reached during preparation [61,62] which has been shown to make CeO2 inactive as an oxygen reservoir.
The TPR results for the methanation reaction on (5%Ru)CeO2 are shown in Fig. 6. This catalyst is clearly different from the doped oxide. Comparing Fig. 5 to Fig. 6, we see that the activity for metha- nation of the (5%Ru)CeO2 catalyst is inferior to that of Ce0.95R- u0.05O2. While the production of CH4 on Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 grows monotonically with temperature, on (5%Ru)CeO2 it reaches a max- imum around 425 C and then decreases. The total CO2 conversion over the doped oxide is 55% and over the impregnated oxide is 25%.
The methane selectivity of (5%Ru)CeO2 is 99% at 375 C, and it drops to almost 5% when the temperature is increased to 450 C.
On the other hand, the doped catalyst shows 99% selectivity at both temperatures.
We studied (5%Ru)CeO2 only to prove that the material made by the combustion method is not metallic Ru supported on ceria. The reader interested in CO2 hydrogenation by supported Ru can find extensive information in the literature [27,2934,3640,43]. From now on, we focus on Ce0.95Ru0.05O2.
The steady-state activity of the Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 catalyst was investigated by varying the temperature linearly in time, as in TPR, until the temperature of interest is reached. Then, the temper- ature is held constant until the methanation reaction reaches stea- dy state. Next, the temperature is again increased linearly until the next temperature is reached, where it is again held constant until 100 200 300 400 500 PCH4/PAr Temperature (c)

301 the system reaches the steady state, etc. This is TPR with a stair- case temperature variation instead of a linear one. We call this a steady-state TPR (STPR). The results of one such measurement are shown in Fig. 7. The black curve (solid curve in the black and white figure) shows the temperature (the temperature scale is on the right-hand axis). We determine the steady states for tempera- tures between 300 C and 500 C, varied with increments of 50 C.
Methane production starts slightly below 300 C and reaches a maximum at 400 C. No CO is formed up to this temperature. A small amount of CO is seen at 450 C and more is formed at 500 C. CO production takes place with no change in CO2 output,but with a loss of methane. This suggests that CO is produced by steam reforming of the methane produced by the reaction.
Upon reaching 500 C, we step the temperature back to 450 C and the reaction proceeds as it did when we increase the temper- ature from 400 C to 450 C; the state of the catalyst is reversible.
Running the reaction on Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 for over 16 h, at 325 C,shows no decrease in CO2 conversion (Fig. 8). Direct observation of the catalyst showed no sign of darkening, which indicates that coking or the bulk reduction of the catalyst is not significant. We also maintained the reaction at 450 C for 40 min and found no change in performance.
The results presented in Table 1 show that CO2 conversion by Ce1xRuxO2 increases with x; high conversion and selectivity are reached for x > 0.03. Since Ru is expensive, having an active cata- lyst with such a low Ru loading is advantageous.
6. Chemical characterization of the catalyst
The chemical properties of the Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 were studied by performing temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with H2 and CO, and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experi- ments in which we heated Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 and monitored O2 emis- sion, water formation from surface hydroxyls and CO2 formation by the decomposition of surface carbonate.
In Fig. 9, we show the gases formed upon heating Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 in a TPD experiment. Determining water evolution is difficult be- cause of the presence of the background water. The water signal is strong at room temperature, and it is constant up to 150 C.
After this temperature, the amount of water escaping from the reactor decreases monotonically up to 600 C. There is no change in the signal that would allow us to distinguish water that was molecularly adsorbed from water formed from the hydroxyls on the surface. Between 200 C and 350 C we observe CO2, which is produced by the decomposition of surface carbonates. The IR experiments described later show that carbonates are formed readily even with trace contamination of Ar with CO2. We do not see any oxygen desorption at temperatures below 600 C. TPD experiments have been carried out on pure ceria [6367], and the results depend strongly on the method of preparation and the degree of dispersion of the oxide. In some cases, no O2 desorp- tion has been observed [68] upon heating to 1100 C. For high-area ceria particles (12 nm across), oxygen desorption can take place [64] at a temperature as low as 350 C. The strong dependence of these results on the method of preparation makes it difficult to compare our TPD results on Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 with the literature 100 200 300 400 500

results on ceria. In addition, it is possible that the samples studied in the literature have low levels of dopants, which may make their behavior different from that of pure ceria.
The results of temperature-programmed reduction experiments of Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 with H2 are shown in Fig. 10. Before performing this reaction, the catalyst was heated in the flow of Ar at 500 C for an hour to remove the adsorbed water, the residual water in the reactor, and the carbonates from the surface. At a temperature below 130 C, we observe background water and, perhaps, water produced by desorption from the surface (compare to Fig. 9), but no hydrogen consumption. The H2 signal starts decreasing as the temperature exceeds 130 C, and this is accompanied by an in- crease in water signal. The amount of hydrogen exiting the reactor reaches a minimum at 200 C, and the amount of water produced is maximum at the same temperature. Above 200 C, the amount of H2 that manages to pass through the reactor increases monoton- ically with the temperature and the amount of water decreases.
This happens because by the time the sample reached 200 C,the surface is already reduced and this makes it more difficult for H2 to remove oxygen from the surface. Depending on the partial pressure of the hydrogen, it is possible that the reduction will go on, if the temperature is sufficiently high, until all oxide is reduced to metallic Ce and Ru. In our experiments, the sample is exposed to H2 for a short time and it is likely that the water is produced only by the reaction with the oxygen atoms in the surface layer.
This experiment tells us that the reduction of Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 by H2 takes place at a lower temperature than the methanation of CO2, and therefore the methanation catalyst is the reduced Ce0.95R- u0.05O2 surface.
The experiments on the reduction of pure ceria [6872] by H2 show a marked dependence on the method of preparation, the hydrogen pressure, the method of measurement, the presence or absence of carbonates and hydroxyls on the surface, and perhaps on unintentional doping by impurities in the precursors. In general,the reduction starts at lower temperature on samples having a lar- ger surface area per gram. Presumably this happens because at large surface area enough water molecules are produced by the reduction of the surface layer to be detected. Given all these com- plications, it is difficult to choose a unique value for the lowest temperature at which H2 consumption by pure ceria takes place.
Perrichon et al. [69] found an onset temperature of 347 C, Laachir et al. [70] found 200 C (for the sample with the lowest onset tem- perature), Leitenburg et al. [71] found 327 C, and Giordano et al.
[72] found 227 C. In spite of these uncertainties, we can state that doping with Ru lowers the onset temperature for the reduction by
H2. The presence of the Ru dopant makes the surface more reduc-
ible, hence a better oxidant.
The results of temperature-programmed reduction of Ce0.95R- u0.05O2 with CO are shown in Fig. 11. CO oxidation starts at 150 C. At 250 C, we begin to observe the production of H2.
The origin of this is not clear. There is water contamination in the system, but we see no change in the water signal when the H2 signal appears. Therefore, we think that H2 originates from the hydroxyls present on the surface and not from the reduction of water (by the reduced ceria surface [73]) or from the water gas shift reaction (CO + H2O ? H2 + CO2). From Fig. 9, we know that no H2 is produced if we heat the surface in Ar, even though water and hydroxyls are present. Hence, H2 production at 250 C is con- nected to the fact that CO started reducing the surface at 150 C; H2 desorbs from the reduced surface. Apparently, the oxygen atoms 100 200 300 400 500 600

303 on the reduced surface are more strongly bound to the surface and do not form water as easily as the fully oxidized surface; H2 desorption is more facile than desorption as water. This assump- tion is supported by experiments performed by Bernal et al. [74] who have shown that H2 adsorbed on reduced ceria desorbs as H2 not as water. Moreover, Otsuka et al. [73] have shown that strongly reduced ceria converts water to hydrogen, a behavior that is very different from that of slightly reduced ceria for which the hydroxyls desorb as water not as H2.
The reduction of pure ceria by CO has been studied by Aneggi et al. [75], who prepared six different ceria samples and found that reduction starts at 227 C for all of them. Other experiments [76] found that ceria having a large area per gram starts being reduced at room temperature, and the reduction becomes extensive at 200 C; a sample with lower surface area per gram was reduced at higher temperature. Thus, pure ceria is reduced at lower temper- ature by CO than by H2. However, one should keep in mind that ceria exposed to CO forms surface carbonates [77,78], and the sur- face being reduced by CO is not identical to the surface reduced by
H2. Of course the precise temperature where reduction begins de-
pends on CO or H2 pressure and on the preparation of the surface. If we compare the results shown in Fig. 11 with the literature results,it is not clear that doping with Ru makes ceria more reducible by
CO. However, we are not aware of any TPR reduction of ceria with
CO in which hydrogen is being produced. In this respect, Ru-doped ceria behaves differently than undoped ceria.
7. IR spectroscopy
Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFT) was performed on Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 under reaction conditions (Thermo Electron Corporation, Nicolet 4700). The catalyst was ex- posed to gases (5 ml/min for argon, 2 ml/min for CO2 and 8 ml/min for H2) by using an automated temperature controller (Harrick).
Our intention was to identify reaction intermediates and deter- mine their stability under reaction conditions.
The IR spectrum of the carbonates formed by exposing ceria to CO2 has been published recently by Marbn et al. [79] in an article that also summarized the previous work [7783]. They recom- mended the following assignments of the IR peak frequencies [79]: 1370, 13511367, 1464, 1517 cm1 for the monodentate car- bonate; 850, 854, 1305, 1297, 1588, 1586 cm1 for the bidentate carbonate; and 1305, 1316, 1510 cm1 for bicarbonate.

of high-purity Ar, to remove gases other than Ar from the reactor.
Then, it was cooled to 35 C in about 30 min. The IR spectrum, ta- ken after cooling, is shown in Fig. 12a. It has three small peaks. The one at 1600 cm1 has a higher frequency than any of the assign- ments listed above for carbonates [79]. The one at 1400 cm1 might be monodentate carbonate, and the one at 1250 cm1 is closest to a frequency assigned to the bidentate carbonate.
The reason for the presence of the carbonates on the surface can be determined by examining Fig. 13b, which shows that there is no carbonate band when Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 is exposed to Ar at 500 C (the spectrum was taken after the mass spectrometer detects no CO2 in the gases coming out of the reactor). This means that the carbon- ates on the Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 surface are not stable at 500 C when the surface is exposed to Ar. Therefore, the carbonates seen in Fig. 12a must have been formed when we cooled the surface, in pure Ar, from 500 C to 35 C (the temperature at which the spectrum in Fig. 12a was taken). Since cooling was done in a flow of high-purity Ar, these results show that the trace CO2 impurity in Ar is sufficient to form carbonates on the Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 surface.
Fig. 12b shows the spectrum obtained after the catalyst used in the measurements reported in Fig. 12a was exposed, for 10 min, at 35 C, to a steady flow of a gas containing CO2 (2 ml/min), H2 (8 ml/ min), and Ar (5 ml/min). The concentration of the carbonates is in- creased substantially by exposure to CO2 and H2. The carbonate peaks merge, probably due to inhomogeneous broadening, to form two bands. A deconvolution of these bands is not reliable, and we do not attempt to quantify how much bicarbonate, or monodentate carbonate, or bidentate carbonate is present on the surface. In what follows, we call these two broad peaks the carbonate bands.
Prior work on CO2 hydrogenation [15] by supported metal cat- alysts suggested that in many cases, CO2 is first reduced to CO which is then converted to alkanes by a FischerTropsch reaction.
Often a formate intermediate is invoked to explain the hydrogena- tion of CO. We do not see any IR adsorption in the region between 2700 and 3100 cm1 where formate bands are expected [79].
To examine the extent to which the chemistry of the Ce0.95R- u0.05O2 surface differs from that of CeO2, we used IR spectroscopy to monitor carbonate decomposition with temperature. Fig. 13 shows the carbonate bands in the IR spectra of CeO2 (Fig. 13a) and of Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 (Fig. 13b), taken while the surface was main- tained at constant temperature, in a flow of argon. In the IR exper- iments, the steady state is reached in 10 min after reaching at the required temperature. At room temperature, the carbonate bands are intense for both materials. When the temperature is 300 C,the intensity of the carbonate band on CeO2 decreases and it disap- pears for Ce0.95Ru0.05O2. If the Ru dopant affects only a few oxygen atoms next to it and if there are only a few Ru atoms on the surface,then the surface would have oxygen atoms that behave like those of pure ceria. The carbonates formed on these atoms would not decompose at 300 C. The fact that the carbonate signal disappears at 300 C on Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 suggests either that there is enough Ru on the surface to affect the majority of the oxygen atoms or that Ru in the bulk affects the chemistry of the surface, or both.
During this experiment, the solids are exposed to argon, which contains enough CO2 to contaminate the sample. Because the car- bonate bands disappear at 300 C, from the Ce0.95Ru0.05O2, we con- clude that, on this material, the rate of carbonate decomposition exceeds the rate of contamination with CO2. This is not the case for pure ceria. Therefore, the decomposition rate of the carbonates on Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 is higher than that of the carbonates on CeO2.There are still carbonates on ceria at 500 C (which is consistent with previous work [77]), and none is seen on Ce0.95Ru0.05O2. Dop- ing the oxide with Ru significantly affects the stability of the carbonates.
In Fig. 14, we show the in situ IR spectra when the system is ex- posed to CO2 (2 ml/min), H2 (8 ml/min), and Ar (5 ml/min) and is held at constant temperature. The spectra were taken after the sys- tem reached steady state. A spectrum taken over a wider range of wavelengths than that shown in Fig. 14 shows strong absorbance from gas-phase CO2 and CH4; we only show the spectral region containing signals from the surface species. The sharp peak marked with a star is due to gas-phase methane.
In all spectra shown in Fig. 14, we see a weak band at 2000 cm1. We are unable to identify the species responsible for this band. The spectrum of CO adsorbed on ceria has peaks [77] at 2177 and 2156 cml. The peaks for the carbonates formed by CO adsorption have frequencies [77] below 1562 cm1. It ap- pears that the feature at 2000 cm1 has not been seen previously on ceria, and it is unique to Ce0.95Ru0.05O2.
We have performed DFT calculations for CO adsorbed on the surface of Ce1xRuxO2(1 1 1) in which the Ru atom replaces a Ce atom in the surface layer and an oxygen vacancy is present near the Ru dopant. We looked at a system having an oxygen vacancy because H2 reduces Ce1xRuxO2 at the temperatures at which the methanation reaction takes place (see Fig. 10). In the calculations,the vacancy was formed by removing the oxygen atom that has the lowest binding energy to the surface. We found two low-energy states for CO binding to Ce1xRuxO2 that has an oxygen vacancy.
The structure of the state having the lowest energy is shown in Fig. 15. In the upper part, the unit cell of the slab used in the cal- culation is shown, as seen from above (Fig. 15a) and from the side (Fig. 15b); each lower part shows a schematic of the bonding as well as the positions of a small number of atoms in the neighbor- hood of the C atom (at the positions they have in the slab calcula- tion). The carbon atom of the adsorbed CO molecule (in gray) binds to the Ru dopant (blue1) and to an oxygen atom from the second surface layer (orange). Some information about bonding in this sys- tem is given in Table 2. It is reasonable to think that the adsorbed CO forms a CO2 molecule since the two CO bonds are of equal length (Table 2). The formation of this complex lowers the energy by

It takes 10 min to reach the steady state at each temperature. 1 (For interpretation of color in Fig. 15, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

305 an oxygen vacancy). The two frequencies associated with the OCO group are approximately 1476 cm1 and 1276 cm1 and are caused by a symmetric and antisymmetric stretch of the OCO group.
The second possibility for CO binding is shown in Fig. 16. The carbon atom of CO binds to the Ru dopant to form a sort of car- bonyl. The binding energy is 2.32 eV, the CO stretching frequency is 1825 cm1, and the stretching frequency of the CRu bond is 606 cm1 (Table 2). Within the accuracy of DFT, the CO molecule binds very weakly to the oxygen atoms on the surface and such a species would not be present at the high temperatures at which the 2000 cm1 band is present in Fig. 14.
We have also calculated the vibrational frequency of a CO2 mol- ecule adsorbed at the site of an oxygen vacancy (near the Ru dop- ant) and found that its highest vibrational frequency is 1847 cm1.
These calculations suggest that the band at 2000 cm1 in Fig. 14 does not originate from CO or CO2 adsorbed on the reduced Ce1xRuxO2. In a further attempt to determine the origin of this band, we took the IR spectrum of the reduced Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 sur- face exposed to CO. We see the carbonate bands and also very small peaks whose frequencies are close to the ones predicted by the calculations. However, the peaks are too small to give convinc- ing proof that the compounds calculated have been observed experimentally. More important is the fact that when CO is ad- sorbed on reduced Ce1xRuxO2, the IR spectrum has no band at 2000 cm1.
We conclude that the nature of the band at 2000 cm1 is uncertain. In the next section, we show that in spite of the presence of this band, it very unlikely that some form of CO is an intermedi- ate in the methanation reaction.
8. CO methanation by H2
Prior publications on CO2 hydrogenation suggested that CO2 is reduced to CO, which is then hydrogenated through a Fischer Tropsch process. To determine whether this mechanism is consis- tent with our observations on Ce0.95Ru0.05O2, we performed tem- perature-programmed reaction of CO with H2, on Ce0.95Ru0.05O2.
We reasoned that if CO is an intermediate in CO2 methanation by Ce0.95Ru0.05O2, then this catalyst should methanate CO. We find,essentially, no activity for CO methanation (Fig. 17). A very small amount of methane is produced at 350 C, but even at 600 C meth- ane production is very small. Compare this to the methanation of CO2 (Figs. 5 and 7) for which the Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 begins producing methane at 300 C with a much larger yield than that obtained by CO hydrogenation at 600 C. We conclude that CO2 methanation does not take place through a CO intermediate.
It is interesting to note that when we expose Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 to CO and H2, the oxidation of CO to CO2 starts at 75 C. This is lower than the temperatures at which CO alone is oxidized (175 C, Fig. 11), and lower than the temperature at which H2 alone is oxi- dized (135 C, Fig. 10). It appears that the mixture of CO + H2 is a better reductant than either CO or H2.
In Fig. 18, we show the gas-phase methane and surface hydrox- yls for Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 exposed to a flow of CO (3 ml/min), H2 (9 ml/ min), and Ar (3 ml/min), at 300, 400 and 500 C. We compare the observed DRIFT spectra to the spectrum of the same catalyst ex- posed to a flow CO2 (2 ml/min), H2 (8 ml/min), and Ar (5 ml/ min), at 300 C. All spectra were taken after the system reached steady state. Practically no methane is observed for CO + H2 at 300 and 400 C and very little is seen at 500 C. The hydroxyl signal is very weak compared to that obtained for CO2 + H2. The IR spectra show that Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 does not catalyze CO hydrogenation un- der conditions for which it is active for CO2 hydrogenation.

It is interesting to note that the hydroxyl signal is very weak when the surface is exposed to CO + H2, and it is substantial when it is exposed to CO2 + H2. The surface exposed to CO and H2 is reduced more than the one exposed to CO2 and H2. The weak hydroxyl signal for CO + H2 suggests that on the reduced surface,the hydrogen does not make hydroxyls. One might think of the reduced surface as consisting on patches of oxygen and patches of ionic cerium. When such patches are present, it may be that the oxygen is less active in forming hydroxyls and the hydrogen may dissociate on cerium patches and make CeH bonds. This may explain why fewer hydroxyls are observed on the surface and is consistent with the observation that when reduced ceria is exposed to hydrogen and then heated H2 is desorbed, not water [74]. A sim- pler explanation for the reduced number of hydroxyls may be that the reduced surface has fewer oxygen atoms for the H to bind to.
9. The local and the global effect of a dopant
So far our previous computational work has considered the ef- fect a dopant has on the oxygen atoms nearby [8490] or on the molecules adsorbed on it [91]. In these cases, the dopant has a chemical effect since its role is to modify locally the strength of chemical bonds.
In the case of Ce0.95Ru0.05O2, a good fraction of Ru atoms are located in the bulk, and calculations indicate that the Ru atoms in the surface region (i.e. accessible to XPS) prefer to be located in the second Ce layer. Therefore, it is likely that many oxygen sites on the surface might be far from a Ru atom. If they are unaf- fected by dopants, they should behave like the oxygen atoms on an undoped ceria surface. In particular, carbonates should be present on the surface up to 500 C. We do not observe carbon- ates on Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 even at 300 C, a temperature at which they are abundant on the undoped ceria surface. This suggests that the Ru dopants might also have a long-range effect. Since it is impos- sible to estimate the Ru concentration in the surface layer, we cannot assert that such an effect is proven by our experiments.
Nevertheless, we discuss here the possibility that a dopant has a global effect and modifies the reactivity at distant surface sites.
In a simplified model, this effect occurs because the dopant changes the Fermi level of the oxide and this can affect the charge rearrangement taking place during a reaction. To understand qual- itatively how this works, consider the conversion of an adsorbed intermediate A to an adsorbed intermediate B. The simplest exam- ple would be the desorption of a CO molecule bound to the surface (system A) to create a CO2 molecule in the gas and an oxygen va- cancy on the surface (system B). In many cases when such a reac- tion takes place, the energies of the orbitals in the band gap change: the filled and empty orbitals of A (in the gap) have differ- ent energies than the localized orbitals of B (in the gap). In partic- ular, this is the case when CO reacts with the solid surface to form CO2 since an oxygen vacancy is left behind, which is known to pro- duce new states in the gap [44,46,92]. It is likely to be the case in general, because adsorbates tend to have some localized frontier orbitals whose energy is located in the gap.
Let us assume, for simplicity, that when A is present on the surface, there is no orbital in the band gap. This is, for example,the case when the reaction A ? B is the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface [44]. Let us denote by ee the energy of an empty orbital created when B is formed, and denote by eF the Fermi energy. If eF > ee, an electron will be transferred to B when the reaction A ? B takes place. This will happen regardless of whether the oxide is doped or not. One could think, qualita- tively, of the formation of B as consisting of two successive steps:(a) in the first step, the chemical bonds at the surface are rear- ranged (or broken) so that A is converted to B, and this requires the chemical energy DE; (b) in addition, an electron is trans- ferred from eF to ee with the energy gain eF  ee. As long as eF > ee the energy to go from A to B is DE  (eF  ee); the energy (eF  ee) gained through electron transfer lowers the total reac- tion energy. This equation shows that a dopant that changes the Fermi energy eF affects the reaction energy. Lowering the reaction energy often results in lowering the activation energy (Evans Polanyi rule), so both the thermodynamic and the kinetic proper- ties of the surface are affected.Since the Fermi energy is a global property (i.e. the Fermi en- ergy is the same at any surface site  we exclude the presence of inhomogeneous electric fields in which case we would need to use the electrochemical potential as a global quantity [[93], Chap- ter 29]), the presence of the term eF  ee in the reaction energy af- fects it globally (regardless of the distance between the dopant and the reaction site). 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600

307 Similarly, if the reaction A ? B creates a localized, filled state in the gap, having an energy ef, and if ef > eF, the reaction will cause an electron transfer from the filled orbital of B to the Fermi level; the energy of the reaction is lowered by the amount ef  eF. Again, by changing the position of the Fermi level, the dopant can affect the reaction energy. The important point is that through this mech- anism, a dopant can affect the energy of a reaction taking place anywhere on the surface, regardless of the dopants location. We call this a global effect to contrast it with the change caused in the reactivity of the sites adjacent to the dopant, a change present because the dopant modifies the strength of the chemical bonds around it.
This kind of global effect has been discussed in the semiconduc- tor literature in connection with the formation of bulk defects and,in particular, with the formation of oxygen vacancies [9496]. If the Fermi energy of the semiconductor is sufficiently high, nega- tively charged oxygen vacancies are stable; if the Fermi energy is very low, positively charged vacancies are formed; neutral vacan- cies are formed when the Fermi energy is in between. The present discussion extends these concepts to chemical reactions on a sur- face, among which oxygen-vacancy formation is a particular case.
While the model has a number of simplifications, it clearly pro- vides a mechanism through which dopants can have a long-range effect.
This discussion has focused on reaction energies, and it is there- fore relevant to a thermodynamic analysis which is trying to estab- lish the effect of remote dopants on the equilibrium concentration of A and B. The kinetic aspects of the charge transfer process are also interesting. If a dopant is far from the site on which A ? B takes place (e.g. the dopant is in the bulk and the reaction takes place on the surface), the charge transfer cannot take place by elec- tron tunneling from the donor to the acceptor and several steps need to be invoked. An electron from the donor (which could be either the dopant or B) is thermally excited to the conduction band where it will form a polaron, which hops from site to site until its electron wave function overlaps with the empty orbital of the acceptor and the localization of the electron on the acceptor can take place. The kinetics involves electron excitation, polaron for- mation, the electronhole separation, the polaron migration, and the transfer of the electron to the acceptor. Obviously, the global effect is most pronounced for shallow donors [97] for which the HOMO is closest to the conduction band and which are easily ionized thermally.
These arguments indicate that in dealing with the equilibrium and the kinetics of A ? B, we should take into account the electron transfer aspects discussed earlier. This means that the partition functions used in either equilibrium calculations or the transition state theory should include the electronic degrees of freedom.
We must consider the population of the neutral donors and that of the charged donors as well as the population of the neutral and charged acceptors.
10. Summary
We have found that the activity and the selectivity of the Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 catalyst for CO2 methanation is comparable to that of the best catalysts reported previously. A quantitative compari- son is difficult because in most of the available experiments (including ours), the quantitative description of the activity of the catalyst depends on the reactor used in the measurements.
Ceria doped with Ni or Co is not selective: it catalyzes methana- tion and the reverse watergas shift reaction. Pd-doped ceria pro- duces only CO.
It is always difficult to prove that the catalyst is a doped oxide.
Our electron microscopy and XRD measurements suggest that Ru is incorporated into the ceria lattice. The XPS measurements indicate that Ru is ionic and is present in the surface region. The DFT calcu- lations show that Ce1xRuxO2 has the lowest energy when the Ru atoms are in the second Ce layer (of the CeO2(1 1 1) surface).
Therefore, if the Ru atoms are close to being in chemical equilib- rium, most of them are likely to be in the surface region. Given the surface area and the number of surface sites and given the number of Ru atoms we add to the system, we conclude that many Ru atoms are in the bulk. This is supported by the XRD measure- ments which show that Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 has the ceria structure with a modified lattice constant, which can only happen if a substantial fraction of the Ru atoms are in the bulk.
The most convincing proof that a doped oxide has been pre- pared is to show that the chemistry of the surface is different from that of other structures that might have been synthesized. To this end, we prepared a catalyst consisting of metallic Ru clusters sup- ported on ceria, which has the same amount of Ru as the one pre- pared by combustion (which we assume to yield doped ceria). The two catalysts have very different activity and selectivity for CO2 methanation. A variety of temperature-programmed reaction mea- surements show that the catalyst made by the combustion method is more reducible than ceria.
In much of the literature on CO2 methanation, it is assumed (and sometimes proven) that the hydrogenation of CO2 consists of the reduction of CO2 to CO, followed by the conversion to al- kanes by a FischerTropsch process. This assumption guided previ- ous research: most catalysts tried for CO2 methanation were those active for the FischerTropsch reaction. Our TPR measurements show that CO + H2 react to produce CO2 and water and practically no methane; therefore, gas-phase CO is not a reaction intermediate for the methanation of CO2 by Ce0.95Ru0.05O2.
In the past, we have used density functional calculations to try to classify the possible roles played by substitutional doping of oxi- des. We have found the following qualitative rules: (1) Dopants that have a lower valence than the cation replaced in the host oxide (Li-doped MgO, La-doped ceria, etc.) tend to weaken the bonds of the oxygen atoms to the surface. This makes the oxygen atoms more reactive and they engage more readily in catalysis by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [84,85,8789,91]. We have pointed out however a moderation principle: if the dopant makes the oxygen atoms in the surface layer too reactive, the sys- tem is a good oxidant but not a good oxidation catalyst; the oxygen atoms are easily consumed by the reductant, with the formation of oxygen vacancies, but these vacancies are not filled rapidly by gas- phase oxygen. (2) Dopants that have a higher valence than the cat- ion they replace tend to bind the oxygen atoms in their neighbor- hood more tightly. Therefore, they do not enhance oxidation by the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. However, in most cases, these do- pants adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it. In these sys- tems, the oxidation is due to the adsorbed O2 (an anti-Marsvan Krevelen mechanism) [91]. (3) The present work adds to these a third mechanism. Hydrogen reduces the surface at a temperature well below the temperature at which methanation occurs. There- fore, the methanation reaction takes place on the reduced surface and the role of the dopant is to facilitate the reduction of the oxide.
The addition of oxygen in the feed poisons the reaction by anni- hilating the oxygen vacancies.
There are by now many examples in which a very low dopant concentration modifies substantially the reactivity of an oxide (and by extension of a sulfide or a halide) catalyst, especially when the dopant has a tendency to segregate at the surface either be- cause it has lower energy there or because its energy in the surface layer is lowered by interaction with the adsorbed molecules. Using precursors having 99.99% purity introduces unknown dopants in the system. These can diminish or enhance the effect of the do- pants added intentionally and make it difficult to perform control 308
