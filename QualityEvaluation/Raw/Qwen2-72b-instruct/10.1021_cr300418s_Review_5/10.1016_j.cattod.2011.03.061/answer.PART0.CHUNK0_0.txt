[1] "Characterization studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (CH4 TPR-MS) and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) were carried out."
[2] "The characterization results indicated that cerium doping could deform the spinel structure and cause redistribution of metal ions with different oxidation states; consequently, they would increase crystal defects and oxygen vacancy concentration, which facilitate oxygen mobility and thus increase the catalytic performance of cerium modified cobalt chromite catalysts."

1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques such as XRD, SEM, XPS, CH4 TPR-MS, and O2-TPD, contributes to the comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It helps understand the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, such as reducibility. For instance, in the study of Ce-doped CoCr2O4, Raman spectroscopy, along with other techniques, revealed that cerium doping deforms the spinel structure, causes redistribution of metal ions with different oxidation states, increases crystal defects and oxygen vacancy concentration, which in turn facilitates oxygen mobility and enhances catalytic performance.

1.拉曼光谱与XRD，SEM，XPS，CH4 TPR-MS和O2-TPD等其他分析技术结合，通过提供对掺杂催化剂的组成，结构，原位行为和反应性的见解，为掺杂催化剂的全面表征做出了贡献。它有助于理解光谱特征与催化剂性质（如还原性）之间的关系。例如，在Ce掺杂CoCr2O4的研究中，拉曼光谱和其他技术揭示了铈掺杂会变形尖晶石结构，导致具有不同氧化态的金属离子的重新分布，增加晶体缺陷和氧空位浓度，进而促进氧的流动性并增强催化性能。
