[1] "Characterization studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (CH4 TPR-MS) and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) were carried out."
[2] "The characterization results indicated that cerium doping could deform the spinel structure and cause redistribution of metal ions with different oxidation states; consequently, they would increase crystal defects and oxygen vacancy concentration, which facilitate oxygen mobility and thus increase the catalytic performance of cerium modified cobalt chromite catalysts."

1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques such as XRD, SEM, XPS, CH4 TPR-MS, and O2-TPD, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It helps in determining the composition, structure, and in situ behavior of the catalysts. The insights provided by Raman spectroscopy about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility are exemplified by studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4. The characterization results show that cerium doping can deform the spinel structure, causing redistribution of metal ions with different oxidation states, increasing crystal defects and oxygen vacancy concentration, which facilitates oxygen mobility and enhances the catalytic performance.

1.拉曼光谱与XRD，SEM，XPS，CH4 TPR-MS和O2-TPD等其他分析技术结合，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了贡献。它有助于确定催化剂的组成，结构和原位行为。拉曼光谱提供的关于光谱特征与催化剂性质（如还原性）之间关系的见解，通过Ce掺杂CoCr2O4的研究得到了例证。表征结果表明，铈掺杂可以变形尖晶石结构，导致具有不同氧化态的金属离子的重新分布，增加晶体缺陷和氧空位浓度，从而促进氧的流动性并增强催化性能。
