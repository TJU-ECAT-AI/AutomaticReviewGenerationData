1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, can contribute to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It can help elucidate the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 have shown that Raman spectroscopy can reveal the distribution of Ce ions and their impact on the lattice structure, which in turn affects the catalyst's reducibility and reactivity. Similarly, for alkali-doped vanadia on titania, Raman spectroscopy can track the formation of different vanadia species and their interaction with the support, which is crucial for understanding the catalytic behavior under different reaction conditions.
