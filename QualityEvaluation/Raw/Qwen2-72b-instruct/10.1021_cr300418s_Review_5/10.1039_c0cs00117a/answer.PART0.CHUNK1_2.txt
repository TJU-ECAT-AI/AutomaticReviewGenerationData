1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, can contribute significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It can provide insights into the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of these materials. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania have shown that Raman spectroscopy can reveal information about the reducibility of the catalysts, which is crucial for their catalytic performance. The spectral features obtained from Raman spectroscopy can be correlated with the catalyst properties, such as the degree of reduction, which in turn affects the catalytic activity and selectivity.

1.拉曼光谱与其它分析技术结合，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解有重大贡献。它可以提供这些材料的组成、结构、原位行为和反应性的见解。例如，对Ce掺杂CoCr2O4和碱金属掺杂的二氧化钛上的钒酸盐的研究表明，拉曼光谱可以揭示催化剂的还原性信息，这对它们的催化性能至关重要。从拉曼光谱获得的光谱特征可以与催化剂的性质相关联，如还原程度，这反过来又影响催化活性和选择性。
