1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, can contribute to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It can reveal information about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania have shown that Raman spectroscopy can identify the presence of specific dopants and their impact on the catalyst's electronic and vibrational properties, which in turn affect the catalyst's performance. By correlating the Raman spectral features with the catalyst's activity and selectivity, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the structure-activity relationships and optimize the catalyst design for improved performance.

1.拉曼光谱法结合其他分析技术，可以对掺杂催化剂进行全面的表征和理解，提供有关其组成、结构、原位行为和反应性的见解。它可以揭示光谱特征与催化剂性质（如还原性）之间的关系。例如，对Ce掺杂的CoCr2O4和碱金属掺杂的钛酸钒的研究表明，拉曼光谱法可以识别特定掺杂剂的存在及其对催化剂电子和振动性质的影响，进而影响催化剂的性能。通过将拉曼光谱特征与催化剂的活性和选择性相关联，研究人员可以更深入地理解结构-活性关系，优化催化剂设计，以提高性能。
