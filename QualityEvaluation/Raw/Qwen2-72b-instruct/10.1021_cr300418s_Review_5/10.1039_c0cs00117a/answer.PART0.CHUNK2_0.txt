1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, can contribute significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It can provide insights into the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of these materials. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania have shown that Raman spectroscopy can reveal information about the reducibility of the catalysts, which is crucial for their catalytic performance. The spectral features obtained from Raman spectroscopy can be correlated with the catalyst properties, such as the degree of reduction, and this can help in understanding the relationship between the structure and the catalytic activity.
