1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It can reveal the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania have shown that Raman spectroscopy can identify the presence of different phases and the changes in the local structure upon doping, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic performance. The reducibility of the catalyst, an important factor for its activity, can be correlated with specific Raman bands, allowing for a deeper understanding of the structure-activity relationship.

1.拉曼光谱法结合其他分析技术，通过提供催化剂组成、结构、原位行为和反应性的见解，为掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了贡献。它可以揭示光谱特征与催化剂性质（如还原性）之间的关系。例如，对Ce掺杂的CoCr2O4和碱金属掺杂的钛酸钒的研究表明，拉曼光谱法可以识别不同相的存在以及掺杂后局部结构的变化，这对于理解催化性能至关重要。催化剂的还原性，是其活性的重要因素，可以与特定的拉曼带相关联，从而更深入地理解结构-活性关系。
