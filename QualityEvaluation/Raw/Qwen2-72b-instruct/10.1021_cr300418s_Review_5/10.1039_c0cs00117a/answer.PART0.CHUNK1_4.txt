1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It can reveal the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania have shown that Raman spectroscopy can identify the presence of specific phases or structures that correlate with the catalyst's reducibility and activity. By monitoring changes in the Raman spectra under different conditions, researchers can understand how the catalyst's structure evolves during activation or reaction, which is crucial for optimizing its performance.

1.拉曼光谱与其它分析技术结合，通过提供催化剂组成、结构、原位行为和反应性的见解，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了贡献。它可以揭示光谱特征与催化剂性质（如还原性）之间的关系。例如，对Ce掺杂的CoCr2O4和碱金属掺杂的二氧化钛上的钒酸盐的研究表明，拉曼光谱可以识别与催化剂还原性和活性相关的特定相或结构。通过在不同条件下监测拉曼光谱的变化，研究人员可以了解催化剂结构在激活或反应过程中的演变，这对于优化其性能至关重要。
