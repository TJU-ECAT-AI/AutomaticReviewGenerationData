1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, can contribute to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It can help elucidate the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 have shown that Raman spectroscopy can reveal the distribution of Ce ions and their impact on the lattice structure, which in turn affects the catalyst's reducibility and reactivity. Similarly, for alkali-doped vanadia on titania, Raman spectroscopy can track the formation of different vanadia species and their interaction with the support, which is crucial for understanding the catalytic behavior under different reaction conditions.

1.拉曼光谱法结合其他分析技术，可以对掺杂催化剂进行全面的表征和理解，提供有关其组成、结构、原位行为和反应性的见解。它可以帮助阐明光谱特征与催化剂性质（如还原性）之间的关系。例如，对Ce掺杂CoCr2O4的研究表明，拉曼光谱法可以揭示Ce离子的分布及其对晶格结构的影响，这反过来又影响催化剂的还原性和反应性。同样，对于碱金属掺杂的二氧化钛上的钒酸盐，拉曼光谱法可以追踪不同钒酸盐物种的形成及其与支撑物的相互作用，这对于理解在不同反应条件下催化剂的行为至关重要。
