Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 4941 been used to study platinum catalysts supported on MFI zeolites. The 2D map can be read as a map showing loca- tion vs. size for the metal particles. Small particles can be distinguished from large ones, and their location can be determined in the pores or on the outer surface of the zeolite.
The role of the pores was demonstrated for the protection of small particles during ageing of the catalyst, and sintering was limited by the pore diameter where the particle was located.86 Quantitative analysis by coupling IR with gravimetry. Thermo- gravimetric analysis (TGA) allows monitoring weight changes in the sample. It has been combined with IR to give new information on surface sites. Reliable quantitative information is the key to understanding the catalytic role of surface sites,and this combination of techniques offers just that. It was used to determine the molar absorption coefficients for IR bands of OH groups on silica and HY zeolites, as well as for adsorbed probe molecules.112 Important information was obtained about the quantity of the OH groups located in the different cages of HY zeolite and also about the quantity of inner and surface silanol groups on silica. The number of silanol groups accessible to water molecules was shown to be constant whatever the sample of precipitated silica, as well as the ratio of water/silanol groups under room atmosphere. Combined thermogravimetry and IR was also applied to operando con- ditions, and denoted as AGIR (Analysis by Gravimetry and IR): a modified microbalance was used to follow mass changes (mg accuracy) inside a catalytic reactor equipped with infrared windows. The spectroscopic response of water and ammonium ions coadsorbed together on zeolites was shown to vary depending on the conditions. The molar absorption coefficients for d(H2O) and d(NH4 +) at 1640 and 1540 cm1 for water and ammonia on a HY zeolite were studied under dry gas flow at variable temperature. It showed the influence of coverage on the infrared response of adsorbed species in zeolites. Adsorption sites change with coverage, and bands are shifted and their shape and intensity are modified. Other interesting facts were observed:water modifies strongly the aspect of the d(NH4 +) vibration band in ammoniated zeolites, without changing the absorption coefficient. Measuring the sample mass while at the same time recording its infrared spectrum showed the key importance of conditions under which the measurement is done. The presence of co-adsorbed species (water in particular) strongly modifies the spectrum of surface species. Under reaction condition, this new technique is especially important for a correct assignment of infrared features and catalytic behaviour, and above all it makes IR measurements really quantitative.114 Other coupled techniques. As we have mentioned in the introduction, the purpose of this review is to critically discuss the characterization of the active site in catalytical processes by using IR analysis compared with catalytic tests. Sometimes,additional information can be provided by the coupling of complemental techniques able to yield enhanced insight into material local properties (structural, textural, physical, . . .) and reactional events at the nano-scale. For more information about this point we refer the reader to specific literature,notably within the present themed issue. We just want to briefly mention a few examples: Numerous techniques have been coupled with IR, thus broadening the experimental data set for subsequent mecha- nistic considerations. Of course, complementary information can be obtained by parallel experiments; nevertheless, to be sure that results are comparable, it is often preferred that the investigation is carried out in a single setup.115 The most natural technique to associate with IR is certainly Raman, to cover the totality of the vibrational spectrum. The first in situ Raman and FTIR spectroscopic characterization of a catalytic system under reaction conditions using a single bench-top instrument with a dedicated cell was published in 2003 by Payen et al.116 Following both the evolution of the molecular structure of the active phase by Raman spectro- scopy and the nature of the different surface adsorbed species by IR and Raman spectroscopy during deNOx reaction they were able to provide an exhaustive identification of the adsorbed species and the corresponding coordination sites.
Similar information can also be obtained by coupling DRIFT with hard X-ray diffraction, which can highlight phenomena taking place in nanoparticulate catalysts, such as the formation of simultaneous surface and bulk species and their evolution.117 Also combining, at high time resolution, a transmission based structural probes, dispersive EXAFS, with diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy, can highlight fundamental steps occurring during gassolid interactions, like that of oxidation and reduction of alumina-supported Rh at 573 K using NO and H2, and the structuralreactive role of linear Rh-nitrosyl species within these processes.118 Chemometric tools. Chemometrics is of course a very efficient way of decomposing complex bands, when they are progressively changing during reaction or during progressive adsorption. CO adsorption on Pt sites leads to complex bands on zeolites where different metal particle sizes can exist.86 Small particles lead to a stronger influence of corners and edges compared to faces, and large particles produce bands with a stronger influence of large faces. Chemometrics allows separating contributions, and the spectra of CO on small and large particles can be distinguished quantitatively. This was revealed to be very important for studying the influence of ageing of the catalyst on the catalytic sites.86 Active sites intermediates and spectators (discrimination of the aforementioned sites by using catalytic evidences) Intermediates, active sites and spectator species are well defined concepts in catalysis. We will summarize them again here for a clear discussion of their spectroscopic characteri- zation.
Heterogeneous catalysis involves adsorption of reactants on the surface, their reaction on the active site, with the possible formation of intermediates species, and the formation of final products (with a possible change of adsorp- tion site), and the further desorption of the products which will go to the exit of the reactor.
Downloaded by University of Toronto on 21 November 2012 Published on 29 October 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B919543M 4942 Chem. Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 During the adsorption step, several sites can participate.
Some of them will indeed be the place for the reaction (and these are the active sites) while some others will only be adsorption sites on which no reaction will take place. These non-active sites can adsorb strongly reactants or products and block any movement of surface species, resulting in a deactivation of the catalyst. Several reactions can take place on the surface. Some species will have no role in the reaction under study, and will thus be spectator species. Some other species can hamper or slow down the reaction, either by staying adsorbed on the active site or by blocking the circula- tion of surface species, and will be poison species. Another type of species will be formed on the surface but will be later transformed into the final expected product, and these are intermediate species. Intermediates are stable species on the surface (at least for a short duration), and should not be confused with transition states. Transition states are postulated between two chemical species on the surface, but do not actually exist since they have no actual lifetime. They are only pathways between two states on the surface (on an active site).
Correlation between probe studies and activity In situ analyses of a surface provide photographs of the material state, detailing the concentration of the superficial entities directly by their corresponding IR spectra or via the spectral response of a molecule adsorbed on the site and their relative strengths vs. the applied probe, as aforementioned.
The most general way to link catalytic activity to a specific site is the correlation method. It consists of measuring activities of a series of materials (starting from the initial reaction rate, or the conversion at the steady state), and to compare this value to the number of sites estimated by the intensity of a specific IR band. In general, this site concentration corresponds to the entities able to adsorb probe molecules. If a linear correlation between these two sets of data is found, the activity can reasonably be attributed to the presence of such adsorption sites. Nevertheless, all the sites able to adsorb a molecule are not necessarily active: the presence of the correlation means that the ratio between the active and the adsorption sites remains constant when their global amount varies. Additionally,we should consider the limitations intrinsic to the probe molecule (probe sensitivity to the strength, nature and number of sites) and the difficulties to obtain for both spectroscopic and catalytic measurements in similar activation conditions.
The use of appropriate probe molecules permits nevertheless to formulate reliable hypotheses on the nature of the corres- ponding sites. Moreover, when the quantitative analysis of the sites is possible, a calculation of the turn over frequency (TOF) can also been performed. A demonstrative example concerns active site study via CO adsorption in hydrotreating reactions such as hydrodesulfurization (HDS). They are usually related to anionic vacancies (coordinatively unsaturated sites, CUS) located on the edges of mixed sulfide nanosized particles (CoMoS or NiMoS) supported on high specific surface area alumina. Nitrogen monoxide has been the most employed but a partial oxidation of the sulfide phase may occur, even at very low temperatures. Infrared spectra of CO adsorbed on the sulfided promoted CoMo/Al2O3 catalysts displays a strong nCO band at 2070 cm1 which is correlated to the HDS catalytic activity.119 It has been assigned to CO interacting either with a Co atom or with a Mo atom adjacent to a Co atom. Similar correlations between the intensity of specific nCO bands and the activity in HDS catalytic activity have been also found with Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. Due to the drastic procedure of activation of sulfide catalyst, it is worth noting that some researchers of our laboratory have designed a new IR cell,called CellEx, in order to characterize in situ sulfided catalysts under a pertinent H2S/H2 flow, with pressure varying from 0.1 up to 4.0 MPa. This cell allows obtaining similar sulfidation procedure for both IR characterizations and catalytic tests.120 Another significant example can be mentioned in the case of the NOx selective reduction by hydrocarbons on oxide-based catalysts. Working on Ag/Al2O3 samples for NOx reduction by ethanol, we observed the formation of cyanide and isocyanate species. The IR band assignment was not straight- forward: contrarily to what is usually reported in the litera- ture, n(NCO) of AgI(NCO) species is located at 2204 cm1 (and not at 2230 cm1), whereas that of Ag0(NCO) species is at 2243 cm1. Thus, during SCR reaction of NO on silver/ alumina catalyst, the isocyanate species generally observed as intermediate compounds around 2230 and 2260 cm1 are not linked to silver sites but to the support, the main role of silver being to favour NCO formation and concentration on the support. The hypothesis that the two observed bands are due to different alumina coordination sites (Alocta and Altetra) for isocyanates was determined as the most probable by isotopic substitutions.121 This information was useful for the compre- hension of the NO SCR pathway. In fact comparing the selective catalytic reduction of NOx in excess of oxygen using ethanol as reducing agent on silver/alumina and on bare alumina showed the connection between the presence of silver and isocyanate species on a catalyst. Then, a detailed investi- gation concerning these groups was undertaken to understand their formation, their localization, and their reactivity in order to propose the pathway of the NOx SCR into N2. Three elemental sequences were suggested explaining, first, the formation of silver cyanide and its transformation into Al3+NCO, then isocyanate hydrolysis into ammonia, and finally the reaction of the latter species with NO in the presence of oxygen giving rise to nitrogen (Fig. 12).122 However, a working surface can have a totally different behaviour, with sites changing their nature. The real valence of a site can be ascertained only catching it in full action, using operando techniques.
Operando studies on Fe-FER indicated that these samples present interesting NOx SCR efficiency for temperature as low as 433 K. Our investigations also indicate that for such low reaction temperature ammonia and nitrogen monoxide compete for adsorption onto the Fe2+ species (whose fine characterisation has been reported in the section Metallic and redox sites), which are active for the NO-to-NO2 oxidation.
Our results are also consistent with this last reaction being the rate determining step of the global SCR process. We finally concentrated our study on the effect of SO2 on this NO-to-NO2 reaction. We must conclude that for the 2.5 wt% Fe-FER sample, the majority of iron sites are poisoned by sulfate formation, although some Fe2+ sites are thio-resistant.123 Downloaded by University of Toronto on 21 November 2012 Published on 29 October 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B919543M This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 Chem. Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 4943 Operando IR spectroscopy shows out all its added values when very complicated and multifunctional systems such as NOx-trap catalysts are investigated. In this case the spectro- scopic evidences are the only support for material modelling and scale-up, since kinetic calculations are totally ineffective in the transient reaction conditions. On the contrary, the synchronous analysis of gaseous and adsorbed phases all along the experiments gave highly valuable information in order to establish consecutive steps of NOx adsorption and reduction on this kind of materials. It has, therefore, been established that this reaction proceeds initially through NO oxidation. The NO2 produced that way is subsequently adsorbed on storage basic sites (for example Ba sites for a typical Toyota NOx-trap catalyst, or potassium sites in the case of the formulation developed with Rhodia: Pt/K/Mn/Al2O3CeO2) in the form of nitrite species. The last step of this mechanism is thus the oxidation of nitrites to nitrates, probably involving NO2 oxidizing molecules. Two different periods have also been determined for the NOx storage process, and linked to the progressive adsorption of NOx all along the catalytic reactor,as well as to the presence of two types of adsorbing sites, i.e. surface and bulk alkaline or earth-alkaline sites.75 Concerning the catalyst working under the alternate lean/rich flow, unique dynamic response details can be obtained by this technique, as illustrated by Fig. 13.
Surface and gas species comparison by time resolved analysis (as reported in Fig. 14 for the system described above) is the best way to establish reaction pathways. It is possible, for example, to observe at what time different intermediates or byproducts are emitted and to deduce which site is responsible for a given catalytic issue.
In such a way it is possible, step by step, to reconstruct all the reaction mechanism as for a jigsaw puzzle, evidencing the different steps, the chemical species taking part into them and the sites at play for the catalytic reaction, as depicted in Fig. 15 for the Pt/K/Mn/Al2O3CeO2 NOx-trap catalyst.124 Basicity: identification of the active sites in the reaction of COS hydrolysis The COS hydrolysis reaction (COS + H2O - CO2 + H2S) is generally used to eliminate COS from gaseous effluent and improves the Claus process, an industrial process to transform H2S into sulfur. The comparison of the results from catalytic test and from infrared experiments using CO2 as acidic probe molecule on Al2O3, ZrO2,TiO2 and ZnO, has revealed that the OH-basic sites (type I according to the nomenclature of Kno zinger16) are the active sites of the reaction, except for ZnO, inactive for this reaction.77 Interaction of COS with these basic sites leads to hydrogen-thiocarbonates according to the reaction MOH + COS - M(HSCO2), which play the role of intermediates in the COS hydrolysis reaction (Fig. 16).
It was concluded that this reaction can be used as a test reaction for the basicity of OH groups of metal oxides.77 Selective site poisoning: application to acid reactions One of the most powerful methods to determine the nature of the active sites in a catalytic reaction is the selective poisoning of the adsorption sites, added before or during the reaction a molecule, which will remain irreversibly adsorbed. In this way,some adsorption sites will be specifically blocked and the consequence on the solid activity will be clear. The operando IR reactor-cell is the ideal tool using a specific probe molecule,because it allows monitoring the surface poisoning in a qualitative (nature of sites affected by poisoning) and quanti- tative way (amount of poisoned sites) in parallel to the changes of the catalytic activity (conversion and selectivity). As examples we can cite the study of the activity of the different Brnsted- acid site of HY zeolites in n-hexane cracking125 and cyclo- hexene conversion,126 or the role of the acidbase pairs of modified alumina in tetrahydrothiophene conversion.10 If site poisoning is due to the reaction products themselves, when those are spectroscopically identified we are in the ideal case for the operando study, under real conditions, with the possibility to determine deactivation mechanisms.
What is visible by IR during the reaction?
The question of what can be detected by IR spectroscopy during the reaction naturally follows. IR is the spectroscopy of chemical bonding, not of individual atoms. IR can directly detect sites, on the condition that they are made of several atoms (as in Brnsted sites with the OH group), and it can detect species formed by adsorption of reactants. During the reaction of hydrocarbons on a protic acid catalyst, for example, the reactant is adsorbed on the Brnsted-acid site before the reaction takes place. The Brnsted site is perturbed by this adsorption, and the intensity of the n(OH) vibration band for the free OH group decreases. After the catalytic cycle has taken place, the hydrocarbon is desorbed, and the n(OH) vibration band reappears. At a given moment on the surface,the ratio of free to occupied acid sites follows a statistic distribution reflecting the coverage level. When the tempera- ture increases, the adsorption equilibrium shifts in favor of the gas phase, and the relative amount of occupied sites decreases,with a corresponding decrease of the visible perturbation of the infrared band. The reaction speed on the catalytic cycle nevertheless increases, and the catalytic conversion increases while the number of active sites in play seems to decrease. This is the classical paradox of operando spectroscopy: active sites seem to take no part in a very active catalyst. The reason is Fig. 12 Proposed formation mechanism of NCO groups in a CO + NO reaction on Ag/Al2O3 catalyst.122 Reproduced by permission of Elsevier.

The vertical blue dashed line represents the time limit to obtain a maximum in selectivity, skipping isocyanate and ammonia formation.124 Fig. 15 Schematic representation of the reaction mechanisms taking place on a Pt/K/Mn/Al2O3CeO2 NOx-trap catalyst during a lean (upper part) and rich flow (lower part). In particular, the oxidation and storage sites are highlighted, showing the superfluous role of platinum during the lean step. During the rich period, nitrate reduc- tion via the exothermic CO and H2 oxidation is evidenced, as well as the dissociation of NOx species on metal particle sites. The presence of secondary reactions is also mentioned. All the species highlighted in yellow and the respective coordination sites can be observed and quantified by IR spectroscopy.124 Downloaded by University of Toronto on 21 November 2012 Published on 29 October 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B919543M This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 Chem. Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 4945 of active sites are not in interaction with products, and the active site spends most of its time at rest. Limiting steps can only be observed by decreasing activity (by decreasing temperature for example) and by slowing down the system. Adsorbed species need to accumulate enough to get over the detection limit.
Another way to concentrate species on a site over a limited period of time is to use transient conditions: sending a pulse of one of the reacting agents suddenly increases the concentration of the intermediates in the reaction chain, making them visible.
Data treatment methods can be a very valuable help for spectroscopic studies of active sites. Operando often leads to large amounts of data, and the eye might not spot meaningful small band variations, especially when the species detected is not expected from the known reaction mechanism. 2D correla- tion spectroscopy (2D-COS) or chemometric techniques such as principal component analysis or MCR-ALS allows extracting meaningful information. 2D-COS was first used in catalysis in 2000, and it allowed extracting information from fairly noisy spectra at high temperature. It showed that the reason for improved selectivity of H-MFI for para-xylene over time-on-stream was due to the filling of pore defects by coke related species.127 After this filling of the defects (detected by the disappearing of their spectral signature, correlated with the signals for coke species),the pore structure was restored to its initial shape, and so was the efficiency for selecting para from the mixture of the three isomers of xylene. More recently, 2D-COS was used to identify catalytically active sites amongst the various Brnsted sites in hierarchical zeolites.128 Kinetics and surface concentrations The surface elementary reaction rate is proportional to the surface concentration of the adsorbed species involved in the reaction process (LangmuirHinshelwood theory). An increase of this concentration will result in a corresponding increase of the reaction speed. Inversely, any change affecting the reaction speed will modify the surface concentration of the intermediate surface species. The reactant pressure is generally an effective way for such a perturbation.
The determination of real reaction intermediates in the synthesis of methanol from CO and H2 is difficult, and many surface species appear on the catalyst: carbonyls, formates,carbonates and methoxy groups. This reaction has been studied on zinc aluminate supported copper catalysts, and it is a very good example of the combined use of operando spectroscopy and on-line analysis for the determination of mechanism and reaction intermediates.129 Two separate reac- tion mechanisms are possible. Insertion of CO under a surface OH group can lead to surface formate groups, further con- verted into methoxy surface groups, and leading to methanol after hydrogenation. In the case of an active copper catalyst,neither copper formate nor copper methoxy species are detected:methoxy groups on the support only build up (in high amounts) on the surface. Desorption is the limiting step, and the methanol formation rate is linked to the product of surface concentrations of methoxy groups and hydrogen. Both species,methoxy groups on the support and hydrogen on copper, are located on two separate adsorption sites. The second possible route is hydrogenation of copper carbonyls via formyl species.
The corresponding kinetic equation is the product of surface concentrations of carbonyl groups and of hydrogen. To check which is the main mechanism, the approach used was to keep hydrogen partial pressure constant, while varying that of carbon monoxide. In the formate mechanism, the equation becomes very simple. The surface concentration of dissociated H2 is constant and the reaction speed only depends on the surface methoxy group concentration: VMeOH = k1[CH3O][H] = k10[CH3O] The formate mechanism was easily excluded, since the surface methoxy concentration clearly was not linearly linked to the amount of methanol produced. In the case of the carbonyl mechanism, the LangmuirHinshelwood theory leads to two equations, depending on the competitive or non-competitive adsorption of CO and hydrogen. If the adsorption is non- competitive, and with constant hydrogen pressure: VMeOH = k200(KCOPCO)/(1 + KCOPCO) For the competitive adsorption, the result is slightly different: VMeOH = k200(KCOPCO)/(1 + KCOPCO)2 KCO was measured easily because the surface carbonyl concentration is directly linked to PCO. The equations corres- ponding to the competitive and non-competitive adsorption were fit to the experimental point at the highest PCO. A very nice fit was obtained for the competitive adsorption (Fig. 17).
Thus, the reaction mechanism was determined together with the adsorption site. Combining surface and gas species in the kinetic modelling of the system is one of the most powerful approaches for operando spectroscopy.
Transient studies Kinetic measurements can be performed with two main approaches: steady state or transient states. In steady state studies, changing a concentration in the gas feed will change Fig. 16 Variation of COS conversion with the area I of the band d(OH) (at 1220 cm1) of HOCO2 species formed from CO2 adsorption on different metal oxides.77 Reproduced by permission of Springer.

Studying transient states is performed by taking advantage of the time resolution of spectroscopic and analytic techniques. Infrared spectra can be recorded fairly quickly, and a time resolution of 0.1 s is routine on any commercial FT instrument. In order to draw conclusions on the kinetics at the time scale of 0.1 s, the whole chain of events in the catalytic setup needs to be controlled and determined at the same time resolution (at least). On-line analyses can be performed quickly with IR gas cells. Mass spectra can be recorded at ca. 1 data point per second, and fast GC can lead to a chromatogram per minute. These information can be combined, and the time scale of the observation will depend on the technique used. One important parameter is the time resolution of the catalytic reactor itself. With a long residence time, gases will be mixed in the reactor, with a consequent loss in the time resolution of the whole experiment.
Short residence time can only be achieved with a low dead volume in the reactor. IR micro reactor-cells have been designed which allow very short residence time and space velocity of 50 000 h1 can be achieved. In this sense, our laboratory has performed considerable efforts in the last two decades.
Freysz et al.130 have used two complementary techniques for gas products analysis: FTIR using a gas microcell (multireflection cell with an inner volume of 88 ml) and mass spectrometry. The dead volumes are minimized in the whole system in order to allow time-resolved analysis in particular inside the
IR
reactor cell.131 The time resolution of both surface analysis and gas analysis is around 12 s. This methodology was applied to study the reduction of NO by CO on a silica-supported platinum catalyst by the addition of very small CO pulses (20 ml) in a continuous NO flow.130 The simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis and the correlation of both surface species and gas phase evolution during the transient-pulse catalytic reaction indicated that a direct reaction between CO and NO (adsorbed or not) must be rejected. When a pulse of CO is sent, two distinct successive periods are observed (Fig. 18). The first period concerns the reduction of Pt by CO. The diminution of the NO/Pt concen- tration at the beginning of the pulse does not correspond to a significant reduction of NO (no significant production of N2/N2O), but to a desorption of nitrogen monoxide: the amount of observed gas NO increases during this period.
The adsorbing CO displaces NO from the surface but does not react with it. The concomitant production of CO2 can then only be explained by a reaction between CO and the initially Fig. 17 Experimental () rates of methanol formation as a function of PCO.

Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 4947 adsorbed oxygen: CO reduces the platinum surface. The second period corresponds to the reduction of NO. At the end of the pulse, CO progressively disappears from the surface, whereas NO re-adsorbs on the Pt sites. The important NO consumption does not correspond only to this re-adsorption,but mainly to an important N2/N2O production (i.e. to NOx reduction). Remaining COlin/Ptred undergoes a total oxidation into CO2, because no more CO is observed in the gas phase and no more carbonaceous species are observed on the surface (if we except the initial COlin/Ptox spectator species). This second CO2 production corresponds to the N2/N2O forma- tion, and NO is the only possible oxidant: COlin/Ptred is the origin of NO reduction. At the end of the pulse, the NO/Pt concentration is higher than at the beginning. In fact, adsorbed nitrosyl species now occupy Pt sites which were unavailable before the pulse as other species were already adsorbed (Oads or nitrates). The surface then slowly returns to its initial equilibrium.
Studying very short lived intermediates cannot be done with standard catalytic setups and spectrometers. Both parameters have to be controlled, the time resolution of the catalytic setup, and of the spectroscopic observation. Very high time resolution (B10 ns) can be achieved by special recording techniques such as step scan interferometry. Step scan inter- ferometry only records one point of the interferogram over time, and the measurement has to be repeated many times so that all the points in the interferogram can be collected. The IR spectra themselves are obtained after Fourier transform of all the recomposed interferograms. The catalytic experiment therefore needs to be well controlled in time but also highly reproducible. If the start of the reaction is well controlled in time, the various states of the surface can be recorded over time and the observation can be reproduced so that results are co-added to lower the detection limit. Fast valves allow millisecond control over the reaction, which can be coupled with millisecond step scan interferometry.132 Nanosecond control of a reaction is achieved with laser triggered reaction,mostly in photochemistry.133 Thermal reactions can also be observed, and that of CO and NO on Ag supported on alumina was induced by an ultrafast pulsed laser, after which the state of the adsorbed species was monitored by step scan FT IR at 33 ns time resolution.134 The transformation of cyanides on silver into isocyanates on alumina is the limiting step of the reaction. This step could be recorded, and a bridged intermediate was detected between the silver particle and the alumina surface. This intermediate only lasts 2 microseconds,and it leads to the formation of an isocyanide on AlVI (AlVI is statistically the most accessible site), which in turn is quickly oxidized into an isocyanate and transferred to the stronger Lewis acid AlIV. The interface between the Ag particle and the alumina support plays a key role in the catalytic activity,and this helps understanding the role of the particle size (see Scheme 3).
Spatial resolution A fundamental point for a complete and trustful catalyst characterisation is the identification of the exact position of the sites along the catalytic bed. Shaped catalysts are in fact far from being homogeneous objects: extrudates or pebbles are often quite heterogeneous (even coreshell objects), while the washcoating process is more an art than a science and active phase deposition experts proceed using empirical techniques. We should also mention that for both monoliths and pebble shaped catalysts, binders are unavoidable com- ponents, constituting up to 30% of the total material mass.
Furthermore, monolith shaped catalysts are often multi- layered, so that the space identification of the site is a real and crucial problem.
As shown out by Weckhuysen in his recent review about spatial resolution in catalysis,135 the few tentative studies of monitoring a catalyst by infrared light use IR microscopy.
This technique is detailed in another contribution of this issue.
It is interesting to remark that using synchrotron light in spite of a classical IR source, the spatial resolution is significantly boosted, allowing to catch sites in action at an impressive spatial resolution, such as distinguishing between the different morphological elements of a zeolitic single-crystal.136 The combination of synchrotron-based IR spectral imaging and label-free coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering can further enhance the details of a working surface at the level to show the multidimensional distribution of reactants and products in zeolite crystals with micrometre resolution, highlighting the importance of diffusion barriers and capillary forces imposed by a pore network for the catalytic activity.137 We wish to mention here that very recently we have obtained the first spectra of a catalyst shaped onto a monolith using direct transmission IR spectroscopy, allowing a precise and quantitative analysis of the adsorbed species, in real operando conditions (keeping the reaction shape of the honey- comb, as well as the real reaction gas composition). Preliminary Scheme 3 Detailed mechanism for the limiting step of the conversion of NO and CO on alumina supported silver catalyst. The cyanide intermediate is transformed after the laser pulse into a isocyanide via a bridged species (lasting 2 ms on the surface) between the silver particle and an aluminium VI atom on the alumina support.134 Reproduced by permission of American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Conclusions IR spectroscopy can provide valuable and pertinent infor- mation on the adsorption sites on a catalyst, both directly or via the adsorption of adapted probe molecules (the best probe is always the reactants themselves). Physicalchemical properties of the sites can be described and ranked vs. reference com- pounds: acidity, basicity, redox properties are verified and quantified in strength and as site concentrations.
Different operando techniques can complete such a view discriminating which sites play a role in the catalytic reaction,behaving as active sites or just hosting reacting agents or products. A catalytic site in action cannot be separated from its respective intermediate, so that the problem of site detection during the catalytic reaction is strongly connected to that of intermediates. In this view, we have also tried to answer the frequently asked question of what can really be seen by IR spectroscopy during the reaction process.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How does Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contribute to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts, particularly in terms of their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity, and what insights can it provide about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility, as exemplified by studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
