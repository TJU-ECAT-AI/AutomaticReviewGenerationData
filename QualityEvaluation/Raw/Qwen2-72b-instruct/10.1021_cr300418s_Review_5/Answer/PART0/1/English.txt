Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques such as XRD, SEM, XPS, CH4 TPR-MS, and O2-TPD, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It helps to understand the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, such as reducibility. For instance, in the study of Ce-doped CoCr2O4, Raman spectroscopy along with other techniques revealed that cerium doping deforms the spinel structure, causes redistribution of metal ions with different oxidation states, increases crystal defects and oxygen vacancy concentration, which facilitates oxygen mobility and enhances the catalytic performance of the doped catalysts.

Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. The addition of alkali promoters to vanadia/titania catalysts induces a red shift of the vibration frequency related to the V O bond, indicating a weakening of the V O double bond. This weakening can affect the activity of the material if the vanadyl group is involved in the reaction. Moreover, the hydrogenation process is more favorable for undoped systems, and the alkali-doped systems show a decrease of the first hydrogen adsorption energy in the order undoped > Li > Na > K. The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system, and the reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table.

Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, can contribute significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It can provide insights into the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of these materials. Studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania have shown that Raman spectroscopy can reveal information about the reducibility of the catalysts, which is crucial for understanding their catalytic properties. The spectral features obtained from Raman spectroscopy can be correlated with the catalyst properties, such as the degree of reduction, which is an important factor in determining the catalytic activity. Raman spectroscopy can also help in understanding the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, such as reducibility, and can identify the presence of specific dopants and their impact on the catalyst's electronic and vibrational properties, which in turn affect the catalyst's performance. By correlating the Raman spectral features with the catalyst's activity and selectivity, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the structure-activity relationships and optimize the catalyst design for improved performance.

The literature emphasizes the importance of using multiple spectroscopic techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, to gain a comprehensive understanding of catalyst structure and activity. Raman spectroscopy is highlighted for its ability to provide molecular level insights into the structure of catalytic active sites and associated surface intermediates under reaction conditions. The combined use of several complementary techniques, including Raman, UVvis-DRS, IR, and others, can afford more detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites, surface reaction intermediates, and their adsorption sites on the catalyst. This combination can help establish links between catalyst structure and activity/selectivity during reaction conditions. Operando spectroscopy, which combines in situ spectroscopy with simultaneous activity measurements under catalytic reaction conditions, is also emphasized. Raman spectroscopy is suitable for studying supported oxides due to the minimal interference from the gas phase and its ability to function over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. The use of several spectroscopic techniques can provide complementary information, contributing to a more detailed understanding of the electronic and molecular structures of catalytic active sites and surface reaction intermediates.
