          [1] "Characterization studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (CH4 TPR-MS) and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) were carried out."
          [2] "The characterization results indicated that cerium doping could deform the spinel structure and cause redistribution of metal ions with different oxidation states; consequently, they would increase crystal defects and oxygen vacancy concentration, which facilitate oxygen mobility and thus increase the catalytic performance of cerium modified cobalt chromite catalysts."

          Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques such as XRD, SEM, XPS, CH4 TPR-MS, and O2-TPD, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It helps to understand the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, such as reducibility. For instance, in the study of Ce-doped CoCr2O4, Raman spectroscopy along with other techniques revealed that cerium doping deforms the spinel structure, causes redistribution of metal ions with different oxidation states, increases crystal defects and oxygen vacancy concentration, which facilitates oxygen mobility and enhances the catalytic performance of the doped catalysts.

          拉曼光谱与XRD，SEM，XPS，CH4 TPR-MS和O2-TPD等其他分析技术结合，通过提供有关其组成，结构，原位行为和反应性的见解，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征做出了贡献。它有助于理解光谱特征与催化剂性质（如还原性）之间的关系。例如，在Ce掺杂CoCr2O4的研究中，拉曼光谱与XRD一起揭示了铈掺杂会变形尖晶石结构并导致具有不同氧化态的金属离子的重新分布，导致晶体缺陷和氧空位浓度增加。这促进了氧的流动性，并增强了掺杂催化剂的催化性能。
