[1] "The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (V O). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V O bond. It indicates a weakening of the V O double bond."
[2] "The hydrogenation process is exothermic [31] and more favorable for undoped systems according to the values shown in Fig. 3, Table 2. For the same VOTi (OB) site, the alkali-doped systems show a decrease of the first hydrogen adsorption energy in the order undoped (2.97 eV) > Li (2.70 eV) > Na (2.63 eV) > K (2.54 eV)."
[3] "The effect of the alkali metal addition to the vanadia/titania catalysts on the reduction profiles is shown in Fig. 4. All catalysts keep the same V/alkali ion atomic ratio. The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table."

1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. The red shift of the vibration frequency related to the V O bond in alkali-doped catalysts indicates a weakening of the V O double bond, which is a key factor in determining the catalyst's reducibility. The hydrogenation process is more favorable for undoped systems, and the first hydrogen adsorption energy decreases in the order undoped > Li > Na > K for the same VOTi (OB) site. The addition of alkali metals to vanadia/titania catalysts decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species, with the reduction becoming more difficult as the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table increases.

1.拉曼光谱法与其他分析技术相结合，通过提供有关掺杂催化剂的组成、结构、原位行为和反应性的见解，有助于全面表征和理解掺杂催化剂。在掺杂催化剂中，与V O键相关的振动频率的红移表明V O双键的减弱，这是决定催化剂还原性的关键因素。对于相同的VOTi (OB)位点，氢化过程对未掺杂的系统更有利，第一氢吸附能按未掺杂> Li > Na > K的顺序降低。向钒钛催化剂中添加碱金属会降低分散的钒氧化物物种的还原性，随着碱金属在周期表中的周期增加，还原变得更加困难。
