[1] "The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (V O). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V O bond. It indicates a weakening of the V O double bond."
[2] "The hydrogenation process is exothermic [31] and more favorable for undoped systems according to the values shown in Fig. 3, Table 2. For the same VOTi (OB) site, the alkali-doped systems show a decrease of the first hydrogen adsorption energy in the order undoped (2.97 eV) > Li (2.70 eV) > Na (2.63 eV) > K (2.54 eV)."
[3] "The effect of the alkali metal addition to the vanadia/titania catalysts on the reduction profiles is shown in Fig. 4. All catalysts keep the same V/alkali ion atomic ratio. The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table."

1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. For instance, the addition of alkali promoters to vanadia/titania catalysts induces a red shift in the vibration frequency related to the V O bond, indicating a weakening of the V O double bond. This weakening is reflected in the changes in reducibility, as evidenced by the decrease in hydrogen adsorption energy for alkali-doped systems compared to undoped systems. The reducibility decreases in the order undoped > Li > Na > K, which is consistent with the trend observed in the experimental reduction profiles. These findings highlight the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility.

1.拉曼光谱法与其他分析技术相结合，通过提供有关掺杂催化剂的组成、结构、原位行为和反应性的见解，为全面表征和理解掺杂催化剂做出了贡献。例如，将碱金属促进剂添加到钒钛催化剂中会导致与V O键相关的振动频率的红移，表明V O双键的减弱。这种减弱反映在还原性的变化中，正如掺杂系统与未掺杂系统相比氢吸附能的降低所证明的那样。还原性按未掺杂>锂>钠>钾的顺序降低，这与实验还原曲线中观察到的趋势一致。这些发现突出了光谱特征与催化剂性质（如还原性）之间的关系。
