[1] "The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (V O). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V O bond. It indicates a weakening of the V O double bond."
[2] "The hydrogenation process is exothermic [31] and more favorable for undoped systems according to the values shown in Fig. 3, Table 2. For the same VOTi (OB) site, the alkali-doped systems show a decrease of the first hydrogen adsorption energy in the order undoped (2.97 eV) > Li (2.70 eV) > Na (2.63 eV) > K (2.54 eV)."
[3] "The effect of the alkali metal addition to the vanadia/titania catalysts on the reduction profiles is shown in Fig. 4. All catalysts keep the same V/alkali ion atomic ratio. The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table."

1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. For instance, the addition of alkali promoters to vanadia/titania catalysts leads to a red shift in the vibration frequency of the vanadyl group, indicating a weakening of the V O double bond. This weakening is related to the reducibility of the catalyst, as evidenced by the decrease in hydrogen adsorption energy for alkali-doped systems compared to undoped systems. The reducibility decreases in the order undoped > Li > Na > K, which is consistent with the trend observed in the reduction profiles of the catalysts. These findings suggest that Raman spectroscopy can provide valuable information about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, such as reducibility.

1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. The technique can reveal changes in the vibrational frequencies of specific chemical bonds, such as the vanadyl group (V O), which can indicate the weakening of the bond upon the addition of alkali promoters. This weakening is evidenced by a red shift in the Raman band, suggesting a decrease in the bond's strength. The technique also allows for the observation of changes in reducibility, as seen in the hydrogen adsorption energy, which decreases in the order undoped > Li > Na > K for the same VOTi (OB) site. This trend is further supported by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles, which show that the reducibility decreases with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table. These insights into the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, such as reducibility, are crucial for understanding the behavior of doped catalysts in various reactions.
