[1] "The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (V O). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V O bond. It indicates a weakening of the V O double bond."
[2] "The hydrogenation process is exothermic [31] and more favorable for undoped systems according to the values shown in Fig. 3, Table 2. For the same VOTi (OB) site, the alkali-doped systems show a decrease of the first hydrogen adsorption energy in the order undoped (2.97 eV) > Li (2.70 eV) > Na (2.63 eV) > K (2.54 eV)."
[3] "The effect of the alkali metal addition to the vanadia/titania catalysts on the reduction profiles is shown in Fig. 4. All catalysts keep the same V/alkali ion atomic ratio. The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table."

1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. For instance, the addition of alkali promoters to vanadia/titania catalysts induces a red shift of the vibration frequency related to the V O bond, indicating a weakening of the V O double bond. This weakening can affect the activity of the material if the vanadyl group is involved in the reaction. Moreover, the hydrogenation process is more favorable for undoped systems, and the alkali-doped systems show a decrease of the first hydrogen adsorption energy in the order undoped > Li > Na > K. The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system, and the reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table.

1.拉曼光谱法与其他分析技术相结合，通过提供有关掺杂催化剂的组成、结构、原位行为和反应性的见解，有助于全面表征和理解掺杂催化剂。例如，向钒钛催化剂添加碱金属促进剂会使与V O键相关的振动频率发生红移，表明V O双键的减弱。如果钒氧基团参与反应，这种减弱可能会影响材料的活性。此外，氢化过程对未掺杂的系统更有利，而掺杂的系统在未掺杂>锂>钠>钾的顺序中显示出第一氢吸附能的降低。锂离子的存在降低了分散的钒氧化物物种的可还原性，与未掺杂的系统相比，随着碱金属原子在周期表中的周期增加，还原变得更加困难。
