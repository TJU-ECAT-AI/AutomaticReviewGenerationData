[1] "The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (V O). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V O bond. It indicates a weakening of the V O double bond."
[2] "The hydrogenation process is exothermic [31] and more favorable for undoped systems according to the values shown in Fig. 3, Table 2. For the same VOTi (OB) site, the alkali-doped systems show a decrease of the first hydrogen adsorption energy in the order undoped (2.97 eV) > Li (2.70 eV) > Na (2.63 eV) > K (2.54 eV)."
[3] "The effect of the alkali metal addition to the vanadia/titania catalysts on the reduction profiles is shown in Fig. 4. All catalysts keep the same V/alkali ion atomic ratio. The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table."

1.Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. The technique can reveal changes in the vibrational frequencies of specific chemical bonds, such as the vanadyl group (V O), which can indicate the weakening of the bond upon the addition of alkali promoters. This weakening is evidenced by a red shift in the Raman band, suggesting a decrease in the bond's strength. The technique also allows for the observation of changes in reducibility, as seen in the hydrogen adsorption energy, which decreases in the order undoped > Li > Na > K for the same VOTi (OB) site. This trend is further supported by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles, which show that the reducibility decreases with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table. These insights into the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, such as reducibility, are crucial for understanding the behavior of doped catalysts in various reactions.

1.拉曼光谱法与其他分析技术结合，通过提供催化剂组成、结构、原位行为和反应性的见解，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了贡献。该技术可以揭示特定化学键，如钒氧基团（V O）的振动频率变化，这可以表明在添加碱金属促进剂后，键的强度减弱。这种减弱通过拉曼带的红移得以体现，表明键强度的降低。该技术还允许观察到还原性的变化，如在相同的VOTi（OB）位点，氢吸附能按未掺杂>锂>钠>钾的顺序递减。这一趋势在温度程序还原（TPR）曲线中得到进一步支持，曲线显示，随着碱金属在周期表中的周期增加，还原性降低。这些关于光谱特征与催化剂性质（如还原性）之间关系的见解，对于理解掺杂催化剂在各种反应中的行为至关重要。
