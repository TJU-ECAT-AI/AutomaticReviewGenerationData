Stabilization of cationic gold species on Au/CeO2 catalysts under working conditions Patricia Concepcio n, Silvio Carrettin, Avelino Corma * Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica (UPV-CSIC), Universidad Politecnica de Valencia, Avda de los Naranjos s/n, 46022 Valencia, Spain Available online 17 April 2006 Abstract Infrared spectroscopy of CO adsorption at low temperature has shown the presence of oxidized gold species (Au+ and Au3+) on nanocrystalline Au/CeO2 catalyst. This species are quite stable even under reduction conditions like the CO oxidation reaction. The concentration of this species decrease by increasing the pre-treatment temperature of the Au/CeO2 catalyst which is in accordance with a decrease in the catalytic activity of the sample. In accordance oxidized gold species are involved in the catalytic activity of Au/CeO2 catalyst for CO oxidation although the participation of metallic sites cannot be excluded.

1. Introduction
In the last years gold catalysts supported on metal oxides have been reported to be highly active for several reactions including low temperature CO oxidation [13]. It has been shown how the catalytic activity of these catalysts is strongly influenced by gold particle size, synthesis method, pre- treatment conditions and the nature of the support [3]. The supports have been differentiated between those able to provide oxygen (reducible) and those not able to do so because of their inability to adsorb oxygen [4]. In the case of reducible oxides supports, oxygen is thought to adsorb on the support and successively interact with the CO adsorbed on the gold particles [5], for this reason the activity is extremely dependent on the type of structure of the metal-support interface [4]. Thus, it has been presented that gold clusters supported on nanocrystalline and mesostructured nanocrystalline CeO2 or Y2O3 is much more active for oxidations [68] as well as for carboncarbon bond formation [9] than gold clusters on conventional CeO2 or Y2O3 supports. More specifically, supported on nanocrystalline CeO2 presents high activity for CO oxidation [6] and the support supplies reactive oxygen (in the form of superoxide and peroxide species) to the active gold sites [10]. The interface between metallic gold particles and the support appears to be critical for high CO oxidation activity [10,11], and time- resolved XANES spectra have shown the presence of cationic gold clusters in the Au/CeO2 catalyst, which were stable during CO oxidation [12]. The presence of Au+ and Au3+ species has also been evidenced by XPS analysis [10]. Several authors suggested the crucial role of oxidized gold species [13,14], or even the cooperative role of metallic and oxidized gold species [15,16] for the low temperature CO oxidation, while others propose only metallic gold as the active species [17].
In the work reported here FTIR spectroscopy has been employed, as a surface sensitive technique, in order to determine the nature of gold species present on Au/CeO2 catalysts under reaction conditions. Due to the rapid reduction at room temperature of ionic gold in contact with CO, even in the presence of oxygen, the characterisation of the catalyst was carried out by freezing down the reaction in liquid N2 and analyzing the nature of gold species using CO as a probe molecule.
2. Experimental
The catalysts were prepared starting from nanocrystalline CeO2 and HAuCl4 according to a procedure previously described [6]. As-prepared samples and H2-reduced samples at 373 and 573 K have been studied. www.elsevier.com/locate/apcata Applied Catalysis A: General 307 (2006) 4245 * Corresponding author.

The FTIR spectra have been collected with a FTS-40A BioRad spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector. An IR cell allowing in situ treatments in controlled atmospheres and temperatures from 90 to 573 K has been connected to a vacuum system with gas dosing facility. Prior to CO adsorption experiments the samples have been exposed at 272 K, in situ, to a mixture of 2% CO1% O297% He at 25 ml/min for 2 h. Afterward the samples were evacuated at 1.01  101 mbar at 273 K during 30 min, and then cooled down to 90 K at
1.01  101 mbar. CO adsorption experiments have been
performed at 90 K by increasing CO dosing pressure. Lorentzian curves have been used for curve fitting of the IR spectra.
3. Results and discussion
The catalytic activity of gold supported on nanocrystalline CeO2 strongly depends on the catalyst pre-treatment (Fig. 1).
The highest catalytic activity was obtained with the as-prepared catalyst while reduction in H2 strongly reduces the activity.
Sintering of gold metal particles due to high temperature pre- treatment has been reported to decrease drastically the activity of gold supported catalysts [3]. However in this case, although the presence of metallic gold particles has been seen in all samples, TEM and EXAFS results [12] have shown no sintering of gold nanoparticles on the Au/CeO2 catalyst under pre- treatment conditions at 573 K, and/or during catalytic oxidation of CO. FTIR spectra of CO adsorption at 90 K on the Au/CeO2 samples after in situ CO oxidation reaction at 273 K are shown in Fig. 2. IR bands at 2154, 2138 and 2100 cm1 are

The samples have been exposed in situ for the CO oxidation reaction at 273 K for 2 h prior to CO adsorption experiments. observed. The low frequency band at 2100 cm1 is assigned to CO adsorbed on metallic gold species. However an asymmetry at lower frequencies is observed in the as-prepared sample indicating the presence of unsaturated sites [18,19]. The assignation of the high frequency IR bands is still controversial in the literature. FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed on pure CeO2 shows a broad asymmetric band with two main components at 2162 and 2148 cm1 related to CO adsorbed on Ce4+ cations with different coordinative unsaturation [20]. In the Au/CeO2 samples the IR spectra of CO adsorption in the high frequency region is characterised by the presence of two strong bands at 2154 and 2138 cm1. In addition to both bands, difference spectra obtained at different CO adsorptions shows the presence of a third band at 2148 cm1, related to Ce4+ ions of the CeO2 support (spectra not shown). As seen in Fig. 2 the intensity of the 2154 cm1 IR band is quite similar in all samples while the intensity of the 2138 cm1 IR band decreases when increasing the reduction temperature of the sample. The 2154 cm1 IR band has been assigned to Au+ cations [18,21,22], while other assignations related with Ce4+ ions slightly modified by gold species in gold/ceria catalysts [20] and/or OH groups [23] could also be found in the literature. The last two possibilities could be disregarded in our case since a band at 2154 cm1 has been also observed with gold on a different support (Au/TiO2) and due to the high stability of the IR band is not expected in the case of CO adsorbed on OH groups. Thus, in agreement with some authors [18,21,22], we can assign this band to CO adsorbed on Au+ species.
The band at 2138 cm1 has been assigned to CO adsorbed on gold metal atoms directly bonded to adsorbed oxygen [18,19,21,24] in analogy with a similar band observed by SERS and assigned to CO adsorbed on oxidized gold sites [25].
Other assignations like Au metallic particles strongly inter- acting with the support surface [26] or liquid-like CO [20] have also been reported in the literature. However, this last interpretation could be disregarded in our case since the intensity of the IR band change with the catalyst pre-treatment independent of the CO pressure.
XPS results of the Au/CeO2 catalyst show the presence of Au3+ in the as-prepared sample, while no Au3+ is observed in the 573 K hydrogen reduced sample. This observation agrees with the FTIR spectra of the same samples where the 2138 cm1 IR band is present in the as-prepared sample and absent in the reduced one. On the other hand, we have observed a decrease of the intensity of the 2138 cm1 IR band in the as- prepared samples after exposing the sample to air for some time (spectra not shown). This could be related to a reduction of oxidized gold species by exposure of the sample to air. On the other hand, EXAFS results shows the presence of two AuO interactions with oxygen atoms of the support at different distances [12], indicating the presence of two different types of oxidized gold species. Thus we can tentatively assign the 2138 cm1 band to an oxidized Aun+ (n > 1, probably n = 3) specie in the perimeter interface with the support, while the 2154 cm1 band can be assign to Au+. The unexpected low frequency of the 2138 cm1 IR band assigned to an oxidized Aun+ (n > 1) specie compared with the 2154 cm1 IR band assigned to Au+ specie could be related to the contribution of d electrons in the Aun+. An increase of the carbonyl stretching frequency with increasing the electric field strength at the cation centre is only observed for a d0 electron configuration [27].
However this is not always the case for transition metal ions with d electrons whose electronic orbitals are easily modified by interaction with an adsorbed molecule. In this way unexpected frequencies have already been observed for vanadia and could be also observed for cobalt ionic species [28], and can also occur in the case of gold. Theoretical calculations are in progress to confirm this behaviour in the case of gold ionic species.
The concentration of the different gold species observed in the Au/CeO2 catalysts during catalytic CO oxidation, Table 1,evidence how oxidized gold species are stabilized on these samples during reaction. Moreover oxidized gold species (Au+ and Au3+) have also been observed by other authors by means of XPS in Au/CeO2 catalyst under water gas shift conditions [11]. In order to determine the influence of these species on the catalytic behaviour of the Au/CeO2 samples during CO oxidation at low temperature, a correlation between oxidized and metallic gold species with the catalytic activity has been done (Fig. 3). The catalytic activity increases with the concentration of oxidized gold species (Au+ + Au3+)/Au0 however a linear correlation is not observed. The highest catalytic activity observed in the as-prepared sample seems to indicate that besides the above cationic gold species other species also contribute to the catalytic activity. In fact FTIR spectra show the presence of highly unsaturated sites in the metallic gold particles of the as-prepared sample, which according to previous observations contribute in some way to the catalytic activity [6]. EXAFS results [12] have shown that oxidized species (Au+ and Au3+) are related with the perimeter interface of the gold particle and the support. Thus the positive catalytic effect of small particle size gold is related to the stabilization of oxidized as well as unsaturated gold species.
In conclusion, we have shown that oxidized gold species are stabilized during the catalytic activity of Au/CeO2 catalysts for
