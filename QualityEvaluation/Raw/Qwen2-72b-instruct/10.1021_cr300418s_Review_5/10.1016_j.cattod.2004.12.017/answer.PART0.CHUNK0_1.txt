1.The literature does not provide specific examples or details about the use of Raman spectroscopy in combination with other analytical techniques to characterize doped catalysts such as Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania. However, it does emphasize the importance of operando spectroscopy, which combines in situ spectroscopy with simultaneous activity measurements under catalytic reaction conditions. Raman spectroscopy is highlighted for its suitability in studying supported oxides due to the minimal interference from the gas phase and its ability to function over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. The literature also mentions that the use of several spectroscopic techniques can provide complementary information, contributing to a more detailed understanding of the electronic and molecular structures of catalytic active sites and surface reaction intermediates.

1.文献没有提供关于使用拉曼光谱法结合其他分析技术来表征诸如Ce掺杂CoCr2O4或碱金属掺杂的二氧化钛上钒酸盐等掺杂催化剂的具体示例或详细信息。然而，它确实强调了原位光谱法的重要性，该方法结合了在催化反应条件下进行的原位光谱法和同时的活性测量。拉曼光谱法因其在气体相中干扰最小以及在广泛温度和压力范围内工作的能力而被突出强调，适用于研究氧化物支撑物。文献还提到，使用几种光谱技术可以提供互补信息，有助于更详细地理解催化活性位点和表面反应中间体的电子和分子结构。
