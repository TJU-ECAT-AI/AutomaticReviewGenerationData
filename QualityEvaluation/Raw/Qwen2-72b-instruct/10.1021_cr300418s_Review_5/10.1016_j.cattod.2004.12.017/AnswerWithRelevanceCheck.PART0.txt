          The literature emphasizes the importance of using multiple spectroscopic techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, to gain a comprehensive understanding of catalyst structure and activity. Raman spectroscopy is highlighted for its ability to provide molecular level insights into the structure of catalytic active sites and associated surface intermediates under reaction conditions. The combined use of several complementary techniques, including Raman, UVvis-DRS, IR, and others, can afford more detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites, surface reaction intermediates, and their adsorption sites on the catalyst. This combination can help establish links between catalyst structure and activity/selectivity during reaction conditions. Operando spectroscopy, which combines in situ spectroscopy with simultaneous activity measurements under catalytic reaction conditions, is also emphasized. Raman spectroscopy is suitable for studying supported oxides due to the minimal interference from the gas phase and its ability to function over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. The use of several spectroscopic techniques can provide complementary information, contributing to a more detailed understanding of the electronic and molecular structures of catalytic active sites and surface reaction intermediates.

          文献强调了使用多种光谱技术，包括拉曼光谱法，来全面理解催化剂结构和活性的重要性。拉曼光谱法因其能够在反应条件下提供催化活性位点和相关表面中间体的分子水平见解而被突出。几种互补技术（包括拉曼、UVvis-DRS、IR等）的联合使用可以提供更详细的电子和分子结构见解，了解表面催化活性位点、表面反应中间体及其在催化剂上的吸附位点的性质。这种组合有助于在反应条件下建立催化剂结构与活性/选择性之间的联系。还强调了原位光谱法，该方法结合了在催化反应条件下进行的原位光谱法和同时的活性测量。拉曼光谱法因其在气体相中干扰最小以及在广泛温度和压力范围内工作的能力而被突出强调，适用于研究氧化物支撑物。使用几种光谱技术可以提供互补信息，有助于更详细地理解催化活性位点和表面反应中间体的电子和分子结构。
