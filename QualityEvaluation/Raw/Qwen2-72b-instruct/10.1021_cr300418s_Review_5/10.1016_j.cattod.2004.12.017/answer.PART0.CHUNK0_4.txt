1.The literature does not provide specific examples or details about the use of Raman spectroscopy in combination with other analytical techniques to characterize doped catalysts, such as Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania. However, it does emphasize the importance of using multiple spectroscopic techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of catalyst structure and activity. Raman spectroscopy is noted for its ability to provide molecular level insights into the structure of catalytic active sites and associated surface intermediates under reaction conditions. When combined with other techniques like UVvis-DRS, IR, and EPR, it can offer a more detailed understanding of oxidation states, chemisorbed species, and the nature of catalytic active sites during reaction conditions.

1.文献没有提供关于使用拉曼光谱法结合其他分析技术来表征掺杂催化剂（如Ce掺杂CoCr2O4和碱金属掺杂的二氧化钛上的钒酸盐）的具体例子或细节。但是，它确实强调了使用多种光谱技术来全面理解催化剂结构和活性的重要性。拉曼光谱法被指出能够提供分子水平的见解，了解催化活性位点的结构和相关表面中间体在反应条件下的情况。当与UVvis-DRS、IR和EPR等其他技术结合时，它可以提供更详细的氧化态、化学吸附物种和催化活性位点在反应条件下的性质的理解。
