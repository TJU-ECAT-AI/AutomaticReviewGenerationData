1.The literature does not provide specific examples or details about the use of Raman spectroscopy in combination with other analytical techniques to characterize doped catalysts, such as Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania. However, it does emphasize the importance of using multiple spectroscopic techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of catalyst structure and activity. Raman spectroscopy is highlighted for its ability to provide molecular level insights into the structure-activity relationships of catalytic active sites and surface intermediates under reaction conditions. The combined use of several complementary techniques, including Raman, UVvis-DRS, IR, and others, is said to afford more detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites, surface reaction intermediates, and their adsorption sites on the catalyst. This combination can help establish links between catalyst structure and activity/selectivity during reaction conditions.

1.文献没有提供关于使用拉曼光谱法与其他分析技术结合来表征掺杂催化剂（如Ce掺杂的CoCr2O4和碱金属掺杂的二氧化钛上的钒酸盐）的具体实例或细节。但是，它确实强调了使用多种光谱技术来全面理解催化剂结构和活性的重要性。拉曼光谱法因其能够在反应条件下提供催化活性位点和表面中间体的分子水平见解而被突出。几种互补技术（包括拉曼、UVvis-DRS、IR等）的联合使用据说可以提供更详细的电子和分子结构见解，了解表面催化活性位点、表面反应中间体及其在催化剂上的吸附位点的性质。这种组合有助于在反应条件下建立催化剂结构与活性/选择性之间的联系。
