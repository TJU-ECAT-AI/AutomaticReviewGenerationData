1.The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. This process allows us to elucidate novel reaction mechanisms and electronic properties that are present on bimetallic surfaces, providing insights into the unique reactivity of bimetallic catalysts. The presence of subsurface Ni is critical in inducing the low-temperature activity observed on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, which is similar to the properties observed in the Co/Pt(111) system. The electronic modification of the Pt d-band center by subsurface Ni or Co atoms changes the adsorption properties of hydrogen, leading to a weaker hydrogen binding energy and lower desorption temperature of hydrogen from the bimetallic surfaces compared to clean Pt(111).

1.在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解在高级表面科学和催化研究的背景下至关重要。这一过程使我们能够阐明双金属表面上存在的新型反应机制和电子性质，为双金属催化剂的独特反应性提供了见解。亚表面Ni的存在对于诱导1 ML Ni/Pt(111)表面上观察到的低温活性至关重要，这与在Co/Pt(111)系统中观察到的性质相似。亚表面Ni或Co原子对Pt d带中心的电子改性改变了氢的吸附性质，导致与清洁Pt(111)相比，双金属表面上氢的结合能较弱，氢的脱附温度较低。

1.The literature does not provide specific details on how the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted. However, it is mentioned that extensive studies on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces have been conducted, which include the observation of low-temperature desorption of H2 and a novel self-hydrogenation pathway of cyclohexene. The presence of subsurface Ni is critical in inducing the low-temperature activity observed on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. The process is crucial for understanding the novel reactivity of bimetallic catalysts at an atomic level.

However, it is mentioned that extensive studies on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces have been carried out, which include the observation of low-temperature desorption of H2 and a novel self-hydrogenation pathway of cyclohexene. The presence of subsurface Ni is believed to be critical in inducing the low-temperature activity observed on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. The process is crucial for understanding the novel reactivity of bimetallic catalysts at an atomic level, elucidating novel reaction mechanisms and electronic properties present on bimetallic surfaces, and comparing the reactivities of 1 ML Co/Pt(111) with those of Pt(111) and thick Co films on Pt(111).

1.The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is not directly described in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the characterization of Co/Pt(111) surfaces using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. This process is crucial for understanding the structural and electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces, which in turn influences their catalytic activity. By comparing the reactivities of 1 ML Co/Pt(111) with those of Pt(111) and thick Co films on Pt(111), the literature provides insights into the novel reactivity of bimetallic catalysts and the role of subsurface Co atoms in modifying the electronic properties of the Pt(111) surface.

1.在提供的文献中，没有直接描述通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征。然而，文献确实讨论了使用Auger电子光谱（AES）和温度程序脱附（TPD）实验对Co/Pt(111)表面进行表征。这一过程对于理解双金属表面的结构和电子性质至关重要，这反过来又影响了它们的催化活性。通过比较1 ML Co/Pt(111)与Pt(111)和厚Co薄膜在Pt(111)上的反应性，文献提供了对双金属催化剂的新型反应性和次表面Co原子在修改Pt(111)表面电子性质中的作用的见解。
