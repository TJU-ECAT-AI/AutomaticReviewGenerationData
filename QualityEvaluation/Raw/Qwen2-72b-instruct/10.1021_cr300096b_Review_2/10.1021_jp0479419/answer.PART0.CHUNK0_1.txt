1.The literature does not provide specific details on how the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted. However, it is mentioned that extensive studies on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces have been conducted, which include the observation of low-temperature desorption of H2 and a novel self-hydrogenation pathway of cyclohexene. The presence of subsurface Ni is critical in inducing the low-temperature activity observed on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. The process is crucial for understanding the novel reactivity of bimetallic catalysts at an atomic level.

1.文献没有提供关于如何表征Ni/Pt双金属表面的具体细节。然而，提到了对Ni/Pt(111)双金属表面进行了广泛的研究，其中包括观察到H2的低温解吸和环己烯的新型自氢化途径。1 ML Ni/Pt(111)表面上观察到的低温活性是由子表面Ni的存在所诱导的。这一过程对于在原子水平上理解双金属催化剂的新型反应性至关重要。
