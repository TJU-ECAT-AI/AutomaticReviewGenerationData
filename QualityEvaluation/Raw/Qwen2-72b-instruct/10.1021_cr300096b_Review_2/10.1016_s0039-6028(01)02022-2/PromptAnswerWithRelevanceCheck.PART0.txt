1.The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows us to observe the initial growth and the alloy formation of Ni ultrathin films on Pt(1 1 1) surface. Several interesting structural phases were observed in this system: pseudo-(1×1), coherent epitaxy, incoherent epitaxy, and (2×2). The phase diagram was determined by LEED. In addition, the formation of NiPt alloy was investigated at various Ni coverages. The starting temperature for the alloy formation increases significantly as the Ni thin films turn into three-dimensional islands.

1.通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层来合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过使用低能电子衍射(LEED)和Auger电子光谱(AES)进行的。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解在高级表面科学和催化研究的背景下至关重要,因为它使我们能够观察Ni超薄膜在Pt(1 1 1)表面的初始生长和合金形成。在这个系统中观察到了几种有趣的结构相:伪-(1×1),相干外延,非相干外延和(2×2)。相图由LEED确定。此外,在不同的Ni覆盖率下研究了NiPt合金的形成。随着Ni薄膜变成三维岛屿,合金形成的起始温度显著增加。
