Annealing at 300C leads to the kinetic blocking of the dissolution process. We have used synchrotron radiation to measure the Pt 4f7/2 core-level shifts due to the alloying process. We estimate the Pt concentration in the surface layer to be 50%. These results are compared to previous work on the Pt/Cu(lll) system which demonstrated the formation of a Cu3Pt surface alloy. The influence of surface segregation and bulk alloying in driving the formation of a surface-alloy phase during dissolution is discussed.

1. Introduction
The study of binary surface-alloy formation by annealing of thin metallic films on a single-crystal substrate is important from several points of view. A series of technological applications, e.g. in catalysis and magnetic recording [1-4], means that these novel systems are particularly attractive. The study of model systems allows us to understand which param- eters need to be controlled to produce such alloys.
From a fundamental point of view we can obtain some insight into the basic physical processes in- volved in the formation of a surface alloy by study- ing well-chosen systems.
It has been shown that a particular surface com- * Corresponding author, Fax: +33 1 6446 4148. pound can be related to an energy balance. There is a competition or synergy between three effects [5,6]:the relative surface energies, the mixing enthalpy and the relative size effects. Under certain conditions the kinetics of the dissolution of a (finite) thin film into an (infinite) single crystal may be slowed down or even blocked due to the local, i.e. near-surface,interaction of these three effects. The result is called a surface alloy.
It follows that for a binary system AB it matters whether we deposit A on B or vice versa. With this in mind we have studied the CuPt system. In this paper we present results obtained on the Cu/Pt(lll) system and compare them with a previous study of the Pt/Cu(lll) surface, using core-level photoemis- sion spectroscopy (PES) and synchrotron radiation.
Shek et al. have already studied the growth of Cu/Pt(lll) [7]. They have shown that the Cu over- 0039-6028/95/$09.50  1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved

layer follows a layer-by-layer growth mode. They find no evidence for charge transfer between the Pt substrate and the Cu overlayer. Once the first Cu layer is completed the Pt surface peak is completely extinguished leaving a single bulk peak, with a peak maximum at a binding energy of 70.90 eV.
2. Experiment
72 71 70 binding energy (eV) The preparation of the single-crystal Cu and Pt(lll) samples has already been described in detail elsewhere [8]; the same in-situ cleaning procedure was used for both Cu and Pt.
Surface core-level photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out using synchrotron radiation at the Super- ACO storage ring, Orsay, France. The SA73b beam- line with a TGM (600 lines/mm) 7 and an experi- mental PES apparatus previously described was used.
The Pt4f7/2 PES results on Pt/Cu(lll) were obtained using an incident photon energy of 155 eV.
This corresponds to a Cooper minimum for the Pt,thus for the Cu/Pt(lll) measurements we have used a lower photon energy of 115 eV. The Fermi level is thus more easily measurable. The overall energy resolution (monochromator and electron analyser combined) was 320 and 200 meV, respectively. Peak heights typically between 5000 and 10000 counts were recorded.
3. Results
The PES results on the Pt/Cu(lll) system have already been presented in detail elsewhere [8]. Here we will concentrate on the Cu/Pt(lll) results and compare them with the salient points of the Pt/Cu(lll) study. There are three sections, first the

How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
