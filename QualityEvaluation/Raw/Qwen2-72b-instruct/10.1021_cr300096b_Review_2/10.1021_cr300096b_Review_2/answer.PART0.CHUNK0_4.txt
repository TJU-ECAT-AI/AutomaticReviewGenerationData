[1] "The characterization of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is very useful in providing structural models for DFT calculations. It is also critical in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "The AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K."
[3] "The characterization following annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from DFT calculations and experimental measurements of chemical properties."

1.The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations. It helps in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces. The AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. After annealing to 600-640 K, the characterization was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111), suggesting the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt. This process is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research.

1.在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征对于结构建模和DFT计算至关重要。它有助于将双金属结构与双金属表面的电子和化学性质相关联。AES、LEIS、XPS和STM结果证实，在300 K下沉积Ni后，Pt(111)上存在表面Ni单层。在600-640 K下退火后，表征结果与Ni扩散到Pt(111)的次表面区域一致，表明可能产生PtNiPt(111)结构，Ni原子直接位于表面Pt下方。这一过程对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。
