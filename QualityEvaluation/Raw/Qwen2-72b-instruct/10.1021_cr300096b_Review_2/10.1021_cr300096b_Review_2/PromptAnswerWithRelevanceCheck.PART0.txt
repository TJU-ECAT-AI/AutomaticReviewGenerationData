<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1.The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using various techniques such as Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). This process is crucial for structural modeling and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations as it provides detailed information about the surface structure. Additionally, it is critical for understanding the correlation between bimetallic structures and their electronic and chemical properties, which is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research.

[3] "The characterization following annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from DFT calculations and experimental measurements of chemical properties."

1.在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征对于结构建模和DFT计算至关重要。它有助于将双金属结构与双金属表面的电子和化学性质相关联。AES、LEIS、XPS和STM结果证实，在300 K下沉积Ni后，Pt(111)上存在表面Ni单层。在600-640 K下退火后，表征结果与Ni扩散到Pt(111)的次表面区域一致，表明可能产生PtNiPt(111)结构，Ni原子直接位于表面Pt下方。这一过程对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。
