1.The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using various techniques including Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). This process is crucial for structural modeling and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, as it provides detailed information about the surface structure. Furthermore, it is essential for understanding the correlation between bimetallic structures and their electronic and chemical properties, which is fundamental to advanced surface science and catalysis research.
