[1] "Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Ni onto Pt(1 1 1) single crystals at 300 K with and without subsequent annealing at 600 K, and by direct deposition of Ni at 600 K."
[2] "The structure, composition and chemical properties of these surfaces were investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of H2, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)."
[3] "Density functional theory calculations showed that subsurface Ni atoms could leads to a weaker metalhydrogen bond by modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms."

This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that subsurface Ni atoms can lead to a weaker metal-hydrogen bond by modifying the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms.

1.通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来合成Ni/Pt双金属表面，其表征采用H2的温度程序脱附(TPD)、扫描隧道显微镜(STM)、低能离子散射光谱(LEIS)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和俄歇电子能谱(AES)进行。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在高级表面科学和催化研究背景下的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。密度泛函理论计算进一步表明，次表面Ni原子可以通过改变表面Pt原子的电子结构，导致较弱的金属-氢键。

1. Ni/Pt(111)双金属表面的表征是通过在300K下将Ni物理气相沉积到Pt(111)单晶上，随后在600K下进行退火，或直接在600K下沉积Ni来制备的。这些表面的结构、组成和化学性质通过氢气的温度程序脱附(TPD)、扫描隧道显微镜(STM)、低能离子散射光谱(LEIS)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和俄歇电子能谱(AES)进行研究。密度泛函理论计算表明，次表面Ni原子可以通过改变表面Pt原子的电子结构，导致较弱的金属-氢键。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在高级表面科学和催化研究背景下的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。密度泛函理论计算进一步揭示，次表面Ni原子可以通过改变表面Pt原子的电子结构，导致较弱的金属-氢键。
