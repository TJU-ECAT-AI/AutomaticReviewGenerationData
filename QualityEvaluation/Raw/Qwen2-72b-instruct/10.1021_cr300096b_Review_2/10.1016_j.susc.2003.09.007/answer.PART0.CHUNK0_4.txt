[1] "Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Ni onto Pt(1 1 1) single crystals at 300 K with and without subsequent annealing at 600 K, and by direct deposition of Ni at 600 K."
[2] "The structure, composition and chemical properties of these surfaces were investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of H2, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)."
[3] "Density functional theory calculations showed that subsurface Ni atoms could leads to a weaker metalhydrogen bond by modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, was conducted using a variety of techniques including temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of H2, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also employed to understand the electronic structure and metal-hydrogen bond strength. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

1. 通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来合成Ni/Pt双金属表面，其表征使用了包括氢气的温度程序脱附(TPD)、扫描隧道显微镜(STM)、低能离子散射光谱(LEIS)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和俄歇电子能谱(AES)等多种技术。还使用了密度泛函理论(DFT)计算来理解电子结构和金属-氢键强度。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在高级表面科学和催化研究背景下的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。
