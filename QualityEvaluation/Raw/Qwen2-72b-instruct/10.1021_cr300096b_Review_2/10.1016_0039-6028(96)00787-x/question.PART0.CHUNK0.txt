1. Introduction
Noble metals on smooth tungsten and molyb- denum single-crystal surfaces have in the submono- layer range a phase transition from a two- dimensional condensate to a two-dimensional dilute layer which has the properties of a gas [ 1-5]. Noble metals adsorbed on smooth faces of tungsten are characterised by strong attractive interactions between adatoms, leading to the for- mation of close-packed islands. A different situa- tion is encountered in the case of transition metals of the platinum family, in which the interaction between adatoms is strongly anisotropic and has an oscillatory character [6-10]. It would be inter- esting to know whether and how an anisotropic and oscillatory character of the interaction affects the gas-condensate phase transition.
Adsorption of platinum metals on tungsten microcrystal surfaces has been studied for many years, in particular with the goal of understanding fundamental atomic processes. One of the goals was the determination of the interaction energies between adatoms. In field ion microscopy (FIM) experiments this energy can be obtained by meas- uring the site distribution of an assembly of indivi- dual atoms [11]. In experiments carried out on single crystals, similar information can be obtained by measuring the coexistence boundary of the gas-condensate system [3].
In this work we report the behaviour of platinum metal adsorbates at temperatures above room tem- perature. The results were obtained mainly from work-function change (Ab) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) measurements as a function of temperature. * Corresponding author. 0039-6028/96/$15.00 Copyright  1996 Elsevier Science

2. Experimental
The experimental conditions of this work have been described elsewhere [12]. As already men- tioned, the main source of information were A measurements which were made with the diode method, in particular in the constant current mode.
In this mode the current between the cathode of the electron gun and the sample (anode) is auto- matically kept constant at a fraction (here 1/10) of the saturation value, and the contact potential difference between the cathode and the sample is automatically recorded. Since the work-function of the cathode does not vary - the tungsten filament is resistively heated and the pressure in the appara- tus is in the 5 × 10 -11 Torr range - the recorded contact potential difference changes are the result of work-function changes of the sample surface.
The power of the method rests on its very high sensitivity to changes of the surface roughness on an atomic scale. The transition of an adsorbate from the condensed to the gaseous phase is accom- panied by a considerable change in the atomic roughness, which can be studied very accurately with this method. The accuracy of our Ab measure- ment was _ _ +
2 meV.
The A(T) measurements were performed while the sample (which was previously heated to a given temperature) was cooling. Sample heating was realized in two ways: either resistively or by radia- tion from a heater located behind the sample.
Using the first method, 2500 K could be achieved,and with the second 1200 K. Unfortunately, direct resistive heating disturbs the Ab measurement since the magnetic field of the heating current deflects the electron beam. For this reason, all A(T) measurements at T>1200 K were made during cooling. Another obstacle in the measurement was thermionic emission. A high initial thermionic emission current causes a temporary blocking of the electrometer, but even a small current causes an error because its contribution is read as a work- function change. For this reason the temperature of the initial heating had to be carefully chosen.
The temperature was measured with a thermocou- pie calibrated with optical and infrared pyrometers with an accuracy of + 5 K.
LEED at elevated temperatures was performed with a blue filter which allowed observations above the light emission threshold of the sample. Despite of this, LEED studies were possible only up to 1200 K. At higher temperatures, TDS measure- ments were used in order to obtain information on the behaviour of the adsorbate. These experi- ments were carried out with a fixed heating rate of 3 or 7 K s-1.
The coverage 0 was determined by AES and LEED measurements presented elsewhere [ 12] for Rh, Ir and Pt and in Ref. [13] for Pd. It will be given in fractions of a monolayer (ML), which is defined as a layer with the atomic density of the fcc(111 ) plane of the given element.
3. Results
The temperature dependence of the work-func- tion changes of Pd (Fig. 1) are "typical", i.e. they are identical to those observed earlier for noble metals [3,4]. At low coverages the curves consist of a curved segment at low temperatures and a straight line segment at higher temperatures. The transition temperature between these segments gradually increases with increasing 0. For a cover- age 0 > 0.2 ML (not shown in Fig. 1) in the temper- ature range of interest, the linear segment is no longer visible. The curvature of the A(T) curves gradually diminishes with increasing coverage to zero at a coverage close to 1 ML.In the case of Rh, the A((T) curves (Fig. 2) have a more complicated shape. In the very low coverage range they are identical in character to those for Pd: they have a constant curvature which permits one to obtain a common curve after a parallel translation of the curves, as shown in Fig. 2a. At coverages 0>0.07 ML, although the two curve segments are still visible, the curvature of the first segment varies, as shown in Fig. 2b and c. At coverages above 0=0.13 ML an inflexion appears followed by a shoulder on the first segment of the Ab(T) curves. Curves of the shape such as that presented in Fig. 2c are observed up to the cover- age 1/3 ML, whereas for higher coverages the zlb(T) curves increase slightly up to T 700 K, and for 0>2/3 ML the shoulder disappears (see Fig. 2d). 3".

Fig. l. A(T) for Pd on W(ll0). The coverage is in units of the bulk atomic density of the (111) plane of the fcc structure, and is shown as curve parameter. The annealing temperature was 1250
K.
For Pt, straight-line high-temperatures segments are observed at low coverages, but no coverage range in which the curvature of the curved low- temperature portions is constant can be found.
Thus it is not possible to attain one common curve by parallel translation of the Aq(T) curves with respect to the A-axis, which is in contrast to the cases of Pd (0<0.2) and Rh (0<0.07) (Figs. 1 and 2a). The slope of the first curved segment varies with increasing preheating temperature. Fig. 3 is an attempt to illustrate this fact; it shows the derivative d(zl)/dT of the work-function change at T = 700 K for layers with the same coverage but previously heated to three different temperatures.Fig. 3 shows a drastic variation of the derivative with preheating temperature in the low coverage range (0 < 1/3 ML). The differences between annea- ling at 800 K on the one hand and 1200 and 1600 K on the other are attributed to different adsorbate arrangements [ 12]. Most of the Adp(T) data for Pt were measured after heating the layers to 1300 K,because the Adp(T) measurement at higher temper- atures was influenced by the thermionic emission.In the case of Ir the work-function change with temperature is very small (e.g. less than 10 meV between 1200 and 600 K after heating to 1800 K) for all coverages below 1 ML. While A(T) decreases with increasing T below 1 ML, with the strongest decrease (10 meV) at about 0.5 ML, it is independent of Tat 1 ML and rises slightly above 1 ML (e.g. by 15meV at 1.7 ML). The A(T) curves show very little curvature, and are nearly straight lines. After preheating at lower temper- atures, e.g. at 800 K, the zl(T) changes are some- what larger but still much smaller than those observed with the other platinum-metal adsor- bates. The slope d(Acp)/dT at 700 K range from twice the value of the clean surface after prepara- tion at 1800 K to five times this value after preheating at 800 K. Thus, the measurements A(T) on Ir layers do not give much information on structural changes. We will therefore further consider only the Ab data of the other adsorbates.The straight line segments at high temperatures change their slopes with increasing coverage. This is shown in Fig. 4 for Rh and Pt; similar results for Pd were reported earlier [14]. The coverage dependences for Rh and Pd are similar to those 74 Z Kotaczkiewicz, E.

The slight increase in the magnitude of d(Ab)/dTat 0>0.15 and 0>0.2 ML, for Rh and Pt, respectively (Fig. 4), is an artefact caused by thermionic emission.From the Ab(T) measurements the dependence of zlb(0) at different sample temperatures can be obtained as vertical cuts through the Ab(T) curves in Figs. 1 and 2. Such data measured after annea- ling at the various temperatures indicated below the onset of thermionic emission are shown in Fig. 5 for Rh, Pt and Ir. All adsorbates except Pd [14] show oscillations in the dependence. The Ab(0) oscillations are small in absolute value, but well above the experimental error of 4- 2 meV. The Ab(0) curves at room temperature after deposition are smooth, as shown in Ref. [12].The LEED observations were made with decreasing sample temperature. The layers were heated to 1200 K in the case of Rh and Pt and T--1500 K for Ir, and the temperature was then gradually lowered and the LEED pattern was recorded simultaneously. The patterns give infor- mation about reversible changes of the structure of the adlayer and are very different from the LEED patterns observed during the first heating of the layers deposited at 350 K and reported in Ref. [ 12]. The LEED patterns observed are shown in Fig. 6. For Rh and Ir the direction of satellite spots deviates about 10 from the [i]2] direction towards the [li0] direction of the substrate (see Fig. 6a). The magnitude of this deviation depends on coverage and temperature. The LEED patterns are deformed by the magnetic field of the heating current, and therefore only fragments of patterns are presented in Fig. 6. Despite this, both periodic- ity and symmetry can be easily determined. The LEED patterns of Rh layers were investigated in

Science 366 (1996) 71-84 detail as a function of temperature and coverage up to 0  1/3 ML. The results are presented in the form of a phase diagram in Fig. 7. Four regions can be discerned, which are separated by dashed lines. In the first low coverage region a (1 x 1) pattern is observed, denoted in Fig. 7 by squares.
In the second region a (1 × 1) pattern with streaks appears (Fig. 6b and crosses in Fig. 7) which is rotated by 4-5  off the <1]2> directions towards the [1]0] direction for 0<0.07 ML and T>700
K. In the third region (0.07 < 0 < 0.12 ML, triangles
in Fig. 7) the deviation has increased to about 10
(Fig. 6c). In the fourth region (full triangles and circles in Fig. 7) the angle is 10 at high temper- ature (Fig. 6a), but decreases to 7-8  upon cooling (Fig. 6d and dots in Fig. 7). The satellite splitting in regions 3 and 4 is [ 112]/2n with n ranging from 11 to 18 and an average a= 14.7__+
1.3.
At coverages above 1/3 ML the high-temper- ature patterns are, in general, similar to those observed at lower coverage but with larger n (n18-19) which increases with decreasing tem- perature. Simultaneously, the deviation of the satel- lites from the [112] direction decreases to zero at room temperature. At intermediate temperatures the pattern is less well pronounced than at room temperature and at T= 1000 K. The satellite spots are replaced to a large extent by elongated sharp streaks. For 0>2/3 ML, the satellite spots were located independent of temperature along the (113) directions, i.e. 10 from the [112] direction towards the [001] direction of the substrate.
LEED patterns of Pt layers at elevated temper- atures are shown in Fig. 6e and f. The satellite spots are always along the [112] direction. At 1050 K a (1 × 1) pattern is observed after cooling to low temperatures with short [1i2] streaks. At high temperature the value of n which characterizes the satellite distance is 12.
The behaviour of Ir is to some extent similar to that of Rh and Pt. At high temperatures, the deviation of the direction of the satellite spots is similar to that in Rh layers, but it somewhat smaller (about 3). The value of n characteristic 1200 Rh/W[110) . / / . . . • < 11001 o " /'x"

366 (1996) 71 84 79 for the satellite distance is 10-11, similar to the case of Pt layers.
TDS measurements were carried out for Pd, Rh and Pt; they indicate that the mechanism of desorp- tion of Rh and Pt is different from that of Pd. In the latter case the Arrhenius plots have two linear segments, as in the case of the noble metals [13,15,16], which is due to simultaneous desorp- tion from two phases which coexist on the surface.
This fact allows the determination of the coexist- ence line of the phases and of the critical tem- perature T=1356 K on the basis of TDS measurements from the T(0) curve. However, in the case of Rh and Pt, the Arrhenius plots have only one linear segment with a 0-dependent slope.
Thus desorption occurs from a single phase.
4. Discussion
4.1. LEED
The LEED patterns reported here (Fig. 6) are similar to those of the Kurdjumov-Sachs (KS) orientation of (lll)-oriented fcc metals on (110) surfaces of bcc metals and have therefore been attributed to one-dimensionally misfitting layers with distorted KS orientation (1D-KS). It is pos- sible, however, that the patterns represent a pseu- domorphic layer. Recent evidence [ 17] mainly for Au on W(ll0) [18] suggests, however, that most fcc metals grow pseudomorphically in the submo- nolayer range as predicted by van der Merwe's phase diagram [ 19]. In this case, the satellites and streaks have to be explained in terms of island shape, island distribution, or linear defects in larger islands. For example, a long sharp streak could be due to a random distribution of islands which are narrow in the streak direction but long in the perpendicular direction; it could also be due to large islands with a random distribution of linear defects (domain walls) perpendicular to the streak directions. Similar alternative interpretations exist for satellite spots. A clear distinction between the various possibilities is possible only by extensive measurements of the intensity distribution in the spots and streaks as a function of coverage and temperature, preferably also as a function of electron energy. This was beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, some qualitative observations deserve discussion. The first is the decrease of the sharpness of the satellite spots with decreasing temperature. This seems counterintuitive because one would expect the reverse to be true due to thermal disordering. However, it should be kept in mind that considerable strain energy accumulates in a pseudomorphic island with increasing size. At high temperature, the lattice becomes softer (decreasing shear modulus G) and the strain can be accommodated more easily. With decreasing temperature this possibility decreases and strain can be reduced either by introduction of defects - mostly linear - in the islands or by break-up of the islands into smaller islands which can relax more easily because of the larger circumference-to- area ratio. A distinction between these two possi- bilities again requires systematic intensity profile studies. An argument for the break-up explanation is the observation that the work function of the Rh-covered surface decreases by at least 100 meV upon cooling from T> 1000 K and 0=0.729 ML.The (O,T) region with the streaky LEED pattern in Fig. 7 is probably a remnant of the tendency at low T and 0 to form long chains along the (111 > directions of the substrate. At the highest temper- atures the transition from the (1 × 1) to the (n x 1) pattern with increasing coverage occurs without an intervening streaky region. This suggests that the n-fold periodicity is due to an ordered array of linear defects in the larger islands along directions which deviate from the (111) directions by the angles mentioned in Section 3. For Pt and Ir similar explanations apply, with minor differences in the angle and the defect distance. I! should be pointed out that our studies do not rule out surface alloying at low coverage and high temperatures.Ir, with its high surface energy, is a particularly good candidate for this possibility.
4.2. Work-function change
The interpretation of the A(T) dependence is the same as in the case of noble metals [3,4]. At high temperatures the adsorbate forms a two- dimensional gas on the surface, which leads to a strong change of the surface roughness on an 80
J. Kotaczkiewicz, E. BauerSurface Science 366 (1996) 71-84
atomic level, and consequently to a work-function decrease [20-23]. When all the adsorbate atoms have passed into the gas phase, a further temper- ature increase causes only an insignificant work- function change, which is associated with the increasing vibration amplitudes of the atoms,and a linear Aqb(T) dependence is observed.
Consequently, the shape of the Aq(T) curves can be explained in the following way: when both phases coexist, a temperature change brings about the transfer of some atoms from one phase to the other. The work-function change due to this pro- cess is 4reeAn(pg-pc), where e is the electron charge, An is the number of adatoms transferred from one phase to the other, and pg and pc are the dipole moments per atom of the gas and conden- sate phase, respectively. With increasing coverage the condensate islands cover an increasing fraction of the surface, so that the area available for the gas phase decreases and fewer and fewer atoms are found in the gas phase. Consequently, the A(T) changes will be smaller and smaller.
This behaviour of Ac(T) is found for Pd, but in the case of Rh only for 0 < 0.07 ML. At higher Rh coverages the A(T) dependence is more compli- cated: the curves have a shoulder. This may be a consequence of the introduction of (light) domain walls postulated before. As the result, the number of atoms with lower coordination which have a greater dipole moment per atom than atoms in the island interior increases, and the work-function decreases. At temperatures below 700 K the defect introduction process dominates so that the work- function decreases with decreasing temperature. At 0 > 2/3 ML, where the contribution of 2D conden- sation is less important, because of the small fraction of the surface available for the gas phase,defect introduction or disintegration is prevailing.
Disintegration is then responsible for the positive slope d(A)/dT for 8>2/3 ML (Fig. 2d) which increases slightly with increasing 8. The only change noticed in the LEED patterns for 8>2/3 is the vanishing of the satellite spots with increasing temperature, which is a consequence of the decreas- ing strain energy (due to decreasing shear modulus G), so that domain walls are no longer necessary.
The work-function change accompanying this pro- cess is larger than 0.1 eV (see Fig. 2d), which suggests a high density of domain walls.
In the case of Pt the linear segment at high temperatures is not as pronounced as in the former adsorbates and, in addition, the curvature of the Ab(T) curves at low temperatures is not coverage- independent. The second observation is a conse- quence of the fact that a transition of an adatom from the 2D gas phase to a 2D condensate is not accompanied by a stable change in the magnitude of the dipole moment per atom, i.e. pg-pc is dependent on concentration. This means either that only small islands with the number of their edge atoms being comparable with that in the inside are formed (since the mean size of the islands are 0-dependent), or that the gas phase is composed of atomic complexes rather than single atoms, and the distribution of adatoms for the respective configurations is concentration-dependent.
Apparently, these alternative situations may occur simultaneously. The smaller positive derivative d(Aqb)/dTfor 8>2/3 ML in Pt layers than in Rh layers seems to indicate that in large Pt islands,fewer domain walls are incorporated in the Pt layer than in the case of Rh, and that the process begins at higher coverages. However, the n value in Pt layers is smaller than in Rh layer (10.5 versus
14.7), and thus the domain wall density is larger.
The two apparently contradicting conclusions can be reconciled if the walls are not as light in Pt as in Rh, or if the dipole-moment difference between edge and interior atoms is smaller in Pt. The dependence of the magnitude of the 3q changes on the heating temperature (Fig. 3) may have its origin in the metastable solid phase [12]. As a result of the first heating (i.e. the case of the irreversible Ab) the system of the adlayer-substrate approaches the state of thermodynamic equilib- rium. The unequilibrated layers consist of many small islands (cf. the streak pattern (1 × 1)) which comprise a relatively high part of adatoms with a low number of nearest neighbours. For the equilib- rium state for systems with a strong attractive interaction, one can expect that the system pos- sesses a maximum number of adatoms with the highest number of neighbours. At the same temper- ature, in both cases, we may expect a different number of adatoms that compose the gas phase,
J. Kolaczkiewicz, E. BauerSurface Science 366 (1996) 71-84
81 which is due to the ease for adatoms to leave the island.
For Ir no evidence of a gas phase was found.
However, the temperature coefficient of the work function appears to be larger than that for clean tungsten by a factor of five. Several causes, includ- ing reversible alloying, could be responsible for this.
The linear segments of the curves at low cover- ages and high temperatures are evidence that the complete adsorbate is in the gas phase. The slope of this segment gives information on the temper- ature coefficient of the work-function for the gas phase (Fig. 4). A difficulty arises in the interpreta- tion of the observed 0 dependence. The constant value observed in Pd for 0 < 0.08 ML and in Rh for 0<0.07 ML may be explained by a gas phase consisting of individual atoms, which is suggested by the behaviour of the temperature coefficient of the work-function, whose magnitude approaches the values for noble metals. It is not clear what happens at higher coverages.A comparison of the reversible and irreversible work-function changes, presented in Fig. 8, indi- cates that the average dipole moment per atom in the gas phase changes irreversibly above 0 = 0.07
ML. This is consistent with the Agp(T) changes
(Fig. 2) and with the dependence d(A)/dTfor the gas phase (Fig. 4). As during evaporation at a temperature for which the adatoms are not mobile (and the case in question is typical of such a restricted mobility during the deposition), a "frozen gas" is formed on the surface with randomly dis- tributed single adatoms. Since the work-function changes that are associated with "frozen gas" only up to 0 <0.07 ML are identical with those associ- ated with the 2D gas (reversible changes), one can believe that only for 0<0.07 ML is the surface occupied by a monomer gas. For 0>0.07 ML,dimers, trimers, etc. then occur; as a consequence,the mean dipole moment per atom is less.The situation of the gas-phase atoms of Pt is also complicated. The Agp(O) dependence shown in Fig. 5b indicates that a gas phase forms for 0 < 0.04
ML. However, the dipole moment per atom of this
phase is smaller than that in the freshly deposited layer at 450 K, i.e. 0.42 D and 0.59 D, respectively.
The large d(A))/dT values at low coverages pre- sented in Fig. 4 suggest that the gas phase does not consist of individual atoms, but rather of clusters which dissociate with increasing temper- ature, causing a stronger Ab decrease.

Science 366 (1996) 71-84 high temperatures is much less than that of the freshly deposited layer at 400 K (0.08 D compared to 0.65 D). This indicates strong clustering or alloying.
The onset temperature of the linear segments can be used to determine the "coexistence line" separating the 2D gas phase from the phase coexist- ence region. Such curves are shown for Rh and Pt in Fig. 9, and for Pd in Ref.
[4]. Points with coordinates (O,T) were obtained by extrapolation of the linear and curved segments (at a given 0) as shown in Fig. 2a. Their intersection determines T.
In this manner the 7(0) curves for Pt and curve 1 for Rh have been obtained. Curve 2 for Rh was obtained from the local maxima observed on the Ab(T) curves (see Fig. 2b). They are also drawn in the phase diagram (full lines in Fig. 7), which shows an exceptionally good agreement between the curve found from the work-function measure- ment (curve 1 in Fig. 9a) and the line separating the (1 × 1) and streaked LEED patterns. Above curve 2 no satellite spots are seen in the LEED pattern. The curve is therefore attributed to the transition from small clusters to large islands with domain walls. This corresponds to the situation when two opposite processes, namely the disinteg- ration of an island (which lowers the work function) and condensation of atoms (raising the work func- tion) counterbalance each other.
In Pt layers the boundary curve consists of two segments with different curvatures. They are tenta- tively attributed to the different stability of the two phases observed at 0<0.3 ML [12]. The 4((T) curves are obtained during cooling of the preheated layers to 1100 and 1300 K. For Pt two metastable phases exist in these coverage and temperature regions (0<0.3 M, 1100<T<1300 K) [12]. For 0<0.11 ML a (1×1) pattern for T<1200 K is

Science 366 (1996) 71 84 83 observed after cooling, above 0=0.11 a (1 x 1) pattern with streaks is observed. This means that for 0 < 0.11 ML the condensation originated pseu- domorphic islands. However, for higher coverages the applied annealing temperature was not high enough to enable the occurrence of a 2D monomer gas. Since for Pt a strong tendency to form chains of atoms has been observed, it can be supposed that a line configuration of adatoms will dominate in this case. The islands formed of such fragments will be asymmetrical, which is manifested by the presence of streaks in the LEED pattern (such a pattern can be produced by narrow islands, elon- gated in one of [111] directions). The annealing temperature for formation of a Pt monomer gas depends on coverage. The results obtained lead us to believe that the heating temperature of 1100 K is sufficiently high only for 0 < 0.09 ML. In contrast,0 = 0.13 ML requires a heating temperature of 1300
K. For coverages 0>0.13 ML even 1300 K is too
low a temperature for annealing, and linear con- figurations of a few adatoms each dominate in the gas phase. So, the boundary curves obtained for Pt have the following physical meaning: curve 1 bounds the region of the 2D gas and the region where the 2D gas coexists with pseudomorphic islands, whereas curve 2 is a boundary curve between a 2D gas composed of atomic complexes and the region where such a gas coexists with elongated islands.
Finally, we briefly address the oscillations of the A4)(O) curves at high temperatures. The curves show many features which are connected with the different LEED structures. For Rh the different parts of the curves are connected with different regions of the "phase diagram" Fig. 7. A line which separates the region marked by squares from Fig. 7 is particularly clearly demonstrated in Fig. 5a.
Separation lines of other regions are less clear,segments of the A(O) curve with slightly different slopes correspond to the respective regions of the "phase diagram".
For Pt, the Adp(O) oscillations are connected with the metastable LEED structures. For Pt the pre- heating temperature for which the results of Fig. 5b are relevant, was 1300 K. In this case several different diffraction patterns of Pt were observed [12]. Accordingly, for 0<0.13 ML a pattern of (1 x 1) appeared; in the range 0.13<0<0.25 ML the (1 x 1) pattern with the addition of streaks occurred. Then, in the 0.25<0<0.66 ML range,the relative pattern demonstrated sharp satellite spots, and for 0>0.66 ML the (1 x 1) pattern appeared again. This effect is manifested in the Ad(O) curves presented in Fig. 5b: each of the ranges mentioned above corresponds to a different fragment of the curves.For Ir we have only limited LEED data, but the oscillations are probably of the same nature. They can be correlated with the oscillations of the atomic structure connected with the introduction of a new domain wall with increasing island size. A detailed discussion of the work-function changes will be given elsewhere, in connection with Monte Carlo simulations [24].
5. Summary
Although the various adsorbates differ consider- ably in the shape of the A(T) curves and in the magnitude of the A changes, the processes that occur at high temperatures are identical. The differences result mainly from the strength of the interactions. The interaction is strongest for Ir,followed by Pt, Rh and Pd. There is no evidence for anisotropic interaction with attraction in the (111) directions and repulsion perpendicular to it,which is evident in layers adsorbed at low temper- atures [25]. The present data show that at high temperatures anisotropy does not play an essential role. This is understandable because the anisotropy of the interactions is in the 10 meV range. Such small energy differences are unimportant at tem- peratures above several 100 K (kT= 25 50 meV for T= 300-600 K).
At higher temperatures an anisotropy of inter- actions between adatoms is seen only in the ten- dency towards the metastable formation of elongated islands parallel to the close-packed [ 111 ] direction. The formation of domain walls at still higher coverages and temperatures and their reversible disappearance at the highest temper- atures is very probably a consequence of elastic interactions between the strained layer and the substrate, which favor the break-up of islands. 84

In the case of Pt it was found that the surface gas-phase coexists with two different solid phases,which results in two boundary curves. For Rh a curve 7-(0) (curve 2 in Fig. 9a) has been found which is the geometric locus of those points at which the work-function increase caused by the gas condensation is compensated by the work- function decrease due to the disintegration of the anisotropic islands. The A(O) oscillations are attributed to a discontinuous change of the island size, in particular in the case of Pt.
