[1] "In many cases, these unique properties result in activities and/or selectivities that exceed those achievable with a monometallic catalyst. For this reason, there have been many fundamental experimental and theoretical studies of the novel properties of well-defined bimetallic surfaces [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ."

[2] "To study the modification effects on surface chemistry due to bimetallic formation, a monolayer film of one metal can be deposited onto a single-crystal substrate of another metal. Lattice mismatch results in the contraction or expansion of adlayer metalmetal bond length compared with that of the bulk metal, leading to a modification of the surface electronic properties due to the strain effect [6] ,[10] ,[11] ."

[3] "In addition, the formation of heterometallic bonds further alters the electronic properties of the surface, which is often referred to as the ligand effect."

[4] "One useful parameter to describe the changes in the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces is the position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level [12] ."

[5] "This parameter has been shown to strongly correlate with the ability of bimetallic surfaces to bind with small adsorbates, such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen [13] , alkenes [8] ,[14] , and oxygenates [15] ,[16] ."

[6] "In addition, activation barriers to such reactions as ethylene and maleic anhydride hydrogenation also have been correlated with the surface d-band center [8] ,[17] ."

[7] "Thus, its determination may enable first-principles predictions of bimetallic surfaces with desirable catalytic properties for reactions involving these molecules [18] ."

[8] "In the present work, a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene."

[9] "This was done by modifying Pt(111) with several 3d transition metals, including Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu."

[10] "Depositing these metals on a Pt(111) single-crystal surface at room temperature was found to result in the formation of a surface monolayer of the 3d metals; these surfaces are designated as 3d-Pt-Pt(111)."

[11] "At elevated temperatures, the formation of a surface alloy is observed for each Pt-3d pair [9] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ."

[12] "These surface alloys have been shown to be enriched in Pt in the first atomic layer due to the enthalpic driving potential created by the lower surface energy of Pt compared with the 3d metals under consideration [28] ,[29] ."

[13] "Strain also may play a part in the interdiffusion of the Pt and 3d metals, because elastic strain is reduced by having the larger Pt atoms in the topmost atomic layer [23] ."

[14] "These Pt-enriched bimetallic surfaces are designated Pt-3d-Pt(111) in this study."

[15] "Kitchin et al. [28] studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level."

[16] "The current study extends these findings to Fe-, Co-, and Cu-modified Pt(111) surfaces."

[17] "Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen."

[18] "Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."

[19] "On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition [7] ,[30] ; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly."

[20] "For example, modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway."

[21] "Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway [28] ,[31] ,[32] ."

[22] "Similar results were observed in the current study for the Pt-Fe-Pt(111) surface; however, the Pt-Cu-Pt(111) surface did not exhibit the same hydrogenation pathway."

[23] "Furthermore, the current study also investigated the hydrogenation pathway on the four 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces and found that this pathway did not occur on these surface structures because of the strong binding of cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen."

[24] "The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow us to establish a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is crucial for understanding the unique properties of these surfaces that can lead to enhanced catalytic activities and selectivities compared to monometallic catalysts. This process allows for the study of surface chemistry modifications due to bimetallic formation, including the strain effect from lattice mismatch and the ligand effect from heterometallic bond formation. The position of the surface d-band center relative to the Fermi level is a key parameter for describing changes in electronic properties, which correlates with the binding of small adsorbates and activation barriers for reactions. DFT modeling and surface science experiments are used to investigate the effects of bimetallic formation on hydrogen and cyclohexene binding, as well as low-temperature hydrogenation. Depositing 3d transition metals on Pt(111) at room temperature forms a surface monolayer, while elevated temperatures lead to surface alloy formation enriched in Pt due to lower surface energy and reduced elastic strain. The study extends findings on Ni-modified Pt(111) to Fe-, Co-, and Cu-modified surfaces, and cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to compare chemical properties of various bimetallic surfaces. The results establish a volcano-type relationship between binding energies and hydrogenation activities among 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.

1. 在Ni/Pt双金属表面上沉积Ni单层，该表面是在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上合成的，其表征对于理解这些表面的独特性质至关重要，这些性质可导致与单金属催化剂相比增强的催化活性和选择性。这一过程使我们能够研究由于双金属形成对表面化学的修改，包括晶格失配引起的应变效应和异金属键形成引起的配体效应。表面d带中心相对于费米能级的位置是一个关键参数，用于描述电子性质的变化，这与小吸附物的结合和反应的活化能垒相关。密度泛函理论（DFT）建模和表面科学实验被用来研究双金属形成对氢和环己烯结合以及低温氢化的影响。在室温下将3d过渡金属沉积在Pt(111)上会形成表面单层，而高温会导致表面合金的形成，由于较低的表面能和减少的弹性应变，这种合金在第一原子层中富含Pt。本研究将Ni改性Pt(111)的发现扩展到Fe-, Co-, 和Cu-改性的表面，环己烯被用作探针分子来比较各种双金属表面的化学性质。结果在3d/Pt(111)双金属表面之间建立了结合能和氢化活性之间的火山型关系。
