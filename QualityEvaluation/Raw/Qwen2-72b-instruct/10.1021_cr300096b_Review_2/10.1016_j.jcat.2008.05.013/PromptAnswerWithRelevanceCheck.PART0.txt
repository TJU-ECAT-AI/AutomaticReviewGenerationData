[1] "In many cases, these unique properties result in activities and/or selectivities that exceed those achievable with a monometallic catalyst. For this reason, there have been many fundamental experimental and theoretical studies of the novel properties of well-defined bimetallic surfaces [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ."

[2] "To study the modification effects on surface chemistry due to bimetallic formation, a monolayer film of one metal can be deposited onto a single-crystal substrate of another metal. Lattice mismatch results in the contraction or expansion of adlayer metalmetal bond length compared with that of the bulk metal, leading to a modification of the surface electronic properties due to the strain effect [6] ,[10] ,[11] ."

[3] "In addition, the formation of heterometallic bonds further alters the electronic properties of the surface, which is often referred to as the ligand effect. One useful parameter to describe the changes in the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces is the position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level [12] ."

[4] "This parameter has been shown to strongly correlate with the ability of bimetallic surfaces to bind with small adsorbates, such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen [13] , alkenes [8] ,[14] , and oxygenates [15] ,[16] ."

[5] "In addition, activation barriers to such reactions as ethylene and maleic anhydride hydrogenation also have been correlated with the surface d-band center [8] ,[17] ."

[6] "Thus, its determination may enable first-principles predictions of bimetallic surfaces with desirable catalytic properties for reactions involving these molecules [18] ."

[7] "In the present work, a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene. This was done by modifying Pt(111) with several 3d transition metals, including Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu."

[8] "Depositing these metals on a Pt(111) single-crystal surface at room temperature was found to result in the formation of a surface monolayer of the 3d metals; these surfaces are designated as 3d-Pt-Pt(111)."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a combination of experimental and theoretical studies. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The unique properties of bimetallic surfaces often result in activities and selectivities that exceed those of monometallic catalysts. Lattice mismatch during the deposition of a monolayer film of one metal onto a single-crystal substrate of another metal leads to modifications in surface electronic properties due to the strain effect. The formation of heterometallic bonds further alters the electronic properties of the surface, known as the ligand effect. The position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level is a useful parameter to describe changes in the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces. This parameter has been shown to correlate with the ability of bimetallic surfaces to bind with small adsorbates and activation barriers to reactions such as hydrogenation. Determining this parameter enables predictions of bimetallic surfaces with desirable catalytic properties. In the present work, DFT modeling and surface science experiments were used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene. Depositing 3d transition metals on a Pt(111) single-crystal surface at room temperature results in the formation of a surface monolayer of the 3d metals, designated as 3d-Pt-Pt(111). At elevated temperatures, the formation of a surface alloy is observed, which is enriched in Pt in the first atomic layer due to the lower surface energy of Pt compared to the 3d metals. Strain plays a part in the interdiffusion of Pt and 3d metals, with elastic strain reduced by having the larger Pt atoms in the topmost atomic layer. These Pt-enriched bimetallic surfaces are designated Pt-3d-Pt(111). Previous studies have shown that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level, while subsurface Ni moves it away. The current study extends these findings to Fe-, Co-, and Cu-modified Pt(111) surfaces. Cyclohexene is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of various bimetallic surfaces due to its competitive reaction pathways. On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition, but when modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly. Modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway. Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway. Similar results were observed in the current study for the Pt-Fe-Pt(111) surface, but not for the Pt-Cu-Pt(111) surface. The hydrogenation pathway did not occur on the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces due to the strong binding of cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen. The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow us to establish a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层制备，是通过实验和理论研究的结合进行的。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在高级表面科学和催化研究背景下的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。双金属表面的独特性质通常导致活动性和选择性超过单金属催化剂。在一种金属的单层薄膜沉积到另一种金属的单晶基底上时，晶格失配导致与体金属相比，吸附层金属金属键长的收缩或扩展，从而导致由于应变效应导致的表面电子性质的改变。异金属键的形成进一步改变了表面的电子性质，通常被称为配体效应。描述双金属表面电子性质变化的一个有用参数是表面d带中心相对于费米能级的位置。这个参数已被证明与双金属表面结合小吸附物的能力，如原子氢和氧，以及烯烃和氧酸的能力密切相关。此外，乙烯和马来酸酐氢化等反应的活化能也与表面d带中心相关。因此，确定这个参数可能使我们能够从第一原理预测具有所需催化性质的双金属表面，用于涉及这些分子的反应。在本研究中，密度泛函理论（DFT）建模和表面科学实验的结合被用来研究双金属形成对原子氢和环己烯结合以及环己烯低温氢化的影响。通过在Pt(111)单晶表面室温下沉积几种3d过渡金属，包括Fe、Co、Ni和Cu，来实现这一点。在室温下将这些金属沉积在Pt(111)单晶表面上，发现形成了3d金属的表面单层；这些表面被称为3d-Pt-Pt(111)。在较高温度下，观察到每个Pt-3d对的表面合金的形成。这些表面合金已被证明在第一原子层中富含Pt，这是由与考虑的3d金属相比，Pt的较低表面能产生的焓驱动势造成的。应变也可能在Pt和3d金属的相互扩散中发挥作用，因为通过将较大的Pt原子置于最上层原子层中，弹性应变得以减少。这些Pt富集的双金属表面在本研究中被称为Pt-3d-Pt(111)。Kitchin等人[28]研究了Ni对Pt(111)的改性，发现表面Ni与Ni(111)相比，将表面d带中心移近费米能级，而第二原子层中的子表面Ni则将d带中心移离费米能级。本研究将这些发现扩展到Fe、Co和Cu改性的Pt(111)表面。环己烯可以经历分解、脱氢和自氢化（歧化）反应，以及在共吸附原子氢存在下的氢化。由于这些反应途径的竞争性质，它是一种理想的探针分子，用于比较各种双金属表面的化学性质的一般趋势。在Pt(111)上，环己烯会经历脱氢和分解[7]，[30]；然而，当Pt(111)被另一种金属改性时，主导的反应途径可能会有显著变化。例如，Sn的改性可以促进可逆吸附，使分子解吸成为主导途径。对3d改性的Pt(111)的先前研究表明，子表面Pt-Ni-Pt(111)和Pt-Co-Pt(111)结构表现出一种新颖的低温氢化途径[28]，[31]，[32]。在本研究中，对于Pt-Fe-Pt(111)表面观察到了类似的结果；然而，Pt-Cu-Pt(111)表面没有表现出相同的氢化途径。此外，本研究还研究了四个3d-Pt-Pt(111)表面上的氢化途径，发现由于环己烯和原子氢的强结合，这种途径没有发生在这些表面结构上。实验结果和DFT建模的结合使我们能够建立3d/Pt(111)双金属表面之间的结合能和氢化活性之间的火山型关系。

For this reason, there have been many fundamental experimental and theoretical studies of the novel properties of well-defined bimetallic surfaces [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ."

[2] "To study the modification effects on surface chemistry due to bimetallic formation, a monolayer film of one metal can be deposited onto a single-crystal substrate of another metal. Lattice mismatch results in the contraction or expansion of adlayer metalmetal bond length compared with that of the bulk metal, leading to a modification of the surface electronic properties due to the strain effect [6] ,[10] ,[11] ."

[3] "In addition, the formation of heterometallic bonds further alters the electronic properties of the surface, which is often referred to as the ligand effect."

[4] "One useful parameter to describe the changes in the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces is the position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level [12] ."

[5] "This parameter has been shown to strongly correlate with the ability of bimetallic surfaces to bind with small adsorbates, such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen [13] , alkenes [8] ,[14] , and oxygenates [15] ,[16] ."

[6] "In addition, activation barriers to such reactions as ethylene and maleic anhydride hydrogenation also have been correlated with the surface d-band center [8] ,[17] ."

[7] "Thus, its determination may enable first-principles predictions of bimetallic surfaces with desirable catalytic properties for reactions involving these molecules [18] ."

[8] "In the present work, a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene."

[9] "This was done by modifying Pt(111) with several 3d transition metals, including Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu."

[10] "Depositing these metals on a Pt(111) single-crystal surface at room temperature was found to result in the formation of a surface monolayer of the 3d metals; these surfaces are designated as 3d-Pt-Pt(111)."

[11] "At elevated temperatures, the formation of a surface alloy is observed for each Pt-3d pair [9] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ."

[12] "These surface alloys have been shown to be enriched in Pt in the first atomic layer due to the enthalpic driving potential created by the lower surface energy of Pt compared with the 3d metals under consideration [28] ,[29] ."

[13] "Strain also may play a part in the interdiffusion of the Pt and 3d metals, because elastic strain is reduced by having the larger Pt atoms in the topmost atomic layer [23] ."

[14] "These Pt-enriched bimetallic surfaces are designated Pt-3d-Pt(111) in this study."

[15] "Kitchin et al. [28] studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level."

[16] "The current study extends these findings to Fe-, Co-, and Cu-modified Pt(111) surfaces."

[17] "Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen."

[18] "Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."

[19] "On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition [7] ,[30] ; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly."

[20] "For example, modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway."

[21] "Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway [28] ,[31] ,[32] ."

[22] "Similar results were observed in the current study for the Pt-Fe-Pt(111) surface; however, the Pt-Cu-Pt(111) surface did not exhibit the same hydrogenation pathway."

[23] "Furthermore, the current study also investigated the hydrogenation pathway on the four 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces and found that this pathway did not occur on these surface structures because of the strong binding of cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen."

[24] "The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow us to establish a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is crucial for understanding the unique properties of these surfaces that can lead to enhanced catalytic activities and selectivities compared to monometallic catalysts. This process allows for the study of surface chemistry modifications due to bimetallic formation, including the strain effect from lattice mismatch and the ligand effect from heterometallic bond formation. The position of the surface d-band center relative to the Fermi level is a key parameter for describing changes in electronic properties, which correlates with the binding of small adsorbates and activation barriers for reactions. DFT modeling and surface science experiments are used to investigate the effects of bimetallic formation on hydrogen and cyclohexene binding, as well as low-temperature hydrogenation. Depositing 3d transition metals on Pt(111) at room temperature forms a surface monolayer, while elevated temperatures lead to surface alloy formation enriched in Pt due to lower surface energy and reduced elastic strain. The study extends findings on Ni-modified Pt(111) to Fe-, Co-, and Cu-modified surfaces, and cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to compare chemical properties of various bimetallic surfaces. The results establish a volcano-type relationship between binding energies and hydrogenation activities among 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层制备，采用密度泛函理论(DFT)建模和表面科学实验的组合进行。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，这些表面在高级表面科学和催化研究的背景下。研究扩展到了Fe和Cu在Pt(111)表面上的生长和热行为。表面通过在300 K下沉积1 ML的3d金属来制备表面配置，而在600 K下制备了次表面双金属配置。DFT用于计算单金属和双金属表面上原子氢和环己烯的结合能。计算了二-σ键合环己烯的船和椅构型的结合能，证明船构型是热力学上优选的结构。研究在配备有Auger电子能谱仪(AES)和四极质谱仪(MS)的两级不锈钢超高压(UHV)室中进行，用于温度编程脱附(TPD)实验和所加气体纯度的原位验证。表面通过物理气相沉积沉积3d金属进行改性，3d金属沉积量由3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES峰峰值比确定。Fe和Cu在Pt(111)上的物理气相沉积和热行为的AES量化已经完成。表面以3 K/s的速率加热到越来越高的温度，一旦表面冷却到500 K以下，就进行AES扫描，以确定表面组成的变化。目前研究中使用的表面是Fe、Co、Ni和Cu的伪多形薄膜，其中大约5到10个单层的3d金属沉积在Pt(111)上，使得Pt在AES扫描中几乎检测不到。薄膜表面被建模为每个相应金属的紧密堆积3d表面。本文中提出的理论结果使用VASP(维也纳ab initio模拟包)代码进行自洽周期性板计算。使用包含四层原子的超单元研究了原子氢和环己烯的结合能，其中允许顶层的两层松弛。对于气相氢和环己烯的计算实施了自旋极化，而吸附物-金属系统计算则以自旋非极化进行，因为对于原子氢和烯烃，有和没有自旋极化的吸附能的相对差异通常发现<5 kJ/mol。对于氢-金属系统，氢在金属表面的三重空位位置吸附，覆盖率为1/9 ML。在氢共吸附表面上研究了环己烯的结合。一个环己烯分子以二-σ构型键合在单金属和双金属表面上，超单元中存在两个共吸附的氢原子。氢原子键合在最接近环己烯分子的两个三重空位位置，以确定对环己烯结合的影响。
