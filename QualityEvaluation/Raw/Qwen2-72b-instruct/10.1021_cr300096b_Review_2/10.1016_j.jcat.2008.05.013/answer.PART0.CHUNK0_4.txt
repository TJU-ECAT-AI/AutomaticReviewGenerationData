[1] "In the present work, a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene. This was done by modifying Pt(111) with several 3d transition metals, including Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu."

[2] "The current study was extended to the growth and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on the Pt(111) surface."

[3] "In summary, 3d-Pt-Pt(111), or the surface configuration, is representative of 1 ML of the 3d metal on Pt(111) and was prepared by depositing 1 ML at 300 K. This surface was modeled as one layer of 3d metal on top of bulk Pt(111). The subsurface bimetallic configuration, designated Pt-3d-Pt(111), was prepared by depositing 1 ML of the 3d metal at 600 K. This surface was modeled as bulk Pt(111) with the second atomic layer replaced by the 3d metal."

[4] "DFT was used to calculate the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces."

[5] "The binding energies of both the boat and chair configurations were calculated, demonstrating that the boat configuration is the thermodynamically preferred structure for di-σ bonded cyclohexene."

[6] "The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases."

[7] "The surfaces were then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition."

[8] "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements."

[11] "The AES quantification of the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of Cu on Pt(111)."

[12] "The surfaces were then heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition."

[13] "The 1 ML Cu surface exhibited similar behavior but with a less pronounced critical temperature above which rapid diffusion into the bulk occurred."

[14] "The surfaces used in the current study were pseudomorphic films of Fe, Co, Ni and Cu, for which approximately five to ten monolayers of the 3d metal were deposited on Pt(111) such that Pt was barely detectable in the AES scan."

[15] "The thin film surfaces were modeled as the bulk closed packed 3d surface for each respective metal."

[16] "The theoretical results presented in this paper were calculated using self-consistent periodic slab calculations with the VASP (Vienna ab initio Simulation Package) code."

[17] "The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene were studied using super cells containing four atomic layers, with the top two layers allowed to relax in each case."

[18] "Calculations for gas-phase hydrogen and cyclohexene were carried out implementing spin-polarization, whereas the adsorbate-metal system calculations were carried out spin-unpolarized, because the relative difference in the adsorption energies with and without spin-polarization was typically found to be <5 kJ/mol for atomic hydrogen and alkenes."

[19] "For the hydrogen-metal system, hydrogen was adsorbed in the threefold hollow site of the metal surface with a coverage of 1/9 ML."

[20] "The binding of cyclohexene was studied on hydrogen co-adsorbed surfaces."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The study was extended to the growth and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on the Pt(111) surface. The surfaces were prepared by depositing 1 ML of the 3d metal at 300 K for the surface configuration, and at 600 K for the subsurface bimetallic configuration. DFT was used to calculate the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. The binding energies of both the boat and chair configurations were calculated for di-σ bonded cyclohexene, demonstrating that the boat configuration is the thermodynamically preferred structure.
