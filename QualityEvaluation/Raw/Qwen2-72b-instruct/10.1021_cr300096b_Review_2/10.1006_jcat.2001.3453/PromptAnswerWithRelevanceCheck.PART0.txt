1.The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is not explicitly described in the literature. However, the process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the creation of surfaces with controlled compositions and structures. These surfaces can then be studied using various surface science techniques to understand their reactivity and selectivity towards specific reactions, such as the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene. The characterization of these surfaces provides insights into the role of metal-hydrogen bonds in the catalytic activity and can guide the design of more efficient catalysts for industrial processes.

However, the process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The literature focuses on the low-temperature hydrodesulfurization of thiophene on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, comparing the reactivity with Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) film surfaces. The characterization of the surfaces is likely conducted using Auger electron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, and low-energy electron diffraction, as these techniques are mentioned in the literature.
