I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Tin-oxide overlayer formation by oxidation of PtSn(111) surface alloys Matthias Batzill; David E. Beck; Dmitri Jerdev; Bruce E. Koel

https://doi.org/10.1116/1.1345902 Article history Share Tools Ordered (2×2) and
(3×3)R30
PtSn(111) surface alloys were oxidized by
NO
2 exposure at 400 K under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The evolution of the surface morphology with annealing temperature was characterized by using low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both oxidized surface alloys form a SnO x overlayer that wets the substrate. However, the SnO x film does not completely cover the surface for the oxidized (2×2) surface alloy. For the oxidized
(3×3)R30
surface alloy, an ordered (4×4) LEED pattern is formed upon flash annealing above 900 K. The formation of this ordered SnO x adlayer coincides with Sn segregation from the bulk to the interface region. A model for the (4×4) structure is discussed. The SnO x overlayer formed by oxidation of the (2×2) surface alloy is significantly less thermally stable than the oxidized
(3×3)R30
surface alloy. Exothermic alloying of Sn with Pt may facilitate the decomposition of the oxide overlayers. Differences in the amount of subsurface tin and its segregation to the surface is proposed to explain the thermal stabilities of the oxide layers. The incompleteness of the SnO x overlayer and less subsurface tin for the oxidized (2×2) surface alloy is proposed to explain its significant lower thermal stability.

<questions>


How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
