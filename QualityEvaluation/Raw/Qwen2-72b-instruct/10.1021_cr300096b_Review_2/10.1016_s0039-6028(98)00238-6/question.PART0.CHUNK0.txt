The bimetallic systems are prepared by adsorbing approximately one monolayer of K, Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag and Au on W(111) at 100 K. The W 4f7/2 core levels from the W( 111 ) substrate are measured. It is found that the core-level W 4f7/2 binding energy shifts originating from W atoms at the interface correlate well with the heats of adsorption for metal films on W(111).  1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Keywords: Low index single crystal surfaces; Metallic films; Metal-metal interfaces; Palladium; Platinum; Soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy; Tungsten Ultrathin metal films adsorbed on W(111) sur- faces have been used as model bimetallic catalysts and have been studied extensively using surface science techniques in the past several years [1-4].
One salient trend emerging from studies of bimetal- lic systems is that certain ultrathin metal films induce morphological instabilities in the atomically rough W(lll) substrate [2]. It is observed that the W(111) substrate covered with ultrathin films of Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt and Au (as well as O and CI),whose Pauling electronegativities are greater than
2.0, will undergo a structural transition around
700K, and develop facets consisting of {211}- oriented three-sided pyramids. On the other hand,* Corresponding author. Fax: (+ 1 ) 732 4454991;e-mail: madey@physics.rutgers.edu 0039-6028/98/$19.00  1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

adsorbed ultrathin films of Co, Ti, Gd, Ni, Cu and Ag, whose electronegativities are less than 2.0,do not cause such a faceting transition of the W(lll) substrate [1,2,4]. This observation sug- gests that the electronic structures of the W( 111 )- based bimetallic systems play a role in the faceting transition. This issue is addressed by means of high-resolution soft X-ray photoelectron spectro- scopy (SXPS) using synchrotron radiation.
By tuning the photon energy to select the appro- priate kinetic energies of the emitted photon- excited electrons (i.e. taking advantage of the short inelastic mean free path of electrons in solids), it is possible to increase the sensitivity to the near- surface region. In a preliminary study of Pd and Pt on W(111), it has been demonstrated that the W 4f7/2 binding energies measured by SXPS are

very sensitive to the surface and interface structures [3,4], and that the binding energies of the W 4f7/2 core levels originating from W atoms at the interface of the bimetallics (i.e. the interfacial W4fT/2 binding energies) could be identified.
Although the measured interfacial W 4fv/2 binding energies are rather small (the interfacial W 4fv/2 binding energy shifts measured with respect to the bulk W 4f7/2 are of the order of tens of meV),differences in the interfacial W 4fv/2 binding energy shifts for different bimetallics are easily measurable due to the narrow width of the W 4f7/2 core level.
In particular, it is observed that the interfacial W 4fv/2 binding energies of the Pd- and Pt-covered planar W( 111 ) are different from those of Pd- and Pt-covered faceted W(211) [3].
In order to understand better the electronic properties of the bimetallic systems, a systematic study of ultrathin metal films of K, Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag and Au on W(111) has been carried out by SXPS. It is found that a correlation exists between the interfacial W 4f7/2 binding energy and the corresponding heat of adsorption of metal films on W( 111 ): metal films on W( 111 ) with high heats of adsorption have higher interfacial W4fv/2 binding energies, and metal films on W(Ill) with lower heats of adsorption have smaller interfacial W 4f7/2 binding energies. A sim- ilar correlation is also observed for a few metals on W(II0) [5]. There is no clear correlation between interfacial W 4fv/z binding energy and Pauling electronegativity. This is because the bind- ing energy of a given core level is not only deter- mined by initial-state effects which are manifested by the Pauling electronegativity, but also by final- state effects, and the W 4f7/2 core level is known to be well screened [6-9].
The measurements were performed at beamline U4A of the National Synchrotron Light Source,which is equipped with a 6 m toroidal grating monochromator. The photon energy used in this study was 75 eV, with a nominal resolution of 50 meV. The photoelectrons were collected by a VSW 100 mm mean radius hemispherical energy analyzer of 5 angular resolution in a vacuum chamber with a base pressure better than 1 x 10-m Torr. The pass energy used in this study was 2 eV, which gives a nominal resolution of 44 meV, and the total instrumental resol .......... approximately 65 meV. The temperature was mea- sured by W5%Re-W26%Re thermocouple wires which were spot-welded to the side of the W( 111 ) crystal. The sample was cleaned by cycles of heat- ing in 1 x 10 .6 Torr oxygen at  1200 K for 5 min,followed by flashing the sample to  2300 K. The cleanliness of the sample was checked by photo- electron spectroscopy.
Model bimetallic systems were prepared,through vapor deposition, by adsorbing a total coverage of approximately one physical monolayer of K, Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag and Au onto W( 111 ) at 100 K (an ideal physical monolayer grows pseu- domorphically on W( 111 ) and covers all substrate W atoms with a coverage of 1.7 x 1015 atoms cm 2 [2,4]). Each metal source (except K, which was produced from a getter source; SAES Getters) consisted of a metal wire with a nominal purity better than 99.99% wrapped around a 0.25 mm diameter W wire. Sufficient metal vapor could be generated by passing an appropriate current directly through the W wire. The surface concen- tration of adsorbed metal on W(I 11) was deter- mined following the incremental deposition of small amounts of metal by means of work-function changes and intensities of photoemission features.
These procedures are discussed in detail elsewhere [10]. Each of the metal films studied using low- energy electron diffraction was observed to grow pseudomorphically on W(lll) [2]. The W 4f7/2 core-level photoemission spectra were taken imme- diately after the deposition of metal films at 100 K.
No faceting of the W(111 ) substrate takes place at this temperature, and the W(lll) substrate remains planar [1-4].
The W 4fv/2 photoemission at a photon energy of 75 eV is very sensitive to the surface region.
This is demonstrated in Fig. 1 by the W 4f7/2 core- level spectrum of clean W( 111 ) measured at 100 K at an emission angle of 13 from the surface normal. In Fig. 1, three W 4f7/2 photoemission features are clearly resolved and confirm the more recent fitting results [7,8] of previous studies, in which only two resolved W 4f n features were observed experimentally [11]. In these studies, a non-linear least-squares fitting was applied to the W 4f7/2 photoemission spectrum by assuming that
