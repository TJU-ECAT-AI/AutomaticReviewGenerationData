1.The literature does not provide information on the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. However, it does discuss the study of ultrathin metal overlayers on W(111) by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation. The bimetallic systems are prepared by adsorbing approximately one monolayer of K, Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag and Au on W(111) at 100 K. The W 4f7/2 core levels from the W(111) substrate are measured. The characterization of these bimetallic surfaces is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of the interfaces, which is important for surface science and catalysis research.

1.文献没有提供关于通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征信息。但是，它确实讨论了使用同步辐射的高分辨率光电子能谱研究W(111)上的超薄金属覆盖层。通过在100 K下在W(111)上吸附大约一层K、Co、Ni、Pd、Pt、Cu、Ag和Au来制备双金属系统。测量来自W(111)基底的W 4f7/2核心能级。这些双金属表面的表征对于理解界面的电子和化学性质至关重要，这对于表面科学和催化研究非常重要。

This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
