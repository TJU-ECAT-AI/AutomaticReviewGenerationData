Department of Physics, National Taiwan Normal University, 88, Sec. 4, Ting-Chou Road, Taipei, 117, Taiwan Received 12 May 1997; accepted for publication 21 August 1997 Abstract Low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy were used to study the initial growth of cobalt ultrathin films on a Pt(111 ) surface at room and low temperatures. The films show incoherent epitaxy at room temperature. Unrotated and rotated incommensurate Co domains with two equivalent angles of rotation, +4.9  and -4.9 , with respect tO the aligned substrate,are observed by LEED for 2 monolayers of Co/Pt( 111 ) after applying an annealing treatment. From a calculation of the mismatch for the corrugated surface, we confirm this reorientation angle. The evolution of the LEED satellite pattern for the deposition at 140 K is the same as for the deposition at room temperature, but a faint (2 x 2) LEED pattern was observed for higher coverages.

1. Introduction
The basic understanding of early stages of the growth of a metal film on a metal substrate has been of continuing interest for many years. The interfacial properties of ultrathin heteroepitaxial films are of fundamental and practical importance in surface science and materials research [1-3].
This system has been selected for a number of reasons. From the viewpoint of crystal growth, Co/Pt(lll) is expected to show some interesting phenomena because the mismatch is rather large (about 10%). In this situation, inhomogeneous strain and a rotated phase may appear at the * Corresponding author.

interface. In addition, Pt is a very good catalyst for oxidation [4]. Co-based alloys are used extens- ively for magnetic recording. Recently, much atten- tion has been devoted to metallic ultrathin films,sandwiches and multilayers of the Co-Pt system owing to their particular magnetic properties [5-7]. For example, polycrystalline CoPt3 alloy films have been used in magnetic-optical record- ings [8]. Various kinds of ordered Co and Pt alloys, such as Co3Pt, CoPt and CoPt3, also exist [9,10]. So the system containing Pt and Co is especially appealing to us.
We used Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) to determine the coverage and to study the initial growth of the Co/Pt(lll) system. The rotated incommensurate Co domains were observed after 320

annealing treatment. They are verified by a cal- culation based on the consideration of lattice mismatch. This interesting structure was first dis- covered by us in this system.
2. Experiment
Experiments were conducted in a stainless steel ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. The base pres- sure was better than 3 x 10 - Torr. The residual gases were checked using a quadrupole mass spec- trometer. The UHV chamber was also equipped for AES, four-grid video LEED and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).
The electron energy analyzer for AES and UPS was the CLAM-2 hemispherical analyzer of VG
MICROTECH. The crystal was oriented within
0.5  of the [ 111 ] direction checked by X-ray reflec-
tion. The Pt(111) substrate was cleaned by cycles of argon ion bombardment and annealing, until sharp diffraction spots with low background were observed by LEED. Before sputtering, the sample was heated at 880 K in an oxygen environment at a pressure of 5 x 10 .7 Torr for about 3 min to remove the residual carbon. The cleanness of the surface was checked by AES.
A Co coil 0.5 mm in diameter and of 99.997% purity was used to evaporate cobalt atoms. The background pressure was about 1 x 10 .9 Torr during Co evaporation. Co was evaporated with a slow rate about 1 monolayer (ML) in 840 s. The instrumentation and sample preparation processes of this experiment are described in detail else- where [11,12].
3. Result and discussion
The evolution of the LEED peak-height inten- sity of the specular beam and the Auger signal vs. deposition time (AS-t) plot can be used to deter- mine the coverage of Co overlayer. Four-grid video LEED with a computer-controlled image process was used to scan the peak-height intensity of a diffracted spot as a function of deposition time.
The phase of LEED inour experimental conditions is (a(O,O)=Akxh=3n for the incident electron energy of 88 eV. Where Ak is the momentum transfer perpendicular to the surface and h = 2.05 is the step height of the adsorbed Co atoms. It is an out-of-phase condition of diffraction which is more sensitive to the surface step density and can oscillate in a layer-by-layer growth [13]. The pro- file of the LEED peak-height intensity versus deposition time (I-t profile) of the (0, 0) beam at room temperature is shown in Fig. 1. The intensity is in oscillation. Two peaks are located at t = 840 s and 1680 s. Since the specular beam is a direct measurement of Ak, it is sensitive to the surface step formation. The maximum of the intensity means that one monolayer grows completely.Hence 1 ML occurs at 840s and 2ML occurs at 1680 s.Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements by Grtitter and Diirig [14] showed that Co grows quasi-layer-by-layer up to a coverage of 3 ML at room temperature. For coverage greater than 3 ML, a three-dimensional island growth mode is observed. AES measurements followed by calibra- tion of the calculated inelastic mean free path of Auger electrons by Thiele et al. [15] showed that Co grows layer-by-layer to at least 2 ML. Because of these results we decided to observe the structural v 9 ....9 g i ,i i

321 evolution with temperature after depositing 2 ML of Co on the Pt( 111 ) surface.
We doubly checked the thickness of the Co overlayer by the evolutions of the Co 775 eV and Pt 237 eV Auger signals at room temperature. The AS-t plot, or Auger uptake curve, is shown in Fig. 2. The Auger intensity of Co 775 eV increases linearly while the intensity of Pt 237 eV Auger signal decreases linearly at the beginning. The change in the slope of the Auger uptake curve is interpreted as a complete growth of each layer on a flat surface. Fig. 2 also shows that Co atoms grow 1 ML in around 840 s and 2 ML in around 1680 s. Because the AS-t plot is not very reliable for determining overlayer growth mode, the plot of Fig. 2 is just the complement for that for LEED.
In fact, the growth of Co/Pt superlattices on epitaxial Ag films on GaAs substrates has been studied by X-ray photoelectron diffraction. The author concluded that the Co film had mixed with Pt during growth at 373 K [16]. This may be the source of the uncertainty in our Auger signals.
A series of LEED patterns were observed at different Co coverages at room temperature. These patterns can be clearly visible as the incident energy of electrons is higher than 56 eV. The well- . - Pt 237eV .....

The linear part is interpreted as a monolayer-by- monolayer growth. The break at t = 840 s corresponds to 1 ML of Co coverage. ordered hexagonal LEED pattern of the clean Pt(111) surface shows that the surface is threefold symmetric. During deposition of Co onto the Pt(lll) surface, the LEED pattern gradually changes to a sixfold symmetry. When the coverage is over 1 ML, the LEED pattern shows a marked change.

a surrounding fine structure. The complex struc- tures for LEED are shown in Fig. 3. The incom- mensurate LEED pattern for coverage of 2 ML is presented in Fig. 3a. (Fig. 3b and c will be dis- cussed later.) The intensity of these satellites increases gradually and the higher order satellites develop as the coverage increases. The intensity of the fine structure reaches a maximum with a low background as the coverage of Co is 2 ML. The background of these satellites increases at higher coverages. These fine structures disappear and the LEED pattern returns to its original sixfold sym- metry with a strong background after the coverage exceeds 9 ML.
The separation in k-space of the nth order of the fine structure from the original integer beam can be described by a misfit vector n(aco - - apt* ) [6,15].
These reciprocal lattice vectors apt = 2/aet, aco=2rc/aco are equal to 2.27A -1 and
2.50A -1
respectively (am=2.77A and aco =
2.51 A). The incommensurate LEED pattern indi-
cates incoherent epitaxy of Co overlayer on the Pt(111) surface. The geometrical structure of the LEED satellites at the coverage of 2 ML is shown in Fig. 4. These satellites can be divided into two sets. One set surrounding (0, 1), (1,-1) and (- 1, 0) looks like a honeycomb. Each spot of the satellites has other hexagonal satellites surrounding it. Another set surrounding (1,0), (0,-1) and (-1, 1) shows a sixfold hexagonal structure. A similar fine structure of LEED satellites has also been found by other authors in the Co/Pt(lll) system [6,15],and in some other thin film systems with a large lattice mismatch, such as ad/W(ll0 [17], Pt/Ni(lll) [18] and FeO/ Pt(lll) [19,20].After annealing 2 ML Co/Pt(lll) at 650 K for 4 rain followed by cooling to room temperature,we found an interesting phenomenon. The satellite rotates about its original integer beam as shown in Fig. 3(b). Fig. 5(a) is a redrawn schematic diagram showing the new structure of satellites after this annealing treatment. The angle of 4.9  is obtained from experimental measurement. The surface structure forming these new hexagonal satellites can be explained by the existence of unrotated (the left part of Fig. 5(b)) and rotated (the right part of Fig. 5(b)) incommensurate Co [-1,1] o [-1

The lighter the colour of the spot, the higher was the intensity of the observed LEED spot. The distance in k-space is indicated. domains of the top layer [ 18 ]. The rotated domains can have two equivalent angles of rotation, + 4.9 and -4.9  with respect to the substrate. The rotated LEED pattern can be clearly observed at temperatures between 630 K and 750 K. It persists for a longer period when the temperature is lower within this temperature range. But the LEED pattern becomes a fuzzy (1 x 1) structure if the annealing lasts too long or the annealing temper- ature is higher than 780 K.
Gtitter and Dtirig studied the alloy formation of Co/Pt(111) at 750 K for the coverage of 2 ML.
The diffusion is very fast and the top few layers are almost pure Pt after 10 rain [14]. Thiele et al. showed that the structure of the incoherent epitax- ial layer of Co/Pt(lll) is maintained and no interdiffusion takes place at T< 525 K. Annealing 4 ML of Co/Pt(lll) at 675 K for 75 min results in the formation of a Pt25Co75 surface alloy [15].From these results, the ultrathin film of 2 ML Co/Pt( 111 ) annealed at 650 K has been developing to form an alloy at the interface. We also checked using AES and showed that the intermixture of Co and Pt occurs under this condition. Since a

is obtained from the experimental measurement. (b) Atomic arrangements with a hard sphere model of rotated and nnrotated domains corresponding to Fig. 5(a). 56 eV electron energy for LEED is very surface sensitive, we believe that the intermixture only occurs at the interface and rotated domains are the top layer of Co. From the above discussion,we can conclude that the driving force for domain rotation comes from a thermal activation. The large mismatch of this system and incommensurate adsorbed layers mean that the original structure is in a metastable state. The rotated domains can be formed under the thermal activation before an alloy state is complete. This new structural phase of the existence of the rotated domains after the annealing is the first such report in the Co/Pt( 111 ) system as far as we know.
A hard sphere model, based on the wave vector of the superstructure, has been used to study the Pb/Ag(111 ) system [21 ]. To confirm that the reori- entation angle is equal to 4.9  for this system, we used the hard sphere model to calculate the mis- match for Co(0001) lattice points on the Pt(lll) surface at different angles in a real space• We chose the original point of the coordinate located on a hollow site on Pt(lll). An x-axis is fixed along the direction of [-1,1,0] of the Pt(lll) surface and an r-axis is set along a straight row of Co adatoms in a rotated Co domain as shown in Fig. 5(b). Then the reorientation angle 0 is defined as the angle between the fixed x-axis and the r- axis. For example, 0 is zero for the left part and is 4.9  for the right part in Fig. 5(b). A point P is confined along the nearest-neighbor row of the x- axis, i.e. the position of P is 2.77(34+ 1/2, /2),where M is the number of hollow sites projected on the x-axis of OP. There are N Co atoms arranged along the r-axis. The Nth Co atom on the r-axis will be close to another hollow site on the substrate after the Co domain rotates an angle of 0. The location of the Nth Co atom is Q--2.51N(cos 0, sin 0). The distance d between points P and Q is:d= IPQI-- {[2.77(M+ 1/2) --2.51N cos 0] 2 + [2.77v/3/2 - 2.51N sin 0] 2 } 1/2.
Let us define a parameter L = d-2.77z where z = 0,1, 2, 3, .... The parameter L is the mismatch with a unit of A as defined. The range of L is assumed to be 2.77>L_>0. The plot of L vs. the reorienta- tion angle 0 is shown in Fig. 6. We only take the part whose mismatch is less than 0.5 A because we are interested only in the minimum mismatch. The range of 0 is set to be within 0-30  under consider- ation of small reorientation. Each lowest point in Fig. 6 represents a minimum mismatch between the row of Co and the Pt(lll) substrate. Table 1 shows all the reorientation angles corresponding to these minimum values of L in Fig. 6. From this table, one can find that N increases at the beginning to a maximum value of N= 15 at 0=4.9 . As 0 exceeds 4.9 , N decreases. Because the Co atom is smaller than the Pt atom in size, a row of Co atoms sitting on a Pt(111 ) surface must buckle up and down. If the distance between two hollow sites of nearest matched points is larger, this buckling 324

The buckling causes an additional term in the surface free energy and increases the surface free energy [22]. Thus the reorientation angle of 4.9  will cause the least mismatch and lowest free energy and it is a reasonable rotation angle for this system. From this calculation we can draw a conclusion: the Co adlayer arranges itself with a row of 15 Co adatoms accumulating on the r-axis with 0=4.9  in which it contains 14 Table 1 All the reorientation angles corresponding to the minimum points as shown in Fig. 6.

We also used LEED to study the growth of this system at 140 K. The same fine structure was observed. These satellites are fuzzier with a stronger background than that of the deposition at room temperature at the coverage above 3 ML.
The insufficient diffusion at this low temperature causes the morphology of this ultrathin film which is rougher than that growing at room temperature.
An additional (2 x 2) LEED pattern was observed as the coverage is larger than 4.5 ML as shown in Fig. 3(c). These (2 x 2) spots persist until the cov- erage is over 7 ML. A similar (2 z 2) pattern was also found in a multilayer FeO/Pt(lll) system and these additional (2 x 2) LEED spots was inter- preted by a particular arrangement of the step structure at the topmost layer [19].
The structure of the valence band of this system in the growing process is interesting. The evolution of the angle integrated UP spectra during depos- ition at room temperature is shown in Fig. 7. He I resonance radiation with a photon energy of
21.2 eV was used. All UP spectra displayed in
Fig. 7 were taken at the near-normal electron emission angle. A sharp Fermi edge and two main peaks located at 1.4 eV and 4.2 eV below the Fermi level were observed for the clean surface (Fig. 7(a)). After Co atoms are deposited on the Pt(111) surface, some interesting phenomena occur:(1) The Fermi edge shifts 0.2 eV to the higher binding energy as the coverage reaches
3.6 ML. This shift is the difference in work
functions for Co and Pt.
(2) The peak height of the Fermi edge decreases monotonically as the coverage increases. The peak height of the Fermi edge at 1 ML attenu- ates to 2/3 of its original value for the clean surface.
(3) The peak height of the peak located at 4.2 eV decreases and the location of this peak shifts toward higher binding energy monotonically as the Co coverage increases. This shift is up to 0.3 eV as the coverage of Co is 1.2 ML.
(4) Only a strong d-band near the Fermi edge is observed when the Co coverage is over

We believe that most of these changes are due to the shift from a Co atomic state to a Co solid state at the interface.

Conclusion We determined the coverage of Co overlayer by oscillation of the out-of-phase LEED intensity and AS-t plot. Cobalt ultrathin film on Pt(lll) shows incoherent epitaxy at room temperature.
Unrotated and rotated incommensurate Co domains of the top layer with two equivalent angles of rotation, +4.9  and -4.9  with respect to the aligned substrate, are observed by LEED for 2 ML of Co/Pt( 111 ) after applying an annea- ling treatment at 650 K. The reorientation angle of 4.9  is confirmed from calculation of mismatch and the grade of buckling. The Co adlayer arranges with a row of 15 Co adatoms accumulating on a row of 14 Pt hollow sites along [-1,1,0] plus another one on the nearest-neighbor row. The rotated domains are caused by the thermal activa- tion and the corresponding LEED pattern will disappear after the alloy state is complete. This interesting structure was first discovered by us in 326

this system. The LEED satellite patterns are the same as that of the deposition at room temper- ature,but a faint (2x2)
LEED
pattern was observed for higher coverages at 140 K. The den- sity of electronic states of this system shows some interesting changes during deposition.
Most of these changes are due to the evolution from the atomic state to the solid state of Co at the interface of Co/Pt ( 111 ).
