I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

The Pt(1 1 1)Sn(2 × 2) and Pt(1 1 1)Sn(3 × 3)R30 surfaces have been prepared and characterised in UHV by vapour deposition of Sn on Pt(1 1 1) and the surfaces subsequently transferred for electrochemical investigation. A surface redox couple, which is associated with the adsorption/desorption of hydroxide on the Sn sites, is observed at 0.28 VRHE/0.15 VRHE in H2SO4 electrolyte on both surfaces. Evidence that it is associated with the adsorption of OH comes from ex situ photoemission measurements, which indicate that the Sn atoms are in a metallic state at potentials below 0.15 VRHE, and an oxidised state at potentials above 0.28RHE. Specific adsorption of sulphate anions is not associated with the surface process since there is no evidence from photoemission of sulphate adsorption, and the same surface couple is observed in HClO4 electrolyte. A second surface redox couple, associated with further oxidation of the Sn sites in the alloy surfaces, is observed at 0.8 VRHE/0.58 VRHE. CO is adsorbed from solution at 300 K, with saturation coverages of 0.37  0.05 ML and 0.2  0.05 ML, respectively. The adsorbed CO is oxidatively stripped at the potential coincident with the adsorption of hydroxide on the tin sites at the lower potential of 0.28 VRHE. This strong promotional effect is unambiguously associated with the bi-functional mechanism. The Sn induced activation of water, and promotion of CO electro-oxidation, is sustained as long as the alloy structure remains intact, in the potential range below 0.5 VRHE. The instability of the alloy surface at higher potentials is associated with the second redox couple. The redox behaviour at higher potentials is modified by the presence of CO in stripping experiments, with couples now observed at 0.78 VRHE/0.56 VRHE, and 0.9 VRHE/0.70 VRHE. This behaviour may be associated with enhanced oxidation through the exclusion of sulphate anions at the surface by CO.

<questions>


How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
