The W 4f7/2 core level is measured in this study. For clean W(lll), there are three components observed in W 4f7/z photoemission due to surface,subsurface and bulk atoms, respectively;the core level shift between surface and bulk atoms is 430 meV. Upon adsorption of Pd or Pt at 300 KI only a bulk-like W 4f7/2 peak is observed. The interface peak associated with W atoms at the Pd-W or Pt-W interface of the W(Ill) face coincides with the W bulk peak. Upon annealing of the metal-covered W(lll) above  750 K, the entire surface undergoes a transition from planar to faceted; the W 4f7/2 core level associated with Pd- and Pt-covered W(211) facets broadens and its centroid shifts to the lower binding energy side of the W bulk peak. The centroid shift and peak broadening are attributed to W atoms at the Pd-W or Pt-W(211) interface of the facets. The relation between the interracial energy and the binding energy difference of the interface W 4fv/z peak and the surface W 4f7/z peak is discussed.

Recently, the Pd- or Pt-covered W(111) has been found to undergo a faceting transition upon annealing the surface above a transition tem- perature,  750 K [ 1-3 ]. The Pd or Pt film grows pseudomorphically on W(lll) at 300K. As the surface is annealed above 750 K, the W substrate * Corresponding author.

The driving force for this faceting transition is believed to be related to the crystallographic anisotropy of the surface free energy of the Pd- or Pt-covered W surface [1,4]. Since electronic energy dominates the bonding between atoms in a solid, valence level photoelectron spectroscopy is an ideal tool to probe the electronic structure as well as the bonding of materials. However, the valence level spectrum is very difficult to understand and theoretical anatysis of band structure is often needed to extract informa- 0039-6028/96/$15.00 Copyright  1996 Elsevier Science

Due to the relatively long lifetime of the W 4f core hole, the natural line width is very narrow and the photoemission lineshape is dominated by phonon broadening [5]; W 4f photoemission is very sensitive to the chemical environment sur- rounding W atoms. The electronic environment around a W atom at the Pd-W or Pt-W interface is expected to be different from that of a W atom in the bulk. This difference may be manifested as a difference in the W 4f7/2 binding energy. That is,the W atom at the Pd-W or Pt-W interface may have a different W 4f7/2 binding energy from that of a W atom at the W-vacuum interface, or in the bulk. Although measurements of surface and inter- face core level shifts are not direct probes of the electronic structure at the interface, they can pro- vide information about segregation and adhesion among metals [6], In this brief report, we present data to illustrate the potential of core level photo- electron spectroscopy for determining the ener- getics of metal-metal interfaces, and we point the direction to future experiments that address these issues.
In the present study, high resolution photo- electron spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation is used to investigate the W 4f7/2 core level shifts that accompany adsorption of Pd or Pt adlayers on W(lll) as well as on {211} facets produced by annealing above 750 K. The measurements are carried out on beamline U4A at the National Synchrotron Light Source.
The beamline is equipped with a 6 m TGM monochromator. The photons are incident at an angle of 45  with respect to the surface normal and photoelectrons are collected by a 100 mm mean radius hemispherical energy analyzer (manufactured by VSW) along the surface normal. The photon energy used in this study is 75 eV and the total instrumental resolution estimated from the Fermi edge at 300 K is 120 meV.

57 two well-resolved peaks. Since the linewidth of the W 4f7/ component is narrower than that of the W 4f5/2 component, we focus our discussion on the W 4f7/2 core level. A nonlinear least squares analysis of the W 4f7/2 spectrum indicates three distinctive components; they have been identified as originating from the bulk, the subsurface and the surface W atoms (cf. Fig. lb) [7]. The detailed analysis of the W 4f7)2 photoemission data for W(lll) will be discussed in a separate report [8].
It suffices to mention that the surface (subsurface) peak is shifted to the lower binding energy side of the bulk peak by 430 meV (110 meV), which agrees very well with a previous study [7].
As ,, 1.5 ML Pd (or ,- 1.i ML Pt) is adsorbed on W(lll) at 300 K, only a bulk-like W peak is observed (cf. Figs. 2b and 310), as indicated by a nonlinear least squares fit. That is, the W surface and subsurface peaks are shifted to higher binding energies and coincide with the W bulk peakJ The

(a) Clean W(lll) surface,(b)  1.1 ML Pt/W(lll) at 300 K, and (c) after annealing of (b) at 900 K for 3 min. 1 The background for the film-covered surface is higher than that of the clean surface; sometimes this makes the peak in the raw data appear at slightly higher binding energy. disappearance of surface and subsurface W peaks can be attributed to the removal of the vacuum-W interface at the expense of creation of a Pd-W or Pt-W interface and a Pd-vacuum or Pt-vacuum interface due to the adsorbed Pd or Pt film. On the other hand, one would expect to observe a W peak associated with W atoms at the Pd-W or Pt-W interface. Therefore, the bulk-like W peak observed in Figs. 2b and 3b suggests that the interface W peak at the Pd-W or Pt-W interface for the [ 111 ] face coincides with the bulk W peak.
As the film-covered W(lll) surface is annealed to 900 K for 3 min, film-covered {211} facets develop,which are verified in situ by low energy electron diffraction. The corresponding W 4f/2 spectra for Pd and Pt films are shown in Figs. 2c and 3c,respectively. The salient features of these spectra are the broadening of the lineshape and the shifting of the centroid of the lineshape to the lower binding energy side of the bulk W peak. The broadening of the lineshape is an inhomogeneous effect, i.e.,the interface W peak at the Pd-W or Pt-W inter- face for the [211] face has a different binding energy from that of the bulk W peak. This is demon- strated by a nonlinear least squares fit of Fig. 2c shown as dashed lines for the Pd-covered facets. A preliminary analysis of the photoemission from Pd-covered facets shows a shift of (90 -1- 10) meV for the interface W peak toward the lower binding energy side of the bulk W peak. For the Pt-covered facets, the nonlinear least squares analysis indicates a shift less than 20 meV for the interface W peak,toward the lower binding energy side of the bulk W peak, which is smaller than that (,-70 meV) observed on Pt/W(ll0) [9]. There is also an increased background at higher binding energies for the film-covered surfaces, which may indicate increased screening of W atoms at the interface.
The detailed analysis of individual systems will be discussed elsewhere [8,10].
A simple bond counting argument suggests that Pd or Pt will bond more strongly on the W(lll) surface than on the W(211) surface due to the rough open nature of W(lll) (cf. Figs. lb and lc).
Based on thermal desorption data [1], the binding energy of 1 ML Pd on W(ll 1) is estimated to be 417 kJ/mol using the Redhead equation [ 11 ]. One may attempt to correlate the shift of the interface 58

W peak relative to the bulk W peak with the Pd-W bond strength. That is, the larger shift of the interface W peak associated with the facets may be related to the weaker Pd-W bond on the [211] face. Furthermore, on W(ll0), Pt is found to bond considerably more strongly than Pd [12,13]; one could expect that Pt also bonds more strongly on the {211} facets than Pd. Therefore,the smaller shift of the interface W peak associated with the facets induced by Pt, compared with that induced by Pd, can also be correlated with the stronger Pt-W bond on [211] face. However, there is no difference in the shifts of the interface W peaks associated with Pd and Pt at the [ 111 ] face and yet Pt is found to bond more strongly on W(lll) [1,2] than Pd. Thus, the relation (if there is one) between the sign and the magnitude of the shift of the interface W peak relative to the bulk W peak and the bond strengths between the metals is very subtle.
A more straightforward way to understand the shifts associated with the interface W peaks is to use a Born-Haber cycle [14] since the ionized W4f is well-screened and the equivalent core approximation (ECA) is adequate. It has been argued that the binding energy difference between the interface peak and the surface peak can be related to the heat of adhesion [6]. Consider Pd adsorption on W(lll) as an example: the binding energy difference between the interface W 4fT/a and the surface W 4f7/2, AE w, is called the adhesion shift. Based on the ECA, the quantity AE w is related to the difference between the heat of adhesion of Re on Pd,a ATva, and that of W on Pd, A7 w [15].
That is,
AE
w = A,p -- ay w,( 1 ) where Pd and Re are assumed to have bcc struc- tures. Furthermore, the heat of adhesion can be related to the surface as well as interface energies through an expression of the form A?w(111) = -Tva(111) - ?w(ll 1) + 7at(W(111)).
(2) in the bcc structure and 7inter(W(111)) is the interracial energy of the Pd-W(111) interface.
If one knows the surface energies, the interracial energy can then be inferred from the heat of adhesion. Unfortunately, surface energies of very few single crystal surfaces of refractory metals are available (in particular, none are available experi- mentally for Pd in the bcc structure). On the other hand, the anisotropy in the surface energies for different crystallographic directions can be deter- mined, e.g. from the shape of thermally annealed field emission tips [16] or from the surface core level shifts [ 17]. Similarly, the anisotropy in inter- facial energies can be inferred from the difference in the adhesion shift. Nevertheless, the present example is not easy to interpret since hcp Re (to the right of W in the periodic table) has a crystalline structure which is different from bcc W. The anisotropy in the surface energies for Re in the bcc structure has not been measured3 However, bcc Ta(ll 1) (to the left of W in the periodic table) may be a good candidate. The adhesion shift measured on Ta(lll) induced by Pd is Ta _ Ta AE ad - A7 w - AYva (3) and dlTpTa(ll 1) = --•pd(lll) -- PTa(lll) + yinter(Ta(111)),(4) where yintr(Ta(lll)) is the interfacial energy of the Pd-Ta(lll) interface. If Pd-covered Ta(lll) goes through the same faceting transition upon annealing as Pd-covered W(lll) does, the differ- ence in the adhesion shift (before and after the faceting transition) is Ta AEa(lll)

59 obtained from the surface core level shifts of the clean surfaces [ 17]. Therefore, the relation between the difference in the interfacial energies can be inferred from the difference in the adhesion shift.
In order to test this relation, the surface core level shifts for Ta(211) and W(211) surfaces have to be measured, in addition to the measurement of the adhesion shift for Pd/Ta(111). These measure- ments are currently planned.
In conclusion, we have shown that tungsten core level shifts associated with interface formation in the Pd/W and Pt/W systems are rather substantial and can be measured to a precision of ,- _+ 10 meV.
In order to use the measured shifts to determine the surface and interfacial energies (within the framework of the ECA), further measurements of core level shifts are needed on Ta surfaces.
