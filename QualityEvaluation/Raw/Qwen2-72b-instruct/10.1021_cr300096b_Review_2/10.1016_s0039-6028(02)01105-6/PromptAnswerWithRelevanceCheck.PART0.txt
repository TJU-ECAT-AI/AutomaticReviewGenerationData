1.The document does not provide information on the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. The document focuses on the characterization of Fe/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing Fe onto a Pt(111) single crystal at 350 K in ultrahigh vacuum. The characterization was conducted using X-ray electron spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and low energy ion scattering. This process is crucial for understanding the alloying that occurs upon deposition, the diffusion of Fe into the near-surface region, and the formation of an alloy layer at the surface. The thermal stability of these Fe films and the concentration of Fe in the topmost layer were characterized by X-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS) and low energy ion scattering (LEIS). XPS provided evidence for formation of a PtFe alloy upon annealing to 750 K which caused a chemical shift of both Fe(3d) and Pt(4f) core levels. The (2×2) LEED pattern observed after annealing to 750850 K indicates the formation of an ordered PtFe alloy at the surface containing 0.5-ML Fe. This procedure produces Fe-containing alloy surfaces that are more thermally stable against Pt surface segregation than expected from the behavior of Pt80Fe20(1 1 1) bulk crystals, and significant amounts of Fe are stabilized in the surface layer until temperatures as high as 950 K.

1.文档没有提供关于通过在Pt(111)单晶或Pt多晶基板上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征信息。文档主要关注Fe/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在超高压下将Fe沉积到350 K的Pt(111)单晶上。使用X射线电子光谱学，低能电子衍射(LEED)和低能离子散射进行表征。此过程对于理解沉积时发生的合金化，Fe向近表面区域的扩散以及表面合金层的形成至关重要。通过X射线电子光谱学(XPS)和低能离子散射(LEIS)表征了这些Fe薄膜的热稳定性以及最顶层中Fe的浓度。XPS提供了在750 K退火时形成PtFe合金的证据，这导致Fe(3d)和Pt(4f)核心水平的化学转移。在750850 K退火后观察到的(2×2)LEED图案表明在表面形成了包含0.5-ML Fe的有序PtFe合金。该程序产生的Fe含量合金表面比从Pt80Fe20(1 1 1)体晶体的行为预期的更热稳定，直到高达950 K的温度，表面层中都有大量Fe稳定。
