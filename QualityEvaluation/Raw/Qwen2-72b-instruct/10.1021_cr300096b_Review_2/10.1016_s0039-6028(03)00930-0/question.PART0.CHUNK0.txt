Stabilization of the ferromagnetic configuration through alloying for monolayers of V, Cr, Mn on Pt(0 0 1) substrate Abstract The magnetism is investigated for pseudomorphic monolayers of (V, Cr and Mn) and their substitutional c(2 × 2) alloyed structures adsorbed on Pt(0 0 1) semi-infinite surfaces using the semiempirical tight-binding method. Vanadium pseudomorphic monolayer exhibits a c(2 × 2) magnetic ordering, whereas Cr and Mn overlayers exhibit both c(2 ×  2) and p(1 × 1) magnetic structures. The substitutional alloyed overlayers exhibit ferrimagnetic structures that leads to appreciable net surface magnetization.
1. Introduction
Although most bulk transition metals are not magnetically ordered, their electronic structures make them likely to be good candidates of induced magnetism. Transition metals are considered to be well-promising candidates as constituents of synthetic magnetic structures due to their favorable properties. Intensive theoretical and experimental studies are devoted to investigate the magnetism of such structures.
Since the experimental evidence of magnetism in vanadium (V) clusters [1] , intensive theoretical and experimental studies were devoted for V overlayers adsorbed on bcc and fcc substrates. Vanadium exhibits an induced ferromagnetic ordering when it is in contact with a ferromagnetic metal such as Fe as it was predicted theoretically [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] and detected experimentally [6] ,[7] ,[8] . On the other hand, it has been predicted that V overlayers exhibit a c(2 × 2) antiferromagnetic ordering when they are adsorbed on an fcc substrate such as Pd(0 0 1) surface [9] ,[10] .
The exciting theoretical predictions concerning the magnetism of Cr surfaces [11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] have stimulated experimentalists to test a number of substrates such as Al, V, Fe, Co, Ag, Nb, W and Au for the growth of Cr ultrathin films, which have attained different success [15] . Zhang et al.
[16] have observed a self-organized nanostructure on the Cr/Pt(1 1 1) system and Albrecht et al.
[17] have discussed the growth and structure of Cr on Ru(0 0 0 1). Ultrathin Cr films with a thickness less than 3 monolayers (MLs) appear to be face-centered-cubic (fcc) when grown on Pd(1 0 0) substrate. Blgel et al.
[18] have reported on the magnetic properties of a Cr ML on Pd(0 0 1). Within FLAPW method in film geometry they have shown that Cr on the Pd(0 0 1) substrate orders in a c(2 × 2) antiferromagnetic (AF) structure favored by 24.5 mRy below the ferromagnetic configuration. The calculations of Cr slabs on Pd(0 0 1) substrate were extended by semi-empirical tight-binding method [19] , and these investigations have shown an in-plane AF structure and interlayer AF coupling in such structures. Overlayers of Cr were studied extensively, they exhibit p(1 × 1) and c(2 × 2) configurations when they are deposited on Fe and Ag, respectively [20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] .
The magnetic moments of Mn overlayers adsorbed on bcc and fcc substrates have been studied. In the case of the bcc Cr substrate, the investigations show ferromagnetic ordering with AF interlayer coupling for the orientations (0 0 1) and (1 1 1) and a c(2 × 2) configuration ordering for the (0 1 1) orientation [24] ,[25] . However, the studies have shown that Mn exhibits a c(2 × 2) magnetic configuration when it is adsorbed on the fcc Pd substrate [26] ,[27] .
Experiments have shown that epitaxially grown layers exhibit substitutional alloying with the substrate as the first layer is grown. Proton-induced Auger-electron spectroscopy has been performed by Igel et al.
[28] for the topmost layer of epitaxial Mn films on Fe(1 0 0). They found significant interfacial alloying during the growth of the first monolayer of Mn on Fe(1 0 0) while the second monolayer grows as a pure Mn film. Taguchi et al. were the first to investigate the stability of a MnFe ordered surface alloy on an Fe(1 0 0) substrate with the perfect Mn ML on Fe (1 0 0) [29] . They have shown within TB-LMTO calculations that alloy formation at the interface affects strongly the magnetic ordering [29] .
In this communication we present a theoretical study to investigate the effect of the substitutional alloying on the magnetic map of V, Cr and Mn transition metals adsorbed Pt(0 0 1). The calculations are carried out using the self-consistent real space tight-binding method in the HartreeFock approximation of the Hubbard Hamiltonian [30] ,[31] ,[32] ,[33] ,[34] .
2. Results and discussion
In this communication, first we study the magnetic properties of V, Cr and Mn transition-metal pseudomorphic monolayers on Pt(0 0 1) substrates. Then we investigate the magnetism of the substitutional alloyed overlayers of the above-mentioned transition metals in the case of one and two monolayers. Each substitutional alloyed overlayer is formed of 50% of one of the 3d transition metals plus 50% Pt. The geometrical structure of the 3d transition metals V, Cr and Mn is bcc, whereas that of the 5d transition metal Pt is fcc. The lattice constants of V, Cr, Mn, and Pt are 5.71, 5.45, 5.40 and 7.41 a.u., with misfits of 9.0%, 4.0% and 3.1%, respectively [35] . These lattice constants are needed to adjust the hopping integrals to that of Pt substrate according to the well-known formula that relates the hopping integrals to the inverse fifth power of the distance for d-type elements [34] . The hopping integral of Pt is chosen to recover its bandwidth in the paramagnetic state [36] . The exchange parameters are adjusted to recover the AF ground states of Cr and Mn. However, V and Pt are paramagnetic materials in their bulk form, so their exchange parameters are taken from ab initio calculations [37] .
3. Pseudomorphic monolayers on Pt(0 0 1) substrates
3.1. V/Pt(0 0 1) system
This system exhibits a c(2 × 2) AF magnetic structure of the V surface layer, V(S), with appreciable local magnetic moment 1.85μB. As a result of this configuration, there is no induced magnetic moments at the Pt atoms of the interfacial layer, Pt(I). However, the Pt(I-1) is found to exhibit a c(2 × 2) magnetic configuration of a moment equals 0.06μB, induced by the moments of V(S) and AF coupled with them ( Table 1 ). This behavior agrees with that of V/Pd(0 0 1) in a previous work, which exhibits the same magnetic configuration, but with smaller values of magnetic moments, 1.68μB at V surface atoms and 0.05μB at Pd subinterfacial atoms [10] . Although, Pd and Pt elements belong to the same group in the periodic table, the lattice constant of Pt is larger than that of Pd, which leads to larger local magnetic moments at V when they are adsorbed at Pt surface rather than the Pd.

3.2. Cr/Pt(0 0 1) system
This system is found to exhibit two magnetic configurations, a p(1 × 1) ferromagnetic (F) and c(2 × 2) AF configurations. However, the AF c(2 × 2) solution is more stable than the F solution by a difference of the total energy per atom of about 0.12 eV. The magnetic moment at Cr surface atom, Cr(S), is 4.25μB in the c(2 × 2) magnetic structure, zero induced magnetic moment at Pt interfacial atoms, Pt(I), and 0.08μB at the subinterfacial layer with AF coupling with those of Cr surface atoms. On the other hand, the local magnetic moment per atom on the Cr(S) layer is 4.53μB in the case of the less favorable F p(1 × 1) magnetic structure. Unlike the case of the c(2 × 2) magnetic structure, there is an induced magnetic moment of 0.11μB at Pt interfacial atom as a result of the net magnetization at the surface with a ferromagnetic coupling with the surface moments. However, surprisingly there are larger magnetic moments at the subinterfacial Pt atoms, which are antiferromagnetically coupled with those of Pt interfacial atoms. The same behavior has been obtained in the Cr/Pd(0 0 1) system but with smaller magnetic moments 3.87μB and 3.77μB at Cr surface atoms and 0.13μB and 0.16μB induced moments at Pd interfacial atoms in the F p(1 × 1) and the AF c(2 × 2) magnetic structures, respectively [19] .
3.3. Mn/Pt(0 0 1) system
In this system, two magnetic configurations are also obtained, the p(1 × 1) and c(2 × 2) magnetic orderings. However, the difference in the total energy per atom between these magnetic configurations is relatively small, about 0.01 eV. This behavior is related to the complexity of the magnetic structure of bulk Mn. A study by Fujii et al. has been carried out by LMTO-ASA method for bcc Mn as a function of lattice constant for paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states [38] . They found that Mn prefers the paramagnetic state below a lattice constant 2.68 Å, the low-spin ferromagnetic state between 2.68 and 2.95 Å and the antiferromagnetic state above 2.95 Å. A more recent study of Mn surfaces at different orientations has attested the fact of the unpredictable magnetic structure of Mn [24] . In this study, the AF solution was found to be more favorable than the F solution by 0.03 eV/atom at the (0 0 1) orientation. However, the F solution was favored by 0.06 eV/atom than the AF solution at the (1 1 1) orientation, whereas only the F solution exists in the (0 1 1) orientation. The above behavior is due to the complex structure of Mn that cannot be easily predicted [39] .
4. Substitutional alloyed overlayers on Pt(0 0 1) substrates
In this subsection, we investigate the magnetism of the substitutional alloyed overlayers of a c(2 × 2) geometrical structure that is represented schematically in Fig. 1 . The local magnetic moments on these substitutional alloyed overlayers are displayed in Table 2 . From this table one can notice that V0.5Pt0.5 and Cr0.5Pt0.5 substitutional alloyed overlayers exhibit ferrimagnetic structures, whereas those on Mn0.5Pt0.5 overlayer are unequal moments aligned in the same direction. The local magnetic moments of the substitutional V atoms are appreciably enhanced as compared to those of the complete pseudomorphic overlayer. This can be ascribed to the relatively weak interaction of the substitutional atoms with Pt atoms, which have approximately filled d-bands. On the contrary, the local magnetic moments are slightly decreased at Cr substitutional atoms. Both V and Cr atoms exhibit intra- and interlayer AF coupling with the induced moments of Pt atoms in the proximity. However, the substitutional Mn atoms have the same magnetic moments as those of the pseudomorphic Mn overlayer in its ferromagnetic state. These moments are ferromagnetically coupled with the induced magnetic moments of Pt atoms in the proximity.

5. Conclusion
In this work, we investigated the magnetic structure of V, Cr and Mn pseudomorphic overlayers and their substitutional alloys adsorbed at Pt(0 0 1) surfaces. The calculations are carried out using the tight-binding method within the HartreeFock approximation using Hubbard Hamiltonian. The main points of this study can be summarized as follows:(i) Vanadium pseudomorphic overlayer exhibits a c(2 × 2) magnetic structure with a zero net magnetization.
(ii) Chromium and Mn pseudomorphic overlayers exhibit both the c(2 × 2) and p(1 × 1) magnetic structures with a preference of the former structure, which is more pronounced in the Cr/Pt(0 0 1) system.
(iii) The substitutional alloyed overlayers exhibit ferrimagnetic ordering in the case of V0.5Pt0.5 and Cr0.5Pt0.5 overlayers, whereas unequal local magnetic moments aligned in the same directions are obtained in the case of the Mn0.5Pt0.5 overlayer. These behaviors are the same as those obtained in a previous study using Pd(0 0 1) as a substrate [40] .
Further investigations on systems such as (V, Cr, Mn)0.75Pt0.25 are in progress.
