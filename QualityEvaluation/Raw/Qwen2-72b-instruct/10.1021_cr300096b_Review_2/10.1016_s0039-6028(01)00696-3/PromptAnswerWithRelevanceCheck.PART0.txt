1.The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is not explicitly described in the literature. However, the process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the investigation of the influence of structural parameters on catalytic activity and magnetism of an alloy. The NiPt system is an interesting candidate for investigations due to its high catalytic selectivity for certain reactions and the strong interplay between magnetic and spatial order.

However, the process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the investigation of the atomic scale interactions and the formation of metastable alloy phases. The study shows that Ni atoms exchange with Pt at both terrace and step sites, forming a one-dimensional ordered alloy at the step edges and randomly embedding in Pt on the terraces. At higher temperatures, a 2x2 substitutional alloy is formed, corresponding to a Ni20Pt80 composition of the surface topmost layer. This detailed characterization is essential for modeling and computational studies, providing insights into the structural and electronic properties of Ni/Pt surfaces, which are critical for catalysis and other surface science applications.
