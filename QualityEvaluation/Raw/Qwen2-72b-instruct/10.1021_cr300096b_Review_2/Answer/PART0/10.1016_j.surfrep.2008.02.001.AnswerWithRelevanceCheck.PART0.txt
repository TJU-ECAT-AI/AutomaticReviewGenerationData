          [1] "The Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces have been characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques and DFT modeling [26] . When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure."
          [2] "Below we will use the NiPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) surfaces as model systems to illustrate the information that can be derived from AES, XPS, LEIS and STM characterization."
          [3] "Fig. 5 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K."
          [4] "Fig. 6 shows the normal and grazing emission XPS of the NiPt(111) surface prepared at 300 K and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure prepared at 600 K."
          [5] "Finally, STM was also utilized to further characterize the morphology of the 300 K and 600 K surfaces."
          [6] "Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K."
          [7] "The characterization following the annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from the DFT modeling and experimental measurements of chemical properties, as described later."

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using a wide range of experimental techniques and DFT modeling. When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. The surfaces are characterized using AES, XPS, LEIS, and STM. The LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K are shown in Fig. 5. The normal and grazing emission XPS of the NiPt(111) surface prepared at 300 K and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure prepared at 600 K are shown in Fig. 6. STM was also utilized to further characterize the morphology of the 300 K and 600 K surfaces. The AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following the annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from the DFT modeling and experimental measurements of chemical properties. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

          通过在300 K下将Ni沉积在Pt(111)表面上，Ni原子停留在最顶层，形成NiPt(111)表面MBS结构。如果随后将该表面加热至600 K，或者在600 K下将Pt(111)基板进行单层沉积，大多数Ni原子会扩散到Pt(111)的次表面区域，形成PtNiPt(111)次表面MBS结构。使用AES、XPS、LEIS和STM对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征。图5显示了将300 K NiPt(111)表面加热至900 K后的LEIS和AES结果。图6显示了在300 K下制备的NiPt(111)表面和在600 K下制备的PtNiPt(111)次表面结构的正常和掠射发射XPS。STM也被用来进一步表征300 K和600 K表面的形貌。AES、LEIS、XPS和STM结果证实，在300 K下沉积Ni后，Pt(111)表面存在一层Ni单层。在600640 K下退火后的表征与Ni扩散到Pt(111)的次表面区域一致；从DFT建模和化学性质的实验测量中进一步提出了PtNiPt(111)结构的可能性，其中Ni原子直接位于表面Pt下方。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在高级表面科学和催化研究背景下的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。
