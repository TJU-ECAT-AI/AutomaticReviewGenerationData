This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The unique surface activity on the bimetallic systems is observed only when annealed to 600 K. Deposition of a monolayer coverage of Ni on Pt(111) at 300 K produces reactivity similar to those on Ni surfaces. On the other hand, after heating the surfaces to 600 K, probe reactions show surface activity unlike those on Ni, Co, or Pt(111) surfaces. Additional experimental characterization and theoretical studies determined that the differences between the 300 and 600 K bimetallic surfaces were due to diffusion of monolayer Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111), producing the PtNiPt(111) surface structures.

It also allows for the investigation of atomic scale interactions and the formation of metastable alloy phases. The study shows that Ni atoms exchange with Pt at both terrace and step sites, forming a one-dimensional ordered alloy at the step edges and randomly embedding in Pt on the terraces. At higher temperatures, a 2x2 substitutional alloy is formed, corresponding to a Ni20Pt80 composition of the surface topmost layer. This detailed characterization is essential for modeling and computational studies, providing insights into the structural and electronic properties of Ni/Pt surfaces, which are critical for catalysis and other surface science applications.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using a wide range of experimental techniques and DFT modeling. When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. The surfaces are characterized using AES, XPS, LEIS, and STM. The LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K are shown in Fig. 5. The normal and grazing emission XPS of the NiPt(111) surface prepared at 300 K and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure prepared at 600 K are shown in Fig. 6. STM was also utilized to further characterize the morphology of the 300 K and 600 K surfaces. The AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following the annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from the DFT modeling and experimental measurements of chemical properties. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The unique properties of bimetallic surfaces often result in activities and selectivities that exceed those of monometallic catalysts. Fundamental experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to explore the novel properties of well-defined bimetallic surfaces. A monolayer film of one metal can be deposited onto a single-crystal substrate of another metal to study the modification effects on surface chemistry due to bimetallic formation. Lattice mismatch leads to a modification of the surface electronic properties due to the strain effect, and the formation of heterometallic bonds further alters the electronic properties of the surface, known as the ligand effect. The position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level is a useful parameter to describe the changes in the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces, which has been shown to correlate with the ability of bimetallic surfaces to bind with small adsorbates and activation barriers to reactions. Determination of the surface d-band center may enable first-principles predictions of bimetallic surfaces with desirable catalytic properties. In the present work, a combination of DFT modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene. Pt(111) was modified with several 3d transition metals, including Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu. Depositing these metals on a Pt(111) single-crystal surface at room temperature resulted in the formation of a surface monolayer of the 3d metals, designated as 3d-Pt-Pt(111). At elevated temperatures, the formation of a surface alloy was observed for each Pt-3d pair, enriched in Pt in the first atomic layer due to the enthalpic driving potential created by the lower surface energy of Pt compared with the 3d metals under consideration. Strain may play a part in the interdiffusion of the Pt and 3d metals, and these Pt-enriched bimetallic surfaces are designated Pt-3d-Pt(111) in this study. Kitchin et al. studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level. The current study extends these findings to Fe-, Co-, and Cu-modified Pt(111) surfaces. Cyclohexene is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces due to the competitive nature of its reaction pathways. Previous studies have shown that subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway, and similar results were observed in the current study for the Pt-Fe-Pt(111) surface. However, the Pt-Cu-Pt(111) surface did not exhibit the same hydrogenation pathway. The hydrogenation pathway did not occur on the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces due to the strong binding of cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen. The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow for the establishment of a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. The study was extended to the growth and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on the Pt(111) surface. The surfaces were prepared by depositing 1 ML of the 3d metal at 300 K for the surface configuration, and at 600 K for the subsurface bimetallic configuration. DFT was used to calculate the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. The binding energies of both the boat and chair configurations were calculated for di-σ bonded cyclohexene, demonstrating that the boat configuration is the thermodynamically preferred structure. The study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases. The surfaces were modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition, and the quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. The AES quantification of the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on Pt(111) was performed. The surfaces were heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition. The surfaces used in the current study were pseudomorphic films of Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, for which approximately five to ten monolayers of the 3d metal were deposited on Pt(111) such that Pt was barely detectable in the AES scan. The thin film surfaces were modeled as the bulk closed packed 3d surface for each respective metal. The theoretical results presented in this paper were calculated using self-consistent periodic slab calculations with the VASP (Vienna ab initio Simulation Package) code. The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene were studied using super cells containing four atomic layers, with the top two layers allowed to relax in each case. Calculations for gas-phase hydrogen and cyclohexene were carried out implementing spin-polarization, whereas the adsorbate-metal system calculations were carried out spin-unpolarized, because the relative difference in the adsorption energies with and without spin-polarization was typically found to be <5 kJ/mol for atomic hydrogen and alkenes. For the hydrogen-metal system, hydrogen was adsorbed in the threefold hollow site of the metal surface with a coverage of 1/9 ML. The binding of cyclohexene was studied on hydrogen co-adsorbed surfaces. One cyclohexene molecule was bonded in the di-σ configuration on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces, with the presence of two co-adsorbed hydrogen atoms in the super cell. The hydrogen atoms were bonded in the two threefold hollow sites nearest to the cyclohexene molecule, to ascertain the effect of repulsion on the binding of cyclohexene.

When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. The surfaces are characterized using AES, XPS, LEIS, and STM. The LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K are shown in Fig. 5. The normal and grazing emission XPS of the NiPt(111) surface prepared at 300 K and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure prepared at 600 K are shown in Fig. 6. STM was also utilized to further characterize the morphology of the 300 K and 600 K surfaces. The AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following the annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from the DFT modeling and experimental measurements of chemical properties. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The unique properties of bimetallic surfaces often result in activities and selectivities that exceed those of monometallic catalysts. Fundamental experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to explore the novel properties of well-defined bimetallic surfaces. A monolayer film of one metal can be deposited onto a single-crystal substrate of another metal to study the modification effects on surface chemistry due to bimetallic formation. Lattice mismatch leads to a modification of the surface electronic properties due to the strain effect, and the formation of heterometallic bonds further alters the electronic properties of the surface, known as the ligand effect. The position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level is a useful parameter to describe the changes in the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces, which has been shown to correlate with the ability of bimetallic surfaces to bind with small adsorbates and activation barriers to reactions. Determination of the surface d-band center may enable first-principles predictions of bimetallic surfaces with desirable catalytic properties. In the present work, a combination of DFT modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene. Pt(111) was modified with several 3d transition metals, including Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu. Depositing these metals on a Pt(111) single-crystal surface at room temperature resulted in the formation of a surface monolayer of the 3d metals, designated as 3d-Pt-Pt(111). At elevated temperatures, the formation of a surface alloy was observed for each Pt-3d pair, enriched in Pt in the first atomic layer due to the enthalpic driving potential created by the lower surface energy of Pt compared with the 3d metals under consideration. Strain may play a part in the interdiffusion of the Pt and 3d metals, and these Pt-enriched bimetallic surfaces are designated Pt-3d-Pt(111) in this study. Kitchin et al. studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level. The current study extends these findings to Fe-, Co-, and Cu-modified Pt(111) surfaces. Cyclohexene is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces due to the competitive nature of its reaction pathways. Previous studies have shown that subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway, and similar results were observed in the current study for the Pt-Fe-Pt(111) surface. However, the Pt-Cu-Pt(111) surface did not exhibit the same hydrogenation pathway. The hydrogenation pathway did not occur on the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces due to the strong binding of cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen. The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow for the establishment of a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. The study was extended to the growth and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on the Pt(111) surface. The surfaces were prepared by depositing 1 ML of the 3d metal at 300 K for the surface configuration, and at 600 K for the subsurface bimetallic configuration. DFT was used to calculate the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. The binding energies of both the boat and chair configurations were calculated for di-σ bonded cyclohexene, demonstrating that the boat configuration is the thermodynamically preferred structure. The study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases. The surfaces were modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition, and the quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. The AES quantification of the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on Pt(111) was performed. The surfaces were heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition. The surfaces used in the current study were pseudomorphic films of Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, for which approximately five to ten monolayers of the 3d metal were deposited on Pt(111) such that Pt was barely detectable in the AES scan. The thin film surfaces were modeled as the bulk closed packed 3d surface for each respective metal. The theoretical results presented in this paper were calculated using self-consistent periodic slab calculations with the VASP (Vienna ab initio Simulation Package) code. The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene were studied using super cells containing four atomic layers, with the top two layers allowed to relax in each case. Calculations for gas-phase hydrogen and cyclohexene were carried out implementing spin-polarization, whereas the adsorbate-metal system calculations were carried out spin-unpolarized, because the relative difference in the adsorption energies with and without spin-polarization was typically found to be <5 kJ/mol for atomic hydrogen and alkenes. For the hydrogen-metal system, hydrogen was adsorbed in the threefold hollow site of the metal surface with a coverage of 1/9 ML. The binding of cyclohexene was studied on hydrogen co-adsorbed surfaces. One cyclohexene molecule was bonded in the di-σ configuration on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces, with the presence of two co-adsorbed hydrogen atoms in the super cell. The hydrogen atoms were bonded in the two threefold hollow sites nearest to the cyclohexene molecule, to ascertain the effect of repulsion on the binding of cyclohexene.

On the other hand, after heating the surfaces to 600 K, probe reactions show surface activity unlike those on Ni, Co, or Pt(111) surfaces. Additional experimental characterization and theoretical studies determined that the differences between the 300 and 600 K bimetallic surfaces were due to diffusion of monolayer Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111), producing the PtNiPt(111) surface structures.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using a wide range of experimental techniques and DFT modeling. When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. The surfaces are characterized using AES, XPS, LEIS, and STM. The LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K are shown in Fig. 5. The normal and grazing emission XPS of the NiPt(111) surface prepared at 300 K and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure prepared at 600 K are shown in Fig. 6. STM was also utilized to further characterize the morphology of the 300 K and 600 K surfaces.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The unique properties of bimetallic surfaces often result in activities and selectivities that exceed those of monometallic catalysts. Fundamental experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to explore the novel properties of well-defined bimetallic surfaces. A monolayer film of one metal can be deposited onto a single-crystal substrate of another metal to study the modification effects on surface chemistry due to bimetallic formation. Lattice mismatch leads to a modification of the surface electronic properties due to the strain effect, and the formation of heterometallic bonds further alters the electronic properties of the surface, known as the ligand effect. The position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level is a useful parameter to describe the changes in the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces, which has been shown to correlate with the ability of bimetallic surfaces to bind with small adsorbates and activation barriers to reactions. Determination of the surface d-band center may enable first-principles predictions of bimetallic surfaces with desirable catalytic properties. In the present work, a combination of DFT modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene. Pt(111) was modified with several 3d transition metals, including Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu. Depositing these metals on a Pt(111) single-crystal surface at room temperature resulted in the formation of a surface monolayer of the 3d metals, designated as 3d-Pt-Pt(111). At elevated temperatures, the formation of a surface alloy was observed for each Pt-3d pair, enriched in Pt in the first atomic layer due to the enthalpic driving potential created by the lower surface energy of Pt compared with the 3d metals under consideration. Strain may play a part in the interdiffusion of the Pt and 3d metals, and these Pt-enriched bimetallic surfaces are designated Pt-3d-Pt(111) in this study. Kitchin et al. studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level. The current study extends these findings to Fe-, Co-, and Cu-modified Pt(111) surfaces. Cyclohexene is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces due to the competitive nature of its reaction pathways. Previous studies have shown that subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway, and similar results were observed in the current study for the Pt-Fe-Pt(111) surface. However, the Pt-Cu-Pt(111) surface did not exhibit the same hydrogenation pathway. The hydrogenation pathway did not occur on the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces due to the strong binding of cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen. The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow for the establishment of a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. The study was extended to the growth and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on the Pt(111) surface. The surfaces were prepared by depositing 1 ML of the 3d metal at 300 K for the surface configuration, and at 600 K for the subsurface bimetallic configuration. DFT was used to calculate the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. The binding energies of both the boat and chair configurations were calculated for di-σ bonded cyclohexene, demonstrating that the boat configuration is the thermodynamically preferred structure. The study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases. The surfaces were modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition, and the quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. The AES quantification of the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on Pt(111) was performed. The surfaces were heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition. The surfaces used in the current study were pseudomorphic films of Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, for which approximately five to ten monolayers of the 3d metal were deposited on Pt(111) such that Pt was barely detectable in the AES scan. The thin film surfaces were modeled as the bulk closed packed 3d surface for each respective metal. The theoretical results presented in this paper were calculated using self-consistent periodic slab calculations with the VASP (Vienna ab initio Simulation Package) code. The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene were studied using super cells containing four atomic layers, with the top two layers allowed to relax in each case. Calculations for gas-phase hydrogen and cyclohexene were carried out implementing spin-polarization, whereas the adsorbate-metal system calculations were carried out spin-unpolarized, because the relative difference in the adsorption energies with and without spin-polarization was typically found to be <5 kJ/mol for atomic hydrogen and alkenes. For the hydrogen-metal system, hydrogen was adsorbed in the threefold hollow site of the metal surface with a coverage of 1/9 ML. The binding of cyclohexene was studied on hydrogen co-adsorbed surfaces. One cyclohexene molecule was bonded in the di-σ configuration on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces, with the presence of two co-adsorbed hydrogen atoms in the super cell. The hydrogen atoms were bonded in the two threefold hollow sites nearest to the cyclohexene molecule, to ascertain the effect of repulsion on the binding of cyclohexene.

This process allows us to elucidate novel reaction mechanisms and electronic properties that are present on bimetallic surfaces, providing insights into the unique reactivity of bimetallic catalysts. The presence of subsurface Ni is critical in inducing the low-temperature activity observed on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, which is similar to the properties observed in the Co/Pt(111) system. The electronic modification of the Pt d-band center by subsurface Ni or Co atoms changes the adsorption properties of hydrogen and affects the ethylene and cyclohexene reaction pathways on the bimetallic surfaces. The literature does not provide specific details on how the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using a wide range of experimental techniques and DFT modeling. When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. The surfaces are characterized using AES, XPS, LEIS, and STM. The LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K are shown in Fig. 5. The normal and grazing emission XPS of the NiPt(111) surface prepared at 300 K and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure prepared at 600 K are shown in Fig. 6. STM was also utilized to further characterize the morphology of the 300 K and 600 K surfaces. The AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following the annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from the DFT modeling and experimental measurements of chemical properties. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The unique properties of bimetallic surfaces often result in activities and selectivities that exceed those of monometallic catalysts. Fundamental experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to explore the novel properties of well-defined bimetallic surfaces. A monolayer film of one metal can be deposited onto a single-crystal substrate of another metal to study the modification effects on surface chemistry due to bimetallic formation. Lattice mismatch leads to a modification of the surface electronic properties due to the strain effect, and the formation of heterometallic bonds further alters the electronic properties of the surface, known as the ligand effect. The position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level is a useful parameter to describe the changes in the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces, which has been shown to correlate with the ability of bimetallic surfaces to bind with small adsorbates and activation barriers to reactions. Determination of the surface d-band center may enable first-principles predictions of bimetallic surfaces with desirable catalytic properties. In the present work, a combination of DFT modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene. Pt(111) was modified with several 3d transition metals, including Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu. Depositing these metals on a Pt(111) single-crystal surface at room temperature resulted in the formation of a surface monolayer of the 3d metals, designated as 3d-Pt-Pt(111). At elevated temperatures, the formation of a surface alloy was observed for each Pt-3d pair, enriched in Pt in the first atomic layer due to the enthalpic driving potential created by the lower surface energy of Pt compared with the 3d metals under consideration. Strain may play a part in the interdiffusion of the Pt and 3d metals, and these Pt-enriched bimetallic surfaces are designated Pt-3d-Pt(111) in this study. Kitchin et al. studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level. The current study extends these findings to Fe-, Co-, and Cu-modified Pt(111) surfaces. Cyclohexene is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces due to the competitive nature of its reaction pathways. Previous studies have shown that subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway, and similar results were observed in the current study for the Pt-Fe-Pt(111) surface. However, the Pt-Cu-Pt(111) surface did not exhibit the same hydrogenation pathway. The hydrogenation pathway did not occur on the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces due to the strong binding of cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen. The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow for the establishment of a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. The study was extended to the growth and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on the Pt(111) surface. The surfaces were prepared by depositing 1 ML of the 3d metal at 300 K for the surface configuration, and at 600 K for the subsurface bimetallic configuration. DFT was used to calculate the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. The binding energies of both the boat and chair configurations were calculated for di-σ bonded cyclohexene, demonstrating that the boat configuration is the thermodynamically preferred structure. The study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases. The surfaces were modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition, and the quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. The AES quantification of the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on Pt(111) was performed. The surfaces were heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition. The surfaces used in the current study were pseudomorphic films of Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, for which approximately five to ten monolayers of the 3d metal were deposited on Pt(111) such that Pt was barely detectable in the AES scan. The thin film surfaces were modeled as the bulk closed packed 3d surface for each respective metal. The theoretical results presented in this paper were calculated using self-consistent periodic slab calculations with the VASP (Vienna ab initio Simulation Package) code. The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene were studied using super cells containing four atomic layers, with the top two layers allowed to relax in each case. Calculations for gas-phase hydrogen and cyclohexene were carried out implementing spin-polarization, whereas the adsorbate-metal system calculations were carried out spin-unpolarized, because the relative difference in the adsorption energies with and without spin-polarization was typically found to be <5 kJ/mol for atomic hydrogen and alkenes. For the hydrogen-metal system, hydrogen was adsorbed in the threefold hollow site of the metal surface with a coverage of 1/9 ML. The binding of cyclohexene was studied on hydrogen co-adsorbed surfaces. One cyclohexene molecule was bonded in the di-σ configuration on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces, with the presence of two co-adsorbed hydrogen atoms in the super cell. The hydrogen atoms were bonded in the two threefold hollow sites nearest to the cyclohexene molecule, to ascertain the effect of repulsion on the binding of cyclohexene.

On the other hand, after heating the surfaces to 600 K, probe reactions show surface activity unlike those on Ni, Co, or Pt(111) surfaces. Additional experimental characterization and theoretical studies determined that the differences between the 300 and 600 K bimetallic surfaces were due to diffusion of monolayer Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111), producing the PtNiPt(111) surface structures.

It also allows for the investigation of atomic scale interactions and the formation of metastable alloy phases.

The hydrogenation pathway did not occur on the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces due to the strong binding of cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen. The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow for the establishment of a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. The study was extended to the growth and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on the Pt(111) surface. The surfaces were prepared by depositing 1 ML of the 3d metal at 300 K for the surface configuration, and at 600 K for the subsurface bimetallic configuration. DFT was used to calculate the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. The binding energies of both the boat and chair configurations were calculated for di-σ bonded cyclohexene, demonstrating that the boat configuration is the thermodynamically preferred structure. The study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases. The surfaces were modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition, and the quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. The AES quantification of the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on Pt(111) was performed. The surfaces were heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition. The surfaces used in the current study were pseudomorphic films of Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, for which approximately five to ten monolayers of the 3d metal were deposited on Pt(111) such that Pt was barely detectable in the AES scan. The thin film surfaces were modeled as the bulk closed packed 3d surface for each respective metal. The theoretical results presented in this paper were calculated using self-consistent periodic slab calculations with the VASP (Vienna ab initio Simulation Package) code. The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene were studied using super cells containing four atomic layers, with the top two layers allowed to relax in each case. Calculations for gas-phase hydrogen and cyclohexene were carried out implementing spin-polarization, whereas the adsorbate-metal system calculations were carried out spin-unpolarized, because the relative difference in the adsorption energies with and without spin-polarization was typically found to be <5 kJ/mol for atomic hydrogen and alkenes. For the hydrogen-metal system, hydrogen was adsorbed in the threefold hollow site of the metal surface with a coverage of 1/9 ML. The binding of cyclohexene was studied on hydrogen co-adsorbed surfaces. One cyclohexene molecule was bonded in the di-σ configuration on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces, with the presence of two co-adsorbed hydrogen atoms in the super cell. The hydrogen atoms were bonded in the two threefold hollow sites nearest to the cyclohexene molecule, to ascertain the effect of repulsion on the binding of cyclohexene.

On the other hand, after heating the surfaces to 600 K, probe reactions show surface activity unlike those on Ni, Co, or Pt(111) surfaces. Additional experimental characterization and theoretical studies determined that the differences between the 300 and 600 K bimetallic surfaces were due to diffusion of monolayer Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111), producing the PtNiPt(111) surface structures.

The NiPt system is an interesting candidate for investigations due to its high catalytic selectivity for certain reactions and the strong interplay between magnetic and spatial order. It also allows for the investigation of atomic scale interactions and the formation of metastable alloy phases. The study shows that Ni atoms exchange with Pt at both terrace and step sites, forming a one-dimensional ordered alloy at the step edges and randomly embedding in Pt on the terraces. At higher temperatures, a 2x2 substitutional alloy is formed, corresponding to a Ni20Pt80 composition of the surface topmost layer.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using a wide range of experimental techniques and DFT modeling. When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. The surfaces are characterized using AES, XPS, LEIS, and STM. The LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K are shown in Fig. 5. The normal and grazing emission XPS of the NiPt(111) surface prepared at 300 K and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure prepared at 600 K are shown in Fig. 6. STM was also utilized to further characterize the morphology of the 300 K and 600 K surfaces. The AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following the annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from the DFT modeling and experimental measurements of chemical properties.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The unique properties of bimetallic surfaces often result in activities and selectivities that exceed those of monometallic catalysts. Fundamental experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to explore the novel properties of well-defined bimetallic surfaces. A monolayer film of one metal can be deposited onto a single-crystal substrate of another metal to study the modification effects on surface chemistry due to bimetallic formation. Lattice mismatch leads to a modification of the surface electronic properties due to the strain effect, and the formation of heterometallic bonds further alters the electronic properties of the surface, known as the ligand effect. The position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level is a useful parameter to describe the changes in the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces, which has been shown to correlate with the ability of bimetallic surfaces to bind with small adsorbates and activation barriers to reactions. Determination of the surface d-band center may enable first-principles predictions of bimetallic surfaces with desirable catalytic properties. In the present work, a combination of DFT modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene. Pt(111) was modified with several 3d transition metals, including Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu. Depositing these metals on a Pt(111) single-crystal surface at room temperature resulted in the formation of a surface monolayer of the 3d metals, designated as 3d-Pt-Pt(111). At elevated temperatures, the formation of a surface alloy was observed for each Pt-3d pair, enriched in Pt in the first atomic layer due to the enthalpic driving potential created by the lower surface energy of Pt compared with the 3d metals under consideration. Strain may play a part in the interdiffusion of the Pt and 3d metals, and these Pt-enriched bimetallic surfaces are designated Pt-3d-Pt(111) in this study. Kitchin et al. studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level. The current study extends these findings to Fe-, Co-, and Cu-modified Pt(111) surfaces. Cyclohexene is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces due to the competitive nature of its reaction pathways. Previous studies have shown that subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway, and similar results were observed in the current study for the Pt-Fe-Pt(111) surface.
