          [2] "It is also critical in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces."
          [3] "The AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K."
          [4] "The characterization following annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from DFT calculations and experimental measurements of chemical properties."









[1] "The Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces have been characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques and DFT modeling [26] . When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure."
          [2] "Below we will use the NiPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) surfaces as model systems to illustrate the information that can be derived from AES, XPS, LEIS and STM characterization."
          [3] "Fig. 5 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K."
          [4] "Fig. 6 shows the normal and grazing emission XPS of the NiPt(111) surface prepared at 300 K and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure prepared at 600 K."
          [5] "Finally, STM was also utilized to further characterize the morphology of the 300 K and 600 K surfaces."
          [6] "Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K."
          [7] "The characterization following the annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from the DFT modeling and experimental measurements of chemical properties, as described later."

[1] "In many cases, these unique properties result in activities and/or selectivities that exceed those achievable with a monometallic catalyst. For this reason, there have been many fundamental experimental and theoretical studies of the novel properties of well-defined bimetallic surfaces [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ."
          [2] "To study the modification effects on surface chemistry due to bimetallic formation, a monolayer film of one metal can be deposited onto a single-crystal substrate of another metal. Lattice mismatch results in the contraction or expansion of adlayer metalmetal bond length compared with that of the bulk metal, leading to a modification of the surface electronic properties due to the strain effect [6] ,[10] ,[11] ."
          [3] "In addition, the formation of heterometallic bonds further alters the electronic properties of the surface, which is often referred to as the ligand effect."
          [4] "One useful parameter to describe the changes in the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces is the position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level [12] ."
          [5] "This parameter has been shown to strongly correlate with the ability of bimetallic surfaces to bind with small adsorbates, such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen [13] , alkenes [8] ,[14] , and oxygenates [15] ,[16] ."
          [6] "In addition, activation barriers to such reactions as ethylene and maleic anhydride hydrogenation also have been correlated with the surface d-band center [8] ,[17] ."
          [7] "Thus, its determination may enable first-principles predictions of bimetallic surfaces with desirable catalytic properties for reactions involving these molecules [18] ."
          [8] "In the present work, a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene."
          [9] "This was done by modifying Pt(111) with several 3d transition metals, including Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu."
          [10] "Depositing these metals on a Pt(111) single-crystal surface at room temperature was found to result in the formation of a surface monolayer of the 3d metals; these surfaces are designated as 3d-Pt-Pt(111)."
          [11] "At elevated temperatures, the formation of a surface alloy is observed for each Pt-3d pair [9] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ."
          [12] "These surface alloys have been shown to be enriched in Pt in the first atomic layer due to the enthalpic driving potential created by the lower surface energy of Pt compared with the 3d metals under consideration [28] ,[29] ."
          [13] "Strain also may play a part in the interdiffusion of the Pt and 3d metals, because elastic strain is reduced by having the larger Pt atoms in the topmost atomic layer [23] ."
          [14] "These Pt-enriched bimetallic surfaces are designated Pt-3d-Pt(111) in this study."
          [15] "Kitchin et al. [28] studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level."
          [16] "The current study extends these findings to Fe-, Co-, and Cu-modified Pt(111) surfaces."
          [17] "Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen."
          [18] "Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."
          [19] "On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition [7] ,[30] ; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly."
          [20] "For example, modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway."
          [21] "Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway [28] ,[31] ,[32] ."
          [22] "Similar results were observed in the current study for the Pt-Fe-Pt(111) surface; however, the Pt-Cu-Pt(111) surface did not exhibit the same hydrogenation pathway."
          [23] "Furthermore, the current study also investigated the hydrogenation pathway on the four 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces and found that this pathway did not occur on these surface structures because of the strong binding of cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen."
          [24] "The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow us to establish a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."
          [25] "In the present work, a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene. This was done by modifying Pt(111) with several 3d transition metals, including Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu."
          [26] "The current study was extended to the growth and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on the Pt(111) surface."
          [27] "In summary, 3d-Pt-Pt(111), or the surface configuration, is representative of 1 ML of the 3d metal on Pt(111) and was prepared by depositing 1 ML at 300 K. This surface was modeled as one layer of 3d metal on top of bulk Pt(111). The subsurface bimetallic configuration, designated Pt-3d-Pt(111), was prepared by depositing 1 ML of the 3d metal at 600 K. This surface was modeled as bulk Pt(111) with the second atomic layer replaced by the 3d metal."

          [37] "The 1 ML Cu surface exhibited similar behavior but with a less pronounced critical temperature above which rapid diffusion into the bulk occurred."
          [38] "The surfaces used in the current study were pseudomorphic films of Fe, Co, Ni and Cu, for which approximately five to ten monolayers of the 3d metal were deposited on Pt(111) such that Pt was barely detectable in the AES scan."

          [19] "On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition [7] ,[30] ; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly."
          [20] "For example, modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway."
          [21] "Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway [28] ,[31] ,[32] ."
          [22] "Similar results were observed in the current study for the Pt-Fe-Pt(111) surface; however, the Pt-Cu-Pt(111) surface did not exhibit the same hydrogenation pathway."
          [23] "Furthermore, the current study also investigated the hydrogenation pathway on the four 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces and found that this pathway did not occur on these surface structures because of the strong binding of cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen."
          [24] "The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow us to establish a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."
          [25] "In the present work, a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene. This was done by modifying Pt(111) with several 3d transition metals, including Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu."
          [26] "The current study was extended to the growth and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on the Pt(111) surface."
          [27] "In summary, 3d-Pt-Pt(111), or the surface configuration, is representative of 1 ML of the 3d metal on Pt(111) and was prepared by depositing 1 ML at 300 K. This surface was modeled as one layer of 3d metal on top of bulk Pt(111). The subsurface bimetallic configuration, designated Pt-3d-Pt(111), was prepared by depositing 1 ML of the 3d metal at 600 K. This surface was modeled as bulk Pt(111) with the second atomic layer replaced by the 3d metal."
          [28] "DFT was used to calculate the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces."
          [29] "The binding energies of both the boat and chair configurations were calculated, demonstrating that the boat configuration is the thermodynamically preferred structure for di-Ïƒ bonded cyclohexene."
          [30] "The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases."
          [31] "The surfaces were then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition."
          [32] "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements."
          [33] "The current study was extended to the growth and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on the Pt(111) surface."

          [35] "The AES quantification of the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of Cu on Pt(111)."
          [36] "The surfaces were then heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition."
          [37] "The 1 ML Cu surface exhibited similar behavior but with a less pronounced critical temperature above which rapid diffusion into the bulk occurred."
          [38] "The surfaces used in the current study were pseudomorphic films of Fe, Co, Ni and Cu, for which approximately five to ten monolayers of the 3d metal were deposited on Pt(111) such that Pt was barely detectable in the AES scan."
          [39] "The thin film surfaces were modeled as the bulk closed packed 3d surface for each respective metal."
          [40] "The theoretical results presented in this paper were calculated using self-consistent periodic slab calculations with the VASP (Vienna ab initio Simulation Package) code."
          [41] "The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene were studied using super cells containing four atomic layers, with the top two layers allowed to relax in each case."
          [42] "Calculations for gas-phase hydrogen and cyclohexene were carried out implementing spin-polarization, whereas the adsorbate-metal system calculations were carried out spin-unpolarized, because the relative difference in the adsorption energies with and without spin-polarization was typically found to be <5 kJ/mol for atomic hydrogen and alkenes."
          [43] "For the hydrogen-metal system, hydrogen was adsorbed in the threefold hollow site of the metal surface with a coverage of 1/9 ML."
          [44] "The binding of cyclohexene was studied on hydrogen co-adsorbed surfaces."
          [45] "One cyclohexene molecule was bonded in the di-Ïƒ configuration on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces, with the presence of two co-adsorbed hydrogen atoms in the super cell."
          [46] "The hydrogen atoms were bonded in the two threefold hollow sites nearest to the cyclohexene molecule, to ascertain the effect of repulsion on the binding of cyclohexene."
          [47] "The binding energies of both the boat and chair configurations were calculated, demonstrating that the boat configuration is the thermodynamically preferred structure for di-Ïƒ bonded cyclohexene."













[1] "Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Ni onto Pt(1 1 1) single crystals at 300 K with and without subsequent annealing at 600 K, and by direct deposition of Ni at 600 K."
          [2] "The structure, composition and chemical properties of these surfaces were investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of H2, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)."
          [3] "Density functional theory calculations showed that subsurface Ni atoms could leads to a weaker metalhydrogen bond by modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms."
