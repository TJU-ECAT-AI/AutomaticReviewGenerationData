          [1] "The characterization of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is very useful in providing structural models for DFT calculations."
          [2] "It is also critical in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces."
          [3] "The AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K."
          [4] "The characterization following annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from DFT calculations and experimental measurements of chemical properties."

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using various techniques such as Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). This process is crucial for structural modeling and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations as it provides detailed information about the surface structure. Additionally, it is critical for understanding the correlation between bimetallic structures and their electronic and chemical properties, which is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research. The AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. After annealing to 600-640 K, the characterization was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111), suggesting the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt. This process is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research.

          通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来合成Ni/Pt双金属表面，其表征采用低能离子散射（LEIS）、俄歇电子能谱（AES）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和扫描隧道显微镜（STM）等多种技术进行。这一过程对于结构建模和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算至关重要，因为它提供了关于表面结构的详细信息。此外，对于理解双金属结构与其电子和化学性质之间的关联，这对于先进的表面科学和催化研究是至关重要的。AES、LEIS、XPS和STM结果证实，在300 K下沉积Ni后，Pt(111)上存在表面Ni单层。在600-640 K下退火后，表征结果与Ni扩散到Pt(111)的次表面区域一致，表明可能产生PtNiPt(111)结构，Ni原子直接位于表面Pt下方。这一过程对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。
