The comprehensive characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is a pivotal area of research in advanced surface science and catalysis, offering insights into the electronic and chemical properties that govern catalytic activity and selectivity. Synthesis methods for these bimetallic surfaces are diverse, ranging from co-deposition techniques to more complex methods like sputtering and atomic layer deposition, each influencing the structural and compositional properties of the resulting materials. Structural modeling plays a critical role in this research, allowing scientists to predict and understand the geometric and electronic configurations of the bimetallic surfaces. This modeling, combined with experimental techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy, provides a detailed picture of how the bimetallic composition and structure affect catalytic performance. Understanding these properties is essential for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, which can significantly impact various industries, from petrochemicals to renewable energy technologies.
