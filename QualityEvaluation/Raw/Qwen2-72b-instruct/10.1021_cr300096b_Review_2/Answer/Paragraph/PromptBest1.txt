The comprehensive characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is pivotal for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding electronic and chemical properties \[10.1021/jp061697z\]. At 300 K, the reactivity is similar to Ni surfaces, but after annealing to 600 K, unique surface activity emerges, distinct from Ni, Co, or Pt(111) \[10.1021/jp061697z\]. This change is attributed to Ni diffusion into the subsurface, forming PtNiPt(111) structures \[10.1021/cr300096b_2\]. The characterization process is essential for correlating bimetallic structures with electronic and chemical properties, enabling computational studies and insights into Ni/Pt surfaces' properties, critical for catalysis and surface science \[10.1021/cr300096b_2\]. Techniques like AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM confirm the surface Ni monolayer and suggest the PtNiPt structure after annealing \[10.1021/cr300096b_2\]. Despite the growth in studying metals on metallic substrates for applications in catalysis and other fields, the Ni on Pt(111) system has not been widely explored theoretically \[10.1016/s0039-6028(03)00228-0\]. Majerus et al.'s effective medium calculation on Pt/Ni combinations provides some insight, highlighting the need for further research on these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis \[10.1016/s0039-6028(03)00228-0\]. Subsurface Ni induces low-temperature activity, akin to Co/Pt(111), by modifying the Pt d-band center, affecting hydrogen adsorption and reaction pathways \[10.1021/jp0479419\]. Studies reveal low-temperature H2 desorption and a novel cyclohexene self-hydrogenation pathway, crucial for atomic-level reactivity insights and comparing 1 ML Co/Pt(111) with Pt(111) and thick Co films \[10.1021/jp0479419\]. Combining DFT and experimental techniques provides insights into the electronic properties and catalytic behavior, facilitating the design of bimetallic catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for chemical reactions like low-temperature hydrogenation of olefins \[10.1016/j.susc.2005.03.046\]. The formation of heterometallic bonds, known as the ligand effect, further changes surface properties. The surface d-band center's position, a key parameter, correlates with the binding of small adsorbates and activation barriers, enabling predictions of catalytic properties \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. Surface Ni shifts the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, affecting cyclohexene's competitive reaction pathways. Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) exhibit novel hydrogenation pathways, while Pt-Fe-Pt(111) shows similar behavior, but Pt-Cu-Pt(111) does not \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. The hydrogenation pathway is absent on 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces due to strong adsorbate binding \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. Experimental results and DFT modeling establish a relationship between binding energies and hydrogenation activities among bimetallic surfaces \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\].
