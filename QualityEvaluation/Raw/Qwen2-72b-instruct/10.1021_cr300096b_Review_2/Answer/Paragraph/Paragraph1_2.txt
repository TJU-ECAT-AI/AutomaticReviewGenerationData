The comprehensive characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is pivotal for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding their electronic and chemical properties in advanced surface science and catalysis research \[10.1021/jp061697z\]. This process elucidates the unique surface activity observed only when annealed to 600 K, unlike at 300 K where reactivity is similar to Ni surfaces \[10.1021/jp061697z\]. At 600 K, probe reactions show activity distinct from Ni, Co, or Pt(111) surfaces, attributed to Ni diffusion into the subsurface region, forming PtNiPt(111) structures \[10.1021/jp061697z\]. The characterization of these surfaces is essential for understanding the effects of subsurface Ni on surface properties, as seen in the cyclohexene reaction pathways, which reveal subsurface Ni's role in low-temperature hydrogenation \[10.1016/j.susc.2005.03.046\]. This process determines surface structure, electronic properties, and reactivity, crucial for predicting and controlling catalytic activity and selectivity in various chemical reactions \[10.1016/j.susc.2005.03.046\]. Understanding the PtNi system fundamentally aids in catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons \[10.1016/j.susc.2004.03.032\].
