The comprehensive characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is pivotal for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding electronic and chemical properties \[10.1021/jp061697z\]. At 300 K, the reactivity is similar to Ni surfaces, but after annealing to 600 K, unique surface activity emerges, distinct from Ni, Co, or Pt(111) \[10.1021/jp061697z\]. This change is attributed to Ni diffusion into the subsurface, forming PtNiPt(111) structures \[10.1021/cr300096b\_2\]. The characterization process is essential for correlating bimetallic structures with electronic and chemical properties, enabling computational studies and insights into Ni/Pt surfaces' properties, critical for catalysis and surface science \[10.1021/cr300096b\_2\]. Techniques like AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM confirm the surface Ni monolayer and suggest the PtNiPt structure after annealing \[10.1021/cr300096b\_2\]. Despite the growth in studying metals on metallic substrates for applications in catalysis and other fields, the Ni on Pt(111) system has not been widely explored theoretically \[10.1016/s0039-6028(03)00228-0\]. Majerus et al.'s effective medium calculation on Pt/Ni combinations provides some insight, highlighting the need for further research on these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis \[10.1016/s0039-6028(03)00228-0\]. Subsurface Ni induces low-temperature activity, akin to Co/Pt(111), by modifying the Pt d-band center, affecting hydrogen adsorption and reaction pathways \[10.1021/jp0479419\]. Studies reveal low-temperature H2 desorption and a novel cyclohexene self-hydrogenation pathway, crucial for atomic-level reactivity insights and comparing 1 ML Co/Pt(111) with Pt(111) and thick Co films \[10.1021/jp0479419\]. Combining DFT and experimental techniques provides insights into the electronic properties and catalytic behavior, facilitating the design of bimetallic catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for chemical reactions like low-temperature hydrogenation of olefins \[10.1016/j.susc.2005.03.046\]. The formation of heterometallic bonds, known as the ligand effect, further changes surface properties. The surface d-band center's position, a key parameter, correlates with the binding of small adsorbates and activation barriers, enabling predictions of catalytic properties \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. Surface Ni shifts the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, affecting cyclohexene's competitive reaction pathways. Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) exhibit novel hydrogenation pathways, while Pt-Fe-Pt(111) shows similar behavior, but Pt-Cu-Pt(111) does not \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. The hydrogenation pathway is absent on 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces due to strong adsorbate binding \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. Experimental results and DFT modeling establish a relationship between binding energies and hydrogenation activities among bimetallic surfaces \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of advanced characterization techniques that can provide real-time monitoring of surface reactions on Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. This could include the use of in-situ spectroscopic methods, such as in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in-situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), to gain deeper insights into the dynamic changes in surface structure and electronic properties during catalytic reactions. Additionally, the integration of machine learning algorithms with DFT calculations could offer a more efficient and accurate prediction of catalytic activity and selectivity, enabling the rational design of bimetallic catalysts with tailored properties for specific chemical reactions. The exploration of novel bimetallic systems, beyond Ni/Pt, could also reveal new catalytic behaviors and reaction pathways, expanding the horizons of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

The comprehensive characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces has emerged as a pivotal area of research, offering profound insights into the electronic and chemical properties that govern catalytic activity and selectivity. This section will delve into the synthesis methods, structural modeling, and the critical role these bimetallic surfaces play in advancing surface science and catalysis research.

Synthesis methods for Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces have evolved significantly, encompassing a range of techniques that include co-reduction, deposition-precipitation, and electrochemical deposition. Each method offers unique advantages in terms of control over particle size, morphology, and composition, which are crucial for tailoring the catalytic properties of the bimetallic surfaces. Co-reduction, for instance, allows for the formation of highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic nanoparticles, whereas electrochemical deposition can be used to create gradient compositions, enhancing the catalytic performance for specific reactions.

Structural modeling of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces has been instrumental in understanding the complex interplay between the electronic structure and catalytic activity. Advanced computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), have been employed to predict the surface structures, electronic properties, and reactivity of these bimetallic surfaces. These models have revealed that the electronic structure of the surface can be significantly altered by the presence of the second metal, leading to changes in the d-band center and the adsorption energies of reactants, which are key factors in determining catalytic activity.

The critical role of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces in understanding the electronic and chemical properties for advanced surface science and catalysis research cannot be overstated. These surfaces have been shown to exhibit superior catalytic performance compared to their monometallic counterparts in various reactions, including hydrogenation, oxidation, and CO oxidation. The synergistic effect between Ni and Pt, facilitated by the electronic and geometric modifications at the bimetallic interface, has been identified as the primary reason for this enhanced catalytic activity. This synergy not only improves the efficiency of catalytic processes but also opens up new pathways for the design of more selective and sustainable catalysts.

In conclusion, the comprehensive characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces has significantly advanced our understanding of the fundamental principles governing catalytic activity and selectivity. The synthesis methods, structural modeling, and the critical role of these surfaces in catalysis research have collectively contributed to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic systems. Future research in this area is expected to further refine our understanding of the complex interplay between structure, electronic properties, and catalytic performance, paving the way for the rational design of advanced catalysts for a wide range of applications.
