Studies on Pt(111) modified with 3d transition metals like Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu show that surface alloys enriched in Pt can form at elevated temperatures \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. Surface Ni shifts the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, affecting cyclohexene's competitive reaction pathways, including hydrogenation, decomposition, and dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. Pt-Fe-Pt(111) exhibits a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway, unlike Pt-Cu-Pt(111) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. The binding of cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen on 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces is too strong for hydrogenation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. DFT modeling and experimental results establish a relationship between binding energies and hydrogenation activities among various bimetallic surfaces, providing insights into catalytic properties \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\].

    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel bimetallic catalysts with tailored electronic and chemical properties for specific catalytic reactions, such as propane dehydrogenation. The rational design of these catalysts could be guided by a deeper understanding of the interplay between subsurface and surface metal atoms, as well as the role of lattice mismatch and heterometallic bond formation in modifying surface chemistry. The surface d-band center's position relative to the Fermi level remains a critical parameter for predicting catalytic properties, and its manipulation through alloy composition and structure could lead to the discovery of surfaces with enhanced activity and selectivity. The use of high-resolution spectroscopic techniques, such as synchrotron radiation-based photoelectron spectroscopy, could provide further insights into the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic interfaces. Additionally, the exploration of alternative synthesis methods, such as the deposition of Pt on Ni(100) substrates, could offer new perspectives on the fundamental properties and reactivity of bimetallic surfaces. The combination of experimental techniques and DFT modeling will continue to be essential for validating theoretical predictions with experimental data, revealing unique catalytic behaviors, and facilitating the rational design of bimetallic catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for chemical reactions, including low-temperature hydrogenation of olefins. The comprehensive characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt substrates, will remain a pivotal process for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding their electronic and chemical properties, crucial for advanced surface science and catalysis research.

2.1.3 Example: Characterization of Ni/Pt Bimetallic Surfaces
In this section we will illustrate the synthesis and characterization of bimetallic surfaces following the deposition of one monolayer of Ni on either a Pt(111) single crystal or a polycrystalline Pt substrate. The characterization of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is very useful in providing structural models for DFT calculations. It is also critical in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces. (10)
For example, Figure 3 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K Ni&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) surface to 900 K. For the LEIS experiments (Figure 3a), Ni was deposited at 300 K and the initial coverage of Ni was ∼1 ML. After a small initial increase in the Ni intensity, possibly due to desorption of contaminant H2, the Ni intensity decreased significantly with increasing temperature until it became nearly undetectable by 800 K. There were corresponding increases in the Pt intensity as the annealing temperature increased. Similar trends were observed in the AES experiments (Figure 3b), which were performed at three different initial coverages. The Ni/Pt AES ratio underwent significant decreases at above 700 K, indicating the diffusion of Ni into regions that were beyond the detection limit of the AES measurements. (27, 28)
The STM images provided further characterization of the 300 and 640 K Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. As shown in Figure 3c, after deposition at 300 K, Ni atoms formed islands that were a single atomic layer thick and nucleated at the step edges of the Pt(111) surface. Upon annealing to 640 K, all of the island features disappeared, as shown in Figure 3d. The surface appeared fairly uniform, with many small, “wormlike” features, which were attributed to the strain caused by the subsurface Ni atoms in Pt(111). Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following annealing to 600&ndash;640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from DFT calculations and experimental measurements of chemical properties, as described later.
In practice, bimetallic catalysts are often supported nanoparticles of varying shape and size. Polycrystalline bimetallic films provide a potential way to bridge the “materials gap” between single-crystal surfaces and supported catalysts. As illustrated in Figure 4, it is reasonable to assume that the surface chemistry of the nanoparticle should be dominated primarily by the first few atomic layers. It is also reasonable to assume that the chemistry of the individual crystal facets on the nanoparticle (primarily (111) and (100) for a face-centered cubic (fcc) nanoparticle) can be approximated by their respective single-crystal extensions. With these assumptions, Menning and Chen deposited Ni on a polycrystalline Pt film that contained mainly the (111) and (100) facets to mimic supported bimetallic particles. (33) Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on the polycrystalline Pt foil at room temperature to produce the Ni&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt subsurface structure. More about the similar catalytic properties between single-crystal Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111), polycrystalline Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt, and supported Pt&ndash;Ni catalysts will be illustrated later.
In addition to the examples given above, many UHV techniques have been utilized to characterize the surface structures of several bimetallic systems. Table 1 provides a list of selected bimetallic surfaces, along with the corresponding UHV techniques or theoretical calculations used to characterize the surface properties.
