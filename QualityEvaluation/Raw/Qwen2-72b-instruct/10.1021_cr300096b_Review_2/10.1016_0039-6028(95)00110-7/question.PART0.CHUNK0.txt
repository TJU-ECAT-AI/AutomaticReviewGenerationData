Surface Science 330 (1995) 193-206 surface science Structural studies of Sn/Pt(100)surfaces:conditions for alloy formation Yingdong Li, Bruce E. Koel * Department of Chemistry, University o/Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-0482, USA Received 12 July 1994; accepted for publication 27 January 1995 Abstract The deposition of Sn onto Pt(100) and the thermal stability of these surfaces was studied primarily by using low energy alkali ion scattering spectroscopy (ALISS) combined with AES, LEED and CO adsorption in order to elucidate conditions for preparing ordered surface alloys of Pt-Sn. Distinct c(2 x 2) and (3v/'2 - × v/-2)R45 LEED patterns were observed for specific Sn precoverages and annealing temperatures. Several real space structures that could be responsible for each of the LEED patterns are proposed and investigated. The results of the ALISS studies show that both overlayer Sn and incorporated Sn atoms can produce the c(2 X 2) LEED pattern with the resultant structure determined by the initial coverage and,critically, by the thermal history. Although the overlayer c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(100) structure is present from 500-700 K, which is over most of the temperature range of the c(2 × 2) LEED pattern, it is not the most stable structure. Annealing to 700-750 K causes Sn adatoms to become incorporated into the first Pt layer and forms the c(2 X 2)-Sn/Pt(100)surface alloy. Heating to 750-850 K produces a more stable Pt-Sn alloy structure characterized by a (3qr2

" LEED pattern. For Sn o incorporated into the first Pt layer to form a surface alloy, a buckling distance of 0.19 + 0.02 A is determined. This indicates that an almost planar Pt-Sn alloy surface is achieved, at least locally, in the first layer and that the buckling distance is independent of the substrate orientation for Pt(100) and Pt(lll)surfaces.

1. Introduction
Deposition of one metal on another metal sub- strate, usually followed by annealing, is an efficient way to prepare highly ordered, two-dimensional bimetallic or alloy substrates [1-6]. Preparation in this manner often provides alloy surfaces that have remarkable thermal stability of their geometric struc- * Corresponding author.

Also, the surface structures provided by this methodology are notnecessarily limited to those from termination of a bulk single crystal alloy. With the help of these stable and often unique surface structures, issues about the origins of the altered chemistry observed on alloy surfaces,such as the relative importance of electronic and ensemble effects on chemical reactions, can be better understood. Favorable reaction paths can also be facilitated. In addition, systematic studies of the structure of these surfaces will form the basis for predicative ability about the structures of other 0039-6028/95/$09.50  1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

bimetallic surfaces. The key to advances in this arena is establishing the conditions under which alloys are formed and determining their structure subsequently using powerful spectroscopic tools. Low energy al- kali ion scattering spectroscopy (ALISS) has proven to be very useful in these regards previously [2,4,6] and we continue to use it as the primary structural probe in this work.
Our interest in the Sn/Pt(100) system stems from catalysis. Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts are used com- mercially in hydrocarbon reforming and it is plausi- ble that Pt-Sn alloy surfaces may play a role in this catalysis. Therefore, studies of the surface chemistry of different crystal faces of Pt-Sn alloys are ex- pected to yield useful information for understanding these catalytic reactions. Two surface alloys can be formed by vapor deposition of Sn on Pt(lll), as reported by Paffett and Windham [1]. The surface alloy structure was later confirmed by Overbury et al. [2] using ALISS. In those studies, successive anneals up to 1000 K were used to produce ordered patterns in low energy electron diffraction (LEED).
For both of the (2 X 2) and (V × vr3-)R30 patterns, Sn atoms were found to be incorporated into the Pt first layer to form a surface alloy, with Sn atoms only slightly buckled, about 0.2 A, above the Pt layer. The first study of the Sn/Pt(100) system was reported by Paffett et al. [3]. They conjectured that the observed c(2 × 2) and (3v-x V-)R45
LEED
patterns formed by this system were also due to alloy formation. This is a very reasonable proposal consid- ering that almost all of the bimetallic systems involv- ing Sn, such as Sn/Ni(lll) [4], Sn/Cu(lll) [5], and Sn/Ni(100) [6], form surface alloys. The motiva- tions behind our studies reported here were to deter- mine the real space structures for the observed LEED patterns for this system and to make comparisons of the structures in this system to the other known transition metal-Sn alloy systems.
2. Experimental methods
The experimental arrangement and conditions were essentially the same as described in a previous publication [6]. The apparatus is a two-level UHV chamber, with instrumentation for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), LEED, gas dosing, metal evap- oration, ion sputtering, and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) at the top level. The bottom level contains a Colutron ion gun for ISS, a small rotatable Comstock electrostatic energy analyzer, and an X-ray source. In addition, the primary energy analyzer used in ALISS was a Perkin-Elmer Model 10-360 spheri- cal capacitor analyzer (SCA) mounted on a fixed flange so that the scattering angle is always 144
.
This analyzer was equipped with a dual multichannel plate detector (MCD) to provide high count rates.
The polar angle, , is defined as the incident angle for ions measured from the sample surface plane.
This angle was calibrated through laser alignment to an accuracy of < 0.5 . The azimuthal angle, , was measured from the [110] azimuth of clean Pt(100).This angle was initially determined by LEED mea- surements and then more finely adjusted using az- imuthal scans in ALISS to give an estimated accu- racy of < 1 .The Pt(100) single crystal sample (Atomergic, 5N purity) was 10 mm diameter X 1 mm thick and oriented to within 0.5
. It was held onto the sample holder by two 0.38 mm Ta wires and could be cooled down to 200 K or resistively heated to 1200
K. The crystal was cleaned by repeated cycles of Ar
ion sputtering (1 kV at 1000 K) and annealing in vacuum to 1100 K. To remove residual surface carbon, the crystal was often heated in oxygen (5 X 10 -7 Torr 02, 5 mill, 850 K). The surface composi- tion of the sample was checked by AES. LEED showed the expected (5 x 20) reconstruction for the clean Pt(100) surface.
The Sn doser was made by using an enclosed boat made from 0.13 mm Ta foil containing a Sn ingot (6N purity). This doser was thoroughly outgassed before use. The Sn deposition rate that we utilized with this doser was about 0.07 monolayer/min with a background pressure below 2 × 10 -l Torr. Sn was deposited on Pt(100) at room temperature and the coverage was calibrated from an AES uptake plot (i.e., Sn and Pt AES peak-to-peak amplitudes versus Sn deposition time). We obtained an AES uptake plot very similar to the one shown by Paffett et al.
[3]. Likewise, the Sn deposition required to obtain the Sn/Pt(100)-c(2 × 2) LEED pattern was also as- signed to 0s, = 0.5 as was done by Paffett et al. [3],and all the Sn coverages were referenced to this calibration throughout the paper.

3. Results
3.1. Determination of scattering potentials
In these studies of the structure of Sn/Pt(100) surfaces we have used low energy alkali ion scatter- ing as our primary technique. Specifically we used 1 keV Li + as our probing ion beam. Two key quanti- ties have to be determined before we can apply this technique to solve structures, i.e., we have to know the scattering potentials for Li + interactions with both Pt and Sn. The most widely used form of the potential in the low energy range, as applied in various studies of surface structure, is the Thomas- Fermi-Molire (TFM) potential. There is one ad- justable parameter, C, that has to be determined for each pair of ion-atom interactions. These numbers are not generally available and also reports of a given parameter vary from experiment to experi- ment. Typically C is determined experimentally from known inter-atomic spacing by using the detailed procedure discussed by Overbury and Huntley [7].
The clean Pt(100) surface has a well-known sur- face reconstruction characterized by a (5 × 20) LEED pattern. Since the precise details of the geometric structure of the atoms in the Pt(5 X 20) surface are not clear, this makes it difficult to determine the C parameter of Li+-Pt (denoted as Cu_et). We prefer to use an unreconstructed Pt(100) surface which can provide convenient atomic spacings to calculate Cu+_i,t. Most importantly, it enables us to compare the Li+-Pt angular scattering features of the ideally terminated p(1 × 1) surface with that of the c(2 × 2)- Sn/Pt(100) surface. In fact, most of our conclusions about the structure of the Sn/Pt(100) surfaces were reached through these comparisons.
There are several ways to prepare the p(1 × 1)- Pt(100) surface [8]. Norton et al. [8] indicated that the Pt(100) (5 × 20) (1 X 1) phase transition is better accomplished by CO adsorption. This presents a potential problem in our work since the resultant p(1 × 1) surface is not a clean one but one with 0.5 ML CO on it. However, our experience is that the scattered ion yields from light atoms like C and O are very small and usually will not noticeably change the scattering features from heavier atoms, like Pt.
Thus, this surface is suitable for making a determina- tion of CLi+_et. The p(1 × 1)-Pt(100) surface was 20 (a) sll 100 80 60 ,-,40 20 j [11 keVi0] azimuthLi'Pt i ' i

The resultant polar angle scans (varying the incident angle while maintaining a fixed scattering angle) of Li+-Pt along [100] and [110] azimuths are shown in Fig. 1. Further dosing of CO gave the same scans, indicating that 6 L CO saturates the Pt(100) surface effectively. Each of the insets shown in Fig. 1 is the corresponding polar angle scan from the corresponding clean Pt(100)-(5 x 20) surface. The striking differences between them are indicative of the movements of Pt atoms upon adsorption of 0.5 ML CO. Not surprisingly, the overall angular features of p(1 × 1)-Pt(100) are very similar to the clean Ni(100) ones [6], which suggests strongly that the majority of Pt atoms have moved back into the bulk registry. 196

Table 1 lists the calculated CLi_pt parameter based on data from the p(1 × 1)-Pt(100) surface just described. The azimuth used in this calculation was the [110]. This azimuth had a more intense flux peak and thus the critical angle (taken at 90% of flux peak intensity) could be determined more accurately. The C parameter of the Li-Sn interaction (CLi+ sn) is also tabulated in Table 2. The surface template used as a reference is the c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(100) surface with the azimuth chosen along the [100] direction.
The rationale for this choice is that Sn atoms form a single atomic chain along this direction for all of the outstanding structural models that we propose, i.e., it is essentially model independent. The C parameters that we deduce are CLi_pt = 0.80 5- 0.01 and CLi+_sn -- 0.76 5- 0.02. Calculations required for this determination were done by using the chain model [71.
3.2. Structure of c(2 × 2)-Sn / Pt(l O0) surfaces
3.2.1. ALISS
The proposed real space models of the c(2 × 2)- Sn/Pt(100) surfaces are shown in Fig. 2 based on the arrangement of Sn atoms either as an overlayer or incorporated into the surface layer. For the over- layer model, Sn atoms are placed on the four-fold sites since these are presumably the most energeti- cally favorable. Conceivably there are other struc- tures that could exist, but they either require exten- sive distortions of the Pt lattice or involve lower Sn Table 2 Scattering potential for Li + on Sn, determined by using c(2 × 2)- Sn/Pt(100) along [100] Eo c Csn 1 keV

A situation that could also occur is one in which the overlayer structure and the incorporated structure coexist. In this section we will investigate all of these possibilities and provide reliable structural pic- tures for the c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(100) surfaces.ALISS energy spectra from the clean Pt(100) and the c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(100) surfaces are shown in Figs. 3a and 3b, respectively. Both spectra were taken using 1 keV Li  along the [110] azimuth at a polar angle of 30 . The single scattering Li+-Pt peak is clearly resolved with essentially no background con- tribution. By contrast, the Li+-Sn single scattering peak sits on a relatively large inelastic scattering background from Pt. This makes the interpretation of the Li+-Sn scattering intensity very difficult since this background changes when we perform angle-de- pendent scans. Two separate polar angle scans are taken to get around this problem, with the first one at the Li+-Sn single scattering peak (790 eV) and the second one at its left shoulder (750 eV). The Li +-Sn polar angle scan reported was obtained by subtract-

The correctness of this procedure was checked by obtaining complete energy scans at a number of different angles and manually integrating each of the Li+-Sn scattering peak areas. We found both proce- dures gave essentially the same results, especially with regard to the main angle-dependent features.
The c(2 × 2) LEED pattern exists over quite a wide range of annealing temperatures (300-750 K) once 0.5 ML Sn is deposited. The sharpest c(2 × 2) pattern appeared between 400-700 K. The quality of c(2 × 2) pattern started to degrade once the sample was annealed to 750 K, although it still showed a clear c(2 X 2) LEED pattern overall. We wilI now show that the characteristics of the polar angle scans from these two surfaces, i.e., the c(2 × 2) structures below 750 K and above 750 K, are so altered that
