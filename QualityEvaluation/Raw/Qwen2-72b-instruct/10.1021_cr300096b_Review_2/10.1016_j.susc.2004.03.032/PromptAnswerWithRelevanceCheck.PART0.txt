1.The literature does not provide information on how the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted. However, it is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows us to understand the effects of subsurface Ni on the properties of the bimetallic surface. The study of the cyclohexene reaction pathways on Pt/Ni(111) surfaces provides insights into the role of subsurface Ni in inducing low-temperature hydrogenation activity.
