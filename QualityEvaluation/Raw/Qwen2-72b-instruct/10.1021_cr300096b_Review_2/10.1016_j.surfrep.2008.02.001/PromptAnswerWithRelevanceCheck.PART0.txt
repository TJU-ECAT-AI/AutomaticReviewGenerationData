1.The literature does not provide specific details on how the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted. However, it is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because the characterization allows for the determination of the surface structure, electronic properties, and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces. This information is essential for correlating the structure and electronic properties with the catalytic activity and selectivity of the surfaces.

1.通过在300 K下将Ni沉积在Pt(111)表面上，Ni原子停留在最顶层，形成NiPt(111)表面MBS结构。如果随后将该表面加热至600 K，或者在600 K下将单层沉积在Pt(111)基板上，大多数Ni原子会扩散到次表面区域，形成PtNiPt(111)次表面MBS结构。使用AES，XPS，LEIS和STM表征来说明信息。图5显示了将300 K NiPt(111)表面退火至900 K后的LEIS和AES结果。图6显示了在300 K下制备的NiPt(111)表面和在600 K下制备的PtNiPt(111)次表面结构的正常和掠射发射XPS。最后，STM也被用来进一步表征300 K和600 K表面的形态。除了上述示例之外，许多UHV技术已被用于研究广泛MBS系统的物理和化学性质。这一过程对于结构建模，DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，特别是在高级表面科学和催化研究的背景下。

If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. Below we will use the NiPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) surfaces as model systems to illustrate the information that can be derived from AES, XPS, LEIS and STM characterization."
[2] "Fig. 5 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K. For the LEIS experiments ( Fig. 5 (a)), Ni was deposited at 300 K and the initial coverage of Ni was approximately 1 ML. The LEIS analyser was fixed at an energy corresponding to He+ scattering from either Ni or Pt, while the sample was heated continuously at a linear rate of approximately 9 K /s. The Pt and Ni intensities were measured in separate experiments, and the LEIS ratio of Ni /Pt intensities was the same at the beginning of each experiment. After a small initial increase in the Ni intensity, possibly due to the desorption of contaminant H2, the Ni intensity decreased significantly with increasing temperature until it became nearly undetectable by 800 K. There were corresponding increases in the Pt intensity as the annealing temperature increased. Similar trends were observed in the AES experiments ( Fig. 5 (b)), which were performed at three different initial coverages. In these experiments, the Ni /Pt AES ratio gradually decreased until around 700 K, in good agreement with the LEIS results. The Ni /Pt AES ratio underwent significant decreases at above 700 K, indicating the diffusion of Ni into regions that were beyond the detection limit of the AES measurements [27] ."
[3] "Fig. 6 shows the normal and grazing emission XPS of the NiPt(111) surface prepared at 300 K and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure prepared at 600 K. In the normal emission experiment, the sample surface was normal to the analyzer and the X-ray beam was incident on the surface at an angle approximately 6070 from the surface normal. In the grazing emission experiment, the analyser axis was at an angle of 60 with respect to the surface normal, and the x-ray beam was nearly incident with the surface normal (about 10 off). Therefore, the grazing emission experiments should be more sensitive to the near surface region than the normal emission experiments. At 300 K, the Ni intensity in the grazing emission spectrum was about 1.35 (based on areas indicated in Fig. 6 ) times larger than the Ni intensity in the normal emission spectrum ( Fig. 6 (a)). This indicated that Ni atoms were preferentially located near the surface. At 600 K ( Fig. 6 (b)), the grazing to normal intensity ratio was 0.74, suggesting a more isotropic composition of the near-surface region, consistent with the inward diffusion of surface Ni atoms at 600 K. The ratios between Ni2p and Pt4f XPS intensities showed a similar trend. For the 300 K deposition, the normal emission Ni2p /Pt4f ratio was 0.82, while for grazing emission it was 1.95, indicating again there was more Ni in the near surface region for deposition at 300 K. At 600 K, the normal emission ratio was 0.71, while the grazing emission ratio was 0.77. Thus, for deposition at 600 K, the surface was not as rich in Ni as the surface prepared by deposition at 300 K, or alternatively, the 600 K surface was enriched in Pt compared to the 300 K surface [27] ."
[4] "Finally, STM was also utilized to further characterize the morphology of the 300 K and 600 K surfaces. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), after deposition at 300 K, Ni atoms formed islands that were a single atomic layer thick and nucleated at the step edges of the Pt(111) surface. Since the islands did not uniformly cover the step edges, the Ni adatoms were most likely mobile on both the surface and at the step edge until another Ni adatom at the step edge was encountered, at which point nucleation or sticking occurred. Upon annealing to 640 K, all of the island features disappeared, as shown in Fig. 7 (b). The surface appeared fairly uniform, with many small, light, worm-like features, which were attributed to the strain caused by the subsurface Ni in Pt(111) [26] . Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following the annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from the DFT modeling and experimental measurements of chemical properties, as described later."

1.The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates is conducted using a wide range of experimental techniques and DFT modeling. When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. The characterization of these surfaces using AES, XPS, LEIS, and STM provides information about the composition, structure, and morphology of the surfaces. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

1.通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层，使用广泛的实验技术和DFT建模来表征Ni/Pt双金属表面。当Ni在300 K下沉积时，Ni原子停留在最顶层，形成NiPt(111)表面MBS结构。如果随后将该表面加热至600 K，或者在600 K下沉积单层，大多数Ni原子会扩散到Pt(111)基底的次表面区域，形成PtNiPt(111)次表面MBS结构。使用AES、XPS、LEIS和STM对这些表面的表征提供了关于表面组成、结构和形态的信息。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在高级表面科学和催化研究背景下的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。
