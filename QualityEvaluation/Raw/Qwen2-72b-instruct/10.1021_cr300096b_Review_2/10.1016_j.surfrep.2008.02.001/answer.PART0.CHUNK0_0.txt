1.The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using a wide range of experimental techniques and DFT modeling. When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. The information that can be derived from AES, XPS, LEIS and STM characterization is illustrated using the NiPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) surfaces as model systems. The LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K are shown in Fig. 5. The normal and grazing emission XPS of the NiPt(111) surface prepared at 300 K and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure prepared at 600 K are shown in Fig. 6. STM was also utilized to further characterize the morphology of the 300 K and 600 K surfaces. In addition to the examples given above, many UHV techniques have been utilized to study the physical and chemical properties of a wide range of MBS systems. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

1.通过在300 K下将Ni沉积在Pt(111)表面上，Ni原子停留在最顶层，形成NiPt(111)表面MBS结构。如果随后将该表面加热至600 K，或者在600 K下将单层沉积在Pt(111)基板上，大多数Ni原子会扩散到次表面区域，形成PtNiPt(111)次表面MBS结构。使用AES，XPS，LEIS和STM表征来说明信息。图5显示了将300 K NiPt(111)表面退火至900 K后的LEIS和AES结果。图6显示了在300 K下制备的NiPt(111)表面和在600 K下制备的PtNiPt(111)次表面结构的正常和掠射发射XPS。最后，STM也被用来进一步表征300 K和600 K表面的形态。除了上述示例之外，许多UHV技术已被用于研究广泛MBS系统的物理和化学性质。这一过程对于结构建模，DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，特别是在高级表面科学和催化研究的背景下。
