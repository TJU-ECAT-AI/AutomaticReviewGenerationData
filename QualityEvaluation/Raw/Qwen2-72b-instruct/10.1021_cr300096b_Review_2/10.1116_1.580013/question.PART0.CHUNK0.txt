I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Effect of annealing on Ag films on Pt(111)
J. S. Tsay;
C. S. Shern
J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 14, 25222526 (1996)
https://doi.org/10.1116/1.580013 Article history Share Tools Lowenergy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were used to study the annealing effect of the silver ultrathin film on a Pt(111) surface. The intensities of the specular beam of LEED versus temperature have abnormal change between 550 and 650 K in a submonolayer range. The irreversibility of this IT curve gives evidence of a structure change of the surface. The intensity of the specular beam of LEED varying with annealing time plus the Auger signals of Ag and Pt function of temperatures show that a disordered twodimensional (2D) AgPt alloy is formed in the submonolayer range at a temperature between 600 and 700 K. UP spectra in the growth process show that the d band and the Fermi edge have some interesting changes. On the other hand, UPS in the annealing process also strongly suggests that Ag and Pt atoms mix on the top layer to form a 2D surface alloy at a temperature between 600 and 700 K and a coverage in the submonolayer range.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
