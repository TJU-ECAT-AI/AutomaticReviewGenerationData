Trends in the adsorption and decomposition of hydrogen and ethylene on monolayer metal films: A combined DFT and experimental study Abstract The combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling with surface science experiments offers the potential to design catalysts with improved activity and selectivity. In the current paper we report theoretical and experimental studies of the adsorption and decomposition of hydrogen and ethylene on several bimetallic surfaces. DFT calculations predicted that Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0) bimetallic surfaces would bind hydrogen and ethylene more weakly than do the corresponding surfaces of the parent metals. The adsorption and decomposition of hydrogen and ethylene on Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0) bimetallic systems were investigated using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to test the DFT predictions. On the 0.5 and 1.0 ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surfaces, the binding strength and the degree of dissociation of hydrogen and ethylene were significantly reduced as compared to Mo(1 1 0) and thick Pd films. Similarly, on 0.5 and 1.0 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surfaces, TPD results indicated that the degree of dissociation of hydrogen and ethylene was substantially reduced as compared to clean W(1 1 0). HREELS studies of C2H4 and C2D4 revealed that the adsorption of ethylene on Pt/W(1 1 0) occurred via the weakly π-bonded configuration, which was different from the di-σ bonding on clean W(1 1 0) or Pt(1 1 1).
1. Introduction
The formation of bimetallic alloys provides a method of modifying metal catalysts to alter their activity and selectivity. Many chemical, electronic, and physical probes have been utilized to understand activity and selectivity modifications at an atomic level [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] . Progress in computational technology has also made feasible theoretical calculations to facilitate the understanding at a fundamental level [9] ,[10] . Rational catalyst design has long been a goal of surface scientists and modeling of surfaces from first principles has begun to show promise in recent years [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] . Regarding the novel properties of bimetallic surfaces, Goodman and coworkers have demonstrated in the late 1980s a strong correlation between the CO desorption temperature and the core electron energy shift in bimetallic surfaces [1] ,[2] ,[3] . Since then, many bimetallic systems and more complicated molecules have been studied in an attempt to further understand bimetallic catalysts.
An excellent example of a bimetallic system that displays novel catalytic properties is the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface, which can be prepared by either depositing Ni on Pt(1 1 1) [5] or Pt on Ni(1 1 1) [15] . Similar to many Pt-3d alloy systems, at monolayer coverage Ni atoms prefer to occupy the subsurface sites of Pt(1 1 1), making Pt the top-most surface layer in both ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1). When molecular hydrogen is exposed to monolayer Ni/Pt(1 1 1) or Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, the strength of the metalhydrogen bond decreases, as confirmed by the TPD measurements which show a hydrogen desorption temperature that is lower than that from either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1). This weakening of the metalhydrogen bond through bimetallic formation promotes reactions such as the low-temperature hydrogenation of olefins, including butene, hexene and cyclohexene [16] . In addition, the adsorption of ethylene on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) or Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces leads to significantly less decomposition in TPD experiments than that on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1) [15] . On the basis of vibrational spectroscopy studies, the lower activity for decomposition on the bimetallic surfaces has been attributed to the formation of a more weakly π-bonded ethylene species as compared to the strongly di-σ bonded ethylene that forms on Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) [15] .
We have recently performed theoretical calculations [4] ,[5] and experimental studies [6] ,[8] ,[9] ,[16] to determine the origin of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. These have confirmed that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the top-most layer of the Pt(1 1 1) surface. Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface as compared to on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1).
The focus of the current paper is to investigate other monolayer metal films to determine if they display similar chemical properties as in the Ni/Pt bimetallic system. In particular, the current study utilizes density functional theory (DFT), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to investigate reactions of hydrogen and ethylene on W(1 1 0), Pt-modified W(1 1 0), Mo(1 1 0), and Pd-modified Mo(1 1 0) surface. We will first report the DFT results for hydrogen and ethylene binding energies on the clean and modified Mo(1 1 0) and W(1 1 0) surfaces. Next we report TPD results for hydrogen and ethylene on clean and modified W(1 1 0) and Mo(1 1 0) surfaces. Finally, we present HREELS results for C2H4 and C2D4 on clean and Pt-modified W(1 1 0) surfaces. These results illustrate the correlation between DFT modeling and experimental results for various bimetallic surfaces.
2. Experimental
2.1. Techniques
The ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chamber used for the W(1 1 0) and Pt-modified W(1 1 0) surfaces has been described in detail previously [17] . Briefly, it is a three-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 3 × 1010 Torr) which is equipped with AES and TPD in the top two levels and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) in the bottom level. The HREELS spectra reported here were acquired with a primary beam energy of 6 eV. Angles of incidence and reflection were 60 with respect to the surface normal in the specular direction. Count rates in the elastic peak were typically in the range of 5 × 1052 × 106 cps, and the spectral resolution was between 35 and 50 cm1 FWHM (full-width at half-maximum). The UHV chamber used for the Mo(1 1 0) and Pd-modified Mo(1 1 0) experiments is a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr) which is equipped with AES and TPD. For TPD experiments the samples were heated at a linear heating rate of 3 K/s. In both UHV systems the opening of the random flux shield of the quadrupole mass spectrometer was placed at a distance of 5 mm from the sample surface. The TPD experimental setup allowed us to monitor up to 12 masses simultaneously.
The tungsten single crystal sample was a [1 1 0] oriented, 1.5 mm thick tungsten disk (99.999%), 8 mm in diameter. The molybdenum single crystal sample was [1 1 0] oriented, 1.5 mm thick molybdenum disk (99.999%), 12 mm in diameter. Both crystals were purchased from Metal Crystals and Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge, England. The crystals were spot-welded directly to two tantalum posts that served as electrical connections for resistive heating, as well as thermal contacts for cooling with liquid nitrogen. With this mounting scheme, the temperature of the crystals could be varied between 100 and 1200 K.
C2H4 (99+%) and C2D4 (99+%) were purchased from Matheson Gas Company and Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, respectively. H2 was obtained from Matheson (99.99% pure). All gases were used without further purification. The purity of all molecules was verified in situ by mass spectrometry prior to use. Doses are reported in langmuirs (1 L = 1 × 106 Torr s) and are uncorrected for ion gauge sensitivity. In all experiments, the gas exposures were made at a crystal temperature of 100 K, with the crystal located in front of the leak valve. The gas exposures were made by backfilling the vacuum chamber.
2.2. Preparation of clean and modified W(1 1 0) and Mo(1 1 0) surfaces
The preparation of the clean W(1 1 0) surface has been described in detail previously [18] . Briefly, the W(1 1 0) crystal was cleaned using multiple cycles of Ne+ sputtering while held at 600 K, followed by annealing to 1200 K. To remove extra carbon species, the crystal was exposed to 10 L oxygen at 1200 K. This cleaning procedure was repeated until negligible C or O signals were detected by AES. Pt-modified W(1 1 0) surfaces were prepared using physical vapor deposition (PVD) of Pt with the W(1 1 0) surface held at 600 K. The evaporative PVD doser consisted of a tungsten filament with a high purity (99.9999+%) Pt wire wrapped around it, mounted on a stainless steel enclosure. The Pt coverage was estimated from the reduction of the W(MNN 182 eV) intensity before and after Pt deposition, based upon the assumption that uniform Pt overlayers are deposited. This assumption has been validated by previous studies of Madey et al. that confirmed layer-by-layer growth of Pt on W(1 1 0) [19] .
The Mo(1 1 0) surface was cleaned by repeated cycles of Ne+ sputtering at 500 K and annealing to 1100 K. Following the last cycle, an exposure of 0.5 L of ethylene at 1100 K was used to remove oxygen left on the surface, followed by annealing at 1100 K for 5 min. This cleaning procedure was repeated until negligible C or O was detected by AES. Pd-modified Mo(1 1 0) surfaces were prepared by depositing Pd with the Mo(1 1 0) surface held at 700 K. The evaporative Pd source was similar to that described earlier but with the Pt wire replaced with a high purity (99.999+%) Pd wire. The Pd (333 eV)/Mo (190 eV) AES ratios were used to determine the Pd monolayer coverage on Mo(1 1 0). Calibration experiments were performed following the AES Pd (333 eV) intensity as a function of deposition time. A shift in the slope of Pd AES intensity was observed at a Pd/Mo AES ratio of 1.2, which was assigned to the formation of a monolayer. In addition, the calibration of the Pd coverage was also performed using the reduction of the Mo (190 eV) intensity before and after Pd deposition. The two methods led to very similar determinations of the Pd coverage (within 10%).
3. DFT modeling
3.1. Details of DFT modeling
DFT was employed to study the adsorption of hydrogen and ethylene on the bimetallic surfaces. Self-consistent periodic slab calculations were carried out based on gradient corrected DFT to produce all the theoretical results discussed in this paper. The DACAPO code developed at the Technical University of Denmark was employed for all calculations [12] . DACAPO is a total energy program that uses a planewave basis to expand the valence electronic orbitals and describes the core electrons using Vanderbuilt ultrasoft pseudo-potentials. Calculations in DACAPO are performed using periodic boundary conditions.
The adsorption of hydrogen and ethylene was studied using 2 × 2 super cells that contained three atomic layers. The top layer was allowed to relax in each case. Previous work has shown that three metal layers are in general adequate to describe all structural effects [9] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] . Results reported in the literature have shown that the binding energy variation was less than 10 kJ/mol when the number of layers was increased beyond three. Hence, the use of three-layered surface was found to be adequate and efficient in comparing trends on different surfaces. A vacuum region equivalent in thickness to five metal layers was used to separate the slabs in order to avoid any electronic interactions between them.
The parameters that were used in the code were set per previous results [9] ,[20] ,[21] . A planewave cut-off of 340 eV was found to be suitable for hydrogen and ethylene adsorption calculations. In accordance with the previous work, 18 Chadi-Cohen special k-points were found to be adequate for these calculations and maximum symmetry was applied to reduce them [9] ,[20] ,[21] . An electronic temperature (kbT) of 0.2 eV was used for the calculations with 15 additional bands to ensure adequate variational freedom. The final total energy was extrapolated back to absolute zero. The PW91 generalized gradient approximation functional was used as the self-consistent exchange correlation functional. Calculations for gas phase species were carried out implementing spin-polarization, while the adsorbatemetal system calculations were carried out spin unpolarized. For all calculations the d-band center of the surface was calculated for infinite cut-off radius.
3.2. Hydrogen binding energy on Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0)
The gas-phase energy for a hydrogen atom calculated using DFT (spin polarized) was found to be 13.68 eV. For the adsorption of atomic hydrogen on surfaces, hydrogen was adsorbed at the 3-fold binding site of the metal surface at a coverage of 0.25 ML. The adsorbateslab system was then allowed to relax to its minimum energy configuration. The binding energy was calculated as the difference between the adsorbateslab total energy and the sum of the total energy of gas-phase hydrogen and of the bare slab.
Fig. 1 compares the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) for various metal substrates against the value of the d-band center of surface metal atoms. It can be seen that the HBE varies approximately linearly with the surface d-band center. In the case of the Pd/Mo(1 1 0) bimetallic surface, the HBE is lower than those of either Pd(1 1 1) or Mo(1 1 0). A similar trend is observed for the Pt/W(1 1 0) bimetallic surface. For comparison, Fig. 1 also includes our previous calculations of the HBE of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, including monolayer Ni either on top of Pt (NiPtPt) or residing in the subsurface region (PtNiPt). The HBE on NiPtPt is higher than either Ni(1 1 1) or Pt(1 1 1), whereas on subsurface PtNiPt the HBE is lower than both Ni(1 1 1) and Pt(1 1 1). These results are consistent with experimental observations on the two types of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces [9] .

3.3. Ethylene binding energy on Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0)
Periodic DFT calculations were also used to study the adsorption of ethylene on various metal substrates. The spin polarized gas phase energy for an ethylene molecule was calculated to be 374.54 eV. On the metal surface, calculations were performed for di-σ bonded ethylene, since the di-σ configuration has been reported as the most favorable adsorption state for ethylene on most surfaces [22] ,[23] ,[24] . When ethylene is di-σ bonded to the metal surface, there is an interaction between the d-bands in the metal surface and the antibonding orbitals in ethylene molecule. Ethylene shares its π electrons with the surface and there is a flow of electrons into the antibonding orbitals of ethylene due to back-donation by metal surface. Thus the extent of interaction with the d-orbitals determines the binding energy. Furthermore, as pointed out by Norskov and coworkers [25] , the extent of interaction varies for the 3d, 4d and the 5d metal surfaces. When considering adsorption of ethylene on different surfaces one must take into account Pauli repulsion in the electronic states between the metal surface and ethylene along with the dative interaction between the π-electrons and the metal surface as stated above [23] . Because of this repulsion the kinetic energy is increased by an amount proportional to the square of the adsorbatemetal d coupling matrix element [12] ,[25] . This coupling element will vary because the 5d orbitals are more extended than the 4d orbitals which are in turn more extended than the 3d orbitals. The Pauli repulsion between electronic states of the metal surface and ethylene increases with the overlap. This effect is not so pronounced in case of simple atomic adsorbates like hydrogen, but must be taken into account when dealing with molecules like ethylene, since molecular adsorption is much more complicated than atomic adsorption [26] . Hence, for ethylene the variation in binding energy with respect to the d-band center is depicted separately for 3d, 4d and 5d metal surfaces.
Fig. 2 shows the binding energy of ethylene on various metal substrates vs. the surface d-band center. We can clearly see that if we consider all the surfaces together, then the correlation for ethylene exhibits much greater scatter from a linear relationship as compared to the HBE. However, within each group (3d, 4d or 5d) there is a fairly linear relationship between ethylene binding energy and the position of the d-band center. Overall the trend in Fig. 2 shows that the binding energies of ethylene on the bimetallic surfaces (PtNiPt, PtWW, Pd/Mo) are less than on the corresponding parent metals, which is consistent with the trend for hydrogen on these surfaces.

4. Experimental results
4.1. TPD of hydrogen and ethylene from Pd/Mo(1 1 0)
Fig. 3 a and b display the TPD spectra of hydrogen from clean and Pd-modified Mo(1 1 0) surfaces following hydrogen exposures of 2 L ( Fig. 3 a) and 10 L ( Fig. 3 b). On clean Mo(1 1 0) following a 2 L exposure ( Fig. 3 a), H2 desorption occurred at 400 K. Increasing the exposure to 10 L ( Fig. 3 b) did not change the TPD spectrum significantly, indicating that a saturation coverage of hydrogen was achieved at the 2 L exposure on clean Mo(1 1 0). Modifying the Mo(1 1 0) surface with Pd changed the peak temperature and peak area of H2 desorption. From the 0.5 ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surface a very broad and weak H2 desorption peak was observed. Increasing the coverage of Pd to 1 ML shifted the desorption temperature to 238 K, confirming the DFT prediction of weaker hydrogen adsorption on ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) as compared to clean Mo(1 1 0). From the thick Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surface, H2 desorption occurred at 225 K with a shoulder at 271 K. The definition of a thick Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surface refers to a Pd film thickness of over 3 ML based on the reduction of the Mo AES features.

Fig. 4 a shows the hydrogen TPD spectra from the decomposition of ethylene on clean and Pd-modified Mo(1 1 0) surfaces. On clean Mo(1 1 0), hydrogen desorption occurred predominantly at 418 K with a smaller peak at 289 K, similar to those reported previously [27] . On the 0.4 ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surface the desorption of H2 occurred as a broad and very weak peak at 418 K. Further addition of Pd to form 1.1 ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surface led to the disappearance of the 418 K H2 peak. Finally, from the thick Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surface, the desorption of the H2 product occurred as two overlapping peaks, centered at 260 K and 298 K.

Fig. 4 b shows the desorption of ethylene from the same surfaces. Mass 27 amu, a major cracking pattern of ethylene, was monitored instead of mass 28 amu to avoid potential contribution from the background CO. The peak at 130 K started to appear as soon as the surfaces were heated, suggesting that the desorption was due to ethylene from the heating leads. Although an additional peak was detected at 165 K on all surfaces, uncertainties about the tail of the 130 K peak made it difficult to quantify the amount of desorbed ethylene. As will be addressed in Section 5 , quantification of ethylene decomposition activities was derived based on H2 TPD peak areas instead those of ethylene.
4.2. TPD of hydrogen and ethylene from Pt/W(1 1 0)
Fig. 5 a and b display the desorption of hydrogen from clean and Pt-modified W(1 1 0) surfaces after exposures of 2 L ( Fig. 5 a) and 10 L ( Fig. 5 b) of H2 at 100 K. On clean W(1 1 0) the desorption of H2 from a 2 L exposure ( Fig. 5 a) occurred as two peaks, a dominant peak centered at 407 K with a less intense peak at 142 K. When the exposure was increased to 10 L ( Fig. 5 b), no significant changes were detected in the thermal desorption spectra, indicating that a saturation coverage of hydrogen was achieved on W(1 1 0) at the 2 L exposure. Unlike clean W(1 1 0), the 0.5 ML Pt/W(1 1 0), 1.0 ML Pt/W(1 1 0), and thick Pt/W(1 1 0) surfaces only displayed a single H2 desorption peak centered at 142 K. The definition of thick Pt/W(1 1 0) surface represents a Pt film thickness of greater than 3 ML based on the reduction of the W AES features.

Fig. 6 shows the desorption of H2 from the decomposition of ethylene on clean and Pt-modified W(1 1 0) surfaces. On clean W(1 1 0), hydrogen desorption occurred as two peaks centered at 355 and 476 K, similar to those reported previously [18] . Unlike the clean W(1 1 0) surface, ethylene decomposition on the 0.5 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface resulted in a single H2 peak at 290 K with a broad tail. In addition to the shift to lower desorption temperature, the hydrogen desorption peak area was reduced from that on clean W(1 1 0). On the 1 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface, desorption of H2 occurred as a broad peak centered at 264 K. The peak area was further reduced from that on the clean W(1 1 0) or 0.5 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surfaces. Finally, the thick Pt/W(1 1 0) surface displayed a weak H2 desorption peak centered at 173 K. Similar to those observed for Pd/Mo(1 1 0), the TPD spectra of ethylene from Pt/W(1 1 0) surfaces (not shown) were not useful due to the desorption of ethylene from the heating leads. Quantification of ethylene decomposition activities on Pt/W(1 1 0) were derived based on the TPD peak areas of H2, as will be described in Section 5 .

4.3. HREELS of C2H4 and C2D4 on Pt/W(1 1 0)
HREEL spectra following the thermal decomposition of adsorbed C2H4 and C2D4 on W(1 1 0) and Pt-modified W(1 1 0) are described in this section. The exposures of ethylene were made with the crystal temperature at 100 K; the adsorbed layer was then heated to the indicated temperatures and cooled immediately before each HREEL spectrum was recorded. Finally, the height of the elastic peaks in all spectra have been normalized to unity, and the expansion factor for each individual spectrum represents the multiplication factor relative to the elastic peak. The HREEL spectra following the thermal decomposition of C2H4 on clean and Pt-modified W(1 1 0) are compared in Fig. 7 . To assist the vibrational assignment, HREEL spectra of C2D4 at 100 and 300 K are shown in Fig. 8 . Vibrational assignments of features on W(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0) surfaces are summarized in Table 1 , Table 2 .

The HREEL spectra at 100 K showed the following features (C2D4 features in parenthesis from Fig. 8 a): 683 cm1, CH2-rock; 872 cm1, CH2-twist; 974 (670) cm1, CH2-wag; 1190 (900) cm1, CH2-twist; 1413 cm1, CH2-scissor; and 2942 (2192) cm1, νs(CH2). Additionally, the C2H4/W(1 1 0) surface exhibited a vibrational features at 392 and 2000 cm1 that were attributed to the ν(metal-C) and ν(CO) modes of adsorbed CO from the UHV background. The C2D4/W(1 1 0) spectra exhibited an additional weak feature at 2895 cm1 which was attributed to C2H4 impurities in the gas sample or in the gas handling system.
The 100 K spectra of C2H4 and C2D4 on W(1 1 0) were indicative of di-σ bonded ethylene [25] . The HREEL spectra following the thermal decomposition of ethylene on W(1 1 0) have been described in detail in a previous publication [28] . Briefly, the di-σ bonded ethylene underwent decomposition to produce an ethylidyne (CCH3) intermediate, as indicated by the onset of the characteristic δs(CH3) and δas(CH3) modes at 1352 and 1434 cm1, respectively [28] . The ethylidyne intermediate underwent further decomposition by 400 K, although a significant amount of CHx fragments remained on the surface as indicated by the relatively intense ν(CHx) feature at 2942 cm1. The vibrational features at frequencies above 3300 cm1 resulted from the accumulation and reaction of water from the UHV background during data acquisition.
Fig. 7 b shows the HREEL spectra of 2.0 L C2H4 on the 0.5 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface after heating to higher temperatures. Overall, the HREEL spectrum at 100 K was similar to those described on the W(1 1 0) surface. Heating the adsorbed layer to 200 K resulted in no significant spectroscopic changes aside from the onset of features at >3300 cm1 due to water accumulation from UHV background. Heating of the adsorbed layer to 300 K resulted in a decrease in intensity of all peaks related to the CH2 features and the growth of the ν(Metal-C) feature at 609 cm1. When the adsorbed layer was heated to 400 K, further intensity reduction of peaks related to the ethylene intermediate was observed. Comparing to the 400 K spectrum on clean W(1 1 0), the amount of CHx fragments remaining on the 0.5 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface was less as evidenced by the smaller ν(CHx) feature at 2962 cm1.
Fig. 7 c shows the HREEL spectra of 2.0 L C2H4 on 1.0 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) after heating to higher temperatures. The HREEL spectra at 100 K show the following features (C2D4 features in parenthesis from Fig. 8 a): 819 cm1, CH2-rock; 1211 (670) cm1, CH2-twist; 1414 (900) cm1, CH2-deformation and 2990 (2192) cm1, νs(CH2). In addition, the intense ω(CH2) mode at 927 cm1 and the ν(CH2) feature at 3051(2320) cm1 are characteristic of the π-bonded C2H4 species [28] , indicating that at least a fraction of ethylene was adsorbed via the π-bonded configuration instead of the di-σ bonding that was observed on the W(1 1 0) and 0.5 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surfaces. The relevant peak assignments for weakly adsorbed C2H4 are summarized in Table 2 . Heating the surface to 200 K revealed that the π-bonded intermediates were stable up to 200 K. Heating the adsorbed layer to 300 K resulted in the following spectral changes: (1) a significant decrease in intensity of the ω(CH2) mode at 927 cm1 of π-bonded ethylene intermediates, (2) the elimination of the ν(CH2) feature at 3051 cm1, and (3) an increase in intensity of the ν(metal-C) feature at 622 cm1. These observations are also supported by the 300 K spectrum of C2D4 on the 1.0 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface in Fig. 8 b. Further heating to 400 K resulted in the disappearance of nearly all the CHx fragments from the 1.0 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface.
Fig. 7 d shows the HREEL spectra of 2.0 L C2H4 on the thick Pt/W(1 1 0) surface. Overall, the HREEL spectra on the thick Pt/W(1 1 0) were similar to those on the 1.0 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface at the corresponding temperatures. The presence of the π-bonded C2H4 was confirmed by the intense features of the ω(CH2) mode at 920 cm1 and the ν(CH2) mode at 3064 cm1. Similar to the 1.0 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface, heating to 300 K resulted in a significant reduction of all the CHx vibrational features, indicating that most of the adsorbed ethylene underwent reversible molecular desorption by 300 K.
5. Discussion
5.1. Quantification of ethylene decomposition on Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0)
On Mo(1 1 0), Pd/Mo(1 1 0), W(1 1 0), and Pt/W(1 1 0) surfaces ethylene decomposes to form gas-phase hydrogen and atomic carbon by the following overall reaction:(1) where a represents the number of ethylene molecules undergoing decomposition. To estimate the amount of ethylene decomposition on the Mo(1 1 0) surface, AES measurements were performed after TPD to determine the amount of atomic carbon on the surface. The C/Mo atomic ratio was then divided by a factor of two, resulting in an estimated 0.150 ethylene molecules decomposed per Mo site on the Mo(1 1 0) surface. To estimate the ethylene decomposition on the Pd-modified Mo(1 1 0) surfaces, the following relationship based on H2 TPD peak area was used:(2) Evaluation of Eq.
(2) using 0.150 for aMo(1 1 0) gives rise to values of a0.4 ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) = 0.010, a1.1 ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) = 0, and athick Pd/Mo(1 1 0) = 0.037 ethylene molecules per metal site.
To estimate the ethylene decomposition on Pt-modified W(1 1 0), a similar relationship between W(1 1 0) and Pt-modified W(1 1 0) based on H2 TPD peak area was used. On the clean W(1 1 0) surface, Hwu et al. found that 0.144 molecules of ethylene decomposed per W site [28] , which was consistent with AES measurements in the current study. Based on this value, ethylene decomposition for the Pt-modified W(1 1 0) surfaces were estimated to be 0.084 for the 0.5 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface, 0.030 for the 1.0 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface, and 0.014 for the thick Pt/W(1 1 0) surface. The values for the decomposition of ethylene on Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0) are summarized in Table 3 .
Table 3. Activity of ethylene decomposition on Pt/W(1 1 0) and Pd/Mo(1 1 0) Surface Activity (per metal site) Surface Activity (per metal site) W(1 1 0) 0.144 Mo(1 1 0) 0.150
0.5 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) 0.084 0.4 ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) 0.010
1.0 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) 0.030 1.1 ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) 0

5.2. Comparison of Pd/Mo with Pd and Mo
If one assumes that the dissociation of H2 is a non-activated process, the desorption temperature of H2 is related to the hydrogen binding energy (HBE). On the clean Mo(1 1 0) surface, the desorption temperature of H2 is 400 K ( Fig. 1 ), similar to that reported previously [28] . On Pd(1 1 1), hydrogen formed an ordered R30 structure at 75 K at a coverage of 2/3 of a monolayer [29] . Thermal desorption spectra showed a single, symmetric hydrogen desorption peak centered at 350 K [30] . Values of HBE from DFT calculations for Mo(1 1 0) and Pd(1 1 1) ( Fig. 1 ) are consistent with these experimental results, with HBE about 0.2 eV weaker on Pd(1 1 1) than on Mo(1 1 0). DFT modeling of the Pd/Mo(1 1 0) bimetallic system predicts that the hydrogen binding energy for the ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surface will be significantly lower than that on either Pd(1 1 1) or Mo(1 1 1). TPD spectra ( Fig. 3 a and b) for hydrogen on Pd/Mo(1 1 0) confirm these DFT predictions. The H2 desorption temperature from the 1.0 ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surface occurs at 238 K, which is significantly lower than that from either clean Mo(1 1 0) (400 K) or Pd(1 1 1) (350 K). The results in Fig. 3 also show that the peak areas for H2 decrease significantly on the 0.5 ML and 1.0 ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surfaces as compared to clean Mo(1 1 0). One possible explanation is that the interaction of H2 with Pd/Mo(1 1 0) is so weak that the dissociation of H2 becomes an activated process, as reported recently for several bimetallic alloys [11] . Finally, when the Pd coverage is increased to 3 ML, the desorption of H2 occurs as a well-defined peak at 225 K, with the peak area much greater than the 0.5 and 1.0 ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surfaces. However, the desorption temperature is still significantly lower than that from clean Pd(1 1 1) [30] , indicating that the 3 ML Pd film is not the same as the bulk Pd(1 1 1) surface, suggesting that the 3 ML Pd film is not chemically identical to bulk Pd(1 1 1).Similar to the trend for H2, DFT calculations for ethylene adsorption ( Fig. 2 ) also predict that the adsorption of ethylene on ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) would be weaker than on either Mo(1 1 0) or Pd(1 1 0). Experimentally, the TPD results in Fig. 4 and in Table 3 clearly indicate that the degree of ethylene decomposition is significantly reduced on the 0.4 and 1.1 ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surfaces as compared to clean Mo(1 1 0).
For comparison, on Pd surfaces ethylene decomposition was determined to be structure sensitive in previous studies [31] ,[32] ,[33] . The stable intermediates on the Pd(1 1 0) and Pd (1 0 0) surfaces are ethynyl and vinyl, respectively, which underwent subsequent decomposition at higher temperatures. On the Pd(1 1 1) surface, ethylene adsorbs in the di-σ bonded configuration at low temperatures, which desorbs upon annealing to 300 K [34] . The partial decomposition of ethylene on Pd(1 1 1) has been reported based on the detection of CHx fragments in a previous HREELS study [35] . However, to the best of our knowledge the extent of ethylene decomposition on Pd(1 1 1) has not been quantified.DFT calculations ( Fig. 2 ) are consistent with the experimental results for ethylene adsorption and decomposition from the Mo(1 1 0) and Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surfaces. For the Pd/Mo(1 1 0) bimetallic surface, DFT calculations predicted a lower ethylene binding energy ( Fig. 2 ) than that on either Mo(1 1 0) or Pd(1 1 1). Similar to the reduced binding of hydrogen on bimetallics, the 0.4 and 1.1 ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surface did not show any decomposition of ethylene in the TPD measurements of the H2 product ( Fig. 4 ). The decomposition of ethylene was detected after increasing the Pd coverage to create a thick (3 ML) Pd overlayer, although the desorption temperature did not exactly resemble that on the Pd(1 1 1) surface, again suggesting that the 3 ML Pd film is not chemically identical to bulk Pd(1 1 1).
5.3. Comparison of Pt/W with Pt and W surfaces
DFT calculations ( Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 ) show that the shift of the surface d-band center and therefore the moleculesurface binding energies on the Pt/W(1 1 0) surface would vary similarly to those of the Pd/Mo(1 1 0) bimetallic surface for reactions with hydrogen and ethylene. The DFT results predict that the HBE on the ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface would be significantly lower than that on W(1 1 0) or Pt(1 1 1). This trend is confirmed experimentally, as shown in the TPD results in Fig. 5 . The desorption temperature of H2 from clean W(1 1 0) occurs at 407 K. Previous TPD studies of H2 from Pt(1 1 1) indicate a desorption temperature of 300 K [5] . In comparison, the desorption of H2 from the ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface occurs at a significantly lower temperature, at 142 K. In addition, the thick (3 ML) Pt/W(1 1 0) surface does not mimic H2 desorption from the Pt(1 1 1) surface, indicating that the 3 ML Pt film does not behave as the bulk Pt(1 1 1) surface.DFT calculations of the ethylene binding energy on the Pt/W(1 1 0) surface ( Fig. 2 ) predict a significant decrease in the ethylene binding energy as compared to Pt(1 1 1) or W(1 1 0). The TPD results in Fig. 6 and in Table 3 confirm that the degree of ethylene decomposition is lower on the 1.0 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface. HREELS results in Fig. 7 , Fig. 8 are consistent with the TPD results and DFT modeling regarding the weaker adsorption of ethylene on the ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface. Ethylene molecules bond to this surface in the weakly π-bonded configuration, as indicated by the characteristic features of ω(CH2) at 927 cm1 and ν(CH2) at 3051 cm1. This is different from the strong di-σ bonding of ethylene on clean W(1 1 0) ( Fig. 7 a) or clean Pt(1 1 1) [15] .
The HREELS results in Fig. 7 , Fig. 8 also reveal the different extent of decomposition of ethylene on different surfaces. On the clean W(1 1 0) and 0.5 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surfaces, HREEL spectra ( Fig. 7 , Fig. 8 a) indicate that the majority of ethylene intermediates bond to the surface at 100 K in the di-σ bonded configuration. This is indicated by the absence of the ω(CH2) and ν(CH2) vibrational features. When heated to 300 K, HREEL spectra indicate that the majority of the intermediates remains on the surfaces ( Fig. 7 , Fig. 8 b). In contrast, heating the 1.0 ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface to 300 K results in molecular desorption without significant decomposition due to the weak bonding of ethylene on ML Pt/W(1 1 0). In addition, the thick (3 ML) Pt/W(1 1 0) surface again does not behave as bulk Pt(1 1 1), as indicated by the near absence of ethylene decomposition from the TPD and HREELS results.
5.4. Comparison of Pd/Mo and Pt/W to DFT trend and other bimetallic systems
Overall, the Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0) bimetallic surfaces exhibit unique surface chemical properties that are significantly different from those of their parent metals, as predicted by DFT and confirmed experimentally. As compared in Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 , the decrease in the binding energies of H2 and ethylene on the bimetallic surfaces can be correlated with the shift in the surface d-band centers as compared to the corresponding parent metals. A similar trend was predicted and experimentally confirmed for the adsorption of H2 and ethylene on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic systems [15] ,[16] . However, the excellent correlation between theoretical predictions and experimental results for monolayer Pd/Mo, Pt/W, and Ni/Pt bimetallic systems demonstrates the potential of using the shift in the surface d-band center to predict the adsorption energies of molecules on bimetallic surfaces. As demonstrated in previous studies [15] ,[16] , the presence of weakly bonded hydrogen on Ni/Pt bimetallic catalysts can lead to the low-temperature hydrogenation of olefins. Therefore, the combination of DFT and surface science experiments should help the rational design of bimetallic catalysts with low-temperature hydrogenation activities.
Finally, it is interesting to point out that the thick (3 ML) Pd and Pt films still exhibit some of the behavior associated with the bimetallic surface. At present we do not understand whether this is due to the non-bulk like structure or the electronic interaction with the substrates. Detailed DFT modeling on the thick films is necessary to determine how the d-band center of the thick films is affected by these two types of modifications.
6. Conclusion
From the results and discussion presented above, the following conclusions can be made regarding the DFT and surface science studies of the Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0) bimetallic surfaces:(1) Submonolayer and monolayer Pd-modification of the Mo(1 1 0) surface results in a decrease in the binding energy of hydrogen and a reduction in the degree of ethylene decomposition. The TPD results are consistent with DFT predictions regarding the unique chemistry of the ML Pd/Mo(1 1 0) surface.
(2) The Pt/W(1 1 0) surfaces with submonolayer and monolayer Pt coverages show a reduced hydrogen binding energy as compared to either W(1 1 0) or Pt(1 1 1), as predicted by DFT modeling and verified by TPD measurements.
(3) The ML Pt/W(1 1 0) surface bonds to ethylene more weakly than either W(1 1 0) or Pt(1 1 1). The weaker bonding on ML Pt/W(1 1 0) results in a decrease in the degree of ethylene decomposition, as verified by TPD and HREELS measurements.
(4) The comparison of Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0) with previous studies of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and Pt/Ni(1 1 1) indicates that the surface d-band center can be used to predict the adsorption energies of H2 and ethylene on bimetallic surfaces.
