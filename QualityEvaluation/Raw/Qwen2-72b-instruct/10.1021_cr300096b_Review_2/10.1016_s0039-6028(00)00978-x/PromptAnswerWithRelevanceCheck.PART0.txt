1.The literature does not provide information on the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. However, it does discuss the synthesis of Pt thin films on Ni(100) surfaces and their characterization using XPS, LEED, and other spectroscopic techniques. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, which can inform catalysis and surface science research.

1.The literature does not provide information on the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. However, it does discuss the preparation of a model bimetallic surface by depositing Pt atoms onto a Ni(100) surface. This process is crucial for understanding the fundamental properties and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic surfaces, as it allows for the correlation of changes in surface structure and related electronic states with chemical reactivity upon the addition of a second constituent.
