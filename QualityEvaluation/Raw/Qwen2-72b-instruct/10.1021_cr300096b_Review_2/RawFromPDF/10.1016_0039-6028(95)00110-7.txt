Abstract 
The deposition of Sn onto Pt(100) and the thermal stability of these surfaces was studied primarily by using low energy 
alkali ion scattering spectroscopy (ALISS) combined with AES, LEED and CO adsorption in order to elucidate conditions 
for preparing ordered surface alloys of Pt-Sn. Distinct c(2 x 2) and (3v/'2 
- × v/-2)R45 
° LEED patterns were observed for 
specific Sn precoverages and annealing temperatures. Several real space structures that could be responsible for each of the 
LEED patterns are proposed and investigated. The results of the ALISS studies show that both overlayer Sn and incorporated 
Sn atoms can produce the c(2 X 2) LEED pattern with the resultant structure determined by the initial coverage and, 
critically, by the thermal history. Although the overlayer c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(100) structure is present from 500-700 K, which is 
over most of the temperature range of the c(2 × 2) LEED pattern, it is not the most stable structure. Annealing to 700-750 K 
causes Sn adatoms to become incorporated into the first Pt layer and forms the c(2 X 2)-Sn/Pt(100)surface alloy. Heating to 
750-850 K produces a more stable Pt-Sn alloy structure characterized by a (3qr2 
- X V~')R45 
"° LEED pattern. For Sn 
o 
incorporated into the first Pt layer to form a surface alloy, a buckling distance of 0.19 + 0.02 A is determined. This indicates 
that an almost planar Pt-Sn alloy surface is achieved, at least locally, in the first layer and that the buckling distance is 
independent of the substrate orientation for Pt(100) and Pt(lll)surfaces.

1. Introduction 
Deposition of one metal on another metal sub- 
strate, usually followed by annealing, is an efficient 
way to prepare highly ordered, two-dimensional 
bimetallic or alloy substrates [1-6]. Preparation in 
this manner often provides alloy surfaces that have 
remarkable thermal stability of their geometric struc-

ture and composition. Also, the surface structures 
provided by this methodology are notnecessarily 
limited to those from termination of a bulk single 
crystal alloy. With the help of these stable and often 
unique surface structures, issues about the origins of 
the altered chemistry observed on alloy surfaces, 
such as the relative importance of electronic and 
ensemble effects on chemical reactions, can be better 
understood. Favorable reaction paths can also be 
facilitated. In addition, systematic studies of the 
structure of these surfaces will form the basis for 
predicative ability about the structures of other

bimetallic surfaces. The key to advances in this arena 
is establishing the conditions under which alloys are 
formed and determining their structure subsequently 
using powerful spectroscopic tools. Low energy al- 
kali ion scattering spectroscopy (ALISS) has proven 
to be very useful in these regards previously [2,4,6] 
and we continue to use it as the primary structural 
probe in this work. 
Our interest in the Sn/Pt(100) system stems from 
catalysis. Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts are used com- 
mercially in hydrocarbon reforming and it is plausi- 
ble that Pt-Sn alloy surfaces may play a role in this 
catalysis. Therefore, studies of the surface chemistry 
of different crystal faces of Pt-Sn alloys are ex- 
pected to yield useful information for understanding 
these catalytic reactions. Two surface alloys can be 
formed by vapor deposition of Sn on Pt(lll), as 
reported by Paffett and Windham [1]. The surface 
alloy structure was later confirmed by Overbury et 
al. [2] using ALISS. In those studies, successive 
anneals up to 1000 K were used to produce ordered 
patterns in low energy electron diffraction (LEED). 
For both of the (2 X 2) and (V~ × vr3-)R30 
° patterns, 
Sn atoms were found to be incorporated into the Pt 
first layer to form a surface alloy, with Sn atoms 
only slightly buckled, about 0.2 A, above the Pt 
layer. The first study of the Sn/Pt(100) system was 
reported by Paffett et al. [3]. They conjectured that 
the observed c(2 × 2) and (3v~-x V~-)R45 
° LEED 
patterns formed by this system were also due to alloy 
formation. This is a very reasonable proposal consid- 
ering that almost all of the bimetallic systems involv- 
ing Sn, such as Sn/Ni(lll) [4], Sn/Cu(lll) [5], and 
Sn/Ni(100) [6], form surface alloys. The motiva- 
tions behind our studies reported here were to deter- 
mine the real space structures for the observed LEED 
patterns for this system and to make comparisons of 
the structures in this system to the other known 
transition metal-Sn alloy systems. 
2. Experimental methods 
The experimental arrangement and conditions 
were essentially the same as described in a previous 
publication [6]. The apparatus is a two-level UHV 
chamber, with instrumentation for Auger electron 
spectroscopy (AES), LEED, gas dosing, metal evap- 
oration, ion sputtering, and temperature programmed 
desorption (TPD) at the top level. The bottom level 
contains a Colutron ion gun for ISS, a small rotatable 
Comstock electrostatic energy analyzer, and an X-ray 
source. In addition, the primary energy analyzer used 
in ALISS was a Perkin-Elmer Model 10-360 spheri- 
cal capacitor analyzer (SCA) mounted on a fixed 
flange so that the scattering angle is always 144 
° 
. 
This analyzer was equipped with a dual multichannel 
plate detector (MCD) to provide high count rates. 
The polar angle, ~, is defined as the incident angle 
for ions measured from the sample surface plane. 
This angle was calibrated through laser alignment to 
an accuracy of < 0.5 
°. The azimuthal angle, ~, was 
measured from the [110] azimuth of clean Pt(100). 
This angle was initially determined by LEED mea- 
surements and then more finely adjusted using az- 
imuthal scans in ALISS to give an estimated accu- 
racy of < 1 
°. 
The Pt(100) single crystal sample (Atomergic, 5N 
purity) was 10 mm diameter X 1 mm thick and 
oriented to within 0.5 
° 
. It was held onto the sample 
holder by two 0.38 mm Ta wires and could be 
cooled down to 200 K or resistively heated to 1200 
K. The crystal was cleaned by repeated cycles of Ar 
ion sputtering (1 kV at 1000 K) and annealing in 
vacuum to 1100 K. To remove residual surface 
carbon, the crystal was often heated in oxygen (5 X 
10 -7 Torr 02, 5 mill, 850 K). The surface composi- 
tion of the sample was checked by AES. LEED 
showed the expected (5 x 20) reconstruction for the 
clean Pt(100) surface. 
The Sn doser was made by using an enclosed boat 
made from 0.13 mm Ta foil containing a Sn ingot 
(6N purity). This doser was thoroughly outgassed 
before use. The Sn deposition rate that we utilized 
with this doser was about 0.07 monolayer/min with 
a background pressure below 2 × 10 -l° Torr. Sn 
was deposited on Pt(100) at room temperature and 
the coverage was calibrated from an AES uptake plot 
(i.e., Sn and Pt AES peak-to-peak amplitudes versus 
Sn deposition time). We obtained an AES uptake 
plot very similar to the one shown by Paffett et al. 
[3]. Likewise, the Sn deposition required to obtain 
the Sn/Pt(100)-c(2 × 2) LEED pattern was also as- 
signed to 0s, = 0.5 as was done by Paffett et al. [3], 
and all the Sn coverages were referenced to this 
calibration throughout the paper.

3. Results 
3.1. Determination of scattering potentials 
In these studies of the structure of Sn/Pt(100) 
surfaces we have used low energy alkali ion scatter- 
ing as our primary technique. Specifically we used 1 
keV Li + as our probing ion beam. Two key quanti- 
ties have to be determined before we can apply this 
technique to solve structures, i.e., we have to know 
the scattering potentials for Li + interactions with 
both Pt and Sn. The most widely used form of the 
potential in the low energy range, as applied in 
various studies of surface structure, is the Thomas- 
Fermi-Moli~re (TFM) potential. There is one ad- 
justable parameter, C, that has to be determined for 
each pair of ion-atom interactions. These numbers 
are not generally available and also reports of a 
given parameter vary from experiment to experi- 
ment. Typically C is determined experimentally from 
known inter-atomic spacing by using the detailed 
procedure discussed by Overbury and Huntley [7]. 
The clean Pt(100) surface has a well-known sur- 
face reconstruction characterized by a (5 × 20) LEED 
pattern. Since the precise details of the geometric 
structure of the atoms in the Pt(5 X 20) surface are 
not clear, this makes it difficult to determine the C 
parameter of Li+-Pt (denoted as Cu~_et). We prefer 
to use an unreconstructed Pt(100) surface which can 
provide convenient atomic spacings to calculate 
Cu+_i,t. Most importantly, it enables us to compare 
the Li+-Pt angular scattering features of the ideally 
terminated p(1 × 1) surface with that of the c(2 × 2)- 
Sn/Pt(100) surface. In fact, most of our conclusions 
about the structure of the Sn/Pt(100) surfaces were 
reached through these comparisons. 
There are several ways to prepare the p(1 × 1)- 
Pt(100) surface [8]. Norton et al. [8] indicated that 
the Pt(100) (5 × 20)~ (1 X 1) phase transition is 
better accomplished by CO adsorption. This presents 
a potential problem in our work since the resultant 
p(1 × 1) surface is not a clean one but one with 0.5 
ML CO on it. However, our experience is that the 
scattered ion yields from light atoms like C and O 
are very small and usually will not noticeably change 
the scattering features from heavier atoms, like Pt. 
Thus, this surface is suitable for making a determina- 
tion of CLi+_et. The p(1 × 1)-Pt(100) surface was

produced by dosing the clean (5 × 20) surface with 6 
L CO at room temperature, which gives a clear 
p(1 × 1) LEED pattem. The resultant polar angle 
scans (varying the incident angle while maintaining a 
fixed scattering angle) of Li+-Pt along [100] and 
[110] azimuths are shown in Fig. 1. Further dosing of 
CO gave the same scans, indicating that 6 L CO 
saturates the Pt(100) surface effectively. Each of the 
insets shown in Fig. 1 is the corresponding polar 
angle scan from the corresponding clean Pt(100)-(5 
x 20) surface. The striking differences between them 
are indicative of the movements of Pt atoms upon 
adsorption of 0.5 ML CO. Not surprisingly, the 
overall angular features of p(1 × 1)-Pt(100) are very 
similar to the clean Ni(100) ones [6], which suggests 
strongly that the majority of Pt atoms have moved 
back into the bulk registry.

Table 1 lists the calculated CLi÷_pt parameter 
based on data from the p(1 × 1)-Pt(100) surface just 
described. The azimuth used in this calculation was 
the [110]. This azimuth had a more intense flux peak 
and thus the critical angle (taken at 90% of flux peak 
intensity) could be determined more accurately. The 
C parameter of the Li÷-Sn interaction (CLi+ sn) is 
also tabulated in Table 2. The surface template used 
as a reference is the c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(100) surface 
with the azimuth chosen along the [100] direction. 
The rationale for this choice is that Sn atoms form a 
single atomic chain along this direction for all of the 
outstanding structural models that we propose, i.e., it 
is essentially model independent. The C parameters 
that we deduce 
are CLi÷_pt 
= 0.80 5- 0.01 
and 
CLi+_sn -- 0.76 5- 0.02. Calculations required for this 
determination were done by using the chain model

3.2.1. ALISS 
The proposed real space models of the c(2 × 2)- 
Sn/Pt(100) surfaces are shown in Fig. 2 based on 
the arrangement of Sn atoms either as an overlayer 
or incorporated into the surface layer. For the over- 
layer model, Sn atoms are placed on the four-fold 
sites since these are presumably the most energeti- 
cally favorable. Conceivably there are other struc- 
tures that could exist, but they either require exten- 
sive distortions of the Pt lattice or involve lower Sn

situation that could also occur is one in which the 
overlayer structure and the incorporated structure 
coexist. In this section we will investigate all of 
these possibilities and provide reliable structural pic- 
tures for the c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(100) surfaces. 
ALISS energy spectra from the clean Pt(100) and 
the c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(100) surfaces are shown in Figs. 
3a and 3b, respectively. Both spectra were taken 
using 1 keV Li ÷ along the [110] azimuth at a polar 
angle of 30 
°. The single scattering Li+-Pt peak is 
clearly resolved with essentially no background con- 
tribution. By contrast, the Li+-Sn single scattering 
peak sits on a relatively large inelastic scattering 
background from Pt. This makes the interpretation of 
the Li+-Sn scattering intensity very difficult since 
this background changes when we perform angle-de- 
pendent scans. Two separate polar angle scans are 
taken to get around this problem, with the first one at 
the Li+-Sn single scattering peak (790 eV) and the 
second one at its left shoulder (750 eV). The Li +-Sn 
polar angle scan reported was obtained by subtract-

ing the second scan from the first scan as described 
above. The correctness of this procedure was checked 
by obtaining complete energy scans at a number of 
different angles and manually integrating each of the 
Li+-Sn scattering peak areas. We found both proce- 
dures gave essentially the same results, especially 
with regard to the main angle-dependent features. 
The c(2 × 2) LEED pattern exists over quite a 
wide range of annealing temperatures (300-750 K) 
once 0.5 ML Sn is deposited. The sharpest c(2 × 2) 
pattern appeared between 400-700 K. The quality of 
c(2 × 2) pattern started to degrade once the sample 
was annealed to 750 K, although it still showed a 
clear c(2 X 2) LEED pattern overall. We wilI now 
show that the characteristics of the polar angle scans 
from these two surfaces, i.e., the c(2 × 2) structures 
below 750 K and above 750 K, are so altered that

The peak marked as sll indicates that it is formed 
by the shadowing of a target atom by its nearest 
neighbor atom on the first layer. The Li+-Pt features 
along the [110] azimuth and [100] azimuth are simi- 
lar to the corresponding ones from the p(1 × 1)- 
Pt(100) surface except for a couple of differences: (i) 
the sll peak along the [110] azimuth is shifted 1 
° to 
higher polar angle and the original feature that ap- 
pears as a shoulder at about 33 
° does not occur, and 
(ii) the sll peak along the [100] azimuth is sharper 
and shifted 2 
° to lower polar angle and its intensity is 
decreased by 35%. The corresponding Li÷-Sn polar 
scans are shown in Fig. 5. The Li+-Sn features are 
characterized mainly by two peaks - a 70 
° peak, and 
a 14 
° or 18 
° peak along the [110] and [100] direction, 
respectively.

Within the two models in Fig. 2, the Sn incorpo- 
rated one can explain all but the Li+-Sn angle scan 
along [110]. Based on the alloy model, the calculated 
critical angle is well above the observed one, which 
is 12.7 
° + 0.5 
°, unless we allow the Sn atoms to have 
a large outward buckling of at least 1 .~. In fact this 
large bucking requirement leads us to the overlayer 
model. By adopting the overlayer model, the Sn-Sn 
atoms act as a shadowing and target atom pair which 
gives us the desired atomic spacing to satisfy the 
measured critical angle. Now we have two choices 
for the arrangement of Sn atoms on the surface. 
Either to stick with the original incorporated model 
and force Sn to have a large buckling distance of at 
least 1 #t, or to simply accept the overlayer model. 
There are two arguments against the first choice. If 
the incorporated Sn atoms have such a large buck- 
ling then we would have observed different angular 
features for the Li+-Pt scan along [110] as shown in 
Fig. 4a. Since the Sn-Pt atoms now act as a shadow- 
ing and target atom pair, the sll peak would be 
diminished and replaced by a new peak at a higher 
polar angle as seen for the case of Sn/Ni(100) [6]. 
Secondly, it is hard to envision an incorporated 
model with such large a buckling, since this would 
require the Sn atoms sitting on top of Pt atoms. 
Thus, we can reasonably eliminate the incorporated 
model, but we still need to see whether the overlayer 
model can explain all the existing polar angle scans. 
Within the overlayer model, the Li+-Sn polar 
angle scans along both [110] and [100] azimuths can 
be easily understood as we have discussed. We only 
need to be concerned with the Li+-Pt angle scans in 
those two directions. When one looks at each Pt row 
along the [110] direction, one finds that Pt atoms are 
still exposed to the probing Li + ions, although not 
exactly in the same way as in the p(1 x 1)-Pt(100) 
case. The Pt rows are in the second layer now and 
there are Sn atoms on each side sitting in the first 
layer. These Sn atoms are at a much closer distance 
laterally to the Pt rows underneath, which may 
slightly affect the Li÷-Pt scattering process. Experi- 
mentally we do observe the sll peak (due to Pt 
shadowing neighboring Pt) to appear very similar to 
that for p(1 × 1)-Pt(100) but shifted 1 
° to higher 
polar angle. This 1 
° shift can be caused by the upper 
Sn atoms since they are not distributed symmetri- 
cally around the Pt row underneath. The scan for 
Li+-Pt scattering along the [100] azimuth looks even 
more different than its counterpart for p(1 X 1)- 
Pt(100) (Fig. lb). For the oveflayer model there are 
still one-half of the Pt rows along [100] open to the 
incoming Li ÷ ions and that is why the sll peak is 
still seen. Because of the reduction of available Pt 
rows along this direction, we would expect a 50% 
decrease of the sll peak instead of a 35% decrease. 
This anomaly can be explained by the effect of the 
upper Sn rows. These Sn rows can act to better 
confine the Li ÷ ions scattered along the Pt chains 
and thus enhance the flux peak. Now, the unan- 
swered question is why the sll peak has a 2 
° shift. 
This is hard to explain simply from the overlayer 
model itself. We suspect the sll peak position given 
by the p(1 X 1)-CO/Pt(100) surface is not quite the 
same as that given by a clean, ideally terminated 
p(1 X 1)-Pt(100). The actual p(1 × 1)-CO/Pt(100) 
surface may have some Pt atoms still out of the bulk

199 
registry or that have undergone small amplitude al- 
ternating buckling along the [100] direction. Both 
situations could shift the sll peak to larger angles 
and there is indirect evidence to back this argument. 
When we calculate the theoretical critical angle from 
the sll peak of Fig. lb by using CLi+_Pt = 0.80 
(obtained from Fig. la), it ends up 2 
° smaller than 
observed, consistent with the observed critical angle 
on the c(2 X 2) surface. Additional evidence to sup- 
port this argument will also come to light as we 
continue. 
The preceding discussion shows that the angular 
scan features of Figs. 4 and 5 have to be and can be 
explained by the overlayer model. Since the same 
polar angle scans as those in Figs. 4 and 5 were 
observed for the c(2 × 2) surface annealed between 
400 and 700 K, we choose the overlayer model to 
describe the structure over this temperature range. 
This assignment is further substantiated by the new 
features in the polar angle scan associated with the 
surface annealed to 750 K (where LEED still showed 
a c(2 x 2) pattern). The Li+-Pt polar angle scans 
taken from such a surface are shown in Fig. 6. For 
the Li+-Pt scan along [110] there is not a great 
difference from the preceding one in Fig. 4a except 
the reoccurrence of a small shoulder at about 34 
°. 
This feature makes the overall scan look very much 
like the corresponding one on p(1 x 1)-Pt(100). The 
polar angle scan along the [100] azimuth differs from 
the preceding one in Fig. 4b mostly by the reduction 
in the sll peak intensity. Now the sll peak intensity 
is even less than it was for the p(1 X 1)-Pt(100) 
surface. 
Dramatic changes occur in the Li+-Sn scattering 
scan along the [110] azimuth as shown in Fig. 7a. 
The sll peak previously at 14 
° is completely lost 
and a broader peak at 22 
° appears. Obviously, appli- 
cations of the overlayer model will not be able to 
explain the new position of the sll peak. To be able 
to produce an sll peak at 22 
°, our calculations 
showed that the distance between the shadowing 
atom and the target Sn atom has to be nearly one-half 
of the distance of the previous one. This inevitably 
leads us to the incorporated model because of the 
inherent existence of such an atomic spacing within 
it. Along the [110] direction, the original Sn-Sn pair 
for the overlayer model is now replaced by the 
Pt-Sn pair in the incorporated model, thus shorten-

ing the pair distance by one-half. Instead of a Sn 
atom casting a shadow on a Sn atom as described 
previously, now the flux peak of sll is produced by 
the shadowing of a nearest neighbor Pt atom of the 
target Sn atom. 
The adoption of the incorporated model here not 
only satisfactorily explains the Li+-Sn scattering 
along [110], but properly fits into a description of the 
rest of the scattering features as well. The Li+-Sn 
scattering along [100] in Fig. 7b does not show any 
change as expected since both models give /unal- 
tered Sn rows along this direction. The intensity 
decrease of the sll peak observed in Fig. 6b can be 
understood as well based on the incorporated model, 
since the original intensity enhancement by the de- 
flection of upper-layer Sn rows does not exist any 
more. In fact if the Sn atoms are incorporated, the 
number of Pt rows along [100] on the first layer 
should be reduced by one-half, and hence the sll

peak height is expected to be reduced by one-half as 
well compared to that for p(1 × 1)-Pt(100) (Fig. lb). 
We did observe a decrease of the sll peak on this 
incorporated surface compared to that on the p(1 × 
1)-Pt(100) surface, but not nearly by one-half. This 
discrepancy probably indicates an imperfect ordering 
of the incorporated c(2 × 2) surface. Based on the 
incorporated model, the sll peak in Fig. 6a is pro- 
duced by a Sn atom casting a shadow on a target Pt 
atom, which is in contrast to the Pt shadowing Pt 
case for the p(1 × 1)-Pt(100) surface. However, our 
calculations show that the switching of the shadow- 
ing atom identity will only shift the sll peak posi- 
tion by 1 
°, thus we still expect similar characteristics 
of the sll peak. Actually, the sll peak position will 
be effected by the flatness of this alloyed Pt-Sn 
surface as well, and more discussion on this point 
will follow.

Fig. 8. The calculated critical angle, ~b 
e, of the sll peak in Fig. 7a 
is plotted as a function of the perpendicular height of Sn atoms 
above the first Pt layer. The dashed lines denote the range of the 
critical angle as determined 
by experiment. 
So far we have assumed implicitly that the incor- 
porated Sn atoms are at the same height as Pt atoms 
in the first layer. As a matter of fact, in most of the 
Sn and late-transition-metal alloy systems studied so 
far, Sn atoms are found buckled upwards [5,6]. As 
we indicated before, the sll peak of Li÷-Sn scatter- 
ing along the [110] azimuth is a sensitive function of 
the relative height between Sn and Pt atoms, and this 
dependence allows us to calculate the buckling dis- 
tance. In Fig. 8 we plot the calculated critical angle, 
~c, of the sll peak as a function of the buckling 
distance, dp, between Sn and Pt atoms, where posi- 
tive dp values are defined to be outward displace- 
ment of Sn compared to Pt. The measured critical 
angle is taken at 90% of the sll peak maximum 
height, which is 19.1 ° + 0.5 °. The resultant dr, value 
is 0.17-0.22 A. This slight amount of buckling 
indicates the formation of mixed Pt-Sn layer on the 
surface which is almost flat. 
It is noted above that the expected peak shift of 
sll in Fig. 6a compared to that in Fig. la can have 
contributions from two effects. The buckling of Sn 
atoms over Pt atoms will increase the critical angle 
of the sll peak, while the role of exchanging Pt for 
Sn as the shadowing atom will generally decrease

201 
this critical angle. Our calculations suggest a net 
shift of 2.5 
° to higher polar angle for the sll peak at 
dp = 0.19 ,~. Experimentally only a 1 
° shift was 
observed and this anomaly was hard to rationalize 
initially. One possible explanation is that the Pt(100) 
surface is such an open surface that the second layer 
provides as well a significant contribution to the 
Li+-Pt scattering along the [110] azimuth. This in- 
terference from an unshifted contribution could in- 
fluence the sl 1 peak position and make it insensitive 
to the buckling. Another potential explanation origi- 
nates from the way in which the critical angle was 
measured. As we described above, q~c = 19.1° in Fig. 
7a for Li +-Sn scattering was determined at 90% of 
the maximum peak height. But the edge of this sll 
peak is unusually broad (probably due to the hetero- 
geneous thermal vibrations of the shadowing Pt atoms 
and target Sn atoms). Thus, the critical angle as- 
signed at 90% of the peak height might be in error. If 
this argument holds then the real critical angle could 
be larger, hence dp could be smaller than it is 
calculated now and the observed discrepancy of the 
Pt edge in Fig. 6a could be understood as well. Work 
is in progress to examine this issue by computer 
simulation. 
We conclude that the observed c(2 × 2) LEED 
pattern can correspond to two completely different 
real space structures depend on the annealing tem- 
perature. When annealed to between 400 and 700 K, 
the outermost surface layer is characterized by pure 
Sn adatoms, thus forming an overlayer structure. 
Once annealed to 750 K, intermixing of Sn and Pt 
atoms occurs on the surface and incorporated Sn 
atoms are responsible for the ordered structure. Also 
in the latter case, the surface Sn atoms experience 
only a small buckling (0.17-0.22 A), and thus the 
Pt-Sn alloy achieved on the outermost surface layer 
is quite fiat. 
3.2.2. He + ISS and CO TPD 
To provide more information about the c(2 × 2)- 
Sn/Pt(100) surfaces, several different additional 
techniques were utilized. Low energy inert gas ion 
scattering spectroscopy (ISS) is well known for its 
surface sensitivity and is a good technique for quan- 
titatively evaluating surface composition. In our 
work, 1 keV He ÷ was used. The sample was aligned 
along the [100] azimuth and the incident angle was

chosen at 50 
° 
. In Fig. 9, the measured intensities for 
Sn and Pt scattering are shown as a function of 
annealing temperature following 0.5 ML Sn deposi- 
tion at 300 K. The Sn and Pt intensities are deter- 
mined by the integrated peak areas in ISS. The 
LEED pattern as well as the proposed real space 
structures corresponding to each temperature region 
are also indicated in Fig. 9. Throughout the whole 
temperature range, the observed Sn signal was al- 
most constant, indicating that no depletion of Sn 
atoms occurred on the surface. In contrast, a pro- 
nounced increase of the Pt signal was observed at 
about 700 K. Actually this increase starts at 600 K 
and peaks at 750 K, and then gradually decreases. 
This intensity variation can be nicely explained by 
our proposed phase transition of an overlayer struc- 
ture to an incorporated structure. For both structures 
the Sn atoms are present at the outermost surface and 
exist at the same coverage. Thus we did not observe 
any noticeable Sn intensity variations. On the other 
hand, the phase transition which happens around 700 
K drives the Sn adatoms into the Pt layer forcing the 
Pt atoms, which originally played a role in the 
second layer, to now change to the first layer. Thus 
202 
Y. Li, B.E. Koel / Surface Science 330 (1995) 193-206 
we see an increased Pt signal. It indicates that this 
phase transition process starts at about 650 K and 
finishes at around 750 K. LEED always showed a 
c(2 × 2) pattern within this range of annealing tem- 
peratures, although the quality of the pattern started 
to degrade at 750 K. We expect that the phase 
transition proceeded locally, e.g., the overlayer do- 
mains and incorporated domains coexist on the sur- 
face but eventually the incorporated domains domi- 
nate at 750 K. Further annealing caused a new LEED 
pattern and its structure will be discussed in the next 
section. 
The interaction of CO with the c(2 × 2)- 
Sn/Pt(100) surface can provide us useful informa- 
tion as well. We assume that the amount of CO 
adsorbed on this bimetallic surface is related to the 
number of exposed Pt surface atoms in the outermost 
layer. Like before, the surfaces for these CO adsorp- 
tion experiments were prepared by annealing to vari- 
ous temperatures following deposition of 0.5 ML Sn. 
An exposure of 20 L CO was dosed on each of the 
surfaces at room temperature. Adsorbed CO cover- 
ages are plotted in Fig. 10 as a function of the 
annealing temperature. The CO coverages were de-

termined by integration of the CO TPD peak areas 
and were referenced to the value of 0.75 ML for 
saturation CO coverage on clean Pt(100) at 310 K 
[9]. This plot is very similar to the one for the Pt ISS 
signal shown in Fig. 9, which is not surprising since 
both techniques reflect the accessibility of exposed 
surface Pt atoms. Similarly, we can argue that the 
increase in CO coverage at 700 K is due to a phase 
transition of the overlayer structure to the alloyed 
structure. In addition, this transition could proceed 
locally and start as early as 650 K. 
A phase transition from an overlayer to incorpo- 
rated c(2 × 2)-Sn structure is accomplished within a 
quite narrow temperature range of ,'- 50 K. Based on 
He + scattering and CO TPD results this transition 
proceeds locally, i.e., the surface is composed of 
mixed overlayer and incorporated Sn atom domains. 
It is also interesting to see how this process was 
characterized by the ALISS results. Fig. 11 shows 
how the sll peak edges for Li+-Sn polar angle 
scans along the [110] azimuth evolved with anneal- 
ing temperature. As pointed out before, this peak 
shape characterizes the fundamental structure of the 
c(2 X 2)-Sn/Pt(100) surface. At 600 K, we observed 
a highly ordered overlayer structure indicated by the

sharp peak edge and its peak position at 14°; the 
surface is composed of a single type of Sn overlayer 
domains. Once annealed to 700 K, the intensity near 
20 
° began to increase, forecasting that a new peak 
feature was forming. This surface was still com- 
prised mostly of overlayer Sn although incorporated 
Sn domains were starting to grow. At 720 K, the 
new peak is more evident and the two types of 
domains compete for the surface. The transformation 
to the incorporated Sn structure is fully accom- 
plished at 760 K, as suggested by the narrow new 
peak at 22 
° 
. At this temperature the surface is com- 
posed overwhelmingly by a single type of alloyed 
Pt-Sn domain. 
3.3. Structure of (3~/ff × ¢rff 
)-Sn/Pt(lO0) surfaces 
The alloyed c(2 x 2) structure is not a very stable 
structure thermally, since the temperature range over 
which it can be prepared is quite narrow (about 50 
K) as indicated in Fig. 9. The c(2 x 2) LEED pattern 
quickly changed to a (3V/2 
- × v~-) symmetry once 
the sample was annealed to 750 K. This new pattern 
can last up to an annealing temperature of 1000 K. 
We expected that this surface was still alloyed and 
this prediction was supported by our experimental 
evidence. The additional 3v/2 
" LEED beams have 
been suggested to arise from periodic lattice step 
arrays with Sn atoms occupying the step sites as 
opposed to originating from periodic lattice domains 
[3]. We also favor this choice for the structure based 
on 
the 
following 
arguments. 
First, 
the bulk 
Pt3Sn(100) crystal surface has been found to be 
preferentially terminated in a randomly up-and-down 
diatomic stepped array fashion [10]. Secondly, both 
the He + scattering and CO TPD results indicate a 
decrease in accessible Pt sites, which can be best 
explained by an excess of Sn atoms at step sites. 
Figs. 12 and 13 shows the respective Li+-Pt and 
Li+-Sn angle scans on this (3v~" × V~)-Sn/Pt(100) 
surface. The surface was prepared by annealing to 
900 K following 0.5 ML Sn deposition. Although 
additional small shoulders appear at lower polar 
angles, the primary features of these curves are 
similar to the c(2 × 2)-alloy ones, especially the sll 
peak for Li+-Sn scattering along [110] which is 
positioned at 22 
° instead of 14 
° 
. As before, these

features indicate the nature of this surface to be an 
alloy. Thus, locally we expect the Pt-Sn alloy struc- 
ture as well as the Sn buckling distance to be similar 
to that for the previously characterized c(2 × 2) al- 
loy. The "bumps" observed at lower polar angles 
are probably direct evidence of the stepped surface 
since they suggest the existence of longer spacing 
between shadowing and target atom pairs which 
could be introduced by step boundaries. It is difficult 
to tell from our data alone details of this stepped 
surface. Hence we cannot exclude a possible surface 
reconstruction forming periodic domains of pure Sn 
atoms every three lattice spacing along the [100] 
azimuth. 
So far we have only been concerned with the 
outermost surface of Sn/Pt(100) and we have said 
little about its deeper layers. In the case of the 
overlayer c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(100) structure, we ob- 
served a pronounced Li+-Sn scattering peak at 70

along both [110] and [100] directions (Fig. 5), which 
suggested that a substantial amount of Sn atoms 
were in the subsurface layers. After forming the 
alloyed c(2 X 2)-Sn/Pt(100) structure by annealing 
to higher temperature, these peaks were still well 
characterized although their intensity was reduced 
(Fig. 7). This observation indicates that the c(2 x 2) 
alloy structure is not purely a two-dimensional sur- 
face alloy and that Sn-Pt intermixing occurs at least 
up to the top three layers. The biggest decrease of 
these peaks were observed for the (3v~-X v~-)- 
Sn/Pt(100) surface, as shown in Fig. 13, where the 
surface was annealed to 900 K. Obviously, more 
subsurface Sn atoms are depleted as one anneals to 
higher temperatures. Although we do not have data 
for surfaces annealed further, it is most likely that a 
p(3x/2 x v/2-)-Sn/Pt(100) surface alloy is created in 
which the subsurface is relatively free of Sn atoms. 
These conclusions are based on interpreting the 70 
° 
peaks as caused by Li+-Sn scattering. The alterna- 
tive is that these features are due to scattering from 
the Pt substrate and not from Sn. We believe the 
background subtraction method used there should 
effectively remove contributions from Pt scattering. 
If this were not the case we should have observed 
similar 70 
° peak intensities for Sn scattering in both 
of the c(2 x 2) and (3V~- x vr2 
-) structures. Instead, 
we observed that these intensities were reduced sig- 
nificantly in the (3v~ X v~-) structure (Fig. 13). 
4. Discussion 
Two distinct LEED patterns, c(2 X 2) and (3v~ X 
v/-2)R45 °, were observed in our studies of Sn deposi- 
tion on Pt(100). This is in agreement with Paffett et 
al. [3]. After deposition of 0.5 ML Sn at room 
temperature, the surface generally shows a disor- 
dered LEED pattern. The clear c(2 × 2) LEED pat- 
tern appears and persists up to 750 K and further 
annealing gives the (3V~ x V~-)R45 
° LEED pattern. 
We find that the initial c(2 X 2) LEED pattern is 
formed by Sn adatoms and this overlayer structure 
dominates until 700 K. For a relatively narrow tem- 
perature range from 700 to 750 K, the LEED pattern 
still shows the same c(2 X 2) LEED pattern, but the 
dominant structure contributing to this pattern comes 
mainly from Sn atoms incorporated into the Pt layer, 
i.e., forming a surface alloy. The surface structure 
characterized by the (3v~- X V~-)R45 
° LEED pattern 
is determined to be a surface alloy, and its local 
structure is similar to the c(2 X 2) alloy. For this 
pattern, we conjecture that the surface undergoes 
further reconstruction caused by the relatively high 
temperature annealing and forms periodic lattice steps 
to relieve the lattice strain caused by surface alloy- 
ing. 
The c(2 X 2)-Sn/Pt(100) alloy is the least stable 
one among all of the structures studied for the 
Sn/Pt(100) system. It probably only acts as a transi- 
tion state between the overlayer c(2 × 2) and the 
p(3v~- × Cry-) alloy structures. As pointed out before, 
its formation is very sensitive to the Sn precoverage 
and annealing history, and the c(2 x 2) alloy phase 
may never be seen in the conversion of the c(2 X 2) 
overlayer to the p(3x/2- x v~-) alloy if the annealing

205 
process lasts too long. The typical annealing time we 
used was 30 s with the heating rate approximately 
> 10 K/s. We found that it was much easier to 
prepare the c(2 × 2) alloy surface by using the fol- 
lowing procedure: the surface precovered with 0.5 
ML Sn is annealed to 600-700 K, an additional 
~ 0.3 ML Sn is deposited, and then the sample is 
annealed to 700 K. This procedure is not very sensi- 
tive to the initial coverage and annealing history and 
quite reliably produces the c(2 X 2) alloy. The c(2 × 
2) alloy formed by this procedure can withstand 
annealing temperatures as high as 800 K. 
In studies of Sn/Pt(lll) surfaces, Paffett and 
Windham [1] performed step-wise annealing using a 
surface which had nearly 3 ML of Sn deposited at 
140 K. They found that once they reached annealing 
temperatures of about 700 K, the Sn/Pt ratio using 
Ne + ion-scattering stabilized. Although the structure 
was not reported at this temperature, the conditions 
were such that an alloyed p(¢~- X ~-)R30 ° structure 
should have been present. This alloy formation tem- 
perature was exactly the same as the one we found 
for the Sn/Pt(100) system. This implies that the 
annealing temperature required to activate alloy phase 
conversion of the bimetallic surface may be in large 
part independent of the substrate's orientation and 
this is the case for the Pt-Sn system. However, the 
thermal behavior is quite different for the Sn/Pt(100) 
and Sn/Ni(100) systems [6]. In contrast to the 
Sn/Pt(100) alloy, our studies showed that the 
Sn/Ni(100) alloy could be formed at below room 
temperature (250 K). It is not clear what physico- 
chemical parameters control the interdiffusion pro- 
cess under different surface kinetic limitations. The 
various existing theories of surface segregation and 
interdiffusion are difficult to apply because in the 
present case we are dealing with a very thin surface 
alloy that has no equilibrium bulk distribution of the 
elements. 
The buckling of Sn on various fcc metal sub- 
strates with (111) surface orientations have been 
systematically investigated by Overbury et al. [5]. 
They concluded that the surface buckling is linearly 
related to the substrate lattice constant as a result of 
lateral strain relief within the layer. It is important to 
determine whether this relationship still holds on 
substrates with orientations other than (111). What 
difference, if any, exists for the buckling distance on

different faces of the same metal? Table 3 lists the 
buckling distance for Sn/Pt and Sn/Ni alloys formed 
on substrates with each of the (111) and (100) faces. 
Two conclusions can be drawn based on these data. 
First, the buckling of Sn on the (100) faces of metal 
substrates is still linearly related to the substrate 
lattice constant, which is consistent with the strain 
relief nature of surface rippling. Secondly, the mag- 
nitude of the buckling distance is independent of the 
substrate orientation, i.e., the size of the buckling is 
not strongly dependent 
on the first-layer and 
second-layer coordination. This insensitivity of the 
buckling distance to the substrate orientation, along 
with the insensitivity of the overlayer-to-alloy transi- 
tion temperature on different faces, strongly indicates 
that the driving forces behind alloy formation and 
structure mainly come from the chemical bonding 
interactions between Sn and the first layer substrate 
atoms. Future systematic studies in our group are 
planned that aim to more fully understand the struc- 
ture and chemical nature of transition metal-Sn al- 
loys. 
5. Conclusion 
The observed c(2 × 2) LEED pattern following 
Sn deposition on Pt(100) surfaces can be due to two 
different surface structures. Over a wide temperature 
range (up to 700 K), the c(2 × 2) surface structure is 
comprised of an overlayer of Sn adatoms. Con- 
versely, a c(2 X2)-Sn/Pt(100) alloy structure is 
formed over a relatively narrow temperature range of 
700-750 K. The most thermally stable alloy struc- 
ture which is formed at higher annealing tempera- 
tures is characterized by a (3v~- x v~)R45 ° LEED 
pattern. The c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(100) alloy has a geo- 
metric structure that has one-half monolayer each of

Sn and Pt, forming a "checkerboard" pattern, where 
each Pt has only Sn nearest neighbors and vice versa. 
The alloy surface is quite fiat, with a outward Sn 
buckling distance of 0.19+0.02 ,~. The (3v~ 
X V~-)R45 
° Sn/Pt(100) alloy has nearly the same 
angular features in ALISS indicating nearly the same 
geometric structure as the c(2 × 2) alloy. We pro- 
pose that it is composed of small c(2 X 2) alloy 
domains with the same buckling distance within the 
domains. Either alloy surface can be used to probe 
the surface chemistry of Pt-Sn alloys and specifi- 
cally can be used to address issues about the reactiv- 
ity of ensembles of isolated Pt atoms on alloy sur- 
faces.
