Structure evolution of Ni ultrathin films on Pt(
)
Abstract
Low-energy electron diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy were used to study the initial growth and the alloy formation of Ni ultrathin films on Pt(1 1 1) surface. Several interesting structural phases were observed in this system: pseudo-(1×1),
, coherent epitaxy, incoherent epitaxy, and (2×2). The phase diagram was determined by LEED. In addition, the formation of Ni–Pt alloy was investigated at various Ni coverages. The starting temperature for the alloy formation increases significantly as the Ni thin films turn into three-dimensional islands.
1. Introduction
Recently, Ni–Pt-based thin films and alloys have attracted considerable interest due to their magnetism and catalytic activity. Ni–Pt alloys have been used as catalysts in many technologically important fields including petroleum refining and automotive emission control

. Adding Ni atoms on Co–Pt thin films or multilayers can decrease the Curie temperature and lead to some interesting changes in magnetic properties

. Recently, Wilhelm et al. found that the hybridization effects between Ni and Pt are mostly localized at the interface and result in a reduction of Ni moment and spin polarization of Pt
[8]
. The study of growth behavior and alloy formation of Ni films on Pt is conducive to the understanding of their magnetic properties and catalytic activities.
In this report, low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were used to study the initial growth of Ni ultrathin films deposited on a Pt(1 1 1) surface. Some interesting structural phases were observed. The alloy formation at different coverage values was investigated.
2. Experiment
All experiments were carried out in situ in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. The working background pressure was better than 3×10−10 Torr. The chamber was equipped with several facilities for the preparation and analysis of thin films and surfaces. The surface structure was obtained by the four-grid video LEED. A computer-controlled image processor measured the intensity of the diffracted spots. The chemical composition of the surface was measured by AES. A CLAM-2 hemispherical electron energy analyzer from VG MICROTECH was used for AES. The coverage of Ni was monitored by the relative evolution of Ni and Pt Auger signals. This coverage was double-checked by a quartz balance thickness monitor. The surface of the sample was cleaned by standard Ar ion bombardment and annealing cycles in the UHV chamber. The bombarding kinetic energy was 2 keV and the annealing temperature reached 1100 K. In order to remove the residual carbon on Pt surface, oxygen was introduced at a pressure of 1×10−7 Torr and the sample was heated at 800 K. Cleaning cycles were repeated until a sharp and well-ordered p(1×1) LEED pattern of the Pt(1 1 1) surface was observed.
Ni was evaporated from a 1 mm diameter high purity (99.995%) coil. We used the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) method to grow thin films. A k-type thermocouple was in contact with the Pt substrate. The sample temperature was kept within 300±3 K during Ni thin film growth. The chamber pressure evidently did not rise during Ni deposition. The deposition rate of Ni films was at about 1 monolayer (ML) per 400 s (0.3 Å/min).
3. Results and discussion
AES was used to study the growth mode when Ni ultrathin films were grown on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature. Auger signals of Pt NNV 237 eV, Ni LVV 848 eV and Ni MVV 102 eV as a function of the deposition time are shown in
Fig. 1
(a). These Auger intensities increase linearly between 0 and 800 s, with the exception of a kink located at 400 s. These curves then change to an exponential tendency after t>800 s. The change of the slope in the Auger uptake curve is interpreted as the layer-by-layer growth of a complete atomic layer on a flat surface
[9]
,
[10]
. The result of
Fig. 1
(a) indicates that 1 ML Ni grows in about 400 s, and 2 ML in about 800 s, in the layer-by-layer growth mode, which subsequently develops into three-dimensional island growth.

The break points at t=400 and 800 s correspond to 1.0 and 2.0 ML of Ni coverage. (b) The intensity of the specular beam of LEED as a function of deposition time (I–t profile). The beam energy of 73 eV was used.
The oscillation of LEED intensity has been used to measure the number of layers of a MBE growth
[10]
,
[11]
. The peak height intensity of LEED (0,0) beam versus deposition time is shown in
Fig. 1
(b). The incident electron energy is 73 eV. The out-of-phase condition, φ(0,0)=Δk⊥h=nπ was taken in our experiment, where Δk⊥ is the momentum transfer perpendicular to the surface, and h=2.03 Å is the step height of the adsorbed Ni atoms. The out-of-phase condition in the diffraction is more sensitive to the surface step density and can oscillate in a layer-by-layer growth mode
[12]
. In
Fig. 1
(b), the maximum of the intensity means that 1 ML grows completely, so that 1 and 2 ML Ni thin films occur at 400 and 800 s, respectively. The result of LEED is consistent with that of AES. From the results of AES and LEED, we can conclude that the growth of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) follows the Stranski–Krastanov mode. After 2 ML of Ni thin film growth is completed in a layer-by-layer growth mode, three-dimensional (3-D) island growth begins. This conclusion is in agreement with the X-ray photoelectron diffraction results
[13]
.
The structural evolution of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) at different coverage was observed by LEED. The LEED pictures and corresponding schematic patterns are shown in
Fig. 2
. When the coverage of Ni is below 0.2 ML, the (1×1) LEED spots are observed as shown in
Fig. 2
(a). This is a pseudo-(1×1) structure because the LEED spots are slightly diffused compared to the clean Pt(1 1 1) LEED pattern. According to the LEED I–V profile by Atrei et al., Ni atoms prefer to occupy the threefold hollow sites with fcc stacking sequence initially
[14]
. This is consistent with our observation. The LEED pattern in
Fig. 2
(a) also shows the threefold symmetry. When the coverage is between 0.3 and 0.9 ML, the LEED pattern changes to the
as shown in
Fig. 2
(b). The
is a well-known structure for a metal adsorbate on Pt(1 1 1) surface, for example Ag/Pt(1 1 1)
[15]
, and K/Pt(1 1 1)
[16]
. A very interesting new phase was observed when the thickness of Ni is between 1.0 and 1.2 ML as shown in
Fig. 2
(c). An extra LEED spot appears on each diagonal line outside the original spot of Pt(1×1) LEED pattern. This structure means that Ni atoms epitaxially grow with respect to the Pt substrate, but having a different lattice constant. The nearest neighboring distances of Pt and Ni atoms are 2.77 and 2.49 Å, respectively. The ratio of reciprocal lattice constant is about 1:1.11. It is consistent with the ratio of the distances between Pt, Ni LEED spots and the specular beam.

In the schematic LEED diagrams, the area of the circle is proportional to the spot size of LEED. Detailed description is given in the text.
A Ni(1×1) structure accompanying some satellites LEED pattern was observed for the coverages from 1.3 to 6 ML as shown in
Fig. 2
(d). This incommensurate LEED structure indicates an incoherent epitaxy of Ni overlayers on Pt(1 1 1). Similar fine structure of LEED satellites has been observed in thin film systems with large lattice mismatch, such as Co/Pt(1 1 1)
[17]
, Pt/Ni(1 1 1)
[18]
and Cu/Ru(0 0 0 1)
[19]
. The clearest satellite LEED pattern occurs in the Ni coverages between 1.3 and 2.0 ML. The intensities of the inner satellite spots on each diagonal line become stronger than the other ones after the coverages are larger than 2.6 ML, but these fine diffraction satellites become gradually blurred as the coverage of Ni thin films is too thick. The LEED pattern was monitored for every 0.4 ML. However, the satellite LEED pattern did not change for the coverages from 1.3 to 6 ML. The LEED patterns due to rotated domains or corrugated structure of strained Cu layers on Ru(0 0 0 1) were not observed in our system
[19]
. This incoherent epitaxial growth may cause the intensity of the LEED specular beam to decay rapidly as shown in
Fig. 1
(b).
When the coverage further increases, an extra spot appears at the center of each side of the triangle as shown in
Fig. 2
(e). This is the (2×2) structure and can be observed in the coverage range between 6 and 10 ML. A similar LEED pattern has also been found on the surface of an 8 ML thick iron oxide film on Pt(1 1 1)
[20]
and on the surface of 4.5–7 ML cobalt films on Pt(1 1 1)
[17]
. These additional spots have been interpreted as a particular arrangement of the step structure at the topmost layer. The step height and the step orientation can be determined by analyzing the data of the I–V profile for each diffraction beam of the (2×2) LEED pattern
[20]
.
All the above LEED patterns were observed at room temperature. The LEED patterns change to the (1×1) structure as shown in
Fig. 2
(f) and (g) after the ultrathin films have been annealed at 750 K for 5 min and observed at room temperature. The (1×1) LEED spots of
Fig. 2
(f) are sharper than that of
Fig. 2
(a). The sharp (1×1) pattern is due to the surface alloy lattice formed upon diffusion of Ni adatoms toward the bulk as a consequence of the annealing treatment. This phenomenon will be discussed later. The (1×1) LEED pattern after annealing becomes blurred and the spot size increases as shown in
Fig. 2
(g) when the Ni films become thicker.
The phase diagram of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) is summarized in
Fig. 3
. It can be divided into six distinct regions of coverage. In region I, Θ<0.2 ML, it shows the pseudo-Pt(1×1) structure. The Ni atoms accumulate on Pt(1 1 1) with a reciprocal lattice vector of
. The adatoms in the overlayer relax to fit the Pt(1 1 1) lattice points. In region II, 0.3⩽Θ⩽0.9 ML, a
superstructure of Ni atoms is adsorbed in an ordered state on Pt(1 1 1) surface. This structure persists until the annealing temperature reaches 450 K. In region III, 1.0⩽Θ⩽1.2 ML, this is the coherent (1×1) structure. Each site on Pt(1 1 1) surface is occupied by one Ni atom. Since the lattice constant of Ni is smaller than that of Pt, the coherent structure is reasonable. This structure remains unchanged during the annealing up to a temperature at 475 K. In region IV, 1.3⩽Θ⩽6.0 ML, Ni atoms grow by incoherent epitaxy. Fine satellites around the hexagonal Ni(1×1) main spots were observed. In region V, 6.0⩽Θ⩽10 ML, additional (2×2) spots appear because of surface steps formed at the topmost layer. After high temperature annealing, LEED pattern shifts to (1×1) structure. In region VI, Θ<10 ML, all (1×1) LEED patterns have the reciprocal vector of Pt. This is the evidence that Ni atoms diffuse into Pt bulk and a disordered Ni–Pt surface alloy forms. Since the Ni–Pt alloy on surface layers is disordered, the background intensity of the (1×1) LEED pattern increases and the LEED spots become blurred.

We further studied the alloy formation by AES. Ni MVV 102 eV Auger signal was detected. The results are shown in
Fig. 4
. Each experimental value was measured 3 min after the thermal equilibrium was reached. All the Auger intensities at different coverage do not change until Ni atoms start to diffuse into Pt bulk. Ta is the temperature value at which the Auger intensity begins to drop, that is as soon as the Ni–Pt alloy starts to develop. These values of Ta are 450, 475, 500, 600, and 650 K for Ni coverage of 0.8, 1.3, 2.0, 2.3, and 3.0 ML, respectively. Ta rises as the coverage of Ni increases. This behavior is similar to that of Co/Pt(1 1 1)
[17]
. This phenomenon may be caused by the adsorbate–adsorbate interaction. This interaction prevents the formation of Ni–Pt alloy. Since the interdiffusion occurs from the Ni–Pt interface, the attraction between Ni atoms needs to be overcome by higher temperature.

The dependence of Ta on Ni coverage is shown in
Fig. 5
. It is interesting that Ta significantly increases when the coverage is larger than 2 ML. From
Fig. 1
we have concluded that the first 2 ML of Ni thin films on Pt(1 1 1) grow in the layer-by-layer mode, which then turns into 3-D islanding for thicker layers.
Fig. 5
shows that the interdiffusion barrier for the 3-D islands is higher than that for the flat layer in this system.

4. Conclusions
The growth of Ni ultrathin films on Pt(1 1 1) follows the layer-by-layer growth mode up to 2 ML, then it turns into the 3-D island growth mode. A rich variety of structural phases in this system were observed at different coverage: the pseudo-(1×1) structure for Θ<0.2 ML, the
commensurate superstructure for 0.3⩽Θ⩽0.9 ML, the Ni(1×1) spots appearing outside of Pt(1×1) LEED spots for 1.0⩽Θ⩽1.2 ML, the incoherent epitaxy for 1.3⩽Θ⩽6.0 ML, and the (2×2) superstructure for 6.0⩽Θ⩽10 ML. The starting temperatures for Ni–Pt alloy formation are 450, 475, 500, 600, and 650 K for Ni coverage of 0.8, 1.3, 2.0, 2.3, and 3.0 ML, respectively.
