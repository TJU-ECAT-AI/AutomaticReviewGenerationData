Abstract
The adsorption of ultrathin "lms of Pt on W, Pt on Ir, and Pd on Mo "eld emitters has been studied with an emphasis
on faceting processes, by means of "eld electron microscopy (FEM) under UHV conditions. The "lm thicknesses ranged
from fractions of an atomic monolayer to several monolayers. From the analysis of "eld emission patterns and
current}voltage measurements we have found that the steady-state shape of the emitter microcrystal (emitter tip) can be
changed by the presence of the metallic adsorbate "lm (in general a transition occurs from a nearly hemispherical shape
to a nearly polyhedron shape). The transition is connected with the faceting of the substrate, which is manifested by
changes in size and in electron emission of some planes. The e!ect is particularly pronounced for the Pt/W and Pd/Mo
systems at adsorbate coverages '1 ML in the substrate temperature range, roughly, 700}1400 K depending on the
adsorption system. Under such conditions, planes of the zone type (1 1 0)-(1 0 1) of the W and Mo crystals (bcc structure)
appear as facets, e.g. 1 1 2, 1 2 3 and 1 7 8, whereas for Ir (fcc), planes of the (0 0 1)-(1 1 1) zone appear, e.g. 1 1 6 or
1 1 5.  2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Faceting and other morphological changes of
surfaces caused by adsorbed thin "lms have been
reported for a number of years for various adsorp-
tion systems and surface geometries, from planar
single crystal surfaces to the nearly spherical surfa-
ces of small particles and large crystals [1}11].
Faceting is the spontaneous growth of a hill and
valley structure on the surface during the heating of
the crystal. It is generally believed that faceting is
driven by minimization of the surface free energy
[9}12].
The studies of thermal faceting of planar single
crystal surfaces have been carried out using low-
energy electron di!raction (LEED), scanning tun-
neling microscopy (STM) and recently low energy
electron microscopy (LEEM) [2,5,6,9,13}19]. Field
ion microscopy (FIM) and "eld emission micros-
copy (FEM) have also been used to study the ge-
ometry of small (&1000 A
s ) single microcrystals
[1,3}5,8]. This is a result of the speci"c, spherical

shape of the tip surface which reveals simulta-
neously both the close-packed regions of low-index
crystallographic planes and regions consisting of
planes, where surface atoms are spaced more dis-
tant from one another.
In recent years, much evidence has accumulated
concerning the extensive faceting of planar W(1 1 1)
and Mo(1 1 1) surfaces induced by metallic adsor-
bates such as Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt, Au [13}19]. W(1 1 1)
and Mo(1 1 1) surfaces covered with monolayer
"lms of each of these adsorbates are thermally
unstable upon annealing above a threshold temper-
ature of &700 K. Then the reconstruction of the
surfaces to form pyramidal facets with dimensions
of several nanometers occurs. The facets of the
pyramids have
predominantly 1 1 2
orienta-
tions.
Recently FEM has been used to study the facet-
ing and steady-state shape of Rh- and Pd-covered
W "eld emitter tips [20]. Both overlayer metals are
found to induce faceting of the nearly spherical
emitter tip upon annealing at elevated temper-
atures, as demonstrated by the increase in size of
2 1 1 facets as well as the appearance of new
facets, e.g. 1 2 3 of the zone type 1 1 1. A distinct
faceting transition was observed only above a criti-
cal coverage and a threshold temperature of
&800 K [20]. A preliminary FEM study of the
faceting in the Pt/W system was carried out in 1997
[21]. The results for this system presented in this
paper are quoted from Ref. [21].
The purpose of this paper is to provide addi-
tional information on the faceting and the "nal
steady-state shape of the emitter tips covered by
metals after high temperature cleaning.
2. The apparatus and measurement procedures
The investigations were performed using FEM
methods under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) condi-
tions (total base pressure below 210Torr).
The measurements were carried out in glass "eld
emission (FE) tubes attached to an ion-pumped
stainless steel chamber, or in tubes sealed o! from
the vacuum system (e.g., Pt/W). The microscope
tubes were equipped with a Bayard}Alpert ioniz-
ation gauge, a liquid nitrogen cooled Ti getter, and
vapor sources of the metal under investigation. Pt
and Pd were deposited on to one side of the emitter
tip from well-outgassed evaporation sources con-
sisting of Pt or Pd wires tightly wrapped around
tungsten wire which was resistively heated during
evaporation. The measurement procedure was sim-
ilar to that described in Ref. [20]; however in this
experiment adsorbates were dosed onto the tips
held at elevated temperature to enable di!usion
during dosing. The W and Mo emitter tips were
electrochemically prepared from 0.1 mm diameter
wires and cleaned by annealing in the FE tubes at
temperatures above 2000 K. Such procedures are
usually su$cient to generate clean surfaces. The Ir
emitters were made from an 0.15 mm diameter Ir
wire (Goodfellow); 99.9% pure. The Ir wire had
been pre-annealed at 800}900K in an atmosphere
of oxygen, &7.510 Torr, for 1 h (as suggested
in Ref. [22]), then outgassed under UHV condi-
tions at a temperature for which distinct evapor-
ation of Ir occurred. Emitter tips were prepared
using Melmed's procedures [23,24] and were
cleaned by heating in vacuum. The temperature of
the emitter tips was controlled by resistive heating
of the emitter loop assembly. Investigations consis-
ted in observation of "eld emission images, accom-
panied by electrical measurements corresponding
to di!erent stages in the adsorption of metallic "lms
onto the emitter surface, at di!erent substrate tem-
peratures. All "eld emission observations and elec-
trical measurements were made with the emitter tip
at room temperature, to avoid "eld-induced facet-
ing. The "eld emission patterns could be observed
directly on the microscope screen or by using a TV
camera and video monitor. The patterns were
video-taped, recorded, and then computer ana-
lysed.
3. Results
The adsorption of Pt on tungsten (bcc structure)
and iridium (fcc), and Pd on molybdenum (bcc) was
observed under di!erent thermal conditions. Typi-
cal FE patterns are presented in Fig. 1 which show
various stages of the faceting process for these
adsorption systems. The radii of curvature of
the W, Mo and Ir emitters, estimated from the

images (Fig. 3). The diameters of the facets have an
estimated measurement error of 20}25%. Pt and
Pd atoms were dosed onto the tips from one side,
perpendicular to the axes of the emitters held at
elevated temperature, to enable surface di!usion
during the dosing. Adsorbates were evaporated
onto the emitter dose by dose. The emitters were
held at elevated temperature 30 s before and after
the dosing. The total time of the heating of the
emitters is indicated below the FE patterns in
Fig. 1. This dosing procedure insured thermal equi-
librium of the adsorbate layer on the emitter surfa-
ces,
and
coverage
could
be
more
precisely
determined. Comments on the de"nition of the
overlayer coverage, an important parameter, are
presented in the Discussion.
3.1. Platinum covered tungsten
FE patterns, obtained during evaporation of
platinum
onto
the
tungsten
emitter
held
at
ยน"1400 K, are shown in Fig. 1a}d. The cover-
age "1 ML was identi"ed with the evaporation
time of Pt corresponding to the maximum of the
average work function of the system (see Section 4).
Signi"cant changes in the tip geometry follow dos-
ing with Pt in excess of 1 ML: an increase in size of
the 1 1 2 facets and decrease in size of the 1 1 0
faces.
New facets, 1 2 3 and 1 7 8 with diameters
about 600 and 500A
s
respectively, also appear
along the lines connecting the 1 1 0 and 1 1 2
facets (zones 1 1 1). The 1 1 2, 1 2 3 and 1 7 8
facets are surrounded by bright emission regions
(due to enhanced electron emission from the edges
surrounding the facets) and the 1 2 3 and 1 7 8
facets are clearly distinguishable from the 1 1 2
facets.
A comparison of patterns for the clean emitter
(Fig. 1a) and the Pt covered emitter (Fig. 1d)
indicates that the presence of adsorbed Pt atoms
a!ects the thermal steady-state shape of the micro-
crystalline tungsten emitter apex: the apex passes
from a nearly hemispherical form to a more poly-
hedral form. The electron emission from a recon-
structed emitter should occur mainly from the
edges of reconstructed faces, due to "eld enhance-
ment. For high temperatures T '1600 K where
faceting diminishes, the hemispherical form of the
emitter is recovered. The temperature range over
which faceting is observed depends primarily on
the coverage of Pt. For coverages '1 ML that
range is 800}1500 K
In the temperature range above 1900 K platinum
is desorbed from tungsten. The clean surface of the
W
emitter
is
recovered
after
annealing
at
ยน'2400 K.
Recently, Pt induced faceting of a W "eld emitter
tip was observed by FIM [25]. The faceting was
found to appear in the 1 1 1 zone for a Pt cover-
age about 1 ML after annealing in the temperature
range 1000}1900 K. Under those conditions facets
of the type 1 1 2, 1 2 3 and 1 7 8 were increased
in size [25], where 4 3 1 should be read 8 7 1.
3.2. Palladium covered molybdenum
Fig. 1a}d shows FE patterns characteristic of
the adsorption of Pd on the molybdenum tip at
970 K. At 1 ML coverage, 0 1 3 facets about 100 A
s
in diameter appear (1 0 0 zones), and are distinct-
ly visible at higher coverage in Fig. 1c. The facets
are surrounded by bright rings attributed to en-
hanced electron emission from the edges of the
facets. With increasing Pd coverage the 0 1 3
facets disappear and the FE patterns become sim-
ilar to those for Pt/W presented in Fig. 1a}d; the
faceting occurs along the 1 1 1 crystallographic
zones. Enhanced electron emission from the edges
surrounding the 1 1 2, 1 2 3 and 1 7 8 facets
indicates an increase in size of the facets.
During the adsorption of Pd atoms on the Mo
tip, faceting was observed for coverage *1 ML
in the substrate temperature range 750}1040K.
The desorption of Pd from molybdenum tip was
observed at ยน'1300 K. The clean surface of the
emitter
was
recovered
after
annealing
at
ยน'1510 K.
3.3. Platinum covered iridium
FE patterns for the adsorption of Pt atoms on
the Ir emitter tip held at a temperature of
ยน"1130 K are presented in Fig. 1a}d. The
pattern in Fig. 1a represents the FE image
G. Antczak et al. / Vacuum 63 (2001) 43}51

corresponding to the thermally cleaned Ir sample
(without Pt). We have observed such patterns con-
sistently after annealing the emitter at various tem-
peratures, also after heating and #ashing the
sample close to its melting point, followed by rapid
quenching to room temperature. The enhanced
electron emission around the Ir(1 0 0) plane, which
has been attributed to contamination of the sample
(as interpreted in many papers by Vanselow and
coworkers (e.g. [26]) and also by Melmed [27] for
Pt emitter tips), always appeared in our FE pat-
terns. Ring-like emission around the 1 0 0 planes
was also observed by Hashim and Jones [22]. We
are not sure whether this emission, in our case, is
really caused by contamination of the tip surface;
the enhanced emission area in Fig. 1a has a square
shape rather than a ring-like one. Such square form
of the Ir(1 0 0) surface top layer with four sides
parallel to the 1 0 0 direction was found under
thermal equilibrium conditions in atomic scale
FIM studies by Tsong and coworkers: around
400 K, the lattice step atoms start to move along
the 1 1 0 steps of a crystal surface [28]. Perhaps
this e!ect (on a massive scale) is responsible for the
enhanced emission of Fig. 1a. This supposition
must be examined, however, in additional experi-
ments. The Pt was adsorbed on the thermally
cleaned Ir sample represented in Fig. 1a. We have
observed distinct faceting to start for coverages
around 2 ML at a substrate temperature about
880 K. Distinct faceting is seen in the (0 0 1)-(1 1 1)
zone: in particular, new 6 1 1 or 5 1 1 facets with
diameter '100 A
s appear. It is possible, though not
certain, that the 1 1 0 planes grow also. The most
pronounced faceting was observed at 1020}1130K.
Pt appears to be completely removed after #ashing
of the emitter above 2100 K. The appearance of the
FE image of the Ir tip after #ashing is the same as
Fig. 1a.
4. Discussion
Faceting of planar surfaces on a massive scale is
demonstrated as the appearance of new facets
which form hills and valleys on initially large and
#at crystallographic surfaces covered by thin metal
"lms [15,19]. Faceting of curved surfaces, consist-
ing of various faces, leads to an increase in facet
size, i.e., increased angular width subtended by
some faces. This can be the case for the surfaces of
large cylindrical crystals and small spherical par-
ticles. Mro
H z and Bauer reported faceting occurring
on the surface of a cylindrical tungsten single crys-
tal covered with a gold layer [6]; faceted regions as
large as 203, 133, and 43 developed around the
[1 1 2], [1 1 0] and [3 3 2] directions, respectively.
A "eld emitter tip, after heating at high temperature
(ยน*0.4 ยน) for an extended time, assumes
a steady-state shape. The surface is composed of
ordered low-index faces and disordered regions. In
the case of bcc crystals, the ordered faces are 1 1 0,
1 1 2 and 1 0 0; in the case of fcc those are 1 0 0
and 1 1 1 surfaces. In the FE images the ordered
faces (planes) are distinctly visible because their
work functions are higher than the work function
of surrounding regions and the sizes much larger
than the resolution of FEM, estimated to be about
20}30A
s [29].
Interaction of Pt layers with the W and Ir tips
and Pd layers with the Mo tip at elevated temper-
ature leads to changes in the faceted morphology of
the substrate. The e!ect depends strongly on cover-
age. In FEM experiments, faceting was observed at
*1 ML for the systems Pd/W, Rh/W [20] and
for Pt/W and Pd/Mo, whereas for Pt/Ir it is found
at *2 ML. A coverage of 1 ML is assumed to be
the overlayer coverage at which a maximum of the
average work function of the adsorbed system ap-
pears. As the smoothing e!ect of atomically rough
regions of the substrate by adsorbed atoms is re-
sponsible for the maximum, "1 ML is inter-
preted as a geometrical monolayer. In this case the
adsorbate density reaches roughly the value of the
top-layer surface density of the substrate [30}33].
Measurements for planar single crystal surfaces
have shown that extensive faceting on W(1 1 1) and
Mo(1 1 1) faces appears at a much higher coverage,
namely at *3 geometrical ML, which is de"ned
as one physical ML [14,15,19]. Possible reasons for
the di!erent coverage dependences of faceting on
planar surfaces and curved emitters surfaces are
discussed in Ref. [34]. For curved emitter surfaces,
a change in tip shape occurs during faceting; this
in#uences the slope of the Fowler}Northeim plot
so that the average work function determination is
48
G. Antczak et al. / Vacuum 63 (2001) 43}51
not reliable. Moreover, under faceting conditons,
the distribution of adsorbate over the surface of the
emitter tip may not be uniform, and nucleation of
higher coverage patches may occur on the faces.
Note also that the faceting phenomenon is manifest
as an increase in size of certain facets (mainly
2 1 1, 3 2 1 and 8 7 1 for W and Mo, and
1 1 6 or 1 1 5 for Ir). Perhaps the facet growth is
initiated at lower coverages than the large scale-
faceting of planar bcc (1 1 1) surfaces.
For the adsorption systems Rh/W and Pd/W,
faceting resulted in a change of the steady-state tip
shape from nearly hemispherical for clean emitter
tips
to
morenearly
polyhedral
[20].
Similar
transitions are seen for the systems presented in this
work. Based on the results of Ref. [20], it appears
that the annealing times indicated in Fig. 1 may not
be long enough in all cases for the tips to reach their
steady-state shapes. The time to reach the steady-
state shape is expected to scale with tip radius as r
[4] and under the present experimental conditions
(temperature and tip radius) the time required can
be of the order of hours. Nonetheless, the annealing
times are more than adequate for determining
trends in metal "lm-induced faceting of tips [20]
especially for seeing the presence of new facets and
identifying their orientations.
4.1. Pt/W and Pd/Mo systems
For the Pt/W and Pd/Mo systems new facets
occur in the curved disordered region between the
[1 1 0] and [1 1 2] directions. From Fig. 1b it is
seen that adsorption of Pt on W causes the shape of
the 1 1 2 facets to become elliptical, #attened in
the [1 1 0] direction. This e!ect is more enhanced
for a higher coverage (Fig. 1c) demonstrated by
broadening of a dark 1 1 1 zone. From a com-
puter analysis of the brightness of FE images for
Pt/W, we "nd that the angular size of the facets in
the [1 1 0] direction does not change upon adsorp-
tion, while in the [1 1 1] direction, it increases by
above 50%.
A similar elliptical shape is observed also for
3 2 1 and 8 7 1 facets (which are not separated in
the image of the clean emitter tip) but facets grow in
both directions during Pt-induced faceting. Al-
though the 3 2 1 and 8 7 1 facets for the Pd
covered Mo emitter tip (Fig. 1d) are not as dis-
tinctly visible in the FE image as those for the Pt/W
emitter (Fig. 1c), one may suspect similar mor-
phological transformation on the Mo tip surface.
As the radius of curvature of the Mo emitter is
about 0.7 of the W tip radius, the sizes of new facets
on the Mo tip surface also can be proportionally
reduced.
The 1 1 2, 3 2 1 and 8 7 1 facets consist of
close packed atomic rows in the [1 1 1] direction
with troughs between them. The distance between
rows (the breadth of the troughs) increases in going
from 1 1 2 to 8 7 1 for clean faces. It seems that
growth of the facets proceeds in the [1 1 1] direc-
tion when the substrate is entirely covered by the
adsorbate, and that faceting proceeds by an attach-
ment of atoms, originating from adjacent regions,
to the [1 1 1] rows at the edges of 1 1 2, 3 2 1 and
8 7 1 faces.
Atomic
scale
STM
images
of
the
faceted
Pd/W(11 1) surface with a coverage of *1 physical
ML [15,16] con"rmed the LEED results [14,15,35]
that three-sided pyramids with 2 1 1 facets are
formed upon annealing at 1075 K for 3 min. The
images demonstrate the atomic row-and-trough
structure of the bcc 2 1 1 facets. Song et al., study-
ing the Pd-induced faceting phase transition of
Mo(1 1 1), have estimated (from the size of the shar-
pest di!raction spots) the average linear dimension
of the (1 1 2) facets to be larger than 100 A
s [35]. For
this system the dimensions of the induced facets are
comparable with those of the Pd modi"ed (1 1 2)
facets of the curved Mo microcrystal (Fig. 1d).
According to the STM studies of the Pt/W(1 1 1)
system carried out in Madey's laboratory the di-
mensions of the three-sided pyramids can grow to
a maximum size of &1000 A
s depending on anneal-
ing temperature and times; the "nal size increases
with increasing annealing temperature, from an
average size of 150 A
s at 880 K to an average size of
&700 A
s at 1400 K [36}38]. The size of induced
facets on the emitter tip surface depend on the tip
radius. Note that the 1 1 2 facets induced on
a planar W(1 1 1) surface are only slightly larger
than the 1 1 2 facets formed on the Pt-covered
W tip of 3500 A
s radius (Fig. 1d); these observations
are similar to the Pd/W and Rh/W systems re-
ported previously [20].
G. Antczak et al. / Vacuum 63 (2001) 43}51

Surface core level shift (SCLS) experiments [39]
revealed that thick "lms of Pt and Pd undergo
alloying with the W(1 1 1) substrate during anneal-
ing; tungsten atoms di!use into the overlayer. Our
observation of surface di!usion of large doses (for
coverages '1 ML) of Pt and Pd atoms on Mo
showed that di!usion proceeds without a sharp
boundary, which can be a result of morphological
changes and surface alloy formation during the
di!usion. This e!ect is particularly noticeable for
the Pt/W system. In contrast, it is often observed
that the di!usion of large doses of various metal
adsorbates proceeds with a sharp boundary ac-
cording to the `unrolling carpeta mechanism [29].
Also the dependence of the average work functions
(and pre-exponential terms of the Fowler}Nor-
dheim equation) on coverage for Pt/W and Pd/Mo,
measured for entire emitter tips at higher temper-
atures, exhibit relatively large scatter in the experi-
mental data. We believe that the strong in#uence of
the adsorbates on surface morphology is respon-
sible for the scatter.
The results for Pt/W and Pd/Mo systems are
quite consistent with the data for the Pd/W and
Rh/W systems studied also by FEM methods [20]:
in all these cases faceting along the 1 1 1 zone has
been observed for coverages exceeding 1 ML. The
threshold temperatures are also similar. The most
pronounced faceting is observed for a Pt/W emit-
ter, and also the temperature at which faceting
vanishes is the highest (ยน'1600 K) for Pt/W.
4.2. Pt/Ir system
It is important to note that there are no previous
data available that show metal-induced faceting of
Ir; however, Brenner has reported that oxygen
causes distinct faceting of an Ir FE tip [1]. The
present results show that Pt-induced faceting of Ir
is observed for the zone (1 0 0)-(1 1 1) (Fig. 1). The
most pronounced e!ect is seen for 1 1 6 or 1 1 5
facets, whereas oxygen in#uences mainly 1 1 3,
1 1 0 and 1 1 1) facets [1]. In contrast to oxygen,
Pt does not signi"cantly in#uence the rearrange-
ment of the Ir(1 1 0) facet. It would be useful to
compare geometrical parameters of the surfaces.
The 1 1 0, 6 1 1 and 5 1 1 facets consist of close
packed atom rows in the [1 1 0] direction with
troughs between them, in the [1 0 0] and [2 3 3]
directions, respectively but the distance between
the troughs are much larger on the latter facets.
This aspect will be taken into consideration in the
next paper.
5. Conclusion
The adsorption of Pt on W, Pt on Ir, and Pd on
Mo "eld emitter surfaces is found to be accom-
panied by distinct rearrangement and faceting of
the substrate surface. This results in a signi"cant
change in tip geometry: for coverage '1 ML
and
in
the
substrate
temperature
range
&800}1400 K (depending on the adsorption sys-
tem) the transition of the steady-state tip shape
