Abstract 
We present a core level photoemission 
spectroscopy study, using synchrotron radiation of the first stages of Pt/Pd( 111) growth. 
Up to one monolayer (ML) of Pt interdiffusion leads to a surface alloy formed over the first two layers. Between 1 and 2 ML the 
system demixes, giving rise to a pure Pt overlayer, for coverages >2 ML. The role of the interface in the surface alloy formation 
is discussed.

1. Introduction 
The 
study 
of 
metallic 
ultra-thin 
films 
has 
attracted 
a lot of attention 
in the last few years. 
These 
nearly 
two-dimensional 
systems 
often 
dis- 
play 
novel 
structures 
with 
interesting 
electronic 
and magnetic 
properties. 
Understanding 
the phen- 
omena requires 
a detailed knowledge 
of the growth 
mechanism 
and the role of the interface 
between 
the thin film A and the metallic 
substrate 
B. In 
fact from an energetic 
point 
of view three param- 
eters 
must 
be considered: 
the 
relative 
surface 
tension; 
the relative 
atomic 
size; and the tendency 
of the system 
A-B 
to alloy or demix. 
In certain 
circumstances 
of overlayer 
coverage 
and temper- 
ature range

surface

may form, either in miscible 
or immiscible 
systems 
[ 11. This 
has already 
been 
demonstrated 
for a 
variety 
of systems, 
including 
Pt/Cu( 111) [ 
2,3], 
Pt/Co(lll) 
[4], Ag/Pt(lll) 
[5]. From 
a techno- 
logical point of view the novel electronic 
properties 
of these structures 
have a variety 
of applications 
in catalysis, 
by increasing 
the chemical 
selectivity, 
or magnetism, 
by creating 
high density 
recording 
media. 
Here 
we present 
a study 
of the 
growth 
of 
Pt/Pd( 111). We have chosen 
this system for two 
reasons. 
First 
the 
atomic 
size 
difference 
is 
negligible, 
the lattice 
misfit 
is 0.8%. 
Second 
we 
expect 
the 
film 
growth 
to 
be 
determined 
by 
the 
relative 
surface 
tension 
(yPd 
= 1640 mJ/m’, 
yp,=2030 
mJ/m2) 
[6]. This suggests 
a strong 
Pd 
segregation, 
however, 
the 
bulk 
phase 
diagram 
exhibits 
a solid solution 
over the whole 
concen- 
tration 
range.

Pt and Pd are also well known catalysts. Their 
(111) surfaces have already been widely studied. 
In particular 
carbon 
monoxide 
adsorption 
has 
been studied both theoretically 
and experimen- 
tally [7,8]. 
Real catalysts come in the form of dispersed 
media in order to enhance the reactive surface. 
Nevertheless, an understanding 
of the composition 
and structure 
of a mixed (111) surface is an 
invaluable starting point for predicting the more 
complicated 
behaviour 
of Pt-Pd 
aggregates with 
(111 )-type facets. The reactivity of such aggregates 
can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude 
depending on the surface composition 
[9]. 
We have followed the room temperature growth 
of Pt on Pd( 111) using Auger electron spectro- 
scopy 
(AES) 
and 
core 
level 
photoemission 
spectroscopy (PES) with synchrotron 
radiation. 
2. Experimental 
A clean Pd( 111) surface was obtained by cycles 
of Ar ion sputtering and annealing at 700°C in 
ultra-high 
vacuum 
(UHV), 
at a base pressure 
of 1 x 10-loTorr. 
The main contaminants 
were 
carbon and sulphur. To remove the latter, Ar ion 
sputtering was performed 
at 400°C. When the C 
level was below the detection limit of AES, the 
surface was considered clean [ lo]. A sharp ( 1 x 1) 
LEED pattern was observed with low background. 
Pt deposition was carried out using a Joule effect 
evaporation 
source, with a pure Pt (99.99%) wire. 
During evaporation 
the maximum 
pressure was 
3 x lo-’ Torr. The deposition rate was measured 
using a quartz 
micro-balance 
which gave one 
monolayer 
(ML) in 30 min. Each thin film was 
characterised 
using LEED, AES and PES. AES 
shows no further evaporation-induced 
contamina- 
tion. The experiments 
were performed 
on the 
SA73b beamline with a TGM (600 lines/mm) 7” 
monochromator 
at the SuperACO 
storage ring, 
Orsay, France. The Pt 4f,,, core level (bulk binding 
energy 
71.15 eV) was studied using a photon 
energy hv = 150 eV, and p polarised light. In this 
way we optimise the surface sensitivity and the Pt 
cross-section. The angle resolved detector was set 
for normal 
emission. The overall experimental 
resolution was 0.3 eV. 
3. Results 
Previous AES experiments 
have been carried 
out, see Ref. [ 111, which favour 
interdiffusion 
during the growth, in agreement 
with field ion 
microscope experiments which show alloyed bime- 
tallic aggregate formation at temperatures 
< 250 K 
[ 121. Concerning 
the PES experiments, 
we ini- 
tially studied the effect of CO adsorption 
in the 
valence band region after successive deposits of 
Pt/Pd( 111). The two levels visible are the 50+-x 
and the 40, at 8.2 and 11.2 eV, respectively, 
on 
Pd( 1 
1 
1 
), whereas on Pt( 111) the binding energies 
are 9 and 11.9 eV, respectively [7,8]. Fig. 1 shows 
the evolution of the binding energy of these levels 
as a function 
of Pt coverage. Here we want to 
show on which chemical species, the Pt or the Pd, 
the CO adsorbs. Up to 1 ML there is preferential 
adsorption 
on Pd, between 1 and 2 ML the CO 
levels shift upwards in binding energy, 
>2 ML 
their position corresponds 
to preferential adsorp- 
tion on Pt.

procedure 
described in Ref. [14]. The binding 
energy scale is fured with respect to the Fermi level, 
the spectra are normalised 
with respect to the 
continuous 
background 
at a constant 
kinetic 
energy. On clean bulk Pt( 111) we obtain a bulk 
peak B, at (71.15 k 0.03) eV and a surface peak, 
Se at (70.75kO.03) eV [13,15]. 
Fig. 2 shows the evolution of the binding ener- 
gies of the Pt 4f,,z levels as a function 
of Pt 
coverage. 
We can identify 
two peaks 
during 
growth. Up to 1 ML, the binding energies are 
(70.9 + 0.03) eV, labelled B*, and (70.5 kO.03) eV, 
labelled S*, both are shifted by 250 meV with 
respect to those measured 
on a clean Pt( 111). 
Between 1 and 2 ML these peaks shift upwards to 
higher 
binding 
energies, 
>2 ML 
they 
attain 
the 
same 
positions 
as 
for 
clean 
Pt( ill), 
(71.15+0.03) 
eV and (70.75kO.03) eV. We can 
notice that Figs. 1 and 2 show the same behaviour. 
In order to investigate further the nature of the 
Pt peaks measured 
<2 ML we have studied two 
further 
Pt-Pd 
environments. 
Starting from two 
separate deposits of 2 ML Pt/Pd( 111) we have, on 
the one hand, annealed the system at 325°C and 
on the other 
hand, 
redeposited 
3 ML of Pd, 
thereby creating a Pd/Pt/Pd( 111) sandwich. The 
results of the core level analysis are shown in 
Fig. 3. In each case we observe a clear shift in the

4. Discussion 
For Pt coverages 
< 1 ML the CO adsorption 
results indicate a Pd rich surface layer. The Pt 
4f,,, core level analysis shows that we have a 
mixed Pt-Pd surface layer and underlayer region. 
We may infer that for low Pt coverages the CO 
adsorbs preferentially 
on the Pd surface atoms. 
Between 
1 and 2 ML this situation 
changes. 
Valence band results on CO adsorption show that 
there are more and more Pt atoms at the surface.

The Pt surface and bulk alloy type sites disappear 
and are replaced by surface and bulk sites corre- 
sponding to the clean Pt( 111) surface. This sug- 
gests that there is demixing rather than burial of 
the Pt-Pd interface. At 2 ML we have formed a 
sharp interface. The CO adsorption looks like that 
on a Pt( 111) surface. Above 2 ML Pt/Pd( ill), 
the growth of the Pt overlayer continues. At all 
times we conserve a sharp (1 x 1) LEED pattern. 
We propose the following model for the first 
stages of growth. Up to 1 ML, there is interdiffu- 
sion and the formation 
of a Pt-Pd surface alloy 
extending 
over the first two surface layers. At 
1 ML the intensity of the surface peak corresponds 
to 50% of the intensity 
of the Pt( 111) surface 
peak, indicating that half of the Pt is in the surface 
layer and the rest is in the second layer. Here it is 
the combination of the tendency of Pd to segregate 
and the bulk alloying effect which drive the pro- 
cess. Between 1 and 2 ML the Pt concentration 
increases, and at room temperature 
it is no longer 
possible to establish a surface alloy over several 
layers, we observe a de-alloying effect, giving rise, 
at 2 ML, to a pure Pt overlayer. The intensity of 
the surface peak is the same as that observed of 
the clean Pt(ll1) 
surface. Subsequent Pt growth 
does not change the Pt-Pd interface. 
Further evidence to support this model comes 
from the annealing of 2 ML Pt/Pd( 111). Within 
the sensitivity of the core level spectra we find the 
same mixed Pt-Pd sites, now over several atomic 
layers. We remark that this implies interdiffusion 
over several atomic layers and is therefore unlikely 
to be due to a surface exchange mechanism. Rather 
this suggests that the compound 
formed during 
the first stages of growth is indeed a surface alloy. 
Using Miedema’s formalism 
[ 161 for core level 
alloy shifts based on the Born-Haber 
cycle we 
expect a shift of 0.2 eV towards lower binding 
energy for a dilute Pt alloy. This is at least qualita- 
tively in agreement with the experimental results. 
Finally the important role of the Pt-Pd interface 
is illustrated by the Pd/Pt/Pd( 111) sandwich. Here 
we introduce 
a second Pt-Pd 
interface into the 
system, re-establishing 
the mixed Pt-Pd environ- 
ment, this time over at least 4 ML. 
Core level analysis of reference 
alloys is in 
progress 
to confirm 
the nature 
of the Pt-Pd 
interface. 
5. Conclusions 
We have studied the first stages of room temper- 
ature growth of Pt/Pd( 111) using AES and syn- 
chrotron 
radiation 
PES. Up to 1 ML growth 
proceeds as a surface alloy, extending over the first 
two surface layers. At 1 ML Pt the surface alloy 
composition 
is close to Pt5&Pd50. The system 
demixes between 1 and 2 ML Pt, to form a pure 
Pt overlayer. 
Annealing 
2 ML Pt/Pd( 111) and 
Pd/Pt/Pd( 111) sandwich formation extends the Pt 
coverage range over which surface alloy formation 
is possible. The role of the Pt-Pd interface, despite 
the negligible size difference, is crucial.
