Step-edge segregation of bimetallic alloys: A LEIS study of Pt25Rh75(4 1 0)
Abstract
We demonstrate that low energy ion scattering can be used to study the step-edge composition on vicinal single crystal surfaces. Employing the shadowing and focusing effects inherent to ion scattering, it is possible to perform site-specific composition measurements on single crystal surfaces over a wide temperature range. By combining these measurements with ion trajectory simulations we have extracted quantitative information concerning the step-edge composition. This technique has been applied to the Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) surface in the temperature range between 400°C and 700°C. The experiments reveal a much stronger Pt enrichment of the step edges than at the terrace sites. This difference between the step-edge composition and the terrace site composition is significantly larger than predicted by simple segregation models based on bond breaking.
1. Introduction and method
Vicinal surfaces of metal single crystals can display a distinctly different behaviour compared to their “flat” counterparts. Among the properties influenced by steps and other surface defects are adsorption
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
reactivity
[4]
, catalytic activity
[5]
and the work function of the surface
[6]
. For stepped surfaces of alloys an additional complication arises due to the fact that the step-edge composition of an alloy will in general differ from both the average surface composition and the bulk composition as a result of the lower coordination of the step-edge atoms. In order to understand the difference in properties between flat and stepped alloy surfaces, it is therefore necessary to know the composition of the surface and the step edges. A comparative study of the bulk composition, the average surface and the step-edge composition also gives more insight into the fundamentals of segregation itself.
Until now, few experimental studies on the step-edge composition of bimetallic alloys have been reported. This is because most surface science techniques are not suitable for site-selective quantitative composition measurements. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is one of the few techniques which is able to get site-selective quantitative information. STM has been used to show that the step edge of a Pt50Rh50(1 0 0) surface consists almost exclusively of Pt
[7]
. However, besides the fact that an additional surface science technique is required to interpret the results, it also cannot be used at the high temperatures which are often needed to reach equilibrium. STM results are also hard to interpret if there are more than two species involved. Low energy ion scattering (LEIS) is capable of providing quantitative information on the composition and structure of surfaces
[8]
,
[9]
.
In previous segregation studies on alloys, LEIS was mostly used to determine the composition of the outermost layer, averaged over all sites present. Experiments where LEIS was used to measure the surface composition of PtRh samples have been presented by for example Platzgummer et al. on Pt25Rh75(1 0 0) and Pt25Rh75(1 1 1)
[10]
and by Beck et al. on Pt10Rh90(1 0 0)
[11]
. By exploiting the shadowing and focusing effects inherent in LEIS, the ion intensity may be focused at specific sites in the surface, thereby restricting the backscattered signal to particles that have collided with atoms residing at this specific site exclusively. In principle, such methods have been used before with time of flight (TOF) LEIS to extract layer by layer composition profiles
[12]
. In this paper we take this idea one step further by using focusing effects to distinguish step-edge sites from terrace sites, which enables us to measure the temperature-dependent composition of step edges for the first time.
The experiments were performed on a vicinal Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) surface which was found to have double atomic height steps. A schematic picture of this surface is given in
Fig. 1
. We will use the term step edge for the atoms that have six missing nearest neighbours (solid black atoms in
Fig. 1
). A terrace atom is defined by three to five missing nearest neighbours (striped atoms in
Fig. 1
). The latter definition has been chosen to include all surface atoms as either step edge or terrace atoms, although most of the terrace atoms have four missing neighbours. The surface composition therefore represents the average composition of all step edge and terrace atoms together.

PtRh was selected because it is an interesting alloy for catalysis. Many automotive three-way catalyst formulations are based on Pt and Rh and it has been found that alloy formation takes place during operation of the catalyst. In addition, the PtRh alloy is not chemically ordered and the low-index surfaces show incomplete segregation of Pt
[13]
,
[14]
. This allows a stronger segregation at the stepped surfaces, as has already been indicated by STM measurements performed at room temperature
[7]
. The (4 1 0) surface was selected because of its interesting catalytic properties
[18]
,
[19]
. In particular, the (4 1 0) surface of pure Pt has been reported to exhibit an unusually high dissociation activity with respect to NO and CO
[15]
,
[16]
. It was suggested that on the Pt(4 1 0) surface the NO dissociation reaction is symmetry allowed according to the Woodward–Hoffmann rules
[15]
,
[17]
. The behaviour of the PtRh(4 1 0) surface with respect to adsorption and dissociation will be dependent on the step-edge composition
[18]
. A clear comparison between various surfaces of Pt, Rh and PtRh, showing this dependence is presented in Ref.
[19]
. Therefore it is especially interesting to link the observed step-edge composition to the catalytic activity of the surface.
1.1. Method
In
Fig. 2
we illustrate the principle of site-selective composition measurements of step edges in the case of vicinal single crystal surfaces. In this figure we show two dimensional ion trajectory simulations on a (4 1 0) surface with double atomic height steps, at four different angles of incidence. Here we will focus on the use of TOF on this specific surface, in
Section 5
we will discuss the use of TOF for step-edge measurements on other surfaces. In
Fig. 2a
an extremely grazing angle of incidence is chosen. This causes the terrace atoms to be inside the shadow cone of the step-edge atoms. This is a general occurring phenomena with glancing incident ion beams, where a large number of small-angle deflections causes the surface to act like a mirror to the incoming ion beam. In the chosen (near 180°) backscattering geometry of our experiments this will results in a very low yield.

Fig. 2. Ion trajectory simulations at different angles of incidence illustrating the shadowing and focusing effects. (a) α=5°. No backscattering possible, (b) α=8° focusing on the step-edge atoms, all other atoms in the shadow cone, (c) α=30° probing the surface composition since all deeper layer atoms are in the shadow cone of the surface atoms, (d) α=50° unfocused yield from the surface atoms and focusing on the deeper layers. Main signal resulting from the second layer.
At the edge of the shadow cone there is a region of increased ion density which can be focused on the step-edge atoms by increasing the angle of incidence (
Fig. 2b
). Ions which backscatter in this geometry into the detector will originate from collisions with step-edge atoms, resulting in a spectrum which effectively represents the mass spectrum of the step-edge sites. Due to the focusing, the scattered yield is larger than for an unfocused beam. This ensures that a good signal may still be obtained, even when only a small fraction of atoms occupies the step-edge sites. In a graph of the backscattered yield as a function of the angle of incidence, this focusing event may be recognized as the first peak or shoulder in the observed intensity. Considering the size of the shadow cone and the distance between the step-edge atoms, it is expected that the atoms which are indicated by an asterisk in
Fig. 1
will also contribute to the backscattered signal. The exact amount of this contribution was determined by ion scattering simulations, as will be discussed in
Section 3
.
Upon increasing the angle of incidence further, the focusing on step-edge atoms disappears and ions may also scatter from atoms at terrace sites. The next maximum in yield will thus occur when the step-edge atoms focus the ions on the subsequent atoms in the terrace (not shown in
Fig. 2
). The required angle of incidence is nearly equal to the angle of incidence which would lead to neighbour on neighbour focusing in the case of a low index PtRh crystal.
The average surface composition of a (4 1 0) crystal can be measured at an angle of incidence of about 30° (45° minus the miscut angle with respect to the [1 0 0]), as shown in
Fig. 1c
. Note that even in this geometry still not all terrace atoms are visible to the ion beam, as would have been the case in the step-up direction. However, the measured average surface composition in this geometry will be closer to the average surface composition as measured with an electrostatic analyzer at normal incidence due to neutralization effects, which will be used for calibration purposes. Thus, from the dependence of the Pt and Rh backscattered signal on the angle of incidence, we may directly derive the composition of the step-edge sites and the terrace sites.
Increasing the angle of incidence even further, as shown in
Fig. 1d
, leads to focusing of the ion beam on the deeper layers. The yield in this situation is caused by a combination of unfocused scattering from the first layer and focused scattering from the second and third atomic layer. The composition of the second layer can be roughly estimated if we assume that the third layer’s composition will be close to the bulk composition and the second layer will be the major contributor to the signal. The latter assumption is based on the fact that blocking effects will become increasingly important for ions that return from deeper layers due to the lower average energy of the returning particles (larger blocking cone) and the larger number of blocking atoms.
For a quantitative interpretation, a calibration of the relative detection sensitivity for scattered Ne+ ions from Pt and Rh is necessary. The difference in sensitivity is caused by the difference in cross-section for scattering from Pt and Rh and by the energy dependent detection efficiency of the channel plates in the TOF analyzer. We have calibrated the sensitivity of the TOF by comparing the results with those obtained using an electrostatic analyzer. This indirect calibration was chosen because the absolute signal in a TOF experiment is strongly dependent on the scattering geometry. This is not the case for the electrostatic analyzer, which may thus be calibrated in a straightforward manner using Pt and Rh single crystal reference samples. In addition, the experiments with the electrostatic analyzer directly yield the temperature dependent composition of the outermost layer.
2. Experimental
The present experiments were performed using a newly constructed (near) 180° backscattering TOF setup. The primary ion beam is aimed at the sample through a hole in the center of the detector which will accept particles with a total scattering angle between 177.0° and 179.5°. One of the main advantages of near-180° backscattering is that any site can be probed which is directly “visible” to the ion beam
[20]
. The backscattering TOF detector is attached to the energy and angle resolved ion scattering spectrometer (EARISS) setup
[21]
. The EARISS consists of a 145° backscattering LEIS setup with a special two dimensional electrostatic analyzer/detector. Also attached are a 35° TOF scattering and recoiling spectrometer (TOF–SARS) and a standard low energy electron diffraction (LEED) instrument. The setup is equipped with a separate ion gun for sputter cleaning.
The sample is placed in a manipulator which has six degrees of freedom for positioning the sample with respect to the ion beam and the detector. The sample can be heated both radiatively and by electron beam bombardment using a filament positioned behind the sample. The temperature of the sample is measured with a CHINO comet 1000 pyrometer with an absolute accuracy of ±50°C and a reproducibility within ±10°C. The lower limit of the temperature range is 400°C and therefore no measurements have been done between room temperature (RT) and 400°C.
The crystal was mounted on a Ti sample holder and covered at the edges by a Ti foil to screen the sides of the sample from the ion beam at grazing angles of incidence. Initially the sample was cleaned by cycles of 2 keV Ar+ sputtering at RT and flashing to 1050°C. After each cycle the surface quality was inspected with LEED and TOF–SARS in different azimuthal directions. The cleaning procedure was continued until the LEED showed sharp spots corresponding to an unreconstructed fcc(4 1 0) surface and a low diffuse background, indicating a well-ordered surface, and until the impurity related peaks in the TOF-SARS spectra were below the detection limit. Based on the large differential scattering cross-section for recoiling to an angle of 35° of light elements like oxygen and carbon (12 Å2/sr for carbon and 7 Å2/sr for oxygen as compared to 0.7 Å2/sr for scattering of Pt and Rh), the level of contaminants is estimated to be less than 0.01 ML.
The LEED pattern of the clean surface corresponded to a unreconstructed (4 1 0) surface, and from the energy dependence of the width of the (0,0) spot it was concluded that Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) has double atomic height steps (see e.g. Ref.
[22]
for interpretation of LEED measurements of stepped surfaces). In general, double height steps can be expected when the step distance becomes very small. In the case of the pure Pt(4 1 0) surface, faceting occurs instead of the formation of double height steps, which was not observed for our PtRh(4 1 0) surface.
Prior to each measurement, the sample was cleaned. After flashing, the sample was held at the desired temperature to reach equilibrium. The time during which the sample was allowed to reach equilibrium ranged between 15 s for temperatures above 950°C and 45 min at RT. The backscattering TOF spectra were taken in the so-called step-down geometry with the projection of the primary ion beam onto the surface along the [0 1 0] direction. The EARISS experiments use a normal incidence of the ion beam with respect to the surface, see e.g. Ref.
[24]
for details.
3. Segregation measurements
3.1. TOF experiments
The backscattering TOF spectra were taken with 4 keV Ne+ which ensures a good mass separation between Pt and Rh in combination with a high detector efficiency and a wide shadow cone. The step-down geometry, which has been used during these measurements, is favorable in the case of Pt25Rh75(4 1 0). In the more general case of crystals with mono-atomic height steps or longer terraces, the step-up geometry would be favorable. The backscattered yield in the single-collision peak from Pt and Rh has been recorded as a function of angle of incidence at three different temperatures.
Fig. 3
shows the Pt (solid line) and Rh signals (dashed line) as a function of the angle of incidence at 400°C. The shoulder in the Pt and Rh signals at an angle of incidence of α=8° (see also
Fig. 2b
) is caused by step-on-step focusing, and is consistent with the results from ion trajectory simulations using MATCH
[23]
which are shown in
Fig. 4
and discussed in more detail below. The simulations have been performed for incidence angles between 3° and 60°. To simulate the finite width of the TOF detector the shown results are an weighted average of the simulation results. The maximum at α=18° is caused by focusing of the ions on the terrace atoms. Between α=20° and α=40° there is an unfocused mode (see also
Fig. 2c
). Between these angles the average surface composition is probed since the atoms at the surface receive the same ion flux. The next focusing occurs at an angle of incidence of α=50° on atoms in the second and deeper layers (see also
Fig. 2d
). The triangles in
Fig. 3
represent the Pt over Rh signal ratio as observed experimentally. From this ratio (axis indicated on the right-hand side of
Fig. 3
) we may directly obtain an indication of the composition of the various sites with respect to each other. At grazing angles of incidence, where the step-edge composition is measured, the Pt over Rh ratio is much larger than between α=20° and α=40° where the surface composition is probed. This shows that the Pt concentration at the step edges is significantly larger than on the terrace. The observed Pt/Rh ratio is much lower at α=50° and so we can immediately conclude that the second layer is strongly depleted in Pt with respect to the surface. To obtain quantitative values for the composition at various sites, we calibrated the sensitivity for Pt with respect to Rh by comparison of the average surface composition measurements with experiments using the EARISS analyzer, (see
Section 3.2
).

3.2. EARISS experiments
The surface composition has been measured as a function of the temperature with the EARISS using 3 keV Ne+ ions. The ion dose was limited to less than 1012 ions/cm2 per spectrum to minimize the radiation damage. The sensitivity factors for Pt and Rh for the EARISS were obtained by using clean and well-ordered Pt(1 1 1) and Rh(1 0 0) single crystals as reference samples. The ability of the EARISS to measure the azimuthal dependence of the scattered signal has been used to determine the contribution of the second atomic layer to the total yield. Discrimination between particles returning from the first and second atomic layer is possible since the first layer will yield an azimuthal independent contribution whereas the second layer yields a azimuth dependent signal
[24]
. From the measurement shown in
Fig. 5
, and method described above, the contribution of the second layer was found to be only 4% of the total scattered yield. Because of this minor influence, the second layer contribution has been neglected for the interpretation of the EARISS measurements. The accuracy of an EARISS measurement is about ±4% of which ±2% is due to the calibration accuracy. After sputtering at RT, the Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) surface composition was nearly equal to the bulk composition (27% Pt). In
Fig. 6
the Pt surface concentration is plotted as a function of temperature. For these experiments the sample was kept at the chosen temperature during the measurement (after flashing and equilibration). The Pt enrichment decreases with increasing temperature, indicating that Pt has a lower surface energy than Rh over the chosen temperature range. The concentration measured at room temperature clearly does not correspond to an equilibrium situation, since a far larger Pt concentration would have been expected given the results between 400°C and 1000°C. Instead, the surface state is “frozen” during cooling down to room temperature from 1050°C after the flash. This further illustrates the need to perform these kind of measurements at the equilibrium temperature and not to rely on quenching after equilibration. The measured Pt segregation to the surface is in agreement with the generally observed Pt enrichment of PtRh alloys
[25]
,
[26]
and not with the Rh enrichment as observed on Pt90Rh10 by atom probe field ion microscopy
[27]
. As stated before
[10]
, the observed Rh segregation in the latter experiment may be due to oxygen contamination on the surface which is known to reverse the segregation behaviour on PtRh
[31]
. Compared to the results from Platzgummer et al. on a Pt25Rh75(1 0 0)
[10]
we found a smaller Pt segregation to the surface (80% Pt versus 55% at 400°C, smaller differences at higher temperatures). This difference cannot be contributed to segregation inhibiting elements like carbon since the surface has been routinely checked and found to be contaminant-free with TOF-SARS after sputter–flash cycles, whereas the temperature during the measurements was kept at or below the flashing temperature. The difference in composition for the high temperature measurements can be explained by the accuracy of the composition and temperature measurements. The difference in composition at lower temperatures (400°C and below) is probably caused by kinetics. If the surface of the Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) “freezes” at a temperature above of its (1 0 0) counterpart, the final Pt concentration at the surface will be smaller. The results are within experimental accuracy if a difference of 100°C in this freezing temperature is assumed. Furthermore it is also possible that the bulk composition of the two samples is somewhat different. Due to the large segregation, this has a pronounced effect on the differences in the surface composition. For each percent difference of Pt in the bulk, the surface composition differs by 2.5%. Similar behaviour would be observed in the case of Pt depletion in the surface region due to the endured sputtering of our sample at elevated temperature. These above described effects might also explain the difference in the measured surface composition after sputtering between our experiments (27% Pt) and the surface composition after sputtering as found by Platzgummer et al.
[10]
(35% Pt). Other causes can be the chosen sputter energy (2000 eV in our experiments versus 500 eV) and/or angle of incidence (20° versus 45°), as is the case for example CuPd alloys where the surface composition after sputtering deviates stronger from the bulk values at lower sputter energies
[28]
. The results from Ref.
[29]
, who measured 11% Pt after sputtering a Pt10Rh90(1 1 1) crystal, also seem to indicate insignificant preferential sputtering at higher primary energies. The experimentally found small deviation from the bulk composition after sputtering is also in agreement with tabulated values for the Pt and Rh sputter efficiency’s of 1.4 versus 1.3 for 500 eV Ar+
[30]
and 1.56 versus 1.46 for 600 eV Ar+

The dotted/dashed curve represents the calculated composition of the step-edge sites according to the ideal/regular solution broken bond model as described in the text. The error bars on the first points show the accuracy including the calibration accuracy, the subsequent error bars show the accuracy without the calibration accuracy.
3.3. Step-edge composition
The combination of the surface measurements with the EARISS and the backscattering TOF between an angle of incidence of 20° and 30° allows a calibration of the TOF results, since both measure the concentration at the same sites (
Fig. 1c
). The accuracy of the EARISS measurements (±4%) is thus included in the calibration of the TOF, resulting in an accuracy of about ±10% in the determination of the step-edge composition. By comparing the TOF and EARISS results, the relative sensitivity factors for Pt and Rh have been calculated and used to quantify the results of the step-edge measurements. The 2.2 times higher sensitivity for Pt with respect to Rh is close to the expected value of 2.5 based on the larger scattering cross-section (1.7) and the larger detector sensitivity caused by the higher final energy (1.5). The step-edge measurements were typically performed with an ion-beam current of 0.1 pA and a measurement time of 300 s, resulting in a maximum dose of about 5×10−11 ions/cm2. No influence of radiation damage on the measurements is thus expected, even if every ion would selectively cause damage to a step-edge site.
From
Fig. 2
it was already concluded that at small angles of incidence not only the step-edge atoms will contribute to the backscattered yield, but also the atoms in between (indicated by the arrow and asterisk in
Fig. 1
). Ion trajectory simulations with the computer code MATCH
[23]
were performed to determine the ratio between the terrace and the step-edge yield. MATCH calculates three dimensional trajectories for ions that start with the primary energy at the ion source, for which the energy decreases with subsequent collisions, and for ions that start with the desired final energy at the detector for which the energy increases after each collision. The ion–atom interaction is treated in the binary collision approximation (BCA: subsequent collisions are treated as two body events) with a screened Coulomb potential (Ziegler/Biersack/Wittmark). The program ties the sets of saved trajectories together if they meet requirements regarding their crossing distance, impact-parameter, collision partner and energy. The chance of a calculated collision to occur is determined from the chance of finding an atom at the collision site, based on its thermal vibrations. Although the amplitude of the thermal vibrations at the surface will be probably larger than in the bulk, we have chosen a fixed amplitude of 0.1 Å for all atoms. The main effect of increasing the amplitude of the terrace/step atoms will be a change in ratio between the yield from the different sites. The composition information as extracted from these sites will not change, however. The main advantage over full three-dimensional trajectory calculations is the larger efficiency, and thus shorter simulation time. The crystal surface for the simulations is build up from a slab with periodical boundary conditions in the lateral direction. The number of atoms in a slab cannot be chosen arbitrarily large due to computing limitations. Therefore there can be only a limited number of unit cells present in a slab. The repeating unit cell of a stepped surface will be large which causes discrete values for the step-edge composition in the simulations. However, the chance that a certain atom is present at the step edge can be chosen at will. For the Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) surface we used a slab of 4 4 0 atoms, with 22 atoms in each unit cell. This means that the Pt concentration at the step edge can be varied by a multiple of 5% in our simulations. Averaging measurements to get arbitrary step-edge concentrations is feasible, but not necessary. It was assumed that the Pt concentration at the step edge could influence the screening of the terrace atoms, since the shadow cone of Pt atoms is larger than that of Rh atoms. To quantify this effect, simulations have been done with different Pt step-edge concentrations. At each chosen step-edge composition, the terrace composition was varied and the resulting backscattered yield was fitted according to:
Here S represents the fraction of the backscattered signal which originates from the step edges. From the results it was found that S=0.60, independent from the Pt concentration at the step edge. This value indicates that the atoms between the step-edge atoms are lightly shielded by the step-edge atoms (no shielding would give S=0.5) which is also the reason that the Pt concentration has no major influence. The shielding factor of S=0.6 has been used to correct the step-edge concentration as measured with the backscattering TOF. The validity of this approach was independently checked by measurements with the ion beam along the [0 1 
] direction (see
Fig. 1
) which positions all terrace atoms in the shadow cones of the step-edge atoms. In this case all signal originates from the steps without need for correction. We have performed this measurement at one temperature and the resulting concentration is in good agreement with the corrected results from the measurements along the [0 1 0] direction. The step-edge concentration as a function of temperature has been plotted in
Fig. 6
, the measurements in the step-down geometry are depicted as diamonds and the measurement along the
direction is indicated by an open square.
Clearly, the step edge is much stronger enriched in Pt than the terrace. A similar behavior has already been observed at the step edges of a Pt50Rh50(1 0 0) crystal with STM at RT
[7]
.
4. Discussion
4.1. Step-edge composition measurements with TOF
In the present experiment a step-on-step focusing was used because of the large vicinal angle of the sample. The backscattering TOF measurements would therefore suffer from variations in the step distance originating from for example step roughening or a miscut angle with respect to the (4 1 0) plane. However, the shoulder/maximum in the Pt and Rh signals at an angle of incidence of 8° in
Fig. 3
would not occur in that case. The maximum in the measurements for the step-edge focusing is less pronounced than for the simulations as can be seen in
Fig. 4
. This is probably due to the screening from the sample by the Ta cover at the sides or by the manipulator. Especially at small angles of incidence α the influence of any side-screening effect will be large since the obscured area is equal to the screening area divided by
. This effect is not important for the quantitative interpretation of the measurement since only the absolute signal is affected. The measurements still clearly show three peaks which can be assigned to the corresponding peaks from the simulations, so the determination of the step-edge composition is still valid.
If any irregularity in step spacing occurs, the experimental value for the step-edge composition will be closer to the average surface composition since the ion beam will also be focused on the terrace sites instead of on the step edge. The experimentally found stronger Pt segregation to the step edges, as compared to the surface composition thus represents a lower limit.
4.2. Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) step-edge and surface composition
Our temperature dependent measurements on Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) show a Pt enrichment which is in agreement with previous results on (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) surfaces of PtRh alloys as have been studied by several groups with various techniques including AES, ISS, atom probe FIM and STM. Calculations of Schoeb et al.
[39]
and Legrand and Treglia
[32]
show that the experimentally found Pt surface enrichment in those experiments can be understood on the basis of the difference in surface energy. Since we are particularly interested in segregation to different coordination sites, we will fit the measurements by calculating the composition of the terrace and the step edges on the basis of bond energies. If only entropy changes due to mixing are considered, then the relation between the bulk composition Xb and the composition Xφ of a phase φ at a temperature T is given by:
(1)
The segregation energy, ΔGseg=μPt0B−μ0φPt−μ0BRh+μ0φRh, is the difference in the standard chemical potential μ and can be seen as the energy gained or required to interchange an atom from one species from phase φ (bulk, surface, step) with an atom of the other species from the bulk. For flat surfaces, the segregation energy is often expressed in terms of a difference in surface energy Δγ times the specific surface area a
[33]
,
[34]
. Equations like
Eq. (1)
have been formulated on the basis of thermodynamics only (see e.g. Ref.
[35]
) under the assumption of two phases (bulk and surface), with random mixing of the species in each phase. However, it holds true for any phase in a binary alloy with an arbitrary number of phases, as long as the number of atoms in each phase is constant. In the broken bond model, the difference in the standard chemical potential can be found by counting the number of bonds between the phases. For an alloy with m phases, the difference in standard chemical potential for phase j equals:
(2)
The regular solution parameter,
, with ϵPtRh the Pt–Rh bond energy, indicates whether Pt and Rh tend to mix
or will tend to form separate Pt and Rh clusters
. The difference in Pt–Pt and Rh–Rh bond energy is Δϵ=ϵPtPt−ϵRhRh. Zij is the number of bonds per atom from phase j to phase i. Zij can thus be a fractional number and will be less or equal to the total number of bonds per atom, which is Z=12 for an fcc when only nearest neighbours are considered. The first term will account for any missing neighbours of phase j with respect to the bulk, whereas the second term accounts for any energy changes due to mixing in an non-ideal solution. In this paper we will use three phases: bulk (b), terrace (t) and steps (s). As an example, counting the number of bonds for the steps is carried out in detail (see
Fig. 1
):
Each unit cell consists of one step-edge atom, seven terrace atoms and N bulk atoms. The total number of bonds from the step edge to the terrace is three as is the number of bonds to the bulk. So for one step-edge atom the number of bonds is: Zss=0, Zst=3, Zsb=3. In the same way the number of bonds for the terrace atoms and the bulk can be counted. The results are given in
Table 1
.

The composition at the step edge and terrace can now be calculated from
Eq. (1)
by recursive approximation. The difference in bond energies Δϵ and the regular solution parameter
are taken as the free parameters in the fit of the measured surface composition. The measured surface composition as a function of temperature, at a certain combination of Δϵ and
, is calculated from
since there is one step-edge atom per eight atoms at the surface. Of these eight atoms, two terrace atoms will only be partly visible to the electrostatic analyzer due to blocking. The 50% blocking of returning ions is estimated since neutralization of the returning ions by the step-edge atoms is involved rather than physical blocking.
The fit of the surface composition is given in
Fig. 6
as the thin solid curve. There is excellent agreement between the measured and calculated surface composition for Δϵ=2.1 kJ/mol and
kJ/mol. The surface composition for an ideal solution
has also been plotted in
Fig. 6
as the thick solid line, in this case the best fit is found for Δϵ=3.1 kJ/mol. The latter value equals a difference in surface energy of Δγ=ΔGseg/a=0.14 J/m2. This compares reasonably well to the difference in surface energies at 0 K, ΔγPtRh0=0.2 J/m2

considering the accuracy and the temperature dependence of the surface free energy.
For many alloys it is possible to estimate the bond energies from the heat of sublimation, which can be considered as the breaking of all bonds. However, this is not the case for Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) since Rh has a larger heat of sublimation which would result in a negative value for Δϵ
[37]
. It was already mentioned by others
[27]
that, based solely on the sublimation energy of Pt and Rh, Rh segregation would be expected instead of the generally observed Pt segregation.
The calculated Pt concentration at the step edges has been plotted in
Fig. 6
as the dotted (ideal solution) and dashed (regular solution) curves. We find that the Pt segregation to the step edges is much larger than expected based on the ideal solution model. The step-edge composition as calculated according to the regular solution predicts the step-edge composition much better, but the positive value of
would tend to favor a phase separation of the Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) surface. The composition of the second layer would therefore be slightly Pt enriched. This is in contradiction with the currently observed second layer Rh enrichment in our experiments as well as previous reports where a sandwich-like Pt–Rh–Pt enrichment was found that continues with a decreasing amplitude for successive atomic layers around the Pt bulk concentration
[38]
. For this a negative heat of mixing, or
, is required. The sandwich structure might help to stabilize the double atomic height steps of Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) since the third (Pt enriched) layer will be the surface of the lower terrace which is also Pt enriched. One paper
[10]
shows Pt enrichment of the surface and Rh enrichment for all the deeper layers with a decreasing magnitude for Pt25Rh75(1 0 0) (no alternating layers). This behaviour is attributed to a local equilibrium, where the exchange of atoms only occurs in the first atomic layers, and these layers are thus depleted in the segregation element. As discussed above, the broken bond model is unable to reproduce this kind of behaviour since a equilibrium is assumed over all atomic layers. As a result, there will be either alternating layers
or all surface layers will be enriched in the same element
that has the lowest surface energy. Since the results of a non-equilibrium model depend strongly on the number of atomic layers that are in equilibrium, and we have only the experiments of Ref.
[10]
as an indication for this number, we choose not to present such a model here. Instead, we tried to improve the broken bond model by using bond energies that depend on the coordination of the atom. The bond energies vary due to the relaxation of atoms at the surface and the steps. An atom with a larger number of broken bonds, or a lower coordination, will bond stronger to the remaining neighbours. This effect will thus be especially important for the step-edge atoms. This idea has been introduced by Schoeb et al.
[39]
as the surface modified pair potential model. Their calculations on PtRh clusters of 201 atoms showed Pt segregation to the steps. A bulk concentration of 25% Pt would yield 60% Pt at the step edges at 700°C, which is less pronounced than found by our experiments. However, with only 201 atoms in a cluster, the bulk concentration will vary significantly during segregation to the surface.
A coordination dependent bond energy can simply be implemented by adjusting
Eq. (2)
accordingly. As a first estimate, the bond energies of the bulk and surface atoms are kept equal and the bond energy of the step-edge atoms is allowed to vary. The best results are obtained when the bond energy at the step edges is 70% larger than for the bulk, Δϵ=3.4 kJ/mol and
kJ/mol.
Fig. 7
shows the composition of the step edge, terrace and second layer as a function of temperature as calculated with the values above. The experimental and calculated values are now in good agreement, although the factor 1.7 difference in bond energy of the step edge and the terrace atoms seems rather large.

5. Conclusions
For the first time TOF has been used to measure the step-edge composition of an alloy as a function of temperature. As expected, the segregation of Pt to the step edges is stronger than the segregation to the terrace. The measured Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) surface composition can be explained very well within the ideal solution (Langmuir–McLean) broken bond model with a difference in bond energy of 3.1 kJ/mol (0.14 J/m2). However, in order to explain the measured Rh enrichment of the second layer and step-edge composition, a regular solution model has to be used with a coordination dependent bond energy. The best fit is obtained for a 70% larger bonding at the step edges compared to the surface, a difference in bond energy of Δϵ=3.4 kJ/mol and a regular solution parameter of
kJ/mol. A factor of 1.7 between the difference in bond energy at the step edges and the bulk seems rather large, although the prediction of the step-edge composition above 400°C is in good agreement with the few obtained experimentally values. Previous corrected effective medium calculations
[32]
yield a factor of 1.4 between the bond energies of step edge and terrace atoms.
Although the technique for the current paper has been applied on a vicinal surface with a relative large number of step edges, we think that it can be used on most flat crystal surfaces. In the general case the backscattering TOF will be used in a non-focused mode in which the terrace sites are shadowed by a large number of small angle deviations of the primary particles. The ions will then skim over the terrace atoms until they hit a step edge which causes them to return to the detector. The loss of signal due to the lower number of step edges and the loss of the focusing effect can be partially made up for by choosing a larger primary energy, thereby increasing the detector efficiency. This is possible since the exact shape of the shadow cone will be less important if a non-focused mode is used.
