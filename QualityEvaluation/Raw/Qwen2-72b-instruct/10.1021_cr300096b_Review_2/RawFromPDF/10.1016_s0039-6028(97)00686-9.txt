Abstract 
Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and ultraviolet photelectron spectroscopy (UPS) 
were used to study the thermal evolution of the structure of cobalt ultrathin films on a Pt(111) surface at different coverages. The 
phase diagram of surface structures was obtained from LEED observation. Several structural phases of this system were observed, 
i.e. pseudo-(1 x 1 
), incoherent epitaxy, extra p(2 x 2), rotational incoherent epitaxy, and alloying (1 x 1) structures. The coverage 
and temperature ranges were examined for each structure. Alloy formation was verified by AES. The changes in valence-band 
structures during phase transitions were studied by UPS. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction 
Ultrathin films, sandwiches, multilayers and 
alloys of the Co-Pt system are especially interes- 
ting because of their particular magnetic proper- 
ties. This system has a perpendicular easy axis of 
magnetization, high coercivity, low Curie temper- 
ature and large magneto-optical Kerr signal [ 1-4]. 
Recently, ordered Co and Pt alloys such as 
CosPt, CoPt and CoPts were investigated [5,6]. 
Therefore, a basic understanding of the interfacial 
properties of Co/Pt ultrathin heteroexpitaxial films 
is of both fundamental and practical importance. 
In this paper, we present LEED, AES and UPS 
studies of the Co/Pt(111) system at different cover- 
ages after annealing. The phase diagram obtained

from LEED is shown, and the corresponding 
ultraviolet photoelectron spectra are presented. 
2. Experiment 
The substrate was a Pt(111) single-crystal disk 
from the ESPI Corporation. The orientation of 
the surface was verified to be within 0.5 ° by X-ray 
reflection. The sample temperature could be raised 
to a maximum of 1170 K by thermal heating using 
a tungsten wire and reduced to a minumum of 
120 K minimum by liquid-nitrogen cooling. The 
temperature of the crystal surface was measured 
by a K-type thermocouple. 
All experiments were conducted in a stainless- 
steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber described 
in detail elsewhere [7,8]. The residual pressure of 
the UHV chamber was in the 10-1°Torr range. 
The pressure was measured by an ion gauge and 
314

checked by a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The 
UHV chamber was equipped with AES, four-grid 
video LEED, UPS and a CLAM-2 hemispherical 
electron energy analyzer (VG Microtech). 
The Pt(111) substrate was cleaned by cycles of 
argon-ion 
bombardment 
and 
annealing. 
To 
remove the residual carbon, the sample was heated 
to 880 K in an oxygen environment at a pressure 
of 5 x 10 -7 Torr for about 3 min before sputtering. 
The annealing temperature reached was 1100 K. 
The sputter-anneal cycles were continued until a 
well-ordered p(1 x 1) LEED pattern with bright, 
sharp LEED spots and a low background were 
observed. Chemical impurities on the surface were 
checked by AES. 
A cobalt wire coil was used to evaporate Co 
atoms. The purity of the cobalt wire was 99.997%. 
The background pressure increased to about 
1 x 10 .9 Torr during Co dosing. Deposition of Co 
was characterized by AES, LEED and a thickness 
monitor. Co was evaporated slowly with a depos- 
ition rate of about 1 monolayer (ML) of Co 
per 840 s. 
3. Results and discussion 
LEED was used to study the structural evolution 
of Co/Pt(111) at different temperatures for each 
coverage. The corresponding schematic pictures of 
LEED patterns are shown in Fig. 1. The incident 
energy of the electrons was 56eV. The Pt(lll) 
(1 x 1 
) LEED spots form a hexagonal lattice which 
is reproduced in gray lines as a scale reference. 
Solid circles indicate diffraction spots and open 
circles around the primary diffraction spots repre- 
sent qualitatively the relative amount of diffuse 
LEED background: the larger the circle, the 
stronger the background. Here, we use the same 
representation as Barnard [9]. LEED spots were 
observed after annealing for 4 min and cooling to 
near room temperature. 
When Co atoms are deposited on the Pt(lll) 
surface for coverages between 0.2 and 0.6 ML at 
140 K, the (1 x 1) LEED spots diffuse slightly, as 
shown in Fig. l a. The background of the LEED 
pattern decreases as the temperature increases. It 
becomes a sharp ( 1 x 1 
) LEED pattern after annea- 
ling at 850 K, as illustrated in Fig. lb. The diffuse 
(1 x 1) LEED pattern at low temperatures indi- 
cates a pseudo-(1 x 1) structure of the Co over- 
layer. 
The 
sharp 
(1 x 1) 
pattern 
at 
high 
temperatures may be due to Co adatoms which 
have diffused into the bulk of the substrate. This 
phenomenon will be discussed later. 
There is a dramatic change in the LEED pattern 
as the Co coverage reaches about 1 ML. A six- 
fold fine structure is developed surrounding each 
integer spot of the substrate. The evolutions of the 
LEED patterns for coverages from 0.8 to 4 ML 
are compared in Fig. lc, e and h. The intensities 
of these satellites increase gradually, and the high- 
order satellites become observable as the coverage 
increases. The nth order LEED spot of the satellites 
within the coverage range is separated from the 
integer 
beam 
by 
a 
misfit 
vector 
of 
a* = n(aco - 
apt) 
[3]. Since the lattice spacings are 
apt = 2.77 A and aco = 2.51 A, the reciprocal lattice 
vectors 
will 
be 
apt = 2g/apt = 2.27 A- 1 
and 
. 
o --1 
aco =2~z/aco =2.50A 
, respectively. The incom- 
mensurate LEED patterns indicate an incoherent 
epitaxy of the Co overlayer on the Pt( 111 ) surface. 
Similar fine structures of LEED satellites have also 
been observed in thin-film systems with a large 
lattice 
mismatch, 
such 
as 
Pt/Ni(lll) 
[9], 
Gd/W(ll0) [10], and FeO/Pt(lll) [11,12]. The 
satellitic structure is complicated when the Co 
coverage is about 2-2.8 ML, as shown in Fig. le. 
These satellites can be divided into two sets. The 
satellites surrounding (0, 1), (1, -1) and (-1, 0) 
are composed of three honeycombs, while the 
satellites surrounding (1, 0), (0, - 1) and (- 1, 1) 
are sixfold hexagonal structures. 
The satellites around each integer beam in 
Fig. ld disappear and the LEED spots become 
fuzzy at temperatures above 575 K for Co cover- 
ages near 1 ML. The LEED background increases 
as the temperature increases. The thermal evolu- 
tion of the LEED patterns for coverages between 
2 and 2.8 ML in Fig. le-g is very interesting. The 
LEED satellites around each integer beam dimin- 
ish as the temperature increases. The satellites in 
Fig. le rotate 30 
° about the integer beam, and 
only the first order of the fine structure survives 
to from the pattern in Fig. If after annealing at 
temperatures between 650 and 750 K. The surface

structure can be explained by the existence of 
rotated, incommensurate Co domains on the top 
layer having a rotation angle of 4.9 ° with respect 
to the substrate. We have successfully used a hard- 
sphere model to calculate the mismatch for 
Co (0001 ) lattice points on the Pt ( 111 ) surface at 
different angles and to confirm that the reorienta- 
tion angle is 4.9 ° for this system [7]. A similar 
phenomenon of the reorientation of an adlayer 
has been observed in a Pt/Ni(111) system [9]. The 
LEED satellites disappear and the integer spots 
become fuzzy when the annealing temperature is 
above 750 K, as shown in Fig. lg. 
The annealing effect for coverages of 3.2-4 ML 
(Fig. lh and i) is similar to that for coverages of 
0.8-1.2 ML (Fig. lc and d). The satellites around 
each integer beam disappear and the LEED spots 
become fuzzy when the temperature is increased 
to above 600 K. However, the locations of the 
LEED spots are further from the (0, 0) beam than 
those of 0.8-1.2 ML films. 
In Fig. lj, an additional p(2 x 2) LEED pattern 
is observed when the coverage is greater than 
4.5 ML. These p(2x2) 
spots persist until the 
coverage exceeds 7 ML. A similar p(2 x 2) pattern 
has also been found in a multilayer FeO/Pt(111) 
system, and these additional p(2 x 2) LEED spots 
have been interpreted by a particular arrangement 
of the step structure at the topmost layer [ 11 ]. The 
intensities of these satellites around each integer 
beam and the p(2x2) spots diminish and the 
LEED background grows as the temperature 
increases. The LEED pattern becomes very fuzzy 
when the annealing temperature is raised above 
600 K, as shown in Fig. lk. From the observation 
of the LEED spots spreading outside the reference 
Pt(111) ( 1 x 1 
) spots, we conclude that the distance 
between the atoms of the adlayer is less than that 
of Pt(111 ). This evidence indicates that the system 
may form an ordered alloy at high temperatures. 
The phase diagram of Co/Pt (111) is summarized 
in Fig. 2. The phase diagram can be divided into 
six parts. In region I (low coverages and low 
temperature), the pseudo-(1 x 1) LEED pattern 
suggest that the Co overlayer accumulates on 
Pt(lll) 
with 
a 
reciprocal lattice vector of 
a 
----= 
apt. The adatoms in the overlayer relax to fit 
the Pt(111) lattice points. In region II, Co grows 
by incoherent epitaxy. This structure remains 
unchanged during annealing up to a temperature 
of 575 K for lower coverages and up to 600 K for 
higher coverages. The lattice parameter of the 
overlayer is close to the nearest-neighbour distance 
in Co(0001). In region III, additional p(2x2)

spots appear because of surface steps formed at 
the topmost layer. In region IV, the alloy of Co 
and Pt is formed, the LEED pattern is close to 
p(lxl), 
and the reciprocal lattice vector a* 
approaches apt. Alloy formation was verified by 
AES, and will be discussed later. The surface layers 
contain most of the Pt atoms and the structure 
changes to Pt(111 ). In region V, the incommensu- 
rate Co domains of the top layer rotate by an 
angle of 4.9 ° with respect to the substrate and 
cause the rotation of the LEED satellites. In region 
VI (high coverages and high temperatures), the 
(1 x 1 
) LEED pattern may be caused by an ordered 
alloy of Co and Pt having a reciprocal lattice 
vector a* between apt and aco. Alloying was verified 
by AES. 
Since low-energy Auger electrons are sensitive 
to the depth of diffusion for each component, AES 
was used to study the composition of Co/Pt( 111 ) 
during the mixing of Co and Pt. Auger signals 
versus annealing temperatures of Co at coverages 
ranging from 0.6 to 4 ML on the Pt(lll) surface 
are summarized in Fig. 3. At a coverage of 0.6 ML, 
the Auger signal of Co (53 e)V remains unchanged 
at low temperatures of up to 350 K, and then 
drops to zero monotonously at 600 K. The Auger 
signals of Co for 1, 2 and 4 ML exhibit a similar 
temperature variation, being constant at low tem- 
peratures. The temperature TA at which Auger 
signal of Co begins to drop increases as the cover- 
age of Co increases. These values of TA are 350, 
350, 500 and 750 K for Co coverages of 0.6, 1, 2 
and 4 ML, respectively. TA increases as the Co 
coverage increases. The reason for this increase is 
that interdiffusion occurs from the Co-Pt interface 
[8,13]. The Auguer signals at coverages of 0.6, 1 
and 2 ML change significantly at 850 K, while the 
change is insignificant at coverages greater than 
4 ML. The annealing temperatures were limited to 
values below 850 K in our experiment to prevent 
Co atoms from diffusing too deeply to be removed 
by sputtering. The results of LEED and AES not 
only imply a variation of structure and concen- 
tration on the surface at high temperature, but 
also provide strong evidence of alloy formation. 
The structure of the valence band of this system 
in the annealing process is interesting. The differ- 
ence form of the angle-integrated UP spectra 
during annealing for a Co coverage of 2.0 ML is 
summarized in Fig. 4, and that for a Co coverage 
of 1.0 ML is summarized in Fig. 5. The angle-

phase of region V in Fig. 2. This peak reappears 
at temperatures greater than 800 K. Peaks P2 and 
P3 appear as the temperature is increased to more 
than 650 K. The location of the binding energies 
of peaks P2 and P3 are around 3.5 and 2.2 eV at 
650 K, respectively• The peaks all shift slightly to 
higher binding energies and their peak heights 
increase 
monotonously 
as 
the 
temperature 
increases. In addition, the Fermi edge (P4 in Fig. 4) 
grows slightly at temperatures greater than 650 K. 
We have determined by AES that the system forms 
an alloy at high temperatures. The appearance of 
the new peaks on annealing may reflect the forma- 
tion of Pt-Co bonds• Taking into account the 
difference in electronegativity between Pt and Co, 
a charge transfer from Co sites to Pt sites may 
occur. This should lead to a shift to higher binding 
318

energy for the mixture of Co and Pt due to bond 
strengthening. 
These UP spectra could give evidence of the 
structure of the Co-Pt alloy film. Moraitis et al. 
[6] calculated the electronic structures near the 
Fermi edge of ordered Co3Pt by a tight-binding 
linear muffin-tin orbital method. The electronic 
structure changes, as reflected by new peaks in the 
magneto-optical Kerr spectra of the ordered 
Co3Pt alloy with a hexagonal stacking during 
annealing near 650 K, are similar to our results 
[14]. Therefore, the features of peaks P1, P2 and 
P3 appearing in our UP spectra above 650 K may 
reflect the onset of alloying to a Co-rich phase. 
The UP spectra for 1.0ML Co/Pt(lll) are 
shown in Fig. 5. Significant changes start to appear 
at 550 K, which is close to the temperature of the 
structural phase transition between region II and 
region IV in Fig. 2. Variations in peaks P1, P2, P3 
and P4 occur at higher temperatures. The behavi- 
our of peak P1 is similar to that in Fig. 4. It also 
decreases at temperatures between 650 and 750 K 
and increases at higher temperatures. The behavi- 
our of peaks P2, P3 is P4 are similar to that in 
Fig. 4, except that the peak height of peak P3 
decreases at temperatures greaterr than 800 K. 
At each structural phase for 1.0 and 2 ML 
Co/Pt( 111 ), a corresponding UP spectrum exists. 
The temperature range of the changes in UPS 
peaks P1, P2, P3 and P4 agree with those of the 
alloy formation studied by LEED. 
4. Conclusion 
The structural evolution of annealing Co/ 
Pt(111) has been obtained from LEED observa- 
tions. 
A 
pseudo-(1 x 1) 
structure 
occurs 
at 
0:2-0.6 ML when temperatures are between 140 
and 550 K. Co films of 0.8-4 ML grow in incoher- 
ent epitaxy. A p(2 x 2) LEED pattern is observed 
for coverages greater than 4.5 ML at temperatures 
below 600 K. Annealing low coverages of Co at 
temperatures between 600 and 850 K causes the 
surface structure to tend towards Pt(lll). A 
rotated domain is observed at 650-750 K at cover- 
ages of 2-2.8 ML. The lattice parameter of the 
alloy film at coverages greater than 2 ML is smaller 
than that of Pt(111 ) after high-temperature annea- 
ling. The density of states observed in valence- 
band photoemission exhibits significant changes 
during the structural phase transition. Alloy for- 
mation was verified by AES.
