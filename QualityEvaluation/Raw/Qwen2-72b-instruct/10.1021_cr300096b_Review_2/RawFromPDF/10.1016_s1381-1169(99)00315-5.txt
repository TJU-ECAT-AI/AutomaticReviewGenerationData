1. Introduction
A catalytic reaction is composed of several

elementary processes, and the slowest step s of
them is responsible for the activity and the
kinetic feature of catalysis. So far, the reaction
mechanism in catalysis has been tacitly ex-
plained by assuming two-dimensional gas-like
adsorbed species. However, we can now gain an

insight into the surface structure in atomic level
details so that the importance of the local struc-
ture of the active sites can be discussed.
How to get and how to design an optimized
long life catalyst has been a long standing desire
in the heterogeneous catalyst. In this respect, a
very important result was presented by Bare et
w
x
al. 1,2 in the ammonia synthesis reaction on
single crystal Fe surfaces. It has been known
that the catalytic activity of Fe single crystal
surfaces for ammonia synthesis reaction is in a

structures. On the other hand, Al O

the indispensable promoting materials in the
industrial Fe catalyst, but the role of Al O has

catalytic activity of Fe 100

is
markedly enhanced when the surface is covered
with a FeAl O

unsolved interesting question why Fe 111 is so
active for ammonia synthesis reaction.
Similar activation of the surface by chemical
restructuring has been observed on PtrRh alloy,
w
x
as well as on PtrRh bimetallic surfaces 3,4 . It
is well known that PtrRh bimetallic catalyst is
a prominent catalyst for NO
reduction in the

exhaust gas of gasoline automotive, but the role

of Rh is still not clear. When a p 1=1

Bimetallic surfaces were prepared by electro-
chemical deposition of Pt or Rh atoms on a
desired Rh or Pt single crystal surface in an
attached small volume cubic chamber. When
the sample is transferred into the cubic cell, the
cubic chamber is perfectly separated from the
main UHV chamber by tight contact of a
conic-shaped sample holder head so that one
can carry out high pressure experiments up to 1
atm pressure in the small-volume cubic cham-
ber. The cubic reactor was filled with 1 atm of
highly pure Ar gas. Then, an electrochemical
quartz cell filled with 0.05 M H SO
solution
2
4
containing a certain concentration of Pt or Rh
ion was lifted in the cubic cell to make a
meniscus contact between the solution surface
and one side of the crystal surface. After the
electrochemical deposition of desired amount of
Pt or Rh, the crystal disk was washed with
highly pure water and was transferred back to
the UHV main chamber for the characterization
by LEED and AES. Details of the electrochemi-
w

cal deposition were described elsewhere 11,12 .

known that when a Pt 100
is heated up in a

N rNO has a peak at around 450 K but this

cess. Accordingly, the peak at around 450 K is
not the catalytic reaction, and it is supposed to

be a desorption mediated reaction of NO 13,14 .

observed on Rh 110 , as shown in Fig. 1b. A

.
The reaction on Rh 100 surface is very slow
at temperatures lower than ca. 600 K, but is
steeply promoted at higher than 600 K, which
may indicate a high activation energy for the

dissociation of NO on Rh 100 surface.
These results show that the catalytic reaction

From a general viewpoint of the practical
catalyst, structure-sensitive catalysis is undoubt-
edly a serious disadvantage. For example, in the
case of the Pt and Rh catalyst, only a limited
part of Pt andror Rh will work as catalyst for
the reaction of NOqH , and a large part of Pt

or Rh does not work as the catalyst. Therefore,
the role of Rh in the PtrRh three-way catalyst
is a very interesting subject to understand. In
order to gain an insight into the mechanism of
PtrRh bimetallic catalyst, we studied first a
Ž
.
Pt
Rh
100 alloy surface, and it was found
0.25
0.75
that the alloy surface undergoes reconstructive
w
x
activation during catalysis 3,4 . From this dis-
covery, we intended to make clear the activation
mechanism using such bimetallic surfaces as

PtrRh alloy is a random alloy so that the

random distribution of Pt and Rh atoms. On the
other hand, it was shown that the depth distribu-
tion of Pt andror Rh is not uniform because the
surface free energy depends on the composition.

that the Pt and Rh composition for the layers

higher as raising the annealing temperature, but

These results indicate that the surface compo-
sition of Pt–Rh alloy and PtrRh bimetallic
surfaces will not rapidly change at lower than
950 K, even if the composition is not in equilib-
rium. This is very important because the cat-
alytic reaction is usually performed in a temper-
ature range of 450–700 K, which is far lower
than the critical temperature of 950 K. In con-
trast to this expectation, however, it was found
w x
that the surface composition of Pt–Rh alloy 4
w x
as well as of bimetallic surfaces 6 is changed
during catalysis, where Rh atoms are readily
extracted onto the topmost layer by reacting
with oxygen even at 400 K.
When Rh atoms were extracted from the
second layer by reacting with oxygen, the
Ž
.

.
Pt
Rh
100 surface gave a clear p 3=1
0.25
0.75
w
x
LEED pattern, as shown in Fig. 2 4,6,17 . It is
Ž
.
worth noting that the p 3=1
surface has a
constant PtrRh ratio and is readily changed to
Ž
.
the p 1=1
pattern by keeping the ratio of
Ž
.
PtrRh at room temperature RT by exposing to
w
x
H
6,12,17 . Taking account of the fact that Pt
2
and Rh do not migrate on the surface at RT, the
Ž
.
p 1=1
surface keeps an ordered array of Pt
Ž
.
and Rh atoms of the p 3=1 structure over the
Ž
.
100 lattice structure. Based on these results, an
Ž
.
Ž
.
STM image for the p 3=1

alloy surface was first observed by us 18 .

When a Pt-enriched clean Pt

Ž
.
Once the p 3=1 structure is established, the
Ž

p 1=1 surface obtained by exposing to H
is
2

readily changed to the p 3=1 at RT in a short
time by exposing to O . It is also confirmed that

.
array of Rh and Pt atoms, the p 3=1 surface
will take a constant PtrRh ratio, as observed in
Fig. 2, and the induction time may correspond
to the time for the accumulation of the required
amount of Rh atoms. Therefore, such surface
reconstruction is caused by ‘‘chemical restruc-
turing’’, where the compositional change is
w
x
brought about by a chemical reaction 6,17 .

The idea of chemical restructuring was more
clearly confirmed on the two bimetallic sur-
Ž

faces, one is an Rh-deposited Pt 100
surface
Ž
.
and the other is a Pt-deposited Rh 100 surface.
The desired amount of Rh or Pt atoms was
electrochemically deposited on a clean surface
Ž
.

.
of Pt 100 or Rh 100 by repeating the cyclic
potential sweep in H SO
solution. Fig. 3a

6
drogen adsorption and desorption peaks that

appeared on the clean Rh 100 surface at y0.26

and y0.19 V SCE are markedly suppressed
by depositing Pt atoms. It is worth noting that
the oxygen wave observed at a higher potential
Ž
.
region on the clean Rh 100 surface disappears
Ž
.
on the Pt deposited Rh 100
surface in the
w
x
potential range scanned 17 . After the deposi-
tion, the bimetallic surface was washed by re-
placing the solution with ultra-pure water and
then, the sample crystal was transferred back
into the main UHV chamber for characteriza-
tion.
Ž
.
XPS spectra for an as-deposited PtrRh 100
surface, the surface annealed at 1000 K for 20
min and that of subsequently annealed at 1050
K for 10 min are shown in Fig. 4a. It is clear
Ž

that the Pt deposited Rh 100
surface is quite
stable in UHV at a temperature as high as 1050
Ž
.
K. Contrary to this, Rh-layer on Pt 100 is not
so stable, which undergoes rapid diffusion into
the bulk, as shown in Fig. 4b, where the Rh
atoms are perfectly dissolved into the bulk at
1000 K for 15 min.
It should be emphasized that the stability of
the bimetallic surfaces is quite different in O2

that of the p 3=1

On the other hand, when a PtrRh 100 sur-
face of ca. 1.1 ml of Pt was heated in O
of
2
1=10y7 Torr, a remarkable segregation of Rh
was brought about at 500 K, as shown in Fig. 6,
Ž
.
and a p 3=1 LEED pattern appears in subse-
quent annealing in O at 600 K. Taking account
2
Ž
.
of the fact that the PtrRh 100 surface is stable
in UHV even at 1050 K, as shown in Fig. 4a,
this Rh segregation and the following recon-
struction are undoubtedly caused by the chemi-
cal restructuring. These phenomena are in good
agreement with the longer induction time for
Ž
.
p 3=1 restructuring on the Pt enriched Pt–Rh
.
100 alloy surface.
Taking account of the fact that the amount of
Ž
.
Pt atoms deposited on the PtrRh 100 surface is
ca. 1.1 ml, the extraction of a certain amount of
Rh may take place by replacing Rh in the
second layer with the Pt atoms. if this is the
Ž
.
case, the formation of the p 3=1
surface is
brought about by the chemical restructuring of
the top two layers so that the second layer is
w
x
enriched with Pt 17 .
Ž
.
The most interesting fact is that the p 3=1
Ž

reconstructed surfaces of Pt–Rh 100
alloy,

RhrPt 110 and PtrRh 110 surfaces are also

gave a c 2=2 LEED pattern and was changed

to a p 1=2 by exposing to H . In contrast, the
2

activation of a bimetallic PtrRh 110

required the segregation of Rh by annealing in

at 760 K, where a c 2=4 LEED pattern

PtrRh 100 rO surfaces are restructured by the
reaction of Rh with O , and this chemical re-
2
structuring is responsible for the activation of
these bimetallic surfaces. If this is the case, an
interesting question is why these reconstructed
surfaces have an almost equal catalytic activity
for the reaction of NOqH . We supposed that
2
the restructuring of these surfaces may form the
active sites having similar local structure. From
Ž
.
Ž
.
this point of view, the p 3=1 Pt–Rh 100 rO
alloy surface was precisely studied using STM

alloy surface gives three different STM images
depending on the tip condition, as shown in Fig.
9, where the Pt as well as the Rh atoms can be

seen in image a but the images of b and c
reflect either Pt or Rh atoms.
Accordingly, we can deduce a suitable model
Ž
.
for the p 3=1 surface such as shown in Fig.
10a, which is different from the model tempo-

rally proposed in Ref.

PtrRh 110 rO and c 2=2

surfaces are composed of active sites having

surface, we can deduce suitable structures for

the

and

RhrPt 110 rO surfaces such as those shown in
Fig. 10b and c.
Based on a series of experiments on Pt–

RhrPt 100 , and RhrPt 110
bimetallic sur-
faces, we could conclude that formation of ac-
tive sites a common structure of Pt and Rh
atoms on PtrRh bimetallic surfaces during
catalysis is responsible for the prominent cat-
alytic activity of this catalyst for removing NO ,
x
CO, and hydrocarbons in the automotive ex-
haust gas. In other words, ‘‘a well-developed or
-optimized catalyst will be structure-insensitive
because they would provide the highest density
of active sites, which is an important requisite
for the perfectly improved catalyst’’.
