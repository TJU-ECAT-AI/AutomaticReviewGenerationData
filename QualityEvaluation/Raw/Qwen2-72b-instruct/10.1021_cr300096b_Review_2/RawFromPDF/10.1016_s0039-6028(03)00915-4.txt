Hydrogen adsorption and coadsorption with CO on well-defined bimetallic PtRu surfaces––a model study on the CO tolerance of bimetallic PtRu anode catalysts in low temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells
Abstract
The influence of PtRu surface alloy formation and of coadsorbed CO on the adsorption/desorption characteristics of hydrogen on bimetallic PtRu surfaces was investigated by temperature programmed desorption, using a 40% Pt containing PtRu surface alloy pseudomorphic on a Ru(0 0 0 1) surface with an almost statistical distribution of Pt surface atoms as substrate. Alloy formation leads to a significant broadening of the desorption peak compared to pure Ru, together with a considerable down-shift in the onset of desorption. This trend is even more pronounced in the presence of coadsorbed CO. The weakening of the hydrogen adsorption bond is attributed mainly to strain effects, imposed by the considerable compression of the pseudomorphic Pt as compared to bulk Pt(1 1 1). Finally we discuss the implications of these results for the mechanistic understanding of the improved performance of PtRu anode catalysts in reformate operated polymer electrolyte fuel cells.
1. Introduction
PtRu catalysts have attracted considerable interest over the last years as highly active and CO tolerant anode catalysts in low temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC), both for the electrooxidation of CO contaminated H2-rich fuel gas generated by reformation of hydrocarbons (‘reformate’) and for the electrooxidation of methanol in direct methanol fuel cells. The improved activity and CO tolerance of these catalysts has generally been assigned to the more facile oxidation of CO on these catalysts via a bifunctional mechanism
[1]
. Recently another explanation for the improved CO tolerance of these catalysts had been offered. Based on CO thermal desorption data obtained on PtRu surface alloy model surfaces Buatier de Mongeot et al. suggested that the improved CO tolerance is at least partly caused by a significant reduction in CO adsorption energy on these PtRu catalysts compared to CO adsorption on platinum
[2]
. Similar results and conclusions were reached in recent density functional theory calculations
[3]
, which showed a significant reduction in the CO adsorption energy on both Ru(0 0 0 1) surfaces covered by a pseudomorphic Pt monolayer or on substitutional Pt surface atoms in a Ru(0 0 0 1) substrate as compared to CO adsorption on Pt(1 1 1)

[5]
or comparable cluster geometries
[6]
. The former authors demonstrated also that for adsorption energies typical for CO adsorption on platinum, around 1.4 eV, and at temperatures common for PEFC operation (350 K) the Had coverage is reduced to very small values already at CO partial pressures around 10−2 mbar, equivalent to a CO concentration of 10 ppm at atmospheric pressure
[3]
.
CO adsorption and CO removal, however, are only part of the reactions going on in a reformate operated PEFC. The current determining step is the electrooxidation of hydrogen (hydrogen oxidation reaction––HOR), which for most platinum metal and platinum alloy electrodes is largely determined by the respective steady state hydrogen coverages. Two important questions to be answered are therefore (i) in how much are hydrogen adsorption and the Had steady state coverage under reaction conditions affected by the presence of coadsorbed CO, and (ii) what is the influence of PtRu alloy formation on hydrogen adsorption and H/CO coadsorption? Quantitative data on the influence of the CO coverage on the HOR rate are scarce
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
. Recently Jusys et al. reported a non-linear relation between CO coverage and HOR rate, with smaller effects in the low CO coverage regime, for the HOR on carbon supported Pt catalysts
[10]
. For PtRu no such data exist. Electrocatalytic measurements showed no measurable effect of PtRu alloy formation on the HOR activity, which was tentatively attributed to the very high activity of the remaining, accessible Pt surface atoms, which are sufficiently active that possible differences in the activity are masked by transport limitations
[11]
. Likewise, little is known on the energetics and kinetics of hydrogen adsorption on bimetallic PtRu surfaces, at the solid–vacuum interface, and on the influence of coadsorbed CO on these properties. This is topic of the present article. The effect of PtRu surface alloy formation on hydrogen adsorption/desorption and of CO coadsorption on hydrogen adsorption on a bimetallic PtRu surface was investigated by temperature programmed desorption (TPD), using a PtRu surface alloy (40% Pt surface atoms) as an example. The concentration and distribution of the Pt surface atoms were determined by high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), which provides further information for the mechanistic interpretation of the results and the underlying physical effects. Finally we will discuss the implications of these results on the mechanistic understanding of the improved performance of PtRu anode catalysts in reformate and methanol operated PEFC’s and on the development of further improved anode catalysts.
2. Experimental
The experiments were performed in two different ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) systems, a UHV–scanning tunneling microscope (STM) system equipped with a home-built pocket-size STM
[12]
, and a UHV-system designed for spectroscopic and in situ high pressure studies on single-crystal samples
[2]
. Both systems contained standard facilities for surface preparation and characterization such as Ar ion sputtering and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES).
The preparation of the Ru(0 0 0 1) sample followed procedures developed previously, a sequence of oxidation cycles at 1350 K in an O2 atmosphere (pO2=10−8 mbar, 30 min) and flash to 1600 K to remove oxidizable bulk contaminants. Before each experiment surface contaminations were removed by Ar+ ion sputtering (pAr=2.5×10−5 mbar, 2 μA ion current, 1.2 kV, 5 min), followed by 2–3 cycles of oxygen adsorption (pO2=1×10−7 mbar, 100 s) at 300 K and subsequent flash annealing to 1600 K. Finally the sample was flashed to 1700 K to remove remaining traces of oxygen. Following this treatment the surface exhibited large flat terraces separated by monolayer steps, as illustrated in
Fig. 1a
. The residual contaminations were below the detection level of AES (<0.01 ML, 1 ML equals one adsorbed atom or molecule per surface metal atom), which was confirmed by high resolution STM images showing trace impurities far below that value. Before the TPD experiments the surface purity was checked by a TPD spectrum of a saturated CO adlayer on the pure Ru(0 0 0 1) substrate prior to Pt deposition, which reacts sensitively to surface impurities.

(c) Simulated similar size STM image showing a surface with 40.7% Pt atoms statistically distributed in the surface.
STM images were recorded under constant current conditions, at tunnel currents It of typically 0.1 nA (overview images) to 45 nA (high resolution imaging) and tunnel voltages Vt of 1–600 mV. TPD spectra were recorded in a dedicated TPD set-up, where the mass spectrometer was shielded against desorption from sample holder etc. by a cup with a central aperture of 4 mm width and the distance between cup and sample was adjusted via an electrical contact
[13]
. For better background discrimination we used D2 instead of H2 in these experiments. The partial pressures are given in arbitrary units (a.u.), the values are equivalent to the mass spectrometric currents in nanoamperes at constant amplifier setting throughout the experiments.
Pt surface alloys were prepared by depositing submonolayer amounts of Pt from an electron beam heated evaporator (Omicron EFM 3) at about 300 K substrate temperature and subsequent annealing of the sample to 1300 K. When that temperature was reached, the annealing was stopped immediately and the sample was allowed to cool down. Careful STM studies, which have partly been reported in
[2]
and which will be described in more detail elsewhere
[14]
, showed that after this treatment the Pt monolayer islands are dissolved and the Pt atoms have exchanged with Ru surface atoms, but remained largely in the topmost layer. This information can be gained by comparing the Pt coverage in STM images after room temperature deposition, i.e., before alloying, with the Pt content of the surface alloy. Both quantities are almost equal. The Ru–Pt exchange is demonstrated by the atomic resolution STM image in
Fig. 1b
, where Pt and Ru surface atoms can clearly be distinguished (chemical contrast)
[2]
. This way absolute coverages (Pt concentration in the topmost layer) were determined by STM. The resulting values served as calibration for the AES measurements, allowing to assign absolute coverages to the measured intensity ratio of the Pt transition at 64 eV and the Ru transition at 273 eV
[15]
. In the TPD experiments the surface alloys were prepared the same way. In this case the Pt content is determined by AES, using the calibrated intensity ratios described above.
3. Results and discussion
Visual inspection of the atomic resolution STM in
Fig. 1b
indicates that the Pt atoms are more or less statistically distributed in this surface region. This is confirmed by a quantitative evaluation of this and similar images from the same surface, which shows that (i) the surface area imaged in
Fig. 1b
is representative for the bimetallic surface and that (ii) the Pt atoms are almost statistically distributed on the surface. At a Pt surface concentration of 40.7 ± 1% the Pt atoms (dark atoms) are largely clustered in medium-sized ensembles between 4 and 40 atoms (61%), while the fraction of Pt atoms in very small ensembles (monomers, dimers and trimers) is below 12.5%. These values can be compared with the corresponding numbers obtained for a random distribution of Pt surface atoms with a similar Pt concentration, where Pt monomers, dimers and trimers contribute with 4.8%, 4.1%, and 3.7%, respectively, while the medium size ensembles (nPt=4–40 atoms) contribute with 53%. For comparison we show a simulated surface with random distribution of 40.7% Pt surface atoms in

and for calibrating the absolute hydrogen coverage we first recorded a saturation D2 TPD spectrum from an unmodified Ru(0 0 0 1) surface (broken line). Both peak temperature (Tmax=330 K) and peak shape agree well with previous findings, underlining the cleanness of the Ru(0 0 0 1) sample.

Fig. 2. Set of D2 thermal desorption spectra, showing the desorption of increasing amounts of D2 from a 40% Pt containing PtRu surface alloy (exposures in 10−6 mbar s: 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0). For comparison D2 saturation desorption spectra obtained from a Dad saturated unmodified Ru(0 0 0 1) surface (broken line) and from a Dad saturated Ru surface covered by a similar amount of Pt (0.40 ML) in a monolayer film (dotted line) are included as well (Tad=100 K, heating rate 4 K/s).
Deuterium adsorption on a bimetallic PtRu surface (Pt surface content 40%) leads to considerable modifications in the desorption spectra (full lines). At low exposures, up to about 0.4 × 10−6 mbar s (θD=0.25 ML) desorption occurs in a slightly, but not much lower temperature range as from the unmodified Ru(0 0 0 1) surface, between 265 and 405 K as compared to between 355 and 455 K for desorption from Ru(0 0 0 1) at a similar coverage. The much larger width of the spectrum and its pronounced asymmetric shape with a maximum much closer to the onset temperature (Tmax=310 K), however, indicate already significant deviations from simple second order desorption from a homogeneous surface. The differences between the two different substrates become more pronounced with increasing coverages. At θD=0.35 a low temperature shoulder appears at about 275 K, which develops into a distinct maximum between 250 and 260 K at higher coverages. At coverages above 0.5 ML another low temperature shoulder grows in, which causes a continuous shift of the onset of desorption to lower temperatures. At saturation, which is reached at about 0.9 ML, desorption starts already right at the start of the temperature ramp. (Longer exposures, up to 50 × 10−6 mbar s, showed no further hydrogen uptake.) This and the apparent saturation coverage, which is significantly less than that obtained on pure Ru(0 0 0 1) (1 ML), both indicate that the saturation coverage of chemisorbed hydrogen on the bimetallic PtRu surface cannot be reached at 100 K due to the onset of D2 desorption at these high coverages.
The spectra obtained for D2 saturation of a surface alloy with 40% Pt shall be compared with one obtained from a Ru(0 0 0 1) surface covered by a submonolayer Pt film with a similar amount of Pt (0.4 ML Pt) (
Fig. 2
, dotted line). The latter spectrum can roughly be described as consisting of two parts, a high temperature peak between 240 and 440 K, which resembles that obtained on a pure Ru(0 0 0 1) substrate (and even better the low coverage peak on the PtRu surface alloy), and a low temperature peak centered at 145 K, which can be attributed to D2 desorption from a Ru(0 0 0 1) surface covered by a monolayer Pt film. Desorption in the low-temperature peak includes an equivalent of 0.16 ML Dad, while the high temperature state corresponds to 0.67 ML Dad. Desorption in the intermediate temperature range (0.06 ML), at temperatures between 200 and 250 K, is tentatively attributed to desorption from Pt island edges and other defects in the films, assuming that Dad is stabilized at these sites
[21]
. At average sizes of the triangular Pt islands of 50 nm the island edges contribute about 0.04 ML adsorption sites, which is in qualitative agreement with the intensity in this temperature range. Also in this case the apparent saturation coverage (0.9 ML) is well below the 1 ML value reached on pure Ru(0 0 0 1). This and the fact that the low temperature peak plus the intermediate temperature desorption range together account only for 0.21 ML, as compared to a coverage of 0.4 ML of the Pt islands, suggest that the local coverage on the Pt monolayer islands is well below 1 ML under these conditions, while the bare Ru areas appear to be saturated (1 ML local coverage corresponds to 0.6 ML total coverage).
The continuous and pronounced down-shift in the onset of D2 desorption from the 40% Pt surface alloy with increasing coverage can arise from either strongly repulsive interactions between adsorbed Dad species or from an increasing population of less stable adsorption sites with increasing coverage. The adsorption energy and also the activation energy for desorption will first of all depend on the composition of this adsorption ensemble. Assuming a saturation coverage of 1 ML and hydrogen adsorption on threefold sites, as it was determined for H adsorption on the pure Ru(0 0 0 1)
[22]
,
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
and Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
[26]
,
[27]
, the minimum ensemble (‘critical ensemble’) required for accommodation of two neighboring hydrogen atoms would be a compact pentamer. Accordingly, the adsorption energy is mainly determined by the composition of this adsorption ensemble. This assumption is supported by recent experimental and theoretical findings for hydrogen adsorption on a PdAu(1 1 1) surface alloy, where a compact Pd tetramer was the critical ensemble size for hydrogen adsorption
[28]
. An additional, smaller contribution may arise from the nature of metal atoms directly adjacent to the adsorption ensemble. The former is well known as the geometric ensemble effect, while the latter reflects the electronic ligand effect
[29]
,
[30]
,
[31]
. Following these ideas, the continuous down-shift in the onset of desorption with increasing coverage is interpreted as an increasing occupation of adsorption ensembles with higher Pt contents, rather than being attributed to repulsive adsorbate–adsorbate interactions. Since the spectra show very little intensity in the temperature range characteristic for low coverage H2 desorption from pure Ru(0 0 0 1), we conclude that there are rather few Ru like adsorption ensembles, e.g., compact Ru5 pentamers with two similar type threefold hollow sites, left on the bimetallic surface.
The PtRu surface alloy formation not only affects the H2 adsorption energetics or strictly speaking the activation energy for desorption, but, though much less strongly, also the adsorption kinetics. This is illustrated by the uptake curves for hydrogen adsorption on an unmodified Ru(0 0 0 1) substrate and on the 40% Pt containing PtRu surface alloy in
Fig. 3a
. The coverage dependent sticking coefficients calculated from these data are displayed in
Fig. 3b
. For adsorption on the pure Ru(0 0 0 1) substrate we find an initial sticking coefficient of s0=0.3, which is in good agreement with the values reported in previous studies (s0=0.25
[19]
, s0=0.29
[20]
). On the bimetallic surface the hydrogen uptake is slightly slower than in the former one, resulting in a decrease of the sticking coefficient by about 20%, with an initial sticking coefficient of s0=0.25. For comparison, reported values for the initial sticking coefficient for (room temperature) hydrogen adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) range around 0.1
[26]
,
[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
. The lower value of the hydrogen sticking coefficient on Pt(1 1 1) compared with Ru(0 0 0 1) agrees with our own finding for hydrogen adsorption on thick Pt films. Hence, the (initial) sticking coefficient for deuterium adsorption on the bimetallic surface PtRu is between those found for Pt(1 1 1) and Ru(0 0 0 1), respectively, but closer to that on Ru(0 0 0 1).

The dramatic weakening of the metal–H bond compared to hydrogen adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) and on Ru(0 0 0 1) can be understood in terms of the d-band model introduced by Nørskov and coworkers
[21]
,
[36]
. According to that model the metal–H bond, just like the metal–CO bond, is weakened if the center of the substrate d-band is shifted downwards. Such a shift can be induced, e.g., by a lateral compression or expansion of the metal surface layer relative to the spacing in the respective bulk metal
[37]
. These strain induced modifications of the electronic structure lead to a stabilization of the metal–H bond for an expansion of the surface layer, while it is destabilized in the case of a compressive strain. In the present case this means that the Pt–H bond on a Pt monolayer, which is pseudomorphic on a Ru(0 0 0 1) substrate, is weakened relative to the Pt–H bond on Pt(1 1 1). The same effect is expected and predicted theoretically for hydrogen adsorption on substitutional Pt ensembles in the Ru(0 0 0 1) surface layer
[3]
. Neglecting possible changes in the basic characteristics of the desorption kinetics (desorption order, preexponential) the down-shift of the desorption peak from 300 K on Pt(1 1 1)
[32]
to 145 K on the strained Pt film reflects a decrease of the hydrogen adsorption energy from about 67 kJ/mol on Pt(1 1 1)
[26]
to about 32 kJ/mol. Accounting for the contribution of the dissociation energy this corresponds to a reduction of 10.8% in the metal–H interaction, from about 260 to 232 kJ/mol (Ebind=(1/2)Ead−(1/2)Ediss,
eV
[38]
). Despite of the pronounced down-shift in the temperature of the desorption peak this effect is considerably less than that observed for CO adsorption on the same surfaces, where the reduction in Pt–CO interaction is about 40%

3.2. Coadsorption of D2 and CO on PtRu surface alloy
Next we will investigate the effect of coadsorbed CO on the hydrogen adsorption behavior on the bimetallic substrate, using the same 40% Pt containing PtRu surface alloy. This will be done by preadsorbing increasing amounts of D2 and subsequently saturating the surface with 10 L CO (adsorption temperature 100 K). The opposite experiment, preadsorbing increasing amounts of CO and subsequent saturation by D2, is not so interesting in this context since adsorbed CO was found to block the surface for subsequent D2 adsorption and is not replaced by adsorbing hydrogen under these conditions, and is hence not shown here. The TPD spectra resulting from the first set of experiments are displayed in
Fig. 4
. As expected, the D2 desorption spectra (
Fig. 4a
) vary significantly from those recorded in the absence of coadsorbed CO. From low Dad coverages on the desorption spectra are dominated by a peak centered at 150 K (α-peak). This peak grows with increasing D2 preexposure, together with a slight shift of the peak maximum to lower temperatures. At all coverages D2 desorption starts practically right after the begin of the temperature ramp, with the initial pressure rise becoming increasingly steeper at growing Dad coverages. Parallel to the growth of the α-peak a high-temperature shoulder develops. This shoulder reaches to increasingly higher temperatures, from ≈200 to 270 K at medium Dad precoverages to about 350 K at saturation precoverage. At the same time this shoulder develops a broad maximum around 250 K (β-peak), which based on the fine structure at subsaturation coverages may comprise several maxima. The formation of this peak is interesting in so far as one would expect a high-temperature peak to be populated first, and lower temperature states are filled only at higher coverages. This will be discussed after the presentation of the CO TPD spectra.

Set of D2 (a) and CO (b) thermal desorption spectra obtained after preexposure of increasing amounts of D2 (exposures in 10−6 mbar s: 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, desorption traces in (a) and (b) are labeled accordingly) to a 40% Pt containing PtRu surface alloy and subsequent CO saturation (CO exposure 10 × 10−6 mbar s) (Tad=100 K, heating rate 4 K/s). Broken lines: (a) D2 desorption after exposure to 20.0 × 10−6 mbar s without CO postexposure, (b) indicates some CO adsorption from the residual gas.
The CO desorption spectra obtained from this surface closely resemble those obtained from this surface without hydrogen preadsorption
[2]
,
[14]
. This is not surprising, since at all D2 preexposures CO desorption only sets in after almost all hydrogen is desorbed. Hence, the CO TPD spectra do not reflect the state of adsorbed CO molecules in the mixed adlayer, but rather that of the remaining COad after D2 desorption. The data furthermore demonstrate that CO adsorption is possible also on the hydrogen saturated surface under these conditions, i.e., a saturated Dad adlayer does not completely inhibit the uptake of CO, as it is observed in the reverse case. Finally, the amount of desorbed D2 is significantly lower under these conditions than that obtained after similar exposures without CO postadsorption, reaching 0.68 ML only instead of 0.9 ML without CO postexposure. The latter two observations together with the fact that after medium and higher exposures D2 desorption starts already right at the onset of the temperature ramp indicate that under these conditions CO cannot only adsorb on the Dad covered surface, but also displace part of the preadsorbed Dad. One may speculate that longer CO postexposures may lead to an increasing, perhaps even total displacement of the preadsorbed Dad. This can easily be understood if we consider that despite of the much weaker adsorption of CO on the bimetallic surface as compared to CO adsorption on Pt(1 1 1)
[2]
,
[39]
,
[40]
,
[41]
this is still significantly stronger adsorbed than hydrogen on similar adsorption ensembles. Hence it is (i) thermodynamically favorable to replace the Dad by COad, and (ii) because of the onset of D2 desorption already just above the adsorption temperature, this process is also kinetically feasible. (The rapid onset of desorption right above the adsorption temperature means that over the longer time of the CO postexposure experiment also desorption at the adsorption temperature is finite.) In that sense coadsorption of CO leads to a further weakening of the metal–hydrogen bond, sufficient to induce (partial) desorption already at 100 K. At elevated temperatures this will lead to a further decrease of the steady state deuterium coverage, in addition to the reduction imposed by the PtRu surface alloy compared to deuterium adsorption on Pt(1 1 1).
Considering these effects we can also understand the population of the high temperature β-state observed in
Fig. 4b
. At small Dad precoverages and hence large coverages of postadsorbed COad the latter will occupy the ‘good’ adsorption sites. Correspondingly, the Dad will be pushed onto Pt-rich ensembles, and its adsorption energy will largely resemble that on a monolayer Pt film on Ru(0 0 0 1) (see
Fig. 2
, dashed line). At higher Dad precoverages and hence smaller COad coverages the adsorbed COad molecules will still occupy the ‘best’ adsorption sites, but now there will be mixed PtRu ensembles available for hydrogen adsorption, where the adsorption energy for both hydrogen adsorption and CO adsorption is lower than on pure Ru ensembles, but still higher than on pure Pt ensembles. Hence, the population of the high temperature β-state only at higher Dad coverages does not indicate a non-equilibrium situation in the adlayer, as it would be the case in an adlayer with a single component, but rather results from the fact that we are dealing with two components, which are competing for the adsorption ensembles. A further slight reduction in the measured adsorption energy may arise from repulsive adsorbate–adsorbate interactions, which because of the rather small Pt ensembles on the bimetallic surface will be dominated by COad–Dad interactions. (Due to the small Pt ensembles on the bimetallic surface a phase separation into Dad and COad islands, where the Dad–Dad interactions would be dominant, is unlikely.)
3.3. Implications for low temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cell operation
Finally we will consider the implications of these results for the operation of a low temperature PEFC, which is typically operated at about 350 K. We will assume that hydrogen (and deuterium) adsorption are not too different in the electrochemical environment to adsorption at the solid–gas interface, which can be qualitatively justified by the rather unpolar nature of both the adsorbed Dad and the transition state for chemisorption. Assuming a flux of 106 molecules per metal surface atom and s
1
––this is equivalent to a hydrogen partial pressure of 1 mbar, using the sticking coefficient of s0=0.25 derived from the above data and not including hydrogen losses due to hydrogen oxidation the steady state hydrogen coverage in thermal equilibrium will be reduced from close to saturation (0.95 ML) on Pt(1 1 1) to around 0.3 ML on the PtRu bimetallic surface or to below 0.05 ML on a Pt monolayer covered Ru surface.
2
This would contrast the experimental observation that the H2 electrooxidation activity is not reduced on PtRu anode catalysts compared to Pt catalysts, but would agree with the explanation that because of the high activity of Pt the Pt alloy surfaces or catalysts are still so active that the differences in activity are masked by transport limitations
[11]
. Nevertheless, the fact that changes in the electronic structure of the substrate affect in the same way the metal–CO and the metal–H bond implies that a continuous improvement of the CO tolerance of anode catalysts by a further reduction in metal–CO bond strength is not possible. Instead, there will be an optimum situation, and further reduction in metal–CO bond strength will result in a situation where the improvement in CO tolerance by a reduction in steady-state COad coverage will be overcompensated by the loss in HOR activity due to a reduction in steady state Had coverage. It should be noted that these arguments do not include COad removal via a bifunctional CO oxidation mechanism, but at the low anode potentials in an operating fuel cell significant contributions from CO desorption are desirable, and may even be dominating.
4. Summary
In summary we have shown that hydrogen (deuterium) adsorption on a bimetallic PtRu layer, which is pseudomorphic on a Ru(0 0 0 1) substrate, is considerably weaker than on an unmodified Pt(1 1 1) or Ru(0 0 0 1) surface. Following the d-band model introduced by Nørskov and coworkers this reduction in metal–H bond strength is attributed to a strain induced modification of the electronic properties of Pt-rich adsorption ensembles. Coadsorption of CO leads to a further weakening of hydrogen adsorption. This is explained by a CO induced displacement of the adsorbed hydrogen from strongly binding Ru-rich ensembles to less strongly binding Pt-rich ensembles. Even at 100 K adsorption temperature postexposure of CO causes a partial displacement of adsorbed hydrogen. At elevated temperatures and pressures, as present in a fuel cell, these effects will result in a severe reduction of the steady-state hydrogen coverage. Further improvement of the CO tolerance of PEFC anode catalysts by the use of platinum alloys will be limited by the reduction in hydrogen electrooxidation activity due to a reduction in the steady-state hydrogen coverage, which is caused by the same electronic effects responsible for the reduction of the steady state COad coverage.
