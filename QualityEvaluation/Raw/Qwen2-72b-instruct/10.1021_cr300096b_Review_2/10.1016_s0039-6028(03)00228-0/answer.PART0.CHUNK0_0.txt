1.The literature does not provide information on how the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted. However, it does mention that the study of metals deposited on a metallic substrate has seen rapid growth in recent years, with attention focused both on the deposition and heteroepitaxial growth of A on B as well as on the fabrication of multilayers with alternating modulations of layers of A and B of varying thickness. These systems are expected to have a wide range of potential applications, in such areas as magnetism, optics, catalysis, tribology, corrosion, etc. The Ni on Pt(111) system does not seem to have been considered previously in the theoretical literature, but Majerus et al. performed an effective medium calculation of various Pt/Ni single-atom adsorbate combinations, which bear some relevance to the system at hand.

1.文献没有提供如何表征通过在Pt(111)单晶或Pt多晶基底上沉积Ni单层制备的Ni/Pt双金属表面的信息。但是，它确实提到金属沉积在金属基底上的研究近年来迅速增长，关注点既包括A在B上的沉积和异质外延生长，也包括具有不同厚度的A和B层交替调制的多层结构的制备。这些系统预计在磁学、光学、催化、摩擦学、腐蚀等领域具有广泛的应用潜力。Ni在Pt(111)上的系统似乎之前没有在理论文献中被考虑过，但Majerus等人对各种Pt/Ni单原子吸附物组合进行了有效介质计算，这与手头的系统有些相关。
