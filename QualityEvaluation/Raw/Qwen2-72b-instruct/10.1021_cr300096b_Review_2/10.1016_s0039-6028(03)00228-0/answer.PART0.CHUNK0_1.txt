1.The literature does not provide information on how the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted. However, it does mention that the study of metals deposited on a metallic substrate has seen rapid growth in recent years, with attention focused both on the deposition and heteroepitaxial growth of A on B as well as on the fabrication of multilayers with alternating modulations of layers of A and B of varying thickness. These systems are expected to have a wide range of potential applications, in such areas as magnetism, optics, catalysis, tribology, corrosion, etc.

1.文献没有提供如何表征通过在Pt(111)单晶或Pt多晶基底上沉积Ni单层制备的Ni/Pt双金属表面的信息。但是，它确实提到金属A沉积在金属B基底上的研究近年来发展迅速，研究重点既包括A在B上的沉积和异质外延生长，也包括具有不同厚度的A和B层交替调制的多层结构的制备。这些系统预计在磁学、光学、催化、摩擦学、腐蚀等领域具有广泛的应用潜力。
