1.The literature does not provide information on how the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted. However, it does mention that the study of metals deposited on a metallic substrate has seen rapid growth in recent years, with attention focused on the deposition and heteroepitaxial growth of A on B, as well as on the fabrication of multilayers with alternating modulations of layers of A and B of varying thickness. These systems are expected to have a wide range of potential applications, including in catalysis. The Ni on Pt(111) system has been the subject of prior experimental work in which it was reported that the initial stages of the Ni growth occur in the hcp adsorption sites on the (111) face with little or no evidence for intermixing with the substrate.

1.文献没有提供如何表征通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的信息。但是，它确实提到金属沉积在金属基底上的研究近年来迅速增长，关注点集中在A在B上的沉积和异质外延生长，以及具有不同厚度的A和B层交替调制的多层的制备。这些系统预计将在广泛的潜在应用中发挥作用，包括催化。Ni在Pt(111)系统上是之前实验工作的主题，据报道，Ni生长的初始阶段发生在(111)面上的hcp吸附位点，几乎没有与基底混合的证据。
