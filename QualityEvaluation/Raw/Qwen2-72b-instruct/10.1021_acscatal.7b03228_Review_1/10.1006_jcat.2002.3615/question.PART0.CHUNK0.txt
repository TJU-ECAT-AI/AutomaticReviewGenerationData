This leads directly to a universal relationship between adsorption energies and catalytic activity, which is used to pinpoint what it is that determines the best catalyst for a given reaction. The universality principle ra- tionalizes a number of known facts about catalysts and points to new ways of improving them. c 2002 Elsevier Science (USA) The empirical knowledge of catalysis and catalysts is enormous (1). We know, for instance, that Pd and PtRh are the best exhaust catalysts for NO removal (2), while Co, Fe, and Ru are the best FischerTropsch catalysts (3), Pt, Pd, and Ag are the best oxidation catalysts (4), and Ru and Fe are the best ammonia synthesis catalysts (5). But in general we do not know why. In the present communication we show that for a class of reactions proceeding over tran- sition metal catalyst surfaces, there is a universal, reaction- independent relationship between activation energies and the stability of important intermediates in the reaction. On this basis we can understand semiquantitatively what it is that characterizes the optimum catalyst for all the reactions belonging to the class.
The reactions we will focus on here can be characterized as activation of a diatomic molecule. Ammonia synthe- sis (N2 + 3H2 2NH3) is, for instance, activation of N2 in the sense that N2 is first dissociated, whereafter the dis- sociation products are hydrogenated into the final pro- duct. Hydrogen also needs to dissociate, but this reaction is fast and hydrogen binds more weakly to the surface than nitrogen. For this reason the N2 activation is the key as- pect of the reaction. Similarly, FischerTropsch synthesis (e.g., nCO + (2n + 1)H2 CnH2n+2 + nH2O) can be char- 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed.

All these reactions have two main parts: The dissociation of the reacting molecules and the removal of the dissoci- ation products. The rate of dissociation is determined by the activation barrier for dissociation, Ea, while the rate of product removal is given largely by the stability, E, of the intermediates on the surface; see Fig. 1. A good catalyst is characterized by a low activation energy and weak bonding of the intermediates. It has long been realized that Ea and E are often correlated such that the best catalyst is a com- promise having adsorbatesurface interactions of interme- diate strength. This is also known as the Sabatier principle (6, 7). The first step toward placing such qualitative consid- erations on a more firm basis was taken recently, when it was shown that there is indeed a direct, linear relationship between Ea andE.Usingdensityfunctionaltheory(DFT) calculations to treat the same process on different transition metal surfaces, such a relationship has been shown to exist for CH bond breaking by Pallassana and Neurock (8), for CO dissociation by Liu and Hu (9), and for N2 dissociation by Logadottir et al. (10).
Focusing first on the results for N2 activation, there is a clear, linear BrnstedEvansPolanyi-type (11, 12) rela- tionship between the activation energy for dissociation and the nitrogensurface bond energy; cf. Fig. 2. In fact there are several such relationships, depending on the surface structure. Figure 2 includes one for close-packed surfaces and another for special step sites where five metal atoms can be used for dissociation (10). Clearly, the step-type sites are most reactive. This has also been shown experimentally in several cases (1315). When combined with a kinetic model for ammonia synthesis, the linear relationship between activation energy and nitrogensurface bond energy translates into a volcano-shaped dependence of the catalytic activity on the nitrogen adsorption energy; see Fig. 2c (10). 275 0021-9517/02 $35.00 c 2002 Elsevier Science (USA) All rights reserved. 276

FIG. 1.

The molecularly (N 2) and atomically adsorbed (N) states, as well as thetransitionstatefordissociation(TS),areindicated.Therateofdissocia- tive adsorption is given by the transition state energy, Ea, while the stability of the dissociated product is given by the chemisorption energy, E.
We now include data for CO, NO, and O2 dissociation on a number of different metals; see Table 1. A total of 84 transition and final states have been located on the ba- sis of periodic slab density functional theory calculations utilizing ultrasoft pseudopotentials, a plane wave basis set with a cutoff of 25 Ry, and the GGARPBE description of exchange and correlation (16). The calculational procedure is outlined in detail in Ref. (10).
The unexpected finding is that all results fall on the same BrnstedEvansPolanyi lines in Fig. 2. This means that within the accuracy of the DFT calculations there is a universal relation for all the molecules studied here.
Knowledge of the adsorption energy of the intermediates,either from experiments or from calculations, can there- fore be used to estimate the activation energies using the linear relationships Ea = (2.07  .07) + E · (0.90  .04) (close-packed surfaces, Fig. 2a) and Ea = (1.34  .09) + E · (0.87  .05) (steps, Fig. 2b), all energies in eV.
The existence of a universal BrnstedEvansPolanyi line immediately raises three questions: Why is the rela- tionship between Ea and E linear? Why is it structure- dependent? And why is it adsorbate-independent? The an- swer to all three questions lies in the nature of the transition state structures. It turns out that for a given metal surface geometry, the transition state structures are essentially in- dependent of the molecule and the metal considered; see Fig. 3 (18). In addition, the bond length in the transition state is quite long, and the constituent atoms have largely lost their molecular identity. This means that variations in the transition state energy will follow that of the final state energy closely giving a linear relationship with a slope close to one. Since the transition state structures do depend on the local surface structure, the BrnstedEvansPolanyi lines are different for different sites on the surface. Finally,the fact that the transition state geometries are so similar for different reactants is the reason that the relationship is adsorbate-independent.
The universality of the BrnstedEvansPolanyi curve for the class of molecules considered here has an interest- ing consequence. If we assume that the overall kinetics of these reactions follows the same patterndissociation is rate limiting when the barrier is high and blocking of the surface is limiting the reactivity when the adsorbates bind strongly to the surfacethen the universality in Fig. 2 trans- lates into universality in terms of the volcano curves. If we take the ammonia kinetics as a guideline, the optimum cata- lyst should be one with an adsorbate binding energy in the range 1.40.8 eV (14080 kJ/mole); cf. Fig. 2c.
For ammonia synthesis (N2 activation) both Ru and Fe lie within this range; see Table 1. For CO activation (Fischer Tropsch synthesis) the same is true for Rh, Co, Ni, and Ru, and for NO activation it is Pd and Pt.

Calculated activation energies (Ea; see Fig. 1) for N2, CO, NO,and O2 dissociation on a number of different metals plotted as a function of the calculated dissociative chemisorption potential energy for the dis- sociation products (E; see Fig. 1). The data are shown in Table 1. Results for close packed surfaces (fcc(111), hcp(0001), and bcc(110)) (a) as well as for steps (which include fivefold coordinated sites) (b) are included. They show the same trends, but group along two different straight lines. The steps are more reactive than the terraces for these reaction and will tend to dominate the reactivity unless poisoned in some way. For N2/Ru(0001) we also include data for a high coverages (0.5 monolayers) of oxygen and ni- trogen(graypoints).ThelinearrelationshipforN2 dissociationonthemost reactive step sites (red points in (b)) has been used as input into a kinetic model for the ammonia synthesis reaction (10). The calculated reactivity per site per second (the turnover frequency, TOF) normalized to give the same maximum value is shown for different reaction conditions (c). The optimum reactivity depends somewhat on reaction conditions and occurs for an adsorbatesurface interaction energy in the range 1.4 to 0.8 eV.

Note. The two energies are defined in Fig. 1. In most cases both values are calculated and used as input into Fig. 2, but some cases where only the adsorption energy is calculated are included. In most cases both adsorbate and metal coordinates have been optimized, but for systems marked with a only the adsorbate degrees of freedom have been relaxed. CoMo-step I and II refer to Mo- and Co-rich sites,respectively, on the same 5050 alloy, while Pt/Rh step refers to Pt with Rh in the second layer. the optimum range, but the closest are Ag (0.65eV), Pd (1.56 eV), and Pt (2.2 eV). The agreement of this simple principle with empirical observations is remarkable.
The important parameter characterizing the reactivity of a given metal is the adsorbate surface interaction energy, E,inthefinalstateofthedissociationprocess.Thisparam- eter has its optimum value for different metals depending on the nature of the reactants, and the variation in optimum catalyst from one reaction to the next follows directly from this principle. We note that it is only with access to the large database of the DFT calculations that we can now establish such a principle and test it.
The present treatment is only aimed at understanding the overall trends in the catalytic activity. There are several reasons for this. First of all, we do not treat the reaction steps following activation of the main reactant molecule in any detail. Including these may change the kinetics somewhat. This will be less of a problem, when the other reactants are easy to activate. Reactions with hydrogen or CO (nondissociated) should belong to this class. Oxidation reactions where O2 reacts with saturated hydrocarbons,on the other hand, may not belong to the class. In this case the hydrocarbon activation can also be decisive. We 278

also note that we are not treating questions relating to selectivity here.
Another limitation is that the accuracy of the DFT calcu- lations is not such that we can give a quantitative treatment.
There are also deviations from the linear behavior in Fig. 2.
We are neglecting them in the present overall treatment,but these deviations may well turn out to be essential in the last fine-tuning of the reactivity of a given system.
Reactions with transition states that are different from those considered here may also show linear Brnsted EvansPolanyi relations, but not necessarily the same. This is true for CH activation (8), for H2 activation, and for H2O activation, for example. Such reactions will belong to differ- ent classes of reactions with optimum interactions strengths different from the one found here for the class of reactions involving medium-size diatomics. The general principles may therefore be applicable to other classes of reactions.
We have concentrated here on differences between dif- ferent metals and have not explicitly treated the effect of adsorbateadsorbate interactions. This can easily be incor- porated, though. In Fig. 2a we have included some points for N2 activation on Ru(0001) in the presence of high coverages of nitrogen or oxygen (18). They are merely shifted to (much) weaker bonding, but are still close to the BrnstedEvansPolanyi line. It means that if the reaction conditions are changed such that the coverage of an in- termediate changes significantly then adsorbateadsorbate interactions may effectively shift the corresponding point to another position along the line. An example of such an effect may be provided by the recent work of Over et al. on CO oxidation over RuO2 (19). Ru is a poor oxidation catalyst. It binds oxygen much too strongly; cf. Table 1. But if the reaction conditions are such that RuO2 is formed,then a new much weaker bound state of adsorbed oxygen appears (thermal desorption experiments suggests an ad- sorption energy of about 1.2 eV (20) and DFT calcula- tions a binding energy of 1.05 eV (21)), and the oxide is catalytically very active (19, 20).
The universal relation between activation energy and binding energy directly suggests a general approach to op- timizing the catalyst by searching for new materials with adsorbatesurface interaction strengths in the right range.
This principle has already been used to find a new ammo- nia catalyst (22). The adsorption properties of N2 on CoMo alloys turn out to be intermediate between those of Co and Mo which bind nitrogen either too weakly or too strongly;cf. Table 1. The alloy has adsorption properties close to op- timum (cf. Table 1) and it has been found experimentally to be a much better ammonia catalyst than either constituent (22). There is therefore good reason to expect that the same principle of looking for surfaces with close to optimum ad- sorption strengths can be applied to find better catalysts for the other reactions in this class as well as in other classes of reactions.
