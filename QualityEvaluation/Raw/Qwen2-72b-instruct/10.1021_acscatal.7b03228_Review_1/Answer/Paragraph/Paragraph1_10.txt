Single-atom alloys (SAAs) have emerged as a promising geometric approach to enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. The design principles of SAAs involve the precise dispersion of a single metal atom on a supportive matrix, typically a metal substrate, which ensures maximum atom utilization and unique electronic properties. This configuration offers several advantages over traditional metal nanoparticle catalysts. Firstly, SAAs provide a high density of active sites, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. Secondly, the isolated metal atoms in SAAs prevent agglomeration and ensure stability under reaction conditions. Lastly, the electronic structure of the single metal atoms can be finely tuned by the choice of support, leading to improved catalytic performance. Applications of SAAs in selective hydrogenation reactions include the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and renewable fuels, demonstrating their potential in various industries. The geometric approach of SAAs represents a significant advancement in the field of catalysis, offering a new avenue for the design of efficient and selective catalysts.
