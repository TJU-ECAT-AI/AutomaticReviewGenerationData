The utilization of single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, has been shown to significantly enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.7b03228_1\]. These SAAs act as unique sites for hydrogen activation, boosting activity and selectivity.

The utilization of single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, as a geometric approach for enhancing catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions has been extensively explored \[10.1021/acscatal.7b03228_1\]. These SAAs act as unique sites for hydrogen activation, boosting activity and selectivity in selective hydrogenation reactions. DFT calculations have revealed that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation is significantly reduced on these alloys, breaking scaling rules and allowing for a departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis \[10.1021/acscatal.7b03228_1\]. This geometric effect enables improved catalytic performance beyond what is achievable through electronic structure modifications alone.

                The design of successful SAA catalysts involves the use of trace amounts of Pd to promote hydrogen uptake and spillover onto the Cu surface, maintaining isolated Pd atoms to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of reactants, and ensuring that the active metal is the minority component \[10.1039/c3cp51538a\]. These catalysts have the ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems by maximizing the total Cu surface area for selective hydrogenation reactions and ensuring the presence of exclusively isolated Pd atoms \[10.1039/c3cp51538a\]. The reaction conditions for the selective hydrogenation reactions using SAA catalysts include ambient temperature and a head pressure of hydrogen (6.9 bar) in a batch reactor \[10.1039/c3cp51538a\].

The specific advantages of SAA catalysts over traditional catalysts include higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation, improved selectivity to styrene, and the ability to maintain high selectivity over many hours at high conversion \[10.1039/c3cp51538a\].

                The strategy for translating the architecture of the model system to nanoparticles involves adding low concentrations of Pd to Cu nanoparticles using a method that allows for the exchange of Cu atoms with Pd atoms \[10.1039/c3cp51538a\]. The presence of surface CuO confirms that Pd is alloyed with Cu, and the atomic ratio of Cu : Pd in each nanoparticle is 83 : 1 \[10.1039/c3cp51538a\].

The utilization of single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, has revolutionized the field of selective hydrogenation reactions, as demonstrated by Sykes and co-workers \[10.1021/acscatal.7b03228_1\]. These SAAs act as unique sites for hydrogen activation, significantly boosting activity and selectivity in selective hydrogenation reactions. DFT calculations have revealed that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation is notably reduced on these alloys, from 0.4 to 0.02 eV, while the adsorption enthalpy remains relatively unaffected \[10.1021/acscatal.7b03228_1\]. This observation indicates a break from Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi scaling rules, which typically dictate a correlation between the reaction enthalpy and the reaction barrier. By breaking these scaling rules through a geometric effect, SAAs allow for a departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis, leading to enhanced catalytic performance beyond what is achievable through electronic structure modifications alone \[10.1021/acscatal.7b03228_1\].
