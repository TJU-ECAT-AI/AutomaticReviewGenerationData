Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by acting as unique sites for hydrogen activation, boosting activity and selectivity. DFT calculations show that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation is significantly reduced on these alloys, breaking scaling rules and allowing for a departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis. This geometric effect allows for improved catalytic performance beyond what is achievable through electronic structure modifications alone.

Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by acting as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include the use of trace amounts of Pd to promote hydrogen uptake and spillover, maintaining isolated Pd atoms to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of reactants, and ensuring that the active metal is the minority component. These catalysts have the ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems by maximizing the total Cu surface area for selective hydrogenation reactions and ensuring the presence of exclusively isolated Pd atoms. The reaction conditions for the selective hydrogenation reactions using SAA catalysts include ambient temperature and a head pressure of hydrogen (6.9 bar) in a batch reactor. The metal properties that are crucial for the success of SAA catalysts include the ability of Pd to act as a site for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover, and the role of Cu as a surface for selective hydrogenation reactions. The specific advantages of SAA catalysts over traditional catalysts include higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation, improved selectivity to styrene, and the ability to maintain high selectivity over many hours at high conversion. The design of successful SAA catalysts requires the use of trace amounts of Pd to promote hydrogen uptake and spillover onto the Cu surface, ensuring the presence of exclusively isolated Pd atoms to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of reactants, and maximizing the total Cu surface area for selective hydrogenation reactions. The strategy for translating the architecture of the model system to nanoparticles involves adding low concentrations of Pd to Cu nanoparticles using a method that allows for the exchange of Cu atoms with Pd atoms. The presence of surface CuO confirms that Pd is alloyed with Cu, and the atomic ratio of Cu : Pd in each nanoparticle is 83 : 1. The Pd atoms are predominantly on the surface of Cu nanoparticles and are well dispersed, leading to a very high selectivity of the Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 catalyst for selective hydrogenation reactions.

Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by lowering the energy barrier for hydrogen uptake and subsequent desorption, facilitating facile hydrogen dissociation and weak binding of intermediates. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include the ability to easily activate hydrogen dissociation while binding it weakly, which breaks scaling rules and improves selectivity. SAAs offer advantages over traditional catalysts by requiring smaller amounts of precious metals, making them a more attractive alternative. The unique energetic landscape of Pd/Cu SAAs allows for efficient and selective hydrogenation of molecules like styrene and acetylene.
