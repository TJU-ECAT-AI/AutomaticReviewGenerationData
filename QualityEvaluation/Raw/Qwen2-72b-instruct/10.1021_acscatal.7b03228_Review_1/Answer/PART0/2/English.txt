Successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts require mild reaction temperatures to prevent metal-metal diffusion and aggregation. Reactive environments that could lead to metal segregation must be avoided. The chosen reaction should be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy, implying that structure-sensitive reactions are more likely to be successful. These criteria ensure that the unique properties of SAA catalysts, such as the ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity, can be effectively utilized across various catalyst systems.
