          [1] "Sykes and co-workers have demonstrated that Pd atoms embedded in a Cu(111) surface can act as unique sites for the activation of hydrogen and thereby boost activity and selectivity in selective hydrogenation."
          [2] "DFT calculations predicted that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation was reduced from 0.4 to 0.02 eV but that the adsorption enthalpy was not strongly affected (0.35 eV on the alloy but 0.20 eV on Cu(111))."

          Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by acting as unique sites for hydrogen activation, boosting activity and selectivity. DFT calculations show that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation is significantly reduced on these alloys, breaking scaling rules and allowing for a departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis. This geometric effect allows for improved catalytic performance beyond what is achievable through electronic structure modifications alone.

          [1] "The following criteria probably apply for any successful SAA catalyst. First, the reaction temperature must be rather mild. High-temperature reactions (e.g., above the Tamman temperature of the metal) may result in significant metalmetal diffusion leading to aggregation of the guest metal."
          [2] "Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal."
          [3] "Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy. This probably implies that structure sensitive reactions are more likely to be successful."
          [4] "Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal. For example, if one metal forms very strong metaladsorbate bonds but the other does not, then the former metal will migrate to the surface."
          [5] "Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy. This probably implies that structure sensitive reactions are more likely to be successful."
          [6] "Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy. This probably implies that structure sensitive reactions are more likely to be successful."

          Successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts require mild reaction temperatures to prevent metal-metal diffusion and aggregation. Reactive environments that could lead to metal segregation must be avoided. The chosen reaction should be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy, implying that structure-sensitive reactions are more likely to be successful. These criteria ensure that the unique properties of SAA catalysts, such as the ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity, can be effectively utilized across various catalyst systems.

          成功的单原子合金(SAA)催化剂需要温和的反应温度，以防止金属-金属扩散和聚集。必须避免可能导致金属分层的反应环境。所选反应应能够利用由单原子合金创建的几何位点，这意味着结构敏感的反应更有可能成功。这些标准确保了SAA催化剂的独特属性，如打破比例规则和提高选择性，可以在各种催化剂系统中得到有效利用。
