[1] "We report a novel synthesis of nanoparticle PdCu catalysts, containing only trace amounts of Pd, for selective hydrogenation reactions."
[2] "PdCu nanoparticles were designed based on model single atom alloy (SAA) surfaces, in which individual, isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface."
[3] "The catalytic performance of the resulting materials for the partial hydrogenation of phenylacetylene was investigated at ambient temperature in a batch reactor under a head pressure of hydrogen (6.9 bar)."
[4] "The bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles have over an order of magnitude higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart, while maintaining a high selectivity to styrene over many hours at high conversion."
[5] "Greater than 94% selectivity to styrene is observed at all times, which is a marked improvement when compared to monometallic Pd catalysts with the same Pd loading, at the same total conversion."
[6] "These model studies addressed a wide range of Pd concentrations related to the bimetallic nanoparticles."
[7] "The objective is to prepare a catalyst with an optimum loading of the active metal for hydrogen activation while maximizing the total Cu surface area on which selective hydrogenation reactions can take place."
[8] "In addition, exclusively isolated atoms of Pd must be present to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of the reac- tants by larger Pd ensembles."
[9] "The important difference in this work is that the active metal (Pd) is the minority component, and only individual, isolated atoms are needed to promote hydrogen uptake dissociation and spillover."
[10] "The strategy for translating the architecture of this model system to nanoparticles is to add low concentrations of Pd to Cu nanoparticles utilizing a method by which Cu atoms are exchanged with Pd atoms."
[11] "The presence of surface CuO confirms that the binding energy shift in the Pd 3d5/2 peak for Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 shown in Fig. 6B is due to partial oxidation of Pd by CuO; more importantly, this demonstrates that Pd is alloyed with Cu."
[12] "Based on the proximity of the theoretical and experimental atomic ratios of Cu: Pd, and the nature of Pd uptake by GR, it is expected that Pd exists predominantly on the surface of Cu nanoparticles and is well dispersed."
[13] "Hence, a very high selectivity of the Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 catalyst, containing only trace amounts of Pd, is demonstrated."
[14] "The bimetallic Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 had a lower initial rate per gram of Pd than either monometallic catalyst."
[15] "In our case Pd is the minority metal, and based on model catalyst studies, is expected to act as a site for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the Cu host, where selective hydrogenation can take place."
[16] "Consequently, a lower rate of phenylacetylene hydrogenation is anticipated compared to a catalyst where hydrogenation takes place predominately on Pd."
[17] "The SAA strategy stemming from model catalytic studies was used in this work to prepare PdCu alloy nanoparticles where trace amounts of Pd (0.18 at%) were deposited exclusively onto the surface of Cu nanoparticles by GR."
[18] "Using UV-vis spectroscopy and XPS we demonstrate that complete uptake of Pd took place by GR, and that Pd exists on the surface of Cu nanoparticles."
[19] "This catalyst shows a marked improvement in the selectivity to styrene when compared to the same amount of Pd on Al2O3, while preserving a high rate of phenylacetylene hydrogenation."
[20] "Based on a combination of surface science studies and heterogeneous catalyst performance measured at near ambient conditions, we propose that the high selectivity of Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 is due to hydrogen spillover on the Cu surface."
[21] "Whereas small amounts of Cu are typically added as a promoter to Pd catalysts, we show here that Cu can be used as a catalyst for selective hydrogenations with the addition of trace amounts of a precious metal with a low barrier for hydrogen dissociation."

1.Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by acting as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include the use of trace amounts of Pd to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of reactants by larger Pd ensembles, maximizing the total Cu surface area for selective hydrogenation reactions, and ensuring that Pd exists predominantly on the surface of Cu nanoparticles and is well dispersed. These catalysts have the ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems by promoting hydrogen uptake dissociation and spillover onto the Cu surface, where selective hydrogenation can take place.

1.单原子合金，特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过充当氢气吸收、解离和溢流到周围Cu表面的位点，增强了选择性氢化反应的催化性能。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括使用痕量的Pd以避免通过较大的Pd集合体完全氢化或分解反应物，最大化总Cu表面积以进行选择性氢化反应，并确保Pd主要存在于Cu纳米颗粒的表面且分布良好。这些催化剂通过促进氢气吸收解离和溢流到Cu表面，使选择性氢化可以在那里发生，从而打破了尺度规则并提高了各种催化剂系统的选择性。
