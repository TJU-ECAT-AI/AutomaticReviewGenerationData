[1] "We report a novel synthesis of nanoparticle PdCu catalysts, containing only trace amounts of Pd, for selective hydrogenation reactions."
[2] "PdCu nanoparticles were designed based on model single atom alloy (SAA) surfaces, in which individual, isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface."
[3] "The catalytic performance of the resulting materials for the partial hydrogenation of phenylacetylene was investigated at ambient temperature in a batch reactor under a head pressure of hydrogen (6.9 bar)."
[4] "The bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles have over an order of magnitude higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart, while maintaining a high selectivity to styrene over many hours at high conversion."
[5] "Greater than 94% selectivity to styrene is observed at all times, which is a marked improvement when compared to monometallic Pd catalysts with the same Pd loading, at the same total conversion."
[6] "These model studies addressed a wide range of Pd concentrations related to the bimetallic nanoparticles."
[7] "The objective is to prepare a catalyst with an optimum loading of the active metal for hydrogen activation while maximizing the total Cu surface area on which selective hydrogenation reactions can take place."
[8] "In addition, exclusively isolated atoms of Pd must be present to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of the reac- tants by larger Pd ensembles."
[9] "The important difference in this work is that the active metal (Pd) is the minority component, and only individual, isolated atoms are needed to promote hydrogen uptake dissociation and spillover."
[10] "The strategy for translating the architecture of this model system to nanoparticles is to add low concentrations of Pd to Cu nanoparticles utilizing a method by which Cu atoms are exchanged with Pd atoms."
[11] "The presence of surface CuO confirms that the binding energy shift in the Pd 3d5/2 peak for Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 shown in Fig. 6B is due to partial oxidation of Pd by CuO; more importantly, this demonstrates that Pd is alloyed with Cu."
[12] "Based on UV-vis measurments presented in Fig. 5A, which confirm the complete uptake of Pd, the atomic ratio of Cu : Pd in each nanoparticle (based on total metal loading) is 83 : 1."
[13] "While XPS spectroscopy is a surface technique, the signal can be representative of several atomic layers beneath the surface."
[14] "It is expected that Pd exists predominantly on the surface of Cu nanoparticles and is well dispersed."
[15] "Hence, a very high selectivity of the Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 catalyst, containing only trace amounts of Pd, is demonstrated."
[16] "The bimetallic Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 had a lower initial rate per gram of Pd than either monometallic catalyst."
[17] "Consequently, a lower rate of phenylacetylene hydrogenation is anticipated compared to a catalyst where hydrogenation takes place predominately on Pd."
[18] "We propose that the high selectivity of Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 is due to hydrogen spillover on the Cu surface."
[19] "Whereas small amounts of Cu are typically added as a promoter to Pd catalysts, we show here that Cu can be used as a catalyst for selective hydrogenations with the addition of trace amounts of a precious metal with a low barrier for hydrogen dissociation."

1.Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by acting as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include the use of trace amounts of Pd to promote hydrogen uptake and spillover, maintaining isolated Pd atoms to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of reactants, and ensuring that the active metal is the minority component. These catalysts have the ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems by maximizing the total Cu surface area for selective hydrogenation reactions and ensuring the presence of exclusively isolated Pd atoms.
2.The reaction conditions for the selective hydrogenation reactions using SAA catalysts include ambient temperature and a head pressure of hydrogen (6.9 bar) in a batch reactor. The metal properties that are crucial for the success of SAA catalysts include the ability of Pd to act as a site for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover, and the role of Cu as a surface for selective hydrogenation reactions. The specific advantages of SAA catalysts over traditional catalysts include higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation, improved selectivity to styrene, and the ability to maintain high selectivity over many hours at high conversion.
3.The design of successful SAA catalysts requires the use of trace amounts of Pd to promote hydrogen uptake and spillover onto the Cu surface, ensuring the presence of exclusively isolated Pd atoms to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of reactants, and maximizing the total Cu surface area for selective hydrogenation reactions. The strategy for translating the architecture of the model system to nanoparticles involves adding low concentrations of Pd to Cu nanoparticles using a method that allows for the exchange of Cu atoms with Pd atoms. The presence of surface CuO confirms that Pd is alloyed with Cu, and the atomic ratio of Cu : Pd in each nanoparticle is 83 : 1. The Pd atoms are predominantly on the surface of Cu nanoparticles and are well dispersed, leading to a very high selectivity of the Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 catalyst for selective hydrogenation reactions.
