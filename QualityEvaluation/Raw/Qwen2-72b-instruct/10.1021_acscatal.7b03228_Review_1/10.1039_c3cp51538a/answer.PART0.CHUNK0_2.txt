[1] "We report a novel synthesis of nanoparticle PdCu catalysts, containing only trace amounts of Pd, for selective hydrogenation reactions."
[2] "PdCu nanoparticles were designed based on model single atom alloy (SAA) surfaces, in which individual, isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface."
[3] "The catalytic performance of the resulting materials for the partial hydrogenation of phenylacetylene was investigated at ambient temperature in a batch reactor under a head pressure of hydrogen (6.9 bar)."
[4] "The bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles have over an order of magnitude higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart, while maintaining a high selectivity to styrene over many hours at high conversion."
[5] "Greater than 94% selectivity to styrene is observed at all times, which is a marked improvement when compared to monometallic Pd catalysts with the same Pd loading, at the same total conversion."
[6] "These model studies addressed a wide range of Pd concentrations related to the bimetallic nanoparticles."
[7] "The role of Cu in promoting selective hydrogenations in PdCu systems depends heavily on the composition and nano-scale structure of the alloy."
[8] "The electronic perturbation of Pd by Cu has been modeled using DFT by Fernandez-Garcia et al. for Pd1Cu12 and Pd4Cu6 clusters, where charge transfer from Cu to Pd was found to leave surface Pd atoms with a slight negative charge."
[9] "The STS spectra revealed that isolated Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface carried a slightly positive charge due to a localized depletion of electron density that arises from surface state electron scattering from the Pd atoms."
[10] "The complex interplay between the bimetallic alloy structure and the catalytic performance of PdCu alloys, or structure function relationships, can be better understood in well defined systems such as single crystal surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV)."
[11] "In effect, these surface science studies may provide a strategy for preparing heterogeneous bimetallic cat- alysts for hydrogenation reactions at near ambient conditions."
[12] "Nanoparticle catalysts were prepared by depositing small amounts of Pd exclusively onto the surface of pre-formed Cu nanoparticles by the galvanic replacement (GR) reaction."
[13] "The catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts was compared to mon- ometallic Pd catalysts with the same Pd loading."
[14] "Model catalytic studies were applied to guide the design of the nanoparticle catalysts."
[15] "High resolution STM imaging and thermal desorption spectroscopy were used to determine a range of Pd concentra- tions in and on Cu(111) for which hydrogen spillover is feasible, while avoiding the formation of large Pd ensembles that lead to poor selectivity."
[16] "The objective is to prepare a catalyst with an optimum loading of the active metal for hydrogen activation while maximizing the total Cu surface area on which selective hydrogenation reactions can take place."
[17] "In addition, exclusively isolated atoms of Pd must be present to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of the reac- tants by larger Pd ensembles."
[18] "The important difference in this work is that the active metal (Pd) is the minority component, and only individual, isolated atoms are needed to promote hydrogen uptake dissociation and spillover."
[19] "The strategy for translating the architecture of this model system to nanoparticles is to add low concentrations of Pd to Cu nanoparticles utilizing a method by which Cu atoms are exchanged with Pd atoms."
[20] "The XPS results shown in Fig. 6B indicate that alloying took place."
[21] "The observed energy shift compares very well to that reported by Guczi for Cu0.05Pd1.5 and Cu0.05Pd0.6 nanoparticles supported on pumice after hydrogen treatment at 298 K (Pd 3d5/2 at 335.6 eV)."
[22] "It is feasible, however, that after GR, oxidation of Cu on the surface of Pd0.18Cu15Al2O3 took place from exposure to air before the sample was prepared for XPS measurements; as such, the oxidation of Pd by CuO would cause a shift to slightly higher binding energies."
[23] "This was explained by interaction with the pumice support upon the reduction of CuO; prior to reduction, Pd was thought to be slightly oxidized by CuO."
[24] "The presence of surface CuO confirms that the binding energy shift in the Pd 3d5/2 peak for Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 shown in Fig. 6B is due to partial oxidation of Pd by CuO; more importantly, this demonstrates that Pd is alloyed with Cu."
[25] "Based on UV-vis measurments presented in Fig. 5A, which confirm the complete uptake of Pd, the atomic ratio of Cu : Pd in each nanoparticle (based on total metal loading) is 83 : 1."
[26] "While XPS spectroscopy is a surface technique, the signal can be representative of several atomic layers beneath the surface."
[27] "The calculated atomic ratios are slightly higher than measured by XPS (20 :1), which is most likely due to a combination of uncertainties."
[28] "Nevertheless, based on the proximity of the theoretical and experimental atomic ratios of Cu: Pd, and the nature of Pd uptake by GR, it is expected that Pd exists predominantly on the surface of Cu nanoparticles and is well dispersed."
[29] "The bimetallic Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 had a styrene selectivity of approximately 94% when the reaction reaches 90% conver- sion; conversely, Pd0.18/Al2O3 has a selectivity of 62% at the same conversion."
[30] "The initial rates per gram of Pd shown in Fig. 8A are comparable to previous reports for highly dispersed Pd catalysts."
[31] "The bimetallic Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 had a lower initial rate per gram of Pd than either monometallic catalyst."
[32] "In our case Pd is the minority metal, and based on model catalyst studies, is expected to act as a site for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the Cu host, where selective hydrogenation can take place."
[33] "Consequently, a lower rate of phenylacetylene hydrogenation is anticipated compared to a catalyst where hydrogenation takes place predominately on Pd."
[34] "It should be noted that improvements in selectivity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation have been previously reported, resulting from and not limited to the use of different catalyst supports, bimetallic catalysts, and organometallic precursors."
[35] "Unlike most previous investigations, our results demonstrate that a very low amount of active metal (Pd) within the bimetallic catalyst can activate an otherwise inactive Cu nanoparticle for the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene."
[36] "In addition, model catalytic studies have guided the development of the PdCu nanoparticle catalysts, and demonstrated the feasibility of hydrogen spillover on such materials."

1.Single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by acting as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include the use of trace amounts of Pd, ensuring that the Pd atoms are isolated and not forming large ensembles, which can lead to poor selectivity. The reaction conditions should be near ambient, and the metal properties should allow for hydrogen spillover onto the Cu surface. SAAs have specific advantages over traditional catalysts, including their ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems. The high selectivity of PdCu SAAs is attributed to hydrogen spillover on the Cu surface, where selective hydrogenation can take place.

1.单原子合金（SAAs），特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过充当氢气吸收、解离和溢流到周围Cu表面的位点，增强了选择性氢化反应的催化性能。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括使用微量的Pd，确保Pd原子是孤立的，而不是形成大集合体，这可能导致选择性差。反应条件应接近常温常压，金属特性应允许氢气溢流到Cu表面。SAAs与传统催化剂相比具有特定的优势，包括它们能够打破比例规则，并在各种催化剂系统中提高选择性。PdCu SAAs的高选择性归因于Cu表面上的氢气溢流，选择性氢化可以在此发生。
