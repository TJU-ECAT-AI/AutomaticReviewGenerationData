1.Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by acting as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include the use of trace amounts of Pd, which can break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems. The reaction conditions should be ambient temperature and pressure, and the metal properties should allow for the complete uptake and alloying of Pd with Cu. The specific advantages over traditional catalysts include higher activity for hydrogenation reactions, high selectivity to desired products, and the ability to maintain these properties over many hours at high conversion. The use of single-atom alloys can lead to greater than 94% selectivity to styrene in the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, which is a marked improvement over monometallic Pd catalysts with the same Pd loading.

1.单原子合金，特别是嵌入铜表面的钯原子，通过作为氢吸收、解离和溢流到周围铜表面的位点，增强了选择性氢化反应的催化性能。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括使用痕量的钯，这可以打破尺度规则，并在各种催化剂系统中提高选择性。反应条件应为常温和常压，金属性质应允许钯完全被铜吸收和合金化。与传统催化剂相比，单原子合金催化剂的具体优势包括对氢化反应的更高活性，对所需产物的高选择性，以及在高转化率下维持这些性质的能力。单原子合金的使用可以使苯乙炔氢化中对苯乙烯的选择性超过94%，这与具有相同钯负载的单金属钯催化剂相比是一个显著的改进。
