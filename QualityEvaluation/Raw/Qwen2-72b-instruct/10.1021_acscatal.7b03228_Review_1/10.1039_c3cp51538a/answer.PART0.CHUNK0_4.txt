[1] "We report a novel synthesis of nanoparticle PdCu catalysts, containing only trace amounts of Pd, for selective hydrogenation reactions."
[2] "PdCu nanoparticles were designed based on model single atom alloy (SAA) surfaces, in which individual, isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation,and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface."
[3] "The catalytic performance of the resulting materials for the partial hydrogenation of phenyl- acetylene was investigated at ambient temperature in a batch reactor under a head pressure of hydro- gen (6.9 bar)."
[4] "The bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles have over an order of magnitude higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart, while maintaining a high selectivity to styrene over many hours at high conversion."
[5] "Greater than 94% selectivity to styrene is observed at all times, which is a marked improvement when compared to monometallic Pd catalysts with the same Pd loading, at the same total conversion."
[6] "These model studies addressed a wide range of Pd concentrations related to the bimetallic nanoparticles."
[7] "The objective is to prepare a catalyst with an optimum loading of the active metal for hydrogen activation while maximizing the total Cu surface area on which selective hydrogenation reactions can take place."
[8] "In addition, exclusively isolated atoms of Pd must be present to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of the reac- tants by larger Pd ensembles."
[9] "The important difference in this work is that the active metal (Pd) is the minority component, and only individual, isolated atoms are needed to promote hydrogen uptake dissociation and spillover."
[10] "The strategy for translating the architecture of this model system to nanoparticles is to add low concentrations of Pd to Cu nanoparticles utilizing a method by which Cu atoms are exchanged with Pd atoms."

1.Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by acting as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include the use of trace amounts of Pd to promote hydrogen activation while maximizing the total Cu surface area for selective hydrogenation reactions. Isolated Pd atoms must be present to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of reactants by larger Pd ensembles. The active metal (Pd) is the minority component, and only individual, isolated atoms are needed to promote hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover. The strategy for translating the architecture of this model system to nanoparticles involves adding low concentrations of Pd to Cu nanoparticles using a method that allows Cu atoms to be exchanged with Pd atoms.

1.单原子合金，特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过充当氢气吸收、解离和溢流到周围Cu表面的位点，增强了选择性氢化反应的催化性能。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括使用微量的Pd来促进氢气活化，同时最大化总Cu表面积以进行选择性氢化反应。必须存在孤立的Pd原子，以避免由较大的Pd集合体引起的完全氢化或反应物分解。活性金属（Pd）是少数成分，只需要个别孤立的原子来促进氢气吸收、解离和溢流。将这种模型系统的架构转化为纳米颗粒的策略涉及使用允许Cu原子与Pd原子交换的方法，向Cu纳米颗粒添加低浓度的Pd。
