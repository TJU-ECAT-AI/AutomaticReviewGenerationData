PUBLISHED ONLINE: 12 SEPTEMBER 2010  DOI: 10.1038/NMAT2849 Controlled selectivity for palladium catalysts using self-assembled monolayers Stephen T. Marshall1, Marykate OBrien1, Brittany Oetter1, April Corpuz2, Ryan M. Richards2, Daniel K. Schwartz1 and J. William Medlin1* The selective reaction of one part of a bifunctional molecule is a fundamental challenge in heterogeneous catalysis and for many processes including the conversion of biomass-derived intermediates. Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated epoxides to saturated epoxides is particularly difficult given the reactivity of the strained epoxide ring, and traditional platinum group catalysts show low selectivities. We describe the preparation of highly selective Pd catalysts involving the deposition of n-alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) coatings. These coatings improve the selectivity of 1-epoxybutane formation from 1-epoxy-3-butene on palladium catalysts from 11 to 94% at equivalent reaction conditions and conversions. Although sulphur species are generally considered to be indiscriminate catalyst poisons, the reaction rate to the desired product on a catalyst coated with a thiol was 40% of the rate on an uncoated catalyst. Interestingly the activity decreased for less-ordered SAMs with shorter chains. The behaviour of SAM-coated catalysts was compared with catalysts where surface sites were modified by carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons or sulphur atoms. The results suggest that the SAMs restrict sulphur coverage to enhance selectivity without significantly poisoning the activity of the desired reaction.

eterogeneous catalysts are widely used in industrial processes because of their stability and ease of catalyst recovery compared with their homogeneous counterparts.
However, the promiscuity of these catalysts commonly leads to low selectivity, which increases costs of product purification and waste1.
In contrast to heterogeneous catalysts, biological and synthetic homogeneous catalysts commonly achieve high selectivity through specific non-covalent or steric interactions between functional groups on the catalyst and reactant. For example, enzymes are able to achieve excellent selectivity through specific interactions between a reactant and amino-acid residues near the active site2.
Similarly, synthetic homogeneous catalysts engineered through the modification of porphyrin with aromatic ligands are highly selective for chiral epoxidation3 and reactions of proteins and aromatics4. Although heterogeneous catalysts modified with chiral organic ligands are employed to enable selective asymmetric hydrogenation5, analogous modifiers for chemoselective reactivity have not been identified.
The hydrogenation of unsaturated epoxides is one class of reactions where identifying such modifiers would prove valuable. These molecules are useful model compounds for a growing feedstock of unsaturated oxygenates that are derived from biomass6,7. In addition, a model unsaturated epoxide reactant,1-epoxy-3-butene (EpB), can be cheaply and selectively produced from butadiene on supported silver catalysts8. EpB contains two functional groups, a COC epoxide ring and a C=C double bond.
Selective hydrogenation of the double bond produces epoxybutane,a valuable commodity chemical used in the manufacture of polyethers, surfactants, glycols, polyesters, epoxy resins and fuel additives9,10. However, EpB forms many products with hydrogen, as demonstrated in Fig. 1, and selective hydrogenation of the double bond is difficult. Surface science studies show that EpB forms strongly bound intermediates on Pd(111) through facile epoxide 1Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Colorado at Boulder, UCB 424. Boulder, Colorado 80309, USA, 2Department of Chemistry and Geochemistry, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado 80401, USA. *e-mail: Will.Medlin@colorado.edu. ring opening to form an aldehyde intermediate11. Unlike other metals such as Ag (ref. 12), Pd causes irreversible ring opening.
Reacting EpB with hydrogen on supported Pd and Pt catalysts yields epoxybutane with a selectivity of less than 20% at temperatures above ambient and conversions greater than 5% (ref. 13).
Here, we modified conventional Pd/Al2O3 catalysts with alkanethiol coatings. When deposited on a metal surface from a dilute solution, these thiols spontaneously arrange to form a SAM (ref. 14). The thiol species typically form a commensurate epitaxial layer such as the (3×3)R30 structure of n-alkanethiol SAMs (in this case propanethiol) on Pd(111) surfaces shown in Fig. 2. Thiol monolayers consist of a sulphur atom head with a hydrocarbon tail, which can comprise a number of functionalities such as alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, acids, amines and aromatics.
Herein, we show that surface modification with alkanethiols can be used to produce a well-defined near-surface environment that alters reactivity for multifunctional compounds.
Figure 3 summarizes the effectiveness of alkanethiol SAMs on conventional Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in enhancing selective EpB reduction to epoxybutane. Alkanethiol coatings with varying tail lengths were evaluated and characterized including propanethiol (C3), hexanethiol (C6), dodecanethiol (C12) and octadecanethiol (C18). On uncoated palladium catalysts, selectivity for epoxybutane at 313 K was 11% at 5% EpB conversion, consistent with previous studies13. After applying the alkanethiol coatings, the selectivity for epoxybutane increased to 8094% at the same conversion depending on thiol tail length, as shown in Fig. 3. On the coated catalysts, crotonaldehyde was the main by-product (315%), with butyraldehyde and alcohols as minor products (<2% each).The uncoated catalyst primarily produced crotonaldehyde (36%),alcohols (44%) and butyraldehyde (7%) along with small amounts of deoxygenation and decarbonylation products in addition to epoxybutane.NATURE MATERIALS  VOL 9  OCTOBER 2010  www.nature.com/naturematerials 853 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Experiments were also conducted varying the amount of catalyst (up to 200 mg) and the total feed flow rate to evaluate selectivity as a function of EpB conversion for the uncoated and octadecanethiol- coated catalysts at 313 K. Whereas selectivity on the uncoated catalyst exhibited a maximum of 31  3% at less than 1% EpB conversion and decreased to 8  2% at between 99 and 100% EpB conversion, selectivity on the C18-coated catalyst was greater than 99% at less than 1% conversion, and 532% at between 99 and 100% conversion.
As shown in Fig. 3, the activity of the SAM-coated catalysts (shown as apparent turnover frequency) decreased relative to the uncoated catalyst, and increased significantly with increasing thiol tail length despite the increasing thickness of the monolayer film above the active surface. The most active SAM-coated catalyst, C18,exhibited epoxybutane formation rates that were approximately 40% of the rate for the uncoated catalyst. Each experiment was conducted over a period of up to 12 h, during which no deactivation was observed. Experiments conducted at 323 and 333 K showed similar trends as the results in Fig. 3.
Taken together, the data in Fig. 3 suggest that although the identity of the moiety attached to the thiol group (that is, the so-called tail group) is a major determinant of the activity of the modified catalyst, the selectivity is essentially independent of the tail group identity, and is therefore likely to be due to the arrangement of the sulphur atoms. This conjecture is supported by further experiments we carried out in which the catalyst was coated with SAMs comprising hydroxy-terminated C3 and C6 alkanethiols and thioglycerol. Although the activity associated with monolayers produced from the hydroxylated thiolates varied significantly, as shown in Fig. 3, the selectivity was again high across all SAMs.
Vibrational spectroscopy has been used extensively to determine the degree of molecular organization with SAMs deposited on Pd (ref. 14), Ag (ref. 15), Cu (ref. 15) and Au (refs 1518). In particular, SAMs exhibit a greater number of Gauche defects with increasing disorder, causing the methylene dstretching mode to shift from 2,920 cm1, a value consistent with crystalline alkanes,to 2,928 cm1, a value consistent with liquid- or solution-phase alkanes16. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of the alkanethiol-coated catalysts deposited from 10 mM ethanolic solutions are shown in Fig. 4. For the C3-coated catalyst,the methylene dstretching mode was observed at 2,929 cm1,indicating that the thiol tails were highly disordered and in a liquid-like state. On the C6- and C12-coated catalysts this mode was observed at 2,925 and 2,923 cm1, respectively, indicating more- ordered monolayers. The C18-coated catalyst exhibited this mode at 2,921 cm1, consistent with an ordered SAM on polycrystalline palladium14. The correlation between alkyl chain order and catalytic activity is striking, and suggests that within the homologous series of alkanethiols, coatings with greater molecular order have higher activity compared with less well-ordered coatings.
Quantifying reaction rates at different temperatures enables the determination of apparent activation energies. Apparent activation energies for olefin hydrogenation reactions are generally found to be 3342 kJ mol1 on a variety of metals with different electronic and geometric structures1,19. Values outside this range indicate a change in the reaction mechanism for hydrogenation or a change in the rate-determining step, such as the desorption of tightly bound carbon monoxide (CO) to make space for the reactants20 or mass-transfer limitations1,21. Experimental values for activation energy were 41  3, 42  3, 41  4 and 39  2 kJ mol1 for the C3-, C6-, C12- and C18-coated catalysts respectively. These values indicate that thiol-coated catalysts seem to behave similarly to their traditional metal counterparts and probably share a similar olefin hydrogenation mechanism. In addition, these results suggest that the presence of the SAM does not induce a significant mass- transfer barrier for the diffusion of EpB through the SAM coating to the metal surface.
The contrast between the uniformly high epoxybutane selectivity for all of the alkanethiol coatings and the activity varying with tail length suggests differing mechanisms for the effect of the SAMs on selectivity and activity. One possible mechanism by which SAMs may enhance selectivity is through site blocking to control ensemble sizes. Surface modification to control metal ensemble size is a common and effective practice to improve selectivity in a variety of systems, such as the synthesis of vinyl acetate on PdAu bimetallic catalysts22. To determine whether ensemble effects alone may be responsible for the enhanced selectivity of thiol-coated catalysts, EpB hydrogenation experiments were conducted using a feed containing a variable amount of CO. Unlike sulphur, CO primarily blocks olefin hydrogenation sites without significantly impacting electronic structure20. Therefore, varying CO exposure probes the impact of ensemble sizes and adsorbate mobility.

Figure 2  The structure of a propanethiol SAM on Pd(111). The figure on the right is a space-filling model shown from above, which illustrates the space available on the surface for reaction. addition, at coverages up to 1/3 of a monolayer, CO adsorbs in a (3 × 3)R30 structure on Pd(111) hollow sites23, which is the same structure observed for hexanethiol SAMs on Au(111) (ref. 24). Selectivity and activity for epoxybutane were evaluated for CO concentrations up to 3,500 ppm, at which point the catalyst activity became negligible. A modest, approximately linear, increase in selectivity to epoxybutane with CO concentration was observed,with a maximum selectivity of only 30% when the surface was nearly saturated with CO. As the catalyst approached saturation,the reaction rate dropped suddenly at 2,500 ppm CO. This step change is similar to the step change observed in the activation barrier of ethylene hydrogenation in the presence of increasing concentrations of CO on Pt(111) (ref. 25). A plot of these data is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. As the observed maximum in selectivity closely matches the selectivity of the palladium catalyst at low conversion (313%), it is clear that ensemble effects alone do not play a critical role in the observed selectivity enhancement.
As the molecular structure of the alkanethiol, rather than its function as merely a site-blocking agent, seems to be key to the observation of high selectivity, we conducted experiments that independently examined the effects of the two component parts of the alkanethiol: the sulphur head group and the alkyl tail group.
It is noted that separation of the two components is not rigorously possible, because they do not operate independently in formation of SAMs. However, such experiments provide key insights into the mechanism for the high selectivity provided by the SAM coatings.
To investigate the effect of the head group, we exposed the uncoated catalyst to 1,000 ppm H2S in nitrogen for periods between 5 s and 2 h at room temperature and then purged the residual H2S in an inert nitrogen atmosphere. H2S dissociates on Pd and can form ordered structures similar to SAMs (ref. 26), so it serves as a means of evaluating the effect of surface sulphur without the presence of an alkyl tail. Figure 5 shows that the selectivity was enhanced at low sulphur exposures; however, larger exposures resulted in nearly complete deactivation. The gradual decrease in selectivity and activity with exposure may result from the formation of subsurface sulphur, which can poison hydrogen adsorption26. The epoxybu- tane formation rate on the sulphided catalysts was at best 31% of the rate observed on octadecanethiol-coated catalysts and only slightly higher than the rate observed on propanethiol-coated catalysts.
The impact of the alkyl tail without surface sulphur was evaluated by exposing the palladium catalyst to alkenes to produce a metal surface containing substantial coverages of alkylidyne (C(CH2)nCH3) species. Alkanethiols in SAMs adsorb on the (111) crystal plane of face-centred-cubic (fcc) metals in the same (3 × 3)R30 geometry24 as alkylidynes such as ethylidyne27.
In addition, the potential energy surfaces for alkanethiols28 and ethylidyne29 diffusing on fcc(111) metals are similar, indicating that these adsorbates have similar mobilities at low coverage. Therefore,we aged the palladium catalyst in dilute propylene, 1-hexene or 1-dodecene to produce catalysts with alkylidyne structures similar to SAMs. Catalysts aged in propylene or 1-hexene showed similar activities and selectivities for epoxybutane formation as the uncoated catalyst; however, unlike the uncoated catalyst, only trace Selectivity to epoxybutane (%) Uncoated   C18

The catalyst aged in 1-dodecene had an epoxybutane formation rate of 0.13  0.02 mol g1 s1, intermediate to the C6 and C12 alkanethiol SAM catalysts, and a selectivity of 655%.DRIFT spectra for the alkene-aged catalysts, shown in Supple- mentary Fig. S2, reveal the presence of disordered alkylidynes in each case, indicated by asymmetric methylene stretching modes at 2,935 and 2,965 cm1, which were previously reported after 1-hexene adsorption on Ru(0,001) (ref. 30). The 1-dodecene- aged catalyst differs from its shorter counterparts owing to the prevalence of an extra mode at 2,860 cm1, which is consistent with carbonaceous deposits observed from exposure to alkynes such as acetylene31 or hexyne32. This mode is also present in the propylene- and 1-hexene-aged catalysts as a shoulder to the methyl stretching mode at 2,800 cm1; however, it is less intense. These results indicate that alkylidynes cannot produce the same selectivity enhancement observed for SAMs and the observed enhancement for the 1-dodecene case probably results from the formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposits in larger, less-mobile structures than surface alkylidynes or alkanethiol SAMs.Cumulatively, the results above suggest that the sulphur head group of the alkanethiol SAMs is most likely to be responsible for the high selectivity for epoxybutane formation, because high selectivity is observed for all tail lengths and atomic sulphur deposited on the surface, but is not observed after deposition of surface CO or alkylidynes. Previous studies show that the effect of surface sulphur can change both the geometric and electronic structure of platinum group metals33. Geometric effects alter the crystallinity of the underlying surface, which may reduce the activity of reactions requiring multiple metal atoms and tightly bound intermediates, such as epoxide hydrogenolysis.Electronic effects similar to those that may occur from surface sulphur have been observed for the synthesis of vinyl acetate on palladium. At high coverage, lateral interactions and electron- withdrawing effects destabilize adsorbates, favouring bond-making reactions over bond-breaking reactions, which require more tightly bound species34. Identical adsorbateadsorbate interactions have been demonstrated using density functional theory for single- atom adsorbates such as oxygen35, so it is likely that adsorbed sulphur could carry out a similar function. Unlike the uncoated catalyst, the SAM-coated catalysts did not effectively catalyse the hydrogenolysis of EpB to form alcohols or the formation of NATURE MATERIALS  VOL 9  OCTOBER 2010  www.nature.com/naturematerials 855 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We found that EpB adsorbed on uncoated Pd(111) through its olefin function and underwent irreversible epoxide ring opening at temperatures below 200 K, consistent with a low-energy barrier for epoxide ring opening11. This reaction was confirmed by the observation that no desorption of intact EpB was detected as the temperature was increased. However, on Pd(111) coated with a C6 SAM, intact EpB was observed to desorb at 260 K, suggesting that the barrier for epoxide ring opening was increased significantly in the presence of the SAM. In addition, the saturated analogue, epoxybutane,desorbed at 190 K, suggesting that epoxide interactions with the surface are significantly destabilized. The presence of the SAM did not seem to prevent EpB adsorption to Pd through the olefin moiety because EpB was observed to desorb at a temperature similar to that observed for ethylene and propylene on Pd(111) (refs 36,37). Details of this method and spectra for the experiments described above are provided in the Supplementary Information and Fig. S3. This relative change in adsorption energy between the olefin and epoxide functionalities may be crucial to the mechanism for sulphur-enhanced selectivity, as first-principles calculations predict that increasing adsorption strength of the desired functional group may aid in the selective hydrogenation of a similar class of molecules, unsaturated aldehydes38.
Pd(111) was used for TPD experiments in this work, and this crystal plane is most commonly used when characterizing SAMs.
Although the low dispersion of the catalyst employed in this study ensures that a large fraction of the surface will consist of this crystal plane, the supported Pd catalyst does not present a purely (111) surface, but rather many surface facets. These other facets predominantly include (100) surface facets and corner and edge sites. Studies of SAMs on Au(100) suggest the formation of a c(2 × 2) structure, which has a higher coverage than its (111) counterpart39. Similarly, studies of SAMs on gold nanoparticles show thiol coverages greater than 60% (ref. 40), probably owing to higher coverage on corner and edge sites, as model studies show sulphur binds more tightly at these locations41.

Nevertheless, the surface crowding effect of alkanethiol deposition is expected to be even greater on more open surface facets, and thus the general mechanisms for reactivity described above would be expected to still be important on surfaces other than Pd(111). Ongoing investigations of the role of Pd particle morphology can shed further light on the role of crystallite morphology.
Although the sulphur head group of alkanethiol SAMs seems to control selectivity modification, the tail groups have a strong influence on activity. Figure 3 and the DRIFT spectroscopy results show that longer, more-ordered tails have the highest activity.
The decrease in activity with decreasing order does not seem to result from mass-transfer limitations through the tail; such effects would result in a decrease in apparent activation energy. Instead,we propose that disordered tails reduce activity in the near-surface region through one of two possible mechanisms. Disordered tails can physically block access to active sites or reduce the mobility of adsorbed thiols. Such a blockage would result in the identical (within experimental uncertainty) activation barriers and product distributions observed for each tail length. It is also possible that disordered tails may increase the entropic barrier to adsorption,which would also leave the activation barrier for epoxybutane for- mation unchanged; however, all reaction pathways would have to be affected equally to retain the same product distribution. Differences in activity between metals that exhibit identical activation barriers for olefin hydrogenation reactions are commonly attributed to such entropic effects19. Regardless, the significant reaction rates observed even for relatively long SAM tails suggest the potential to use a wide variety of complex SAM structures, even those that significantly crowd the surface, to modify selectivity of supported metal catalysts.
The results for EpB are supported by similar experiments using an αβ unsaturated aldehyde, crotonaldehyde (2-buten-1-al).
Experiments testing crotonaldehyde hydrogenation at 313 K on a C6-thiol-coated catalyst showed 100% selectivity for butyraldehyde,the product formed by reduction of the C=C double bond.
Although achieving high selectivity for this reaction is facile on Pd catalysts42, the thiol-coated catalyst continued to achieve 100% selectivity for butyraldehyde regardless of conversion or reactor residence time, whereas the uncoated catalyst produced 1-butanol at high conversions and residence times. This result indicates that selectivity promotion with thiol SAMs and supported catalysts may be applicable to a variety of reactions of importance with 856 NATURE MATERIALS  VOL 9  OCTOBER 2010  www.nature.com/naturematerials 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

similar reaction pathways, such as the selective hydrogenation of a double bond over other functional groups including aldehydes,acids, nitriles or alkynes.
As surface sulphur is primarily responsible for enhanced selectiv- ity and disordered thiol tails can reduce activity, it is reasonable to conclude that exposure to alternative forms of sulphiding could be superior to SAMs. However, SAMs provide significant advantages over more traditional means of sulphur exposure. Despite the prominent influence of sulphur on the enhanced selectivity,catalysts sulphided by exposure to dilute H2S or sulphur-containing molecules that can easily crack, such as thiophene, are not the same as catalysts with alkanethiol SAM coatings. Surface sulphur forms a wide variety of structures on Pd that can hinder hydrogenation.
Similar to alkanethiol SAMs, the (3 × 3)R30 geometry of ad- sorbed sulphur is observed on Pd(111); however, the (7×7)R19 geometry is also observed and preferentially forms in ultrahigh vacuum on Pd(111) after annealing above 400 K (ref. 43). TPD experiments show that the latter structure prevents the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen and effectively poisons the catalyst,probably through the formation of subsurface sulphur, which changes both the geometric and electronic structure of the surface26.
Although the deposition of alkanethiol SAMs does result in some surface sulphur through SC bond cracking, depth profiling Auger electron spectroscopy experiments have shown that this sulphur does not measurably penetrate into the bulk14 and is thus less likely to poison hydrogen dissociation than surface sulphur from other sources. It is worth noting that surface restructuring effects caused by deposition of alkanethiolsas has been shown for the herringbone reconstruction of the Au(111) surface44may have some influence on the observed reactivity, but such restructuring effects are expected to be far more subtle than is observed following extensive sulphidation by H2S. Therefore, alkanethiol coatings provide a facile method of restricting sulphur coverage to the more favourable (3×3)R30 geometry on fcc(111) surfaces, prevent- ing such deleterious effects. These effects manifest themselves in the facile deposition method for SAMs, unlike the comparatively difficult procedure for depositing controlled quantities of surface sulphur, which in this work produced an inferior result.
The selective hydrogenation of unsaturated epoxides such as EpB is a considerable challenge on traditional supported metal catalysts.
Unlike uncoated palladium catalysts that showed a selectivity to epoxybutane at 313 K of 11%, coated catalysts greatly improved selectivity to up to 94% at the same EpB conversion. Mechanistic studies suggested that the enhancement in selectivity was caused by metalsulphur interactions and that the thiol tail controlled sulphur coverage and improved activity over systems using only sulphur.
This work shows that the precise control of surface structure by well-organized alkanethiol SAM coatings can markedly improve the catalytic selectivity of hydrogenation reactions, and that the reactiv- ity of these SAM-modified catalysts is sensitive to subtle differences in the molecular organization within the molecular layer.
Methods Materials. Pd/Al2O3 (5 wt%), 1-propanethiol, 1-hexanethiol, 1-dodecanethiol,1-octadecanethiol, 1-dodecene, 1-hexene, crotonaldehyde (2-buten-1-al, 97%) and 200-proof HPLC-grade ethanol were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. All thiol and alkene purities were greater than 97%. EpB (>98%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar and all gases were ultrahigh purity and were obtained from Airgas.
Preparation and characterization of catalysts. Before thiol deposition and/or testing, 7.0 mg (uncoated case) or 50.0 mg (coated cases) of 5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst diluted to 300 mg with Al2O3 was packed into a glass reactor tube and cleaned by oxidation at 573 K in 20% oxygen for two hours. The catalyst was then reduced at 473 K in 20% hydrogen for greater than 2 h and cooled to room temperature in an inert flow of He. Thiol coatings were deposited by immersing the packed catalyst bed at room temperature in 10 mM ethanolic solutions of propanethiol,hexanethiol or dodecanethiol or 1 mM ethanolic solutions of octadecanethiol for 24 h, except where specified otherwise. The coated catalyst was dried in an inert flow of nitrogen or helium for at least 12 h before being tested. Sulphur-coated catalysts were prepared by exposing 50.0 mg of 5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst packed in a glass reactor tube to 1,000 ppm H2S in N2 at a flow rate of 200 s.c.c.m. for varying amounts of time and then purging with N2. The catalysts aged in alkenes were prepared by exposing 50.0 mg of 5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst to a flow of helium with 1% propylene or 1-hexene or 0.1% 1-dodecene for 4 h at 373 K.
Coated and uncoated catalysts were characterized using DRIFT spectroscopy to collect spectra in the CH stretching region (2,800 cm1 to 3,000 cm1) using a Thermo Nicolet 6,700 FTIR. DRIFT spectra were corrected by subtracting a background spectrum of oxidized and reduced 5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst and adjusting for baseline drift. A resolution of 4 cm1 was used.
CO chemisorption (Quantachrome Autosorb-1) was also used to characterize the surface area of exposed Pd on the coated and uncoated catalyst. We measured a metal surface area of 3.74 m2 g1 on the uncoated catalyst that dropped to
0.23 m2 g1 after coating with hexanethiol using CO chemisorption, indicating
that 94% of the metal surface was modified by the adsorbed thiol. The palladium metal dispersion was 16.8% and the average metal particle diameter (assuming a spherical shape) was 6.7 nm.
Catalytic tests. Reaction products were quantified using a gas chromatograph (HP5890) equipped with a flame ionization detector, a Poraplot-Q capillary column (Varian) and peak simple software (SRI). The packed catalysts were exposed to a feed stream with a 10:1 H2 to EpB ratio, produced by entraining EpB in a He flow at 298 K with a bubbler. A constant feed flow rate of 25 s.c.c.m. for thiol- and sulphur-coated catalysts was chosen to produce 52% conversion of EpB unless otherwise noted. Reactions were conducted at 313, 323 and 333 K by heating the glass reactor tubes in a temperature-controlled clamshell-style furnace. Selectivities were calculated by dividing the conversion to one product by the total EpB conversion. Turnover frequencies were calculated on the basis of the metal surface area of the uncoated catalyst. This method does not account for reductions in the number of active sites resulting from the thiol coating or carbonaceous deposits and may underestimate the true turnover frequency.
Experiments testing crotonaldehyde hydrogenation were conducted similarly using a 25:1 H2 to crotonaldehyde feed ratio and 1 g of uncoated or hexanethiol-coated 5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst at 313 K.
