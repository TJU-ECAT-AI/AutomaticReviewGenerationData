I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

A smaller distance of 80 pc would be required to bring SS Cyg's peak accretion rate in line with typical values for DNe (25). Using this distance and an accretion rate of 5 × 109 Myear1 during the rise, we obtain a flux of 0.7 mJy, in agreement with the observations (the uncertainty of the correlation is a factor of 2). However, if the HST distance is correct and the accretion rate is indeed as high as 107 Myear1, we have to assume an accretion rate during the rise of 5 × 108 M yr1. The predicted radio flux is then 4 mJy,which is still roughly consistent with the mea- sured values. In this case, the jet emission of SS Cyg, especially during the optical plateau, may correspond to the highest accreting states in XRBs and not to the hard state. For such high accretion rates, jet launching for CVs has been suggested by Soker and Lasota (5).The similarities in the radio luminosity, as well as in the relation of the radio emission to the accretion states, suggest that we did observe a jet from a nonmagnetic DN. The detection of a jet in a DN with similar disc/jet coupling as that seen in XRBs suggests that there may be a common jet- launching mechanism in CVs and XRBs. The radii of WDs lie roughly halfway in log-space be- tween those seen in young stellar objects (YSOs) and those of black holes, so WDs connect YSOs to XRBs. With the exception of source classes similar to soft-state XRBs, all accretion-powered jet- emitting sources from YSOs (26), via AGN (27) to gamma-ray bursts (28), seem to have a jet-launching efficiency (that is, the ratio of the jet power to the power liberated in the accretion flow) of 10%. This suggests that there may be a common disc/jet coupling in all accreting objects from YSOs to gamma ray bursts.

<questions>


How do single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions, and what are the essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts in terms of reaction conditions, metal properties, and specific advantages over traditional catalysts, including their ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
