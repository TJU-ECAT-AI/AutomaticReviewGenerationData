PdZn or ZnPd: Charge Transfer and PdPd Bonding as the Driving Force for the Tetragonal Distortion of the Cubic Crystal Structure Matthias Friedrich,[a] Alim Ormeci,[a] Yuri Grin,[a] and Marc Armbrster*[a] Dedicated to Professor Bernd Harbrecht on the Occasion of His 60th Birthday Keywords: PdZn; ZnPd; Chemical bonding; Electron localizability indicator; Charge transfer; Intermetallic phases Abstract. The intermetallic compound PdZn was reported to have two modifications, the tetragonal CuAu-type low-temperature phase and the cubic CsCl-type high-temperature phase. The existence of the cubic high-temperature phase at the equiatomic composition could not be proven experimentally. Calculations of the total energy reveal a mini- mum at c/a = 1.155, clearly excluding the cubic structure at the equi- Introduction The tetragonal distortion of the CsCl type of structure to- wards the CuAu type of structure has been subject of debate over several decades. Johansson and Linde were the first to explain the tetragonal lattice of CuAu by ascribing the distor- tion to the different atomic radii of copper and gold [1]. Schu- bert showed that the ratio of the atomic radii does not linearly correlate with the ratio of the axes [2]. Hence, the influence of the atomic radii seemed not to be the only driving force for the distortion. The argument, that the tetragonal lattice is formed due to favored heteroatomic interactions like in tetrag- onal NiZn [3]  one nickel atom is surrounded by eight zinc atoms, but only by four nickel atoms  was rejected by com- parison to PtCu. The latter is not distorted tetragonally, it is slightly rhombohedral; every atom is surrounded by six atoms of each kind [2]. Dehlinger suggested another driving force for the distortion [4]. The tetragonal lattice results in new Brillouin zones leading to additional Bragg reflections. Since these al- low accommodating electrons in an energetically favorable way, the Fermi energy is decreased by the distortion. Counter arguments for this thesis are supported by the crystal structures of NiZn, PdCd and PtHg, which do not show intense additional reflections but still form the CuAu type of structure. Schuberts model of the Ortskorrelation [2] tried to explain the tetragonal structure by the contribution of a certain number of valence electrons of each atom to stabilize the crystal structure.

Results showed a correlation between the degree of tetragonal- ity and the enthalpy of formation or degree of ionic bonding,respectively [5]. However, this is contradictory since ionic in- teractions should favor the more isotropic undistorted CsCl- type. Experimental and quantum chemical investigations of TiAl (CuAu type of structure) resulted in the description of covalently bonded Ti 44 nets in the structure to which the te- tragonal distortion was assigned [6, 7]. High-pressure experi- ments on CuAu [8] revealed that the atomic size ratio plays only a secondary role for the tetragonality in CuAu-type struc- tures. More important are band structure effects, resulting in an energetically favorable way to accommodate the electrons.
As already suggested by Schubert [2] and Neumann et al. [5],a single aspect might not solely explain the tetragonal distor- tion of the CuAu type.
The equiatomic phase in the binary system Pd-Zn is usually described with the formula PdZn. The tetragonal structure of the room temperature modification was first reported in 1950 by Nowotny et al. [9]. Later Nowotny et al. [10] and Kster et al. [11] investigated the high temperature region at the compo- sitions Pd2Zn and Pd2Zn3 both of which realize the cubic CsCl structure type. The authors remained unsure, whether the phase ranges of Pd2Zn and Pd2Zn3 merge at high temperatures or if two separate phases exist. To our best knowledge, no experi- mental evidence of the cubic CsCl-type crystal structure at 50 at.-% palladium at elevated temperatures has been reported so far. The latest cumulative phase diagram in [12] is based on earlier work of [13] where the high-temperature region is shown as tentative.

ploring chemical stability and catalytic properties of interme- tallic compounds [14, 15]. For example, the stability of PdGa as a catalyst in the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene could be understood by analyzing the chemical bonding using the electron localizability indicator [16, 17]. In this context it is worth mentioning, that the intermetallic compound PdZn (better to be described as ZnPd, see the bonding analysis be- low) plays an important role as catalyst in the steam reforming of methanol [18, 19]. The formation of the intermetallic com- pound was detected in situ when applying Pd/ZnO as a cata- lyst, accompanied with a huge increase in selectivity. The den- sity of states of ZnPd and other compounds realizing the CuAu- or CsCl-type of structures was used to draw conclu- sions about their catalytic properties in the steam reforming of methanol [20].
In this study, the chemical bonding in the tetragonal and cu- bic structures of ZnPd is explored using quantum chemical calculations through the electron localizability indicator (ELI).
Furthermore, new experimental data on the binary PdZn phases around 50 at.-% palladium are presented.
Experimental Section Synthesis of Tetragonal ZnPd All procedures were carried out in an argon-filled glove box with H2O and O2 concentrations below 0.1 ppm. Elemental zinc (99.9999 %,powder, ChemPur) and palladium (99.9 %, powder, Chempur) were weighed with a composition Zn50Pd50. The mixture was filled in a quartz glass ampoule. After evacuating and sealing the tube, the am- poule was placed in a furnace, and the temperature was increased with 5 K·h1 up to the melting point of Zn (693 K) and finally was raised to 1123 K with 1 K·min1, where it was held for 6 d. The ampoule was cooled and the sintered product was ground, sealed into an evacu- ated quartz glass ampoule again and annealed at 1173 K for 7 d. After quenching in water, the powder was analyzed by X-ray powder diffrac- tion (image plate Guinier camera G670, Huber, Cu-Kα1, λ = 1.54056 Å,quartz monochromator, 3 < 2θ < 100; internal standard LaB6, a =
4.15692 Å).
Investigation of the Homogeneity Range of Tetragonal ZnPd Samples containing 46 at.-% and 64 at.-% Pd, respectively, were pre- pared according to the above synthesis route. The samples were finally annealed at 1173 K for 5 d. After quenching in water, powders were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction and WDX spectroscopy (CAMECA SX 100, W filament, 25 kV).
Synthesis of Cubic ZnPd To obtain the cubic (HT) modification of ZnPd, several quenching attempts were made, all starting from a phase pure powder sample of tetragonal ZnPd. The challenge is melting the compound while mini- mizing loss of zinc due to evaporation. The first attempt consisted of heating the sample in a thin-walled closed quartz glass ampoule to 1503 K, by referring to [11], followed by annealing for seven hours and finally rapid quenching the ampoule in cold water. Another experi- ment to obtain the HT modification started with inductive heating of the initial compound inside an open glassy carbon crucible under inert 1736 www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

argon atmosphere to 1673 K. After reaching this temperature the cruci- ble was turned upside down and the melt was poured onto a stainless steel plate. Measuring the density of the quenched products by means of a Helium pycnometer (AccuPyc 1330, Micromeritics) was used to obtain information about the composition of the products.
Quantum Chemical Calculations The tight-binding linear-muffin-tin-orbital (TB-LMTO) program [21] in the atomic sphere approximation (ASA) and all-electron full-poten- tial local orbital (FPLO) scheme [22] were used for quantum chemical calculations on tetragonal and cubic ZnPd. The issue of stability re- garding the tetragonal and cubic crystal structures was addressed by carrying out FPLO total energy calculations within local density (LDA) and generalized gradient (GGA) approximations. For LDA Per- dewWang [23] and for GGA PerdewBurkeErnzerhof [24] parame- trizations were used.
The following crystal structure model was used for tetragonal ZnPd:space group P4/mmm (No. 123), Pd in Wyckoff position 1a at 0 0 0, Zn in Wyckoff position 1d at 0.5 0.5 0.5 with cell parameters a =
2.8931(1) Å and c = 3.3426(2) Å as determined experimentally. Calcu-
lations on cubic ZnPd are based on the following structure model:space group Pm3 m (No. 221), Pd in 1a at 0, 0, 0, Zn in 1b at 0.5, 0.5,
0.5. Since no experimental lattice parameter for cubic ZnPd is available
at 50 at.-% Pd, a = 3.0513 Å was calculated by linear interpolation of the cell parameters of cubic Zn3Pd2 and cubic ZnPd2 [10]. For LMTO- ASA calculations, no interstitial empty spheres were necessary in ei- ther structure, because it was possible to reach the total unit cell vol- umes by atomic spheres with acceptable overlap (14 %). The follow- ing radii of the atomic spheres were applied for tetragonal ZnPd:r(Pd) = 1.51 Å, r(Zn) = 1.48 Å. For cubic ZnPd, the applied radii of the atomic spheres were r(Pd) = 1.52 Å, r(Zn) = 1.49 Å. The density of states (DOS) was calculated using a grid of 553 k-points for tetrago- nal ZnPd and 583 k-points for cubic ZnPd, respectively.
Chemical bonding analysis was based on the concept of electron local- izability. The electron localizability indicator (ELI, Y) [25] was evalu- ated in ELI-D representation according to [26, 27]. ELI could be calcu- lated by both FPLO [28] and TB-LMTO methods. The topology of ELI was analyzed using the program DGrid [29] with integration of the electron density in ELI basins, a procedure similar to the treatment of the electron density in the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) proposed by Bader [30].
Results and Discussion Synthesis of Tetragonal and Cubic ZnPd Single phase material of tetragonal ZnPd was obtained after annealing the pre-reacted powder at 1173 K as confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (Figure 1). The compound is hard and brittle with silvery metallic lustre. Contrary to previously reported synthesis routes, which always had to deal with evap- orating zinc, this method is capable of preparing the compound with the initial equiatomic Pd:Zn ratio. The cell parameters were determined as a = 2.8931(1) Å and c = 3.3426(2) Å. The samples for the homogeneity range determination consisted of tetragonal ZnPd and cubic ZnPd2 or cubic Zn3Pd2, respec- tively, in accordance with the published phase diagram. Unit cell parameters as well as the composition of the phase ZnPd in the two-phase samples are shown in Table 1.

The synthesis of cubic ZnPd in an open glassy carbon cruci- ble, quenched from melt, only yielded zinc-poor samples with compositions of Zn0.66Pd1.34 (according to the density measure- ments) due to evaporation of zinc. The evaporation of zinc can be avoided if the initial compound is placed inside a quartz glass ampoule which then is quenched from 1503 K. Neverthe- less, single phase material of tetragonal ZnPd was obtained instead of cubic ZnPd. Hence, the existence of cubic ZnPd (50 at.-% Pd) could not be proven experimentally using the preparation procedures described.
On the Stability of the Cubic Structure Since c/a = 1 in the tetragonal space group P4/mmm gives the cubic structure, total energy calculations in that space group were performed to compare the energies for different c/a ratios at a given unit cell volume. The results obtained by GGA at the experimental volume of the unit cell are shown in Figure 2. The lowest total energy is obtained in the range of the experimental c/a value at 1.155, whereas the energy of the cubic structure (c/a = 1) is higher by ca. 10 meV/atom. To determine the volume dependence of the c/a ratio, the c/a ra- tios of the tetragonal structure are optimized for different unit cell volumes by both LDA and GGA (Figure 2). In both cases,c/a decreases monotonically with decreasing volume, but even at a volume compression of 35 %, the c/a ratio is around 1.09,far from the cubic limit of 1. These results suggest that at larger volumes, which should be attained at elevated tempera- tures due to thermal expansion, the lowest total energies will be obtained at larger c/a values, which is in clear contradiction to the assumption that the tetragonal structure will transform

The theoretical equilibrium volume obtained by GGA (LDA) is 3.8 % larger (4.5 % smaller) than the experimental volume. Both results are within the expected range of deviations for each functional.

As would be expected for both compounds, the major contri- butions in the DOS originate from the Zn-d and Pd-d states (TB-LMTO-ASA results, Figure 3). The main difference in the density of states is detected around the Fermi energy. In the cubic structure a higher contribution by Pd-d states to the DOS at the Fermi energy is observed, compared to the tetragonal structure. The local peak in the density of states just below the Fermi energy indicates a possible instability of the cubic crys- tal structure in agreement with the total energy calculations. In tetragonal ZnPd, this local peak close to the Fermi energy

splits into two smaller peaks at 1 eV and +0.5 eV, respec- tively. This change in the electronic structure suggests a Pei- erls-like distortion stabilizing the tetragonal structure in ZnPd.Figure 3.

The topology of the calculated electron density for the cubic and the tetragonal structure reveals basins defined by the zero- flux surfaces in the density gradient, the QTAIM atoms (Fig- ure 4, top). The volume of the QTAIM Pd (16.65 Å3) is smaller than the average value of 22.3 Å3 between the atomic volumina of elemental palladium (29.4 Å3) and zinc (15.2 Å3).
The volume of QTAIM Zn (11.32 Å3) is even smaller than for metallic zinc. In the chemically similar system Al-Pt [31] this indicated atomic interactions between the components and for- mation of platinum anions and aluminum cations. Indeed, inte- gration of the electron density within the QTAIM reveals charge transfer from zinc to palladium for both structures and both calculation methods, in accordance with their electronega- tivities after Pauling [32]. Following the IUPAC nomenclature,we therefore suggest to describe the compound as ZnPd. Inte- gration of the electron density obtained by the FPLO calcula- tion yields Zn0.4+Pd0.4 and reveals the important role of the charge transfer in the formation of the cubic and tetragonally 1738 www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

distorted body-centered-like structural patterns in the system Zn/Pd.
Figure 4. Chemical bonding in ZnPd: (top) QTAIM basins of palla- dium (blue) and zinc (green) in tetragonal ZnPd (FPLO calculation) with the according electronic populations revealing the charge transfer from zinc to palladium. (middle) ELI-D distribution in the (100), (010) and (001) planes in tetragonal ZnPd shows strong structuring of the penultimate shell of palladium in the (001) plane as well as small ELI-D maxima between palladium atoms along [100]. (bottom) ELI- D distribution in the (100), (010) and (001) planes in cubic ZnPd shows weaker structuring of the penultimate shell of palladium in all three planes.
The reasons for the tetragonal distortion are visualized by the analysis of the electron localizability indicator for both structural motifs (Figure 4, middle and bottom). For both structures, the distribution of ELI-D in the inner shells (espe- cially the penultimate one) around the zinc nuclei is very close to spherical. The basins of the ELI attractors in the valence region are multi-synaptic implying multi-center ZnPd bond- ing interactions (not shown in the figure). In combination with PdZn or ZnPd: Driving Force for the Tetragonal Distortion the charge transfer, this suggests polar interaction between zinc and palladium. In contrast to zinc, in the tetragonal structure the penultimate shell of palladium is significantly structured in the (001) plane compared to weaker structuring in the (100) plane. Such a structuring proved to be a fingerprint for the direct (covalent) interaction between the palladium atoms [33,34]. This interaction is also reflected by small ELI-D maxima between the palladium atoms along [100] (Figure 4, middle).
In cubic ZnPd, the structuring is less pronounced as illustrated by the structuring index (the difference between the highest ELI-D value in the examined shell and the ELI-D value at which the localization domain is without a hole [34]), which is 0.037 for the tetragonal structure and 0.012 for the cubic one. Furthermore, no maxima in ELI-D were found between the palladium atoms. Thus, the direct PdPd bonding within the 44 nets in the (001) plane is the main reason for the tetrago- nal distortion of the cubic structure in case of ZnPd.
Conclusions The existence of the cubic high-temperature phase of equia- tomic composition in the binary system Pd-Zn could not be proven experimentally and remains uncertain. Tetragonal ZnPd has a homogeneity range of 13.8 at.-% at 1173 K.
Calculations of the total energy reveal a minimum at c/a =
1.155, clearly excluding the cubic pattern at the equiatomic
composition in the system Zn-Pd. Analysis of the chemical bonding applying the electron localizability approach revealed the charge transfer from zinc to palladium, thus justifying the formula ZnPd instead of PdZn. In addition, direct PdPd inter- actions in the (001) plane were shown to be the main reason for the tetragonal distortion of cubic ZnPd.
