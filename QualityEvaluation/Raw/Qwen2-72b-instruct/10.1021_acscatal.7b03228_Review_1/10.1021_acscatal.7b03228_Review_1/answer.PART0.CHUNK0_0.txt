[1] "Sykes and co-workers have demonstrated that Pd atoms embedded in a Cu(111) surface can act as unique sites for the activation of hydrogen and thereby boost activity and selectivity in selective hydrogenation."
[2] "DFT calculations predicted that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation was reduced from 0.4 to 0.02 eV but that the adsorption enthalpy was not strongly affected (0.35 eV on the alloy but 0.20 eV on Cu(111))."
[3] "This prediction indicates a break from BrnstedEvansPolanyi scaling rules which would dictate that the reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier are correlated."
[4] "The following criteria probably apply for any successful SAA catalyst. First, the reaction temperature must be rather mild. High-temperature reactions (e.g., above the Tamman temperature of the metal) may result in significant metalmetal diffusion leading to aggregation of the guest metal."
[5] "Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal. For example, if one metal forms very strong metaladsorbate bonds but the other does not, then the former metal will migrate to the surface."
[6] "Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy. This probably implies that structure sensitive reactions are more likely to be successful."

1.Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by acting as unique sites for hydrogen activation, boosting activity and selectivity. DFT calculations show that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation is significantly reduced on these alloys, breaking the BrnstedEvansPolanyi scaling rules, which typically correlate reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier. This geometric effect allows for improved selectivity and catalytic performance.
2.Successful SAA catalysts require mild reaction temperatures to prevent metal-metal diffusion and aggregation. Reactive environments that can cause metal segregation must be avoided, especially if one metal forms stronger metal-adsorbate bonds than the other. The chosen reaction must be able to exploit the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy, with structure-sensitive reactions being more likely to succeed.

1.单原子合金，特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过作为氢活化的独特位点，增强选择性氢化反应中的催化性能，提高活性和选择性。DFT计算表明，这些合金上的氢解离势垒显著降低，打破了BrnstedEvansPolanyi缩放规则，这些规则通常将反应焓和反应势垒相关联。这种几何效应允许提高选择性和催化性能。
2.成功的SAA催化剂需要温和的反应温度，以防止金属-金属扩散和聚集。必须避免可能导致金属分离的反应环境，特别是如果一种金属形成的金属-吸附物键比另一种金属强。所选反应必须能够利用单原子合金创建的几何位点，结构敏感反应更有可能成功。
