[1] "To this end, Sykes and co-workers have demonstrated that Pd atoms embedded in a Cu(111) surface can act as unique sites for the activation of hydrogen and thereby boost activity and selectivity in selective hydrogenation."
[2] "DFT calculations predicted that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation was reduced from 0.4 to 0.02 eV but that the adsorption enthalpy was not strongly affected (0.35 eV on the alloy but 0.20 eV on Cu(111)). This prediction indicates a break from BrnstedEvansPolanyi scaling rules which would dictate that the reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier are correlated."
[3] "The following criteria probably apply for any successful SAA catalyst. First, the reaction temperature must be rather mild. High-temperature reactions (e.g., above the Tamman temperature of the metal) may result in significant metalmetal diffusion leading to aggregation of the guest metal."
[4] "Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal. For example, if one metal forms very strong metaladsorbate bonds but the other does not, then the former metal will migrate to the surface."
[5] "Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy. This probably implies that structure sensitive reactions are more likely to be successful."

1.Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by acting as unique sites for hydrogen activation, which boosts activity and selectivity. This is achieved by breaking the BrnstedEvansPolanyi scaling rules, as the barrier for hydrogen dissociation is significantly reduced while the adsorption enthalpy remains relatively unchanged. Successful SAA catalysts require mild reaction temperatures to prevent metal aggregation, avoidance of reactive environments that could cause metal segregation, and the selection of reactions that can exploit the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy, with structure-sensitive reactions being more likely to succeed.

1.单原子合金，特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过作为氢活化的独特位点来增强选择性氢化反应中的催化性能，从而提高活性和选择性。这通过打破BrnstedEvansPolanyi比例规则来实现，氢解离的能垒显著降低，而吸附焓基本保持不变。成功的SAA催化剂需要温和的反应温度以防止金属聚集，避免可能导致金属分层的反应环境，并选择能够利用单原子合金创建的几何位点的反应，结构敏感的反应更有可能成功。
