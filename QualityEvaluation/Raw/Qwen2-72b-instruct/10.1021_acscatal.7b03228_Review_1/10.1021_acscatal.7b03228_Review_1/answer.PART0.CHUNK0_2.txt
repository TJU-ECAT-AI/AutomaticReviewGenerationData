[1] "Sykes and co-workers have demonstrated that Pd atoms embedded in a Cu(111) surface can act as unique sites for the activation of hydrogen and thereby boost activity and selectivity in selective hydrogenation."
[2] "DFT calculations predicted that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation was reduced from 0.4 to 0.02 eV but that the adsorption enthalpy was not strongly affected (0.35 eV on the alloy but 0.20 eV on Cu(111))."
[3] "Breaking these scaling rules through a geometric effect (changing the active site) allows departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis."
[4] "The following criteria probably apply for any successful SAA catalyst. First, the reaction temperature must be rather mild. High-temperature reactions (e.g., above the Tamman temperature of the metal) may result in significant metalmetal diffusion leading to aggregation of the guest metal."
[5] "Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal."
[6] "Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy. This probably implies that structure sensitive reactions are more likely to be successful."

1.Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by acting as unique sites for hydrogen activation, which boosts activity and selectivity. DFT calculations show that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation is significantly reduced on these alloys, breaking scaling rules and allowing for a departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis. Successful SAA catalysts require mild reaction temperatures to prevent metal aggregation, avoidance of reactive environments that can cause metal segregation, and the selection of reactions that can take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy, with structure-sensitive reactions being more likely to succeed.

1.单原子合金，特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过作为氢活化的独特位点，增强了选择性氢化反应中的催化性能，从而提高了活性和选择性。DFT计算表明，这些合金上的氢解离势垒显著降低，打破了比例规则，允许从纯电子结构的催化描述中脱离。成功的SAA催化剂需要温和的反应温度以防止金属聚集，避免可能导致金属分层的反应环境，并选择能够利用单原子合金创建的几何位点的反应，结构敏感的反应更有可能成功。
