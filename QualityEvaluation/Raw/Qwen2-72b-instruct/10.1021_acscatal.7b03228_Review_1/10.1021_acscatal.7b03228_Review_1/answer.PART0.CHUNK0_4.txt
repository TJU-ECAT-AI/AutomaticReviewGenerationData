[1] "To this end, Sykes and co-workers have demonstrated that Pd atoms embedded in a Cu(111) surface can act as unique sites for the activation of hydrogen and thereby boost activity and selectivity in selective hydrogenation."
[2] "DFT calculations predicted that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation was reduced from 0.4 to 0.02 eV but that the adsorption enthalpy was not strongly affected (0.35 eV on the alloy but 0.20 eV on Cu(111)). This prediction indicates a break from BrnstedEvansPolanyi scaling rules which would dictate that the reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier are correlated."
[3] "The following criteria probably apply for any successful SAA catalyst. First, the reaction temperature must be rather mild. High-temperature reactions (e.g., above the Tamman temperature of the metal) may result in significant metalmetal diffusion leading to aggregation of the guest metal."
[4] "Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal. For example, if one metal forms very strong metaladsorbate bonds but the other does not, then the former metal will migrate to the surface."
[5] "Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy. This probably implies that structure sensitive reactions are more likely to be successful."

1.Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by acting as unique sites for hydrogen activation, boosting activity and selectivity. This is achieved by breaking the Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi scaling rules, which normally correlate the reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier. The criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include mild reaction temperatures to prevent metal aggregation, avoiding reactive environments that cause metal segregation, and selecting reactions that can exploit the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy, particularly structure-sensitive reactions.

1.单原子合金，特别是嵌入铜表面的钯原子，通过充当氢活化的独特位点，提高了选择性氢化反应中的催化性能，从而增强了活性和选择性。这通过打破布伦斯特-埃文斯-波拉尼（Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi）缩放规则来实现，这些规则通常将反应焓和反应势垒相关联。设计成功的SAA催化剂的标准包括温和的反应温度，以防止金属聚集，避免导致金属分层的反应环境，以及选择能够利用由单原子合金创建的几何位点的反应，特别是结构敏感的反应。
