Abstract
Understanding which surface properties control adsorption on metal surfaces has long been a primary goal in surface science and catalysis, for both fundamental and technological reasons. Moreover, for the purposes of designing catalysts for enhanced selectivity, it can be desirable to understand surface properties that lead to significant differences in adsorption energies of hydrocarbons and oxygenates. In this work, expressions for predicting adsorption energies of CH3 and OH are developed, based in part on screening a large number of possible predictors. These expressions include the d-band center, d-band filling, and matrix coupling element, which are well-known in the literature, as well as the relatively unstudied p-band center. These expressions are also applied to other adsorbates, including alkyls, alkoxides, C, O, and H, allowing elucidation of how the adsorbate structure affects the adsorption energy. While all alkyls behave similarly and all alkoxides behave similarly, there are significant differences between alkyls and alkoxides. In particular, adsorbate–surface coupling is net attractive for hydrocarbons but net repulsive for oxygenates, likely due to the deeper valence states on O atoms. As demonstrated within the context of the partial oxidation of ethylene, this difference can potentially be used to rapidly screen catalysts for improved selectivity based on the values of simple electronic structure parameters.

Introduction
Adsorption energies of molecules on transition metal surfaces have proven to be useful predictors of the catalytic performance of these surfaces for a wide variety of processes, such as renewable fuel production, petrochemical production, and electrochemistry. In particular, adsorption energies of simple hydrocarbons and oxygenates have been shown to correlate strongly with the activity and/or selectivity of a number of different reactions. (1-3) Hence, accurate prediction of adsorption energies could allow rational design of catalysts for a wide variety of important processes.
As an example, it is useful to consider the selective epoxidation of olefins such as ethylene, which is one of the most important and most studied reactions in heterogeneous catalysis. The key driver for catalyst improvement is achieving higher selectivity to the desired product, ethylene oxide, rather than the undesired combustion products. While the exact mechanism is still a matter of debate, there is evidence that the selectivity-determining step is reaction of a surface oxametallacycle (−OCH2CH2−) intermediate (see Scheme 1). (4-7) Oxametallacycle ring closure produces the epoxide, whereas H transfer leads to combustion. Prior work has indicated that the desired process can be promoted relative to the undesired process by increasing the oxygen–metal (O–M) bond strength relative to the carbon–metal (C-M) bond strength. (4, 5, 8) If so, more selective catalyst compositions could be identified based on an understanding of the fundamental surface properties associated with relatively strong O–M bonds and weak C–M bonds. While this scheme may not apply to all olefins, there is evidence that ethylene and several other olefins behave similarly. (9, 10)

Scheme 1. Pathways for Ethylene Epoxidation (Desirable, Upper Pathway) and Combustion (Undesirable, Lower Pathway)
Identifying these descriptors requires a detailed model for how hydrocarbon and oxygenate adsorption varies across metal surfaces with different properties. Recent work (11) has shown that, given the adsorption energy of methyl in the top site, the adsorption energy of any alkyl in any site can be accurately predicted. There has also been recent work successfully predicting electronic structure parameters from alloy structures, with no quantum chemical calculations other than those used in the initial fitting. (12, 13) The goal of the present work is to bridge the gap between these previous studies by developing accurate expressions that predict adsorption energies of simple adsorbates that are bound to the surface through C–M and O–M bonds in particular sites based on surface properties.
Accurate prediction of adsorption energies from electronic structure parameters on a wide range of surfaces is difficult, in part because adsorbate site preference can change across metals. Further, most previous studies only consider a small number of surface properties. In the present work, we systematically examine a large number of properties for their predictive power for adsorption energies on a wide range of surfaces. The simple adsorbates CH3 and OH are used to measure the reactivity of an individual metal atom by adsorbing them in the top site. The surface properties are tested for their predictive power alone as well as in multiterm expressions. We use our findings to develop simple, accurate, physically transparent expressions for CH3 and OH adsorption energies. We then generalize these expressions to predict the adsorption strength of other adsorbates that bond through a C or O atom, with a focus on metrics that can rapidly predict differences between those adsorption energies. To demonstrate their utility, we apply these expressions to ethylene epoxidation and methane oxidation.
Methods
Plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). (14, 15) The PW91 exchange-correlation functional (16) and the projector augmented-wave method (17, 18) were used, along with an energy cutoff of 396 eV and a 7 × 7 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack (19)k-point grid. One adsorbate was placed in each 3 × 3 surface cell with four layers of metal. The bottom two layers were fixed at their bulk positions, and all other atoms were allowed to relax. Spin polarization was employed only for Ni and Co. Density of states (DOS) calculations were performed by performing a single-point calculation with tetrahedral smearing and a smearing width of 0.01 eV. The charge density from this calculation was fixed, the k-point mesh was increased to 19 × 19 × 1, and a non-self-consistent calculation was performed. The DOS was sampled over intervals on the order of 10–4 eV. Band centers were calculated by projecting the wave function on atom-centered spherical harmonics within a cutoff radius and taking the first moment of the entire band for a given atom. The default number of bands was used in all calculations; test calculations indicate that increasing the number of bands has a negligible effect on adsorption energies.
Further details on the surfaces employed in most of this work are available in a previous publication. (11) The exceptions are those surfaces which were only employed in the ethylene epoxidation studies. The MAg alloys (M = Cu, Pd, Au) consisted of 1/3 ML of M dispersed throughout the Ag surface cell, such that each Ag surface atom was bonded to three M atoms. The KadsAg surface consisted of 1/9 ML of K adsorbed on Ag in the top site in order to maximize the K–CH3 and K–OH distances.
Results and Discussion
Applying Simplified Versions of the d-Band Model
First, as a basis of comparison, we apply some expressions that have been previously employed in the literature. The d-band model (20) has been widely applied, most often under the assumption that the adsorption energy has a linear dependence on εd, the d-band center. As is evident in Figure 1, a higher εd correlates with stronger adsorption for both CH3 and OH. However, a linear fit to the data gives poor accuracy, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.15 eV for CH3 and 0.48 eV for OH. It is clear that εd alone cannot provide quantitative predictions across a range of metals, even when restricted to a single row of the periodic table.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Adsorption energy of (a) CH3 and (b) OH in the top site as a function of the d-band center. Comparing Pt to Pd or to the Pt atom in Pt1Au8 shows that the d-band center cannot always account for variations, even between similar metals or the same metal.
To increase the accuracy of the predictions, the effects of the matrix coupling element, Vad, and the idealized d-band filling, f, are often included. (21-23) In previous work, (11) we have written the adsorption energy of alkyls on late transition metals as
(1)
where εa is the energy of an alkyl’s (e.g., CH3’s) singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO). Values of Vad are tabulated, (20) but more accurate results are achieved if Vad is calculated using the C–M distance for CH3 in the top site as Vad2 ∝ rd3/d7, where rd is the size of the d orbitals in the appropriate metal atom (previously tabulated) and d is the C–M distance. (13, 24) The value of α4 is negative for CH3 and positive for OH, indicating that the two species have a different dependence on the adsorbate–metal coupling. When fit to our database, eq 1 gives an MAE of 0.11 eV for CH3 and 0.15 eV for OH. These MAEs are still fairly high compared to typical variations in adsorption energies for these species; therefore, we conclude that there are other important factors determining the variations in adsorption energy across metals. In particular, traditional application of the concepts from d-band theory predicts that Pd should bind adsorbates more strongly than Pt, since Pd has a higher d-band center and a similar matrix coupling element. However, CH3 binds more strongly to Pt by roughly 0.2 eV. This trend has been seen in several previous theoretical studies, (25, 26) as well as in experimental adsorption energies of CO, (27-29) which generally correlate with those of CH3. (30) Further, the Pt atom in Pt1Au8 has a higher d-band center than the Pt atoms in pure Pt, yet it binds CH3 less strongly. There are similar problems for OH; for example, eq 1 incorrectly predicts that adsorption will be stronger on Au than Ag.
Hence, the d-band model in its usual formulation can be both quantitatively and qualitatively inaccurate, and it is clear that other factors affect the adsorption energy. Since changes in adsorption energies of 0.1–0.2 eV can result in significant differences in selectivity, (4, 5) high accuracy is often desirable. To aid in developing a model capable of identifying relatively subtle differences in adsorption energies, we systematically tested which other surface properties are good predictors for hydrocarbon and oxygenate adsorption.
Developing New Expressions for Predicting CH3 and OH Adsorption Energies
The MAEs from using a variety of surface properties to predict adsorption energies of CH3 and OH in the top site are shown in Table 1. (A table containing all of the properties is in the Supporting Information.) For CH3, the best predictors are related to the d-band (εd2, wd, etc.). Most of these properties are fairly good predictors for OH as well, but χ (the electronegativity) and rcov (the metal atom’s covalent radius) are also excellent predictors. Hence, it is already clear that oxygenate and hydrocarbon adsorption energies do not necessarily follow the same trends.

Every combination of properties was tested for its accuracy for predicting adsorption energies in multiterm expressions up to five terms (in addition to a constant term). The properties that performed poorly in these expressions were then eliminated, and all combinations of the remaining properties were checked for expressions with six terms. The most accurate expressions in each case are available in the Supporting Information, and the MAEs of these expressions are given in Table 2. Using more than one attribute dramatically increases the accuracy; however, after approximately 3–4 terms only small improvements in the accuracy are achieved.

Equation 2 is the most accurate three-term expression for CH3, with an MAE of 0.06 eV. Equation 3 is not the most accurate four-term expression for OH, but it is quite accurate (MAE of 0.10 eV) and allows the prediction of both CH3 and OH adsorption energies from a single set of electronic structure parameters. The parameter values are given in Table 3, and examples demonstrating the use of these equations are available in the Supporting Information.

aUnits are such that the energies are in electronvolts (eV).
Equations 2 and 3 mostly consist of terms that are well-known in the literature; the exception is εp. However, this term fits easily into the paradigm of the d-band model, which treats chemisorption on transition metals in two steps. (20) The εp term accounts for the first step, the renormalization of adsorbate states by the broad s- and p-bands of the metal surface. The second step, interaction of the renormalized adsorbate states with the narrow d-band to form bonding and antibonding states, is accounted for by the other terms.
A higher εd generally leads to more unoccupied antibonding states and stronger adsorption. However, a lower εp correlates with stronger adsorption. For example, Pt has a much lower εp than Pd, which may explain the exception to the εd trend noted above. Hence, the relationship between εp and the adsorption energy is the opposite trend as that usually found for εd. This is because the p-induced resonance is completely filled and does not split into well-defined bonding and antibonding states. (20) A lower p-band should interact more strongly with adsorbate states and result in a lower resonance state, as confirmed by our calculations using the Newns–Anderson model on a model chemisorption function (see Figure 2 and the Supporting Information). A lower resonance state will be more energetically favorable relative to the initially half-filled adsorbate state. Hence, we conclude that a lower εp results in a lower-energy renormalized state, which results in stronger adsorption.

Differences Between C–M and O–M Bonds
The primary difference between adsorption through O atoms and adsorption through C atoms is the dependence on Vad. After fitting, the Vad2f term is negative (attractive) for CH3, but positive (repulsive) for OH. The Vad2 term, which is only in the expression for OH, is negative but smaller in magnitude than the Vad2f term. Therefore, increasing the coupling results in stronger adsorption of CH3 but weaker adsorption of OH. These differences explain, for example, why OH adsorbs more strongly on Ag than Au, but CH3 adsorbs more strongly on Au than Ag: Au has a larger Vad, which is net attractive for CH3 but net repulsive for OH.
To help explain the differences between CH3 and OH adsorption, Bader charge calculations (31) were performed for CH3 and OH adsorbed on a subset of eight metals. For OH, a larger Vad2f results in less charge transfer to OH (see Figure 3) because of increased repulsion between the O states and the metal states. As O is quite electronegative, less charge transfer results in weaker bonding. However, once Vad2f is controlled for, a larger Vad2 apparently results in stronger bonding, as implied by perturbation theory. CH3 has higher valence states that can couple and split more easily. Therefore, a larger Vad2f results in a stronger interaction and stronger bonding, (20) and Vad2f does not correlate well with charge transfer.

Other Adsorbates with C–M and O–M Bonds
To confirm the generality of these expressions, they were applied to other adsorbates that have the same valence as CH3 or OH but have different structures: alkyls, 2-hydroxyethyl, simple alkoxides, and furfuryl alkoxide. Since we are currently interested only in how these structures affect the single adsorbate–metal bond, these adsorbates were placed in the top site and in orientations where the only interaction was through a single C or O atom. This may not be the most stable configuration, particularly for multifunctional adsorbates at low coverage. (32)
For a particular metal, variations in alkyl adsorption energies in the top site are controlled by the energy of the SOMO. (11, 33) However, hydroxyethyl does not quite follow this trend. Instead, the gap between the SOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) controls the variation in the binding energy for any radical that forms single bonds between C and a metal atom. The SOMO–LUMO gap also controls the strength of the analogous gas-phase C–H bonds. Figure 4a shows that this applies generally for both C–M and O–M bonds. Hence, by including the effect of the SOMO–LUMO gap (εgap), adsorption energies of a variety of adsorbates in the top site can be predicted from electronic structure parameters:
(4)
(5)
These equations give MAEs of 0.06 eV for C–M bonds and 0.09 eV for O–M bonds when applied to the adsorption energies shown in Figure 4a (the parity plot is in Figure 4b), indicating that these electronic structure parameters can be used to predict the adsorption energies of a variety of adsorbates. Adding a constant term to these expressions has little effect on the MAE (≈0.01 eV).

Each set of connected points represents different radicals binding to a particular metal surface atom or an H atom. Filled symbols are C–M bonding adsorbates, and open symbols are O–M bonding adsorbates. (b) Parity plot showing the application of eqs 4 and 5 to a variety of adsorbates. A few adsorbates are labeled for concreteness.
Previous work has indicated that gas-phase bond energies can be used to predict changes in adsorption energy for similar adsorbates. (11, 34) As shown in Figure 5, this is an accurate and general principle, likely because the SOMO–LUMO gap controls changes in adsorption energies in the top site as well as gas-phase bond energies. For hydrocarbons, more highly branched alkyls such as isopropyl and tert-butyl have higher steric effects as well as weaker gas-phase bonds, leading to an effective slope slightly greater than 1. We show in the Supporting Information that the more significant deviations from parity in Figure 5 are likely due to steric effects.

Figure 5. Changes in adsorption energies as a function of changes in gas-phase bond energies.
Further, eqs 2 and 3 can also be used to predict the adsorption energies of C and O. Because the same expressions apply for similar adsorbates, they can be used to rationalize so-called scaling relations, which are linear relationships between adsorption energies of similar adsorbates. (35) In a separate publication we use eq 2 to rationalize scaling relations for hydrocarbons, demonstrating its wide applicability. (36) H in the face-centered cubic (fcc) hollow site can also be predicted with good accuracy (MAE of 0.08 eV) using eq 2.
Translations To Other Sites
Although the above developments relate primarily to adsorption in the top site, displacements to other sites can be predicted based on previous approaches, which we briefly summarize here. We have previously developed expressions for predicting changes in adsorption energy upon translation of alkyls from the top site to other sites. (36) For translation of CH3 from a top site to a staggered hollow site, the change in adsorption energy can be predicted as
(6)
The change in coupling upon translation, accounted for by the Vad2f term, is the primary source of the adsorption energy change, (11) while the εp(occ) term accounts for electron–electron repulsion. (36) The Vdd2 term accounts for how far the d orbitals extend into the hollow site. (36) As shown in Figure 6, this expression can also be used to predict energetic changes upon translation of OH from the top to the fcc hollow. Hence, CH3 and OH translations appear to follow similar physical models. (Agostic C–H–M interactions can be accounted for separately.) (36) However, OH is much more likely to prefer the hollow site than CH3. This is likely because OH–d interactions are more repulsive than CH3–d interactions, as noted above. The d-orbitals are quite localized, leading to stronger d interactions in the top site than the hollow site. Since the s and p electrons are more delocalized and contribute significantly to the bonding, (20) the hollow site tends to be more stable for OH. In any case, because adsorption in the hollow site roughly scales with adsorption in the top site, trends in binding energy to the top site can be used to capture trends for adsorption in the hollow site.
Figure 6

Applications
As an example of the utility of eqs 2 and 3, we examine structures proposed to be important for ethylene epoxidation on various surfaces. In previous work, an expression containing the adsorption energy difference between CH3 and CH3O as well as other terms was found to quantitatively predict differences in activation energies between the selective and nonselective pathways. (5, 6) We instead use a simple difference between OH and CH3 adsorption energies, which is likely to be useful as a qualitative metric. Since the primary difference between O–M and C–M bonds is their dependence on the Vad terms, these terms can be used to predict the difference in their bond strengths. (The values of β2 and γ2 are quite similar, as are those of β3 and γ3.)
Figure 7a shows the strong correlation between the coupling terms and the difference in OH and CH3 adsorption energies. Figure 7b focuses on those surfaces that are potentially relevant for ethylene epoxidation. For simplicity, it does not include surfaces that bind OH very strongly (since surfaces that bind O strongly are likely to oxidize) or inhomogeneous surfaces. Ag is well-known as a selective catalyst for ethylene epoxidation, and its selectivity can be increased by alkali promotion. (37) In its metallic state, Cu has been found to be even more selective than Ag for epoxidation of nonallylic olefins. (10, 38-40) As can be seen in Figure 7, these trends are all present in the adsorption energy differences. Since these differences can be predicted from Vad and f, the selectivity can potentially be tuned by tuning the electronic structure of the surface. To explain why KadsAg is above the curve, we compared the K–OH and K–CH3 interactions in vacuum at their adsorption distance (≈5 Å) and at a much larger distance (≈11 Å). K stabilizes OH through direct interactions by about 0.1 eV more than CH3. This indicates that K may stabilize the O–M interaction more than the C–M interaction through both surface-mediated and direct interactions.

(b) Screening for selectivity for ethylene epoxidation, with selected surfaces labeled. (The KadsAg surface, which has 1/9 ML of K adsorbed on Ag(111), was not used in the rest of this work.)
We also tested CuAg, PdAg, and AuAg alloy surfaces. If the C atom in the oxametallacycle binds to Ag and the O atom binds to the other metal, we find a predicted selectivity trend of CuAg(1.73) > PdAg(1.37) > AuAg(1.16) > Ag(1.09), where the adsorption energy differences are given in electronvolts. This agrees well with previous findings based on the oxametallacycle: CuAg > PdAg > Ag > AuAg, where AuAg and Ag were found to be very similar. (4) CuAg is more selective than Ag because the Cu stabilizes the O–M interaction significantly, while the C–M interaction is nearly unaffected. Therefore, our metric agrees with a number of known trends in experimental selectivities and may be useful in designing other surfaces for ethylene epoxidation.
There are other examples in the literature where catalytic performance has been essentially reduced to the strength of C–M and/or O–M bonds, including CO methanation, (2) acetylene hydrogenation, (41) methane steam reforming, (30) and methane oxidation. (42) These cases demonstrate the wide utility of simple models to predict C and O adsorption energies, and how eqs 2 and 3 can be used in catalyst design. For example, previous work (42) has shown that trends in activity for methane oxidation in solid oxide fuel cells can be predicted based on the C and O adsorption energies. Our model, though fit to data calculated using different adsorbates, a different functional, and a different DFT code, generally reproduces the qualitative trends in adsorption through C atoms and O atoms (see Figure 8).

Conclusions
We have tested a large number of surface properties for their utility in predicting adsorption energies for hydrocarbons and oxygenates. On the basis of this work, we have developed simple, physically transparent, accurate expressions for predicting adsorption energies on a variety of transition metal surfaces. Using a single set of electronic structure parameters, the adsorption energies of CH3, OH, and other similar adsorbates in the top site as well as C, O, and H in the fcc hollow can be predicted. Energies for alkyls and alkoxides in other sites can then be determined using previously developed techniques. While the d-band center, d-band filling, and matrix coupling element are important predictors that are widely used in the literature, adding a dependence on the p-band center can significantly improve the accuracy of predictions. There are significant differences between hydrocarbon adsorption and oxygenate adsorption; in particular, the matrix coupling element is net attractive for hydrocarbons and net repulsive for oxygenates. Both the absolute values and differences in these quantities may be useful in designing catalysts for improved activity and selectivity.

Figure 1
Figure 1. Adsorption energy of (a) CH3 and (b) OH in the top site as a function of the d-band center. Comparing Pt to Pd or to the Pt atom in Pt1Au8 shows that the d-band center cannot always account for variations, even between similar metals or the same metal.

Figure 2. Adsorbate-induced resonance for various values of the p-band center, calculated using the Newns–Anderson model.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Net charge on the adsorbed (a) CH3 group and (b) OH group as a function of Vad2f. Linear fits are included to show that the correlation is much stronger for OH than CH3.
Figure 4
Figure 4. (a) Top-site adsorption energies and gas-phase bond energies as a function of the SOMO–LUMO gap. Each set of connected points represents different radicals binding to a particular metal surface atom or an H atom. Filled symbols are C–M bonding adsorbates, and open symbols are O–M bonding adsorbates. (b) Parity plot showing the application of eqs 4 and 5 to a variety of adsorbates. A few adsorbates are labeled for concreteness.
