Heterogeneous Hydrogenations

Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for
efficient and selective catalysis. However, these two variables are intimately linked in a way
that does not generally allow the optimization of both properties simultaneously. By using
desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy,
we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier
to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface. This facile
hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective
hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone.
T
ypical heterogeneous catalysts for hy-
drogenation reactions often contain noble
metals and alloys based on platinum, pal-
ladium, rhodium, and ruthenium. Although these
metals are active at modest temperature and pres-
sure for a variety of heterogeneous hydrogena-
tions, including alkenes and alkynes, they are
not always selective toward the desired product
and are expensive. Given that molecular hydro-
gen (H2) dissociation is often the rate-limiting
step, one strategy is to engineer the minimal cat-
alytic ensemble that will activate H2 but not the
other reactants. Along these lines, several studies
have shown that individual atoms of Pt, Pd, or Au
in charged or ionic states supported on oxides can
efficiently catalyze a number of important reac-
tions (1–4). Our recent work provides evidence
that, in the Pt catalyzed water-gas shift reaction, it
is not the metal nanoparticle as such but an ionic
species stabilized on the surface of the oxide
support that functions as the active site for cat-
alytic turnover (3).
In a different but related thrust, we are in-
terested in how the reactivity of a catalytically
active metal is altered when it is atomically dis-
persed in the surface layer of a more inert host
metal. Such an approach, if successful, would
offer a means to both temper the reactivity of
a very active element and to design catalysts
with very small amounts of the precious metal.
Besenbacher et al. showed that the opposite strat-
egy can be effective in reducing the reactivity of
a metal by adding small amounts of Au to a Ni
surface to prevent coking of the Ni and improve
steam-reforming performance (5). In a series of
low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy
(LT-STM) and density functional theory (DFT)
studies, we investigated the formation of a class
of bimetallic alloy systems, which we term single-
atom alloys (SAAs), and their interaction with H2
(6–8). Two key characteristics of SAAs are (i) the
more active of the two components (in our case
Pd) is present in the surface of the host metal at
very low concentrations [~0.01 monolayer (ML)]
and (ii) atoms of the more active component
(Pd) are thermodynamically more stable when
surrounded by the host metal such that no dimers
or trimers are present at low coverage. Theory
predicts in a simple homogeneous surface slab
that Pd:Cu ratios up to 1:2 yield individual, iso-
lated Pd atoms that are more stable when sur-
rounded by Cu as compared with Pd dimers or
trimers (6).
This effect is depicted in the STM image in
Fig. 1 for a 0.01 ML Pd in Cu (111) [Pd/Cu(111)]
alloy surface (9). Detailed investigation of the
alloying process reveals that, depending on the
substrate temperature upon Pd deposition, al-
loying occurs mainly in either the topmost layer
(~350 K) or in the subsurface layers at a higher
sample temperature (~500 K) (6–8, 10). The
evaporated Pd adatoms adsorb on the substrate
and diffuse over the terraces in a random walk
fashion until they are trapped at the nearest as-
cending step edge where place exchange and al-
loying into the copper surface layer takes place.
DFT calculations by Sholl and co-workers (7)
reveal that, despite the relatively low barrier of Pd
to traverse step edges, it binds very strongly to
ascending step edges, and we find experimentally
that it remains there during subsequent reaction.
The Pd/Cu SAA surface displays a rather un-
common energetic landscape for the dissociation
and chemisorption of hydrogen. Unlike Pd, the
pristine Cu(111) surface is inert toward the dis-
sociation of unactivated H2 in ultrahigh vacuum
(UHV) because of the dissociation barrier on the
order of 0.4 eV (11). Critically, we find that a
small quantity of Pd atoms in the Cu surface
makes the SAA active toward the uptake of H2,
which can dissociate on the Pd monoatomic en-
tities and then spill over onto the bare Cu(111)
terraces. Chopra et al. recently reported a related
effect involving Ti2Al2 complexes in a Ti-doped
Al(111) surface that efficiently activated H2 (12).
Also, Wittstock et al. suggested that, in the case
of the oxidative coupling of methanol, the ac-
tivity of nanoporous Au, prepared by dealloying
of AuAg alloys, may be rationalized either by a
local change of the d-band structure or by disso-
ciation of oxygen on Ag followed by spillover
onto the Au (13). LT-STM (5 K) enabled us to
directly visualize individual hydrogen adatoms
(Ha) on the Cu(111) surface that spilled over from
Pd atom sites in a 0.01 ML Pd/Cu(111) surface
after exposure to ~10 Langmuirs (L, 10–6 torr⋅s)
of H2 at 80 K (Fig. 1C). Hydrogen atoms appear
as depressions in the STM images because of
the lower electron tunneling probability through
the H-metal complex as compared with the bare
metal at energies near the Fermi level (typically
<0.1 eV) (14, 15).
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)
measurements of H2 desorption from Pd/Cu were
acquired after exposing two different Pd cover-
ages (Fig. 2A, 0.01 ML Pd, and Fig. 2B, 0.1 ML
Pd) to H2 at 85 K. In both cases, the alloys were
prepared by depositing Pd on Cu(111) at a sam-
ple temperature of 380 K for appropriate time
intervals in order to generate surfaces with dif-
ferent densities of Pd atoms substituted into the
surface layer. Desorption of H2 from the 0.01 ML
Pd/Cu(111) alloy surface (Fig. 2A) occurred in a

single state that initially shifted to lower temper-
atures upon increasing the Ha coverage, as ex-
pected for a second-order desorption process. A
200-L H2 exposure yielded a surface Ha cover-
age of 0.2 ML. The peak maximum (210 K) was
much lower than that expected for H2 desorption
from Cu(111) (310 K) (16) or Pd(111) (320 K)
(17). This effect demonstrates that individual,
isolated Pd atoms both assist adsorption and
spillover of Ha onto Cu(111) by acting as the dis-
sociation site for H2 and, as would be expected
from microscopic reversibility, serve as low-barrier
exit routes for H2 during the desorption process.
In comparison, desorption of H2 from Cu(111)
occurs at ~310 K because of a large recombina-
tion barrier and from Pd(111) at ~320 K because
of strong binding. Theoretical modeling has indi-
cated that at higher Pd:Cu ratios two-atom Pd
ensembles are best for activating H2 (18), but our
data in the very low coverage regime reveal that
Pd monomers in the Cu surface are sufficient to
induce the low-temperature hydrogen activation
and desorption observed here.
Increasing the surface concentration of Pd
to 0.1 ML yielded an even lower H2 desorption
maximum (175 K) compared with that of the
0.01 ML Pd/Cu(111) surface for the same nom-
inal H2 exposure; the amount of H2 desorbing
from the surface (~0.4 ML) increased by a factor
of 2 for the same 200-L exposure. The increase of
the Ha surface coverage coupled with the even
lower desorption temperature suggests that in-
creasing the number of Pd monoatomic entities
in the surface effectively increases the number of
entrance and exit routes of hydrogen on and off
the Cu(111) surface. Surface strain also serves
to lower the H2 desorption temperature, because
the addition of larger Pd atoms (diameter dPd =
0.275 nm) to a smaller Cu(111) lattice (dCu =
0.256 nm) imparts compressive strain in the sur-
face. This weakens the binding of H to the Pd
atoms from which they desorb, resulting in a lower
desorption temperature (19). Further increases
of the Pd coverage to 1 ML (Fig. 2C) resulted
in broad desorption features that saturated after
small H2 doses with an Ha coverage ~0.7 ML.
These desorption profiles are consistent with a rath-
er heterogeneous surface of energetically differ-
ent adsorption sites ranging from Pd monoatomic
entities to 2-ML-high Pd islands, which shifted
the desorption feature to higher temperatures, as
expected for desorption of H2 from Pd(111) or
high Pd content Pd/Cu alloys (17, 18).
The potential energy diagram shown in Fig. 3
illustrates the vastly different energetics of the
interaction of hydrogen with Pd(111), Cu(111),
and Pd/Cu SAAs. Energies and activation bar-
riers are taken from (6, 20). The Pd(111) and
Cu(111) surfaces display a difference in the dis-
sociative adsorption of hydrogen. Although H2
dissociation on Pd(111) is not activated (activa-
tion energy Ea ≈0 eV), on Cu(111) it is hampered
by a rather large activation barrier of 0.4 eV. Con-
versely, the binding energy of Ha on Cu(111) is
about 0.2 eV, which is much weaker than that on
Pd(111) (0.6 eV) (6, 20). The weak binding of Ha
on, and activated desorption of H2 from Cu ver-
sus the strong binding of Ha on, and nonactivated
desorption of H2 from Pd lead to almost identical
H2 desorption temperatures from both surfaces
(310 to 320 K). The situation, however, is dras-
tically different on Pd/Cu SAA surfaces.
Our TPD data revealed that single Pd atoms
in the Cu(111) surface lowered the activation
barrier to H2 dissociation and bound Ha weakly
enough to allow it to spill over onto the Cu sur-
face. The net effect is a surface that can easily
activate H2 dissociation (as evidenced by efficient
uptake at 85 K) but also bind it weakly. A similar
type of behavior has been theoretically predicted
for a related class of surface alloys termed near-
surface alloys (NSAs) (20, 21). NSAs involve a
single layer of one metal either supported on or
sandwiched between layers of a different host
metal. Such NSAs have been shown to form even
when bulk alloys are not thermodynamically sta-
ble. It is predicted that, in addition to binding
reactants more weakly than the corresponding
pure metals, NSAs can also dissociate reactants
more readily. The important catalytic properties
of NSAs have been demonstrated with both mod-
el single-crystal alloy surfaces and nanoparticle
catalysts (22–24). For example, a single Ni layer
on Pt(111) exhibits increased activity in the re-
forming of oxygenates as compared with Pt(111),
a subsurface Ni ML, or a thick Ni layer on Pt(111)
(23). RuPt core-shell nanoparticles also display
enhanced reactivity in the preferential oxidation
of CO in the presence of H2 feed as compared
with traditional PtRu nanoalloys, monometallic
mixtures of nanoparticles, and pure Pt particles
(24). By contrast, our SAAs are not layer-on-layer
like the NSAs but use an extremely low surface
concentration of the active metal in the surface
layer, thus allowing the host surface to preserve
its original properties. In the present case, the
Cu(111) host surface, which is in overwhelming
excess (99:1), binds Ha weakly.
Inspired by this vastly different energetic land-
scape for hydrogen adsorption and desorption,
we investigated the capacity of Pd/Cu SAAs
to perform low-temperature, selective catalytic
hydrogenations by using two probe molecules:
styrene and acetylene. Styrene serves as a model
alkene in UHV studies (25) because it can bond
strongly to metals through p interactions. The het-
erogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation of trace
acetylene to ethene is of major industrial impor-
tance, and the adsorption of acetylene has also
been extensively studied on both Cu(111) and
Pd(111) by various techniques (26, 27). Figure 4A
shows representative data acquired from a 0.01
ML Pd/Cu(111) SAA after adsorbing 0.2 ML of
Ha followed by 0.5 ML of styrene. The sole hydro-
genation product of the reaction of styrene with
Ha was ethylbenzene, which desorbed at 260 K
with a 13% conversion and >95% selectivity
based on the detection limit of our mass spectrom-
eter. Unreacted styrene also desorbed during the

temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) sweep,
with all desorption features being essentially iden-
tical to what is expected for styrene adsorption on
clean Cu(111) (figs. S1 and S3). This reveals that
the very small amount of Pd in the Cu(111) surface
(1:99) does not alter the adsorption properties of
the molecule. The absence of any high-temperature
H2 desorption features indicates that there is es-
sentially no decomposition of styrene on the
0.01 ML Pd/Cu(111) surface. In other words, the
single Pd atoms have converted the otherwise
entirely inactive Cu(111) surface into an effective
and very selective hydrogenation catalyst by pro-
viding both a low-energy entrance route for Ha
and many Cu sites where it is weakly bound.
The Pd/Cu SAA also catalyzed the hydro-
genation of acetylene to ethene with high selec-
tivity. Earlier work by Lambert and co-workers
(27) has shown that desorption of acetylene
from the clean Cu(111) surface produces ethene
(8% conversion) through decomposition and self-
hydrogenation of acetylene at ~330 K, as well as
small quantities of coupling products (mainly ben-
zene desorbing at ~320 K). Figure 4B and fig. S4
show representative TPR spectra for the hydro-
genation of acetylene on a 0.01 ML Pd/Cu(111)
SAA after adsorbing 0.2 ML of Ha and 0.5 ML of
acetylene. Hydrogenation of acetylene proceeded
via two distinct pathways. The high-temperature
(330 K) pathway is similar to the TPR of acet-
ylene from Cu(111) in the absence of any pre-
adsorbed Pd or Ha (fig. S1), and we assigned
this pathway to the decomposition and self-
hydrogenation of acetylene at high temperatures
on Cu(111) (27). The conversion of acetylene in
the high-temperature pathway is estimated to be
14% (ethene, 4%; surface carbon, 8%; and ben-
zene, 2%). The low-temperature ethene for-
mation pathway, in which acetylene reacts with
preadsorbed Ha on Cu(111), corresponds to 3%
conversion of the initially adsorbed acetylene with
>95% selectivity based on the detection limit of
our mass spectrometer.
In marked contrast to the selective hydrogen-
ation chemistry on SAAs, the hydrogenation of
styrene and acetylene on 1 ML Pd/Cu(111) (Fig.
4, C and D) was accompanied by an extensive
decomposition of both molecular species and dra-
matically lower hydrogenation selectivity. As the
STM image in Fig. 2C illustrates, higher Pd cov-
erages resulted in the formation of large Pd islands.
These islands exhibited the common tendency of
Pd, which has not been preconditioned with C,
to decompose organic molecules and form ad-
sorbed CHx fragments on the surface that evolve
H2 at a higher temperature, resulting in consider-
ably lower selectivities (28). The TPR measure-
ments shown in Fig. 4C indicate that the overall
conversion of styrene to ethylbenzene and sur-
face carbon is 80% with the selectivity toward
ethylbenzene being 38%. In other words, ~50% of
the initially adsorbed reactant decomposed on the
surface. A similar picture was observed in the case
of acetylene hydrogenation on 1 ML Pd/Cu(111)
(Fig. 4D); 60% of the initially dosed acetylene de-
composed to form surface carbon with no coupling
products observed. The overall conversion of acet-
ylene was 90%, whereas the selectivity toward
ethene was 33%.
Our results demonstrate that very small quan-
tities of individual, isolated catalytically active
metal atoms can substantially influence the cat-
alytic properties of less reactive metals. Minority
Pd atoms (1%) in a Cu surface activate hydrogen,
which then populates bare Cu areas (99%) where
it is weakly bound and effective for hydrogena-
tion, yielding a bifunctional surface with different
regions facilitating different steps in the reaction.
From a practical application standpoint, the small
amounts of precious metal required to produce
SAAs generates a very attractive alternative to
most traditional bimetallic catalysts. Recent ad-
vances in catalyst synthesis mean that synergistic
effects, whereby different components of the
catalyst have a particular function in the overall
reaction mechanism, are indeed possible with prac-
tical dispersed catalysts (29). Implementation of
the SAA approach to the design of real catalysts
requires consideration of the effect of higher re-
action temperature, which may cause the minor-
ity active element to segregate into the bulk of the

more inert host and hence a loss in activity. How-
ever, there are now many experimental and the-
oretical examples of metal alloys under realistic
conditions in which the more active element is
stabilized at the surface by adsorbates (21, 30–32).
This adsorbate-induced reverse segregation effect
is understood in terms of the adsorbate binding
more strongly to the element, which would nor-
mally segregate to the bulk and result in a re-
versal of the surface segregation behavior (21). In
the case of the Cu/Pd system, the stabilization
resulting from segregation of Cu to the surface is
small (0.02 eV) (31) compared with the ~0.4-eV
increase in binding of H to Pd versus Cu (6, 20).
The fact that Pd segregation to the Cu surface has
been observed experimentally in Pd/Cu catalysts
under realistic hydrogenation operating condi-
tions bodes well for the utility of this atomic ge-
ometry in real catalysts (32).

An Impactor Origin for Lunar
Magnetic Anomalies
Mark A. Wieczorek,1* Benjamin P. Weiss,2 Sarah T. Stewart3
The Moon possesses strong magnetic anomalies that are enigmatic given the weak magnetism
of lunar rocks. We show that the most prominent grouping of anomalies can be explained by
highly magnetic extralunar materials from the projectile that formed the largest and oldest impact
crater on the Moon: the South Pole–Aitken basin. The distribution of projectile materials from
a model oblique impact coincides with the distribution of magnetic anomalies surrounding this
basin, and the magnetic properties of these materials can account for the intensity of the observed
anomalies if they were magnetized in a core dynamo field. Distal ejecta from this event can
explain the origin of isolated magnetic anomalies far from this basin.
B
eginning with the Apollo era, spacecraft
observations have shown that portions of
the lunar crust are strongly magnetized
(1–4), yet their origin has remained unresolved.
The lithologies of the source rocks for these
anomalies are unknown, their time of magneti-
zation acquisition is poorly constrained, and it
is unclear whether the magnetization process
was thermoremanent or shock-related (5, 6). As a
result, the origin of the magnetizing fields is
a matter of debate, with possibilities including a
core dynamo, transient fields generated during
impacts, and the amplification of ambient fields
by impact-generated plasmas (7–13).
A key difficulty is that most lunar magnetic
anomalies have not been recognized to correlate
withknowngeologicstructures.Afewimpactbasins
possess central magnetic anomalies (12, 14, 15),
but these anomalies are typically weak and are
not representative of the most intense anomalies,
most of which are located on the far side of the
Moon (Fig. 1). Impact basin ejecta deposits are
statistically somewhat more magnetic than other
geologic units, but the magnetic signatures of the
ejecta from any given basin are quite variable
(16). A few prominent anomalies on the far side
of the Moon are located near the antipodes of four
young impact basins (2, 3), suggestive of an exot-
ic impact origin (17), but many strong anomalies
are not associated with basin antipodes, and most
basins do not possess antipodal anomalies.
It is also difficult to reconcile the strengths of
these anomalies with the magnetic properties of
known endogenous lunar materials. This is be-
cause lunar materials are very weakly magnetic
relative to terrestrial materials: The saturation rem-
anent magnetizations of mare basalts and pristine
highlands rocks are weaker than those of mid-
ocean ridge basalt by two to four or more orders
of magnitude (18, 19). To demonstrate this, we
calculated the thickness of magnetized materials
required to generate a representative 10-nTanom-
aly at an altitude of 30 km as a function of the
magnetizing field strength and rock thermorem-
anence susceptibility (ratio of thermoremanence
to the magnetizing field) (Fig. 2). The thermo-
remanence susceptibility correlates with both the
abundance of magnetic carriers in the rock and
the rock’s saturation remanent magnetization
(supporting online material), and lunar paleomag-
netic studies imply ancient field strengths be-
tween ~1 and 120 mT (5, 20, 21). We find that
even the highest postulated paleofield strengths
would require extremely thick deposits of uni-
directionally magnetized materials to account
for the lunar magnetic anomalies. For example,
more than 100 km of pristine feldspathic high-
land rocks would be required, but these thick-
nesses are greater than the thickness of the entire
lunar crust. More than 10 km of mare basalts
would be required, but this far exceeds the thick-
ness of most maria (11). Even the relatively high-
ly magnetic mafic impact melts, most of which
are thought to be derived from the Imbrium im-
pact event (22), would require thicknesses of
at least several kilometers, but none of the mag-
netic anomalies show the topographic expres-
sions that might be expected for such locally thick
ejecta deposits.
However, there is a major geologic structure
that correlates with some of the largest lunar
magnetic anomalies and that has received little
consideration previously. The far-side hemisphere
of the Moon hosts the largest known unequivocal
