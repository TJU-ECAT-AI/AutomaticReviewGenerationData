The selective reaction of one part of a bifunctional molecule is a fundamental challenge in heterogeneous catalysis and for
many processes including the conversion of biomass-derived intermediates. Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated epoxides
to saturated epoxides is particularly difﬁcult given the reactivity of the strained epoxide ring, and traditional platinum group
catalysts show low selectivities. We describe the preparation of highly selective Pd catalysts involving the deposition of
n-alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) coatings. These coatings improve the selectivity of 1-epoxybutane formation
from 1-epoxy-3-butene on palladium catalysts from 11 to 94% at equivalent reaction conditions and conversions. Although
sulphur species are generally considered to be indiscriminate catalyst poisons, the reaction rate to the desired product on a
catalyst coated with a thiol was 40% of the rate on an uncoated catalyst. Interestingly the activity decreased for less-ordered
SAMs with shorter chains. The behaviour of SAM-coated catalysts was compared with catalysts where surface sites were
modiﬁed by carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons or sulphur atoms. The results suggest that the SAMs restrict sulphur coverage
to enhance selectivity without signiﬁcantly poisoning the activity of the desired reaction.

eterogeneous catalysts are widely used in industrial
processes because of their stability and ease of catalyst
recovery compared with their homogeneous counterparts.
However, the promiscuity of these catalysts commonly leads to low
selectivity, which increases costs of product purification and waste1.
In contrast to heterogeneous catalysts, biological and synthetic
homogeneous catalysts commonly achieve high selectivity through
specific non-covalent or steric interactions between functional
groups on the catalyst and reactant. For example, enzymes are
able to achieve excellent selectivity through specific interactions
between a reactant and amino-acid residues near the active site2.
Similarly, synthetic homogeneous catalysts engineered through
the modification of porphyrin with aromatic ligands are highly
selective for chiral epoxidation3 and reactions of proteins and
aromatics4. Although heterogeneous catalysts modified with chiral
organic ligands are employed to enable selective asymmetric
hydrogenation5, analogous modifiers for chemoselective reactivity
have not been identified.
The hydrogenation of unsaturated epoxides is one class
of reactions where identifying such modifiers would prove
valuable. These molecules are useful model compounds for a
growing feedstock of unsaturated oxygenates that are derived from
biomass6,7. In addition, a model unsaturated epoxide reactant,
1-epoxy-3-butene (EpB), can be cheaply and selectively produced
from butadiene on supported silver catalysts8. EpB contains two
functional groups, a C–O–C epoxide ring and a C=C double bond.
Selective hydrogenation of the double bond produces epoxybutane,
a valuable commodity chemical used in the manufacture of
polyethers, surfactants, glycols, polyesters, epoxy resins and fuel
additives9,10. However, EpB forms many products with hydrogen, as
demonstrated in Fig. 1, and selective hydrogenation of the double
bond is difficult. Surface science studies show that EpB forms
strongly bound intermediates on Pd(111) through facile epoxide

ring opening to form an aldehyde intermediate11. Unlike other
metals such as Ag (ref. 12), Pd causes irreversible ring opening.
Reacting EpB with hydrogen on supported Pd and Pt catalysts yields
epoxybutane with a selectivity of less than 20% at temperatures
above ambient and conversions greater than 5% (ref. 13).
Here, we modified conventional Pd/Al2O3 catalysts with
alkanethiol coatings. When deposited on a metal surface from
a dilute solution, these thiols spontaneously arrange to form a
SAM (ref. 14). The thiol species typically form a commensurate
epitaxial layer such as the (√3×√3)R30 structure of n-alkanethiol
SAMs (in this case propanethiol) on Pd(111) surfaces shown in
Fig. 2. Thiol monolayers consist of a sulphur atom ‘head’ with a
hydrocarbon ‘tail’, which can comprise a number of functionalities
such as alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, acids, amines and aromatics.
Herein, we show that surface modification with alkanethiols can be
used to produce a well-defined near-surface environment that alters
reactivity for multifunctional compounds.
Figure 3 summarizes the effectiveness of alkanethiol SAMs
on conventional Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in enhancing selective EpB
reduction to epoxybutane. Alkanethiol coatings with varying tail
lengths were evaluated and characterized including propanethiol
(C3), hexanethiol (C6), dodecanethiol (C12) and octadecanethiol
(C18). On uncoated palladium catalysts, selectivity for epoxybutane
at 313 K was 11% at 5% EpB conversion, consistent with previous
studies13. After applying the alkanethiol coatings, the selectivity
for epoxybutane increased to 80–94% at the same conversion
depending on thiol tail length, as shown in Fig. 3. On the coated
catalysts, crotonaldehyde was the main by-product (3–15%), with
butyraldehyde and alcohols as minor products (<2% each).
The uncoated catalyst primarily produced crotonaldehyde (36%),
alcohols (44%) and butyraldehyde (7%) along with small amounts
of deoxygenation and decarbonylation products in addition
to epoxybutane.

Experiments were also conducted varying the amount of catalyst
(up to 200 mg) and the total feed flow rate to evaluate selectivity as a
function of EpB conversion for the uncoated and octadecanethiol-
coated catalysts at 313 K. Whereas selectivity on the uncoated
catalyst exhibited a maximum of 31 ± 3% at less than 1% EpB
conversion and decreased to 8 ± 2% at between 99 and 100%
EpB conversion, selectivity on the C18-coated catalyst was greater
than 99% at less than 1% conversion, and 53±2% at between 99
and 100% conversion.
As shown in Fig. 3, the activity of the SAM-coated catalysts
(shown as apparent turnover frequency) decreased relative to the
uncoated catalyst, and increased significantly with increasing thiol
tail length despite the increasing thickness of the monolayer film
above the active surface. The most active SAM-coated catalyst, C18,
exhibited epoxybutane formation rates that were approximately
40% of the rate for the uncoated catalyst. Each experiment was
conducted over a period of up to 12 h, during which no deactivation
was observed. Experiments conducted at 323 and 333 K showed
similar trends as the results in Fig. 3.
Taken together, the data in Fig. 3 suggest that although the
identity of the moiety attached to the thiol group (that is, the
so-called tail group) is a major determinant of the activity of
the modified catalyst, the selectivity is essentially independent of
the tail group identity, and is therefore likely to be due to the
arrangement of the sulphur atoms. This conjecture is supported by
further experiments we carried out in which the catalyst was coated
with SAMs comprising hydroxy-terminated C3 and C6 alkanethiols
and thioglycerol. Although the activity associated with monolayers
produced from the hydroxylated thiolates varied significantly, as
shown in Fig. 3, the selectivity was again high across all SAMs.
Vibrational spectroscopy has been used extensively to determine
the degree of molecular organization with SAMs deposited on
Pd (ref. 14), Ag (ref. 15), Cu (ref. 15) and Au (refs 15–18). In
particular, SAMs exhibit a greater number of Gauche defects with
increasing disorder, causing the methylene d−stretching mode to
shift from ∼2,920 cm−1, a value consistent with crystalline alkanes,
to 2,928 cm−1, a value consistent with liquid- or solution-phase
alkanes16. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT)
spectra of the alkanethiol-coated catalysts deposited from 10 mM
ethanolic solutions are shown in Fig. 4. For the C3-coated catalyst,
the methylene d−stretching mode was observed at 2,929 cm−1,
indicating that the thiol tails were highly disordered and in a
liquid-like state. On the C6- and C12-coated catalysts this mode was
observed at 2,925 and 2,923 cm−1, respectively, indicating more-
ordered monolayers. The C18-coated catalyst exhibited this mode
at 2,921 cm−1, consistent with an ordered SAM on polycrystalline
palladium14. The correlation between alkyl chain order and catalytic
activity is striking, and suggests that within the homologous series
of alkanethiols, coatings with greater molecular order have higher
activity compared with less well-ordered coatings.
Quantifying reaction rates at different temperatures enables the
determination of apparent activation energies. Apparent activation
energies for olefin hydrogenation reactions are generally found to
be 33–42 kJ mol−1 on a variety of metals with different electronic
and geometric structures1,19. Values outside this range indicate a
change in the reaction mechanism for hydrogenation or a change
in the rate-determining step, such as the desorption of tightly
bound carbon monoxide (CO) to make space for the reactants20
or mass-transfer limitations1,21. Experimental values for activation
energy were 41 ± 3, 42 ± 3, 41 ± 4 and 39 ± 2 kJ mol−1 for the
C3-, C6-, C12- and C18-coated catalysts respectively. These values
indicate that thiol-coated catalysts seem to behave similarly to
their traditional metal counterparts and probably share a similar
olefin hydrogenation mechanism. In addition, these results suggest
that the presence of the SAM does not induce a significant mass-
transfer barrier for the diffusion of EpB through the SAM coating
to the metal surface.
The contrast between the uniformly high epoxybutane selectivity
for all of the alkanethiol coatings and the activity varying with
tail length suggests differing mechanisms for the effect of the
SAMs on selectivity and activity. One possible mechanism by which
SAMs may enhance selectivity is through site blocking to control
ensemble sizes. Surface modification to control metal ensemble
size is a common and effective practice to improve selectivity in a
variety of systems, such as the synthesis of vinyl acetate on Pd–Au
bimetallic catalysts22. To determine whether ensemble effects alone
may be responsible for the enhanced selectivity of thiol-coated
catalysts, EpB hydrogenation experiments were conducted using
a feed containing a variable amount of CO. Unlike sulphur, CO
primarily blocks olefin hydrogenation sites without significantly
impacting electronic structure20. Therefore, varying CO exposure
probes the impact of ensemble sizes and adsorbate mobility. In

space available on the surface for reaction.
addition, at coverages up to 1/3 of a monolayer, CO adsorbs in
a (√3 × √3)R30 structure on Pd(111) hollow sites23, which is
the same structure observed for hexanethiol SAMs on Au(111)
(ref. 24). Selectivity and activity for epoxybutane were evaluated
for CO concentrations up to 3,500 ppm, at which point the catalyst
activity became negligible. A modest, approximately linear, increase
in selectivity to epoxybutane with CO concentration was observed,
with a maximum selectivity of only ∼30% when the surface was
nearly saturated with CO. As the catalyst approached saturation,
the reaction rate dropped suddenly at 2,500 ppm CO. This step
change is similar to the step change observed in the activation
barrier of ethylene hydrogenation in the presence of increasing
concentrations of CO on Pt(111) (ref. 25). A plot of these data
is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. As the observed maximum in
selectivity closely matches the selectivity of the palladium catalyst at
low conversion (31±3%), it is clear that ensemble effects alone do
not play a critical role in the observed selectivity enhancement.
As the molecular structure of the alkanethiol, rather than its
function as merely a site-blocking agent, seems to be key to the
observation of high selectivity, we conducted experiments that
independently examined the effects of the two component parts
of the alkanethiol: the sulphur head group and the alkyl tail group.
It is noted that separation of the two components is not rigorously
possible, because they do not operate independently in formation
of SAMs. However, such experiments provide key insights into the
mechanism for the high selectivity provided by the SAM coatings.
To investigate the effect of the head group, we exposed the uncoated
catalyst to 1,000 ppm H2S in nitrogen for periods between 5 s and
2 h at room temperature and then purged the residual H2S in an
inert nitrogen atmosphere. H2S dissociates on Pd and can form
ordered structures similar to SAMs (ref. 26), so it serves as a means
of evaluating the effect of surface sulphur without the presence of
an alkyl tail. Figure 5 shows that the selectivity was enhanced at
low sulphur exposures; however, larger exposures resulted in nearly
complete deactivation. The gradual decrease in selectivity and
activity with exposure may result from the formation of subsurface
sulphur, which can poison hydrogen adsorption26. The epoxybu-
tane formation rate on the sulphided catalysts was at best 31% of the
rate observed on octadecanethiol-coated catalysts and only slightly
higher than the rate observed on propanethiol-coated catalysts.
The impact of the alkyl tail without surface sulphur was
evaluated by exposing the palladium catalyst to alkenes to produce
a metal surface containing substantial coverages of alkylidyne
(–C–(CH2)n–CH3) species. Alkanethiols in SAMs adsorb on the
(111) crystal plane of face-centred-cubic (fcc) metals in the same
(√3 × √3)R30 geometry24 as alkylidynes such as ethylidyne27.
In addition, the potential energy surfaces for alkanethiols28 and
ethylidyne29 diffusing on fcc(111) metals are similar, indicating that
these adsorbates have similar mobilities at low coverage. Therefore,
we aged the palladium catalyst in dilute propylene, 1-hexene
or 1-dodecene to produce catalysts with alkylidyne structures
similar to SAMs. Catalysts aged in propylene or 1-hexene showed
similar activities and selectivities for epoxybutane formation as the
uncoated catalyst; however, unlike the uncoated catalyst, only trace

(<1%) alcohols were produced. Thus, co-coverage of shorter-chain
alkylidynes does modify the selectivity, but not in the desired
manner. The catalyst aged in 1-dodecene had an epoxybutane
formation rate of 0.13 ± 0.02 mol g−1 s−1, intermediate to the C6
and C12 alkanethiol SAM catalysts, and a selectivity of 65±5%.
DRIFT spectra for the alkene-aged catalysts, shown in Supple-
mentary Fig. S2, reveal the presence of disordered alkylidynes in
each case, indicated by asymmetric methylene stretching modes
at 2,935 and 2,965 cm−1, which were previously reported after
1-hexene adsorption on Ru(0,001) (ref. 30). The 1-dodecene-
aged catalyst differs from its shorter counterparts owing to the
prevalence of an extra mode at 2,860 cm−1, which is consistent
with carbonaceous deposits observed from exposure to alkynes
such as acetylene31 or hexyne32. This mode is also present in the
propylene- and 1-hexene-aged catalysts as a shoulder to the methyl
stretching mode at 2,800 cm−1; however, it is less intense. These
results indicate that alkylidynes cannot produce the same selectivity
enhancement observed for SAMs and the observed enhancement
for the 1-dodecene case probably results from the formation of
significant amounts of carbonaceous deposits in larger, less-mobile
structures than surface alkylidynes or alkanethiol SAMs.
Cumulatively, the results above suggest that the sulphur head
group of the alkanethiol SAMs is most likely to be responsible
for the high selectivity for epoxybutane formation, because high
selectivity is observed for all tail lengths and atomic sulphur
deposited on the surface, but is not observed after deposition
of surface CO or alkylidynes. Previous studies show that the
effect of surface sulphur can change both the geometric and
electronic structure of platinum group metals33. Geometric effects
alter the crystallinity of the underlying surface, which may reduce
the activity of reactions requiring multiple metal atoms and
tightly bound intermediates, such as epoxide hydrogenolysis.
Electronic effects similar to those that may occur from surface
sulphur have been observed for the synthesis of vinyl acetate on
palladium. At high coverage, lateral interactions and electron-
withdrawing effects destabilize adsorbates, favouring bond-making
reactions over bond-breaking reactions, which require more tightly
bound species34. Identical adsorbate–adsorbate interactions have
been demonstrated using density functional theory for single-
atom adsorbates such as oxygen35, so it is likely that adsorbed
sulphur could carry out a similar function. Unlike the uncoated
catalyst, the SAM-coated catalysts did not effectively catalyse the
hydrogenolysis of EpB to form alcohols or the formation of

deoxygenation or decarbonylation products, possibly owing to the
destabilization of the tightly bound intermediate required to break
a C–O or C–C bond.
This mechanism (that is, the destabilization of adsorbates,
favouring bond-making over bond-breaking) of SAM-coated
catalysts is supported by temperature-programmed desorption
(TPD) studies on single-crystal Pd surfaces. We found that EpB
adsorbed on uncoated Pd(111) through its olefin function and
underwent irreversible epoxide ring opening at temperatures below
200 K, consistent with a low-energy barrier for epoxide ring
opening11. This reaction was confirmed by the observation that
no desorption of intact EpB was detected as the temperature was
increased. However, on Pd(111) coated with a C6 SAM, intact EpB
was observed to desorb at 260 K, suggesting that the barrier for
epoxide ring opening was increased significantly in the presence
of the SAM. In addition, the saturated analogue, epoxybutane,
desorbed at 190 K, suggesting that epoxide interactions with the
surface are significantly destabilized. The presence of the SAM
did not seem to prevent EpB adsorption to Pd through the olefin
moiety because EpB was observed to desorb at a temperature
similar to that observed for ethylene and propylene on Pd(111)
(refs 36,37). Details of this method and spectra for the experiments
described above are provided in the Supplementary Information
and Fig. S3. This relative change in adsorption energy between the
olefin and epoxide functionalities may be crucial to the mechanism
for sulphur-enhanced selectivity, as first-principles calculations
predict that increasing adsorption strength of the desired functional
group may aid in the selective hydrogenation of a similar class of
molecules, unsaturated aldehydes38.
Pd(111) was used for TPD experiments in this work, and this
crystal plane is most commonly used when characterizing SAMs.
Although the low dispersion of the catalyst employed in this study
ensures that a large fraction of the surface will consist of this
crystal plane, the supported Pd catalyst does not present a purely
(111) surface, but rather many surface facets. These other facets
predominantly include (100) surface facets and corner and edge
sites. Studies of SAMs on Au(100) suggest the formation of a
c(2 × 2) structure, which has a higher coverage than its (111)
counterpart39. Similarly, studies of SAMs on gold nanoparticles
show thiol coverages greater than 60% (ref. 40), probably owing to
higher coverage on corner and edge sites, as model studies show
sulphur binds more tightly at these locations41. Thus, the precise
ensemble of metal sites left available for reaction by the SAM

will differ on the different facets of the crystal, and SAM-coated
catalysts are probably sensitive to dispersion. Nevertheless, the
surface crowding effect of alkanethiol deposition is expected to be
even greater on more open surface facets, and thus the general
mechanisms for reactivity described above would be expected
to still be important on surfaces other than Pd(111). Ongoing
investigations of the role of Pd particle morphology can shed further
light on the role of crystallite morphology.
Although the sulphur head group of alkanethiol SAMs seems
to control selectivity modification, the tail groups have a strong
influence on activity. Figure 3 and the DRIFT spectroscopy results
show that longer, more-ordered tails have the highest activity.
The decrease in activity with decreasing order does not seem to
result from mass-transfer limitations through the tail; such effects
would result in a decrease in apparent activation energy. Instead,
we propose that disordered tails reduce activity in the near-surface
region through one of two possible mechanisms. Disordered tails
can physically block access to active sites or reduce the mobility
of adsorbed thiols. Such a blockage would result in the identical
(within experimental uncertainty) activation barriers and product
distributions observed for each tail length. It is also possible that
disordered tails may increase the entropic barrier to adsorption,
which would also leave the activation barrier for epoxybutane for-
mation unchanged; however, all reaction pathways would have to be
affected equally to retain the same product distribution. Differences
in activity between metals that exhibit identical activation barriers
for olefin hydrogenation reactions are commonly attributed to such
entropic effects19. Regardless, the significant reaction rates observed
even for relatively long SAM tails suggest the potential to use a wide
variety of complex SAM structures, even those that significantly
crowd the surface, to modify selectivity of supported metal catalysts.
The results for EpB are supported by similar experiments
using an α–β unsaturated aldehyde, crotonaldehyde (2-buten-1-al).
Experiments testing crotonaldehyde hydrogenation at 313 K on a
C6-thiol-coated catalyst showed 100% selectivity for butyraldehyde,
the product formed by reduction of the C=C double bond.
Although achieving high selectivity for this reaction is facile on
Pd catalysts42, the thiol-coated catalyst continued to achieve 100%
selectivity for butyraldehyde regardless of conversion or reactor
residence time, whereas the uncoated catalyst produced 1-butanol
at high conversions and residence times. This result indicates that
selectivity promotion with thiol SAMs and supported catalysts
may be applicable to a variety of reactions of importance with

similar reaction pathways, such as the selective hydrogenation of
a double bond over other functional groups including aldehydes,
acids, nitriles or alkynes.
As surface sulphur is primarily responsible for enhanced selectiv-
ity and disordered thiol tails can reduce activity, it is reasonable to
conclude that exposure to alternative forms of sulphiding could be
superior to SAMs. However, SAMs provide significant advantages
over more traditional means of sulphur exposure. Despite the
prominent influence of sulphur on the enhanced selectivity,
catalysts sulphided by exposure to dilute H2S or sulphur-containing
molecules that can easily crack, such as thiophene, are not the same
as catalysts with alkanethiol SAM coatings. Surface sulphur forms
a wide variety of structures on Pd that can hinder hydrogenation.
Similar to alkanethiol SAMs, the (√3 × √3)R30 geometry of ad-
sorbed sulphur is observed on Pd(111); however, the (√7×√7)R19
geometry is also observed and preferentially forms in ultrahigh
vacuum on Pd(111) after annealing above 400 K (ref. 43). TPD
experiments show that the latter structure prevents the dissociative
adsorption of hydrogen and effectively poisons the catalyst,
probably through the formation of subsurface sulphur, which
changes both the geometric and electronic structure of the surface26.
Although the deposition of alkanethiol SAMs does result in some
surface sulphur through S–C bond cracking, depth profiling Auger
electron spectroscopy experiments have shown that this sulphur
does not measurably penetrate into the bulk14 and is thus less
likely to poison hydrogen dissociation than surface sulphur from
other sources. It is worth noting that surface restructuring effects
caused by deposition of alkanethiols—as has been shown for the
‘herringbone’ reconstruction of the Au(111) surface44—may have
some influence on the observed reactivity, but such restructuring
effects are expected to be far more subtle than is observed following
extensive sulphidation by H2S. Therefore, alkanethiol coatings
provide a facile method of restricting sulphur coverage to the more
favourable (√3×√3)R30 geometry on fcc(111) surfaces, prevent-
ing such deleterious effects. These effects manifest themselves in
the facile deposition method for SAMs, unlike the comparatively
difficult procedure for depositing controlled quantities of surface
sulphur, which in this work produced an inferior result.
The selective hydrogenation of unsaturated epoxides such as EpB
is a considerable challenge on traditional supported metal catalysts.
Unlike uncoated palladium catalysts that showed a selectivity to
epoxybutane at 313 K of 11%, coated catalysts greatly improved
selectivity to up to 94% at the same EpB conversion. Mechanistic
studies suggested that the enhancement in selectivity was caused by
metal–sulphur interactions and that the thiol tail controlled sulphur
coverage and improved activity over systems using only sulphur.
This work shows that the precise control of surface structure by
well-organized alkanethiol SAM coatings can markedly improve the
catalytic selectivity of hydrogenation reactions, and that the reactiv-
ity of these SAM-modified catalysts is sensitive to subtle differences
in the molecular organization within the molecular layer.
Methods
Materials. Pd/Al2O3 (5 wt%), 1-propanethiol, 1-hexanethiol, 1-dodecanethiol,
1-octadecanethiol, 1-dodecene, 1-hexene, crotonaldehyde (2-buten-1-al, 97%) and
200-proof HPLC-grade ethanol were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. All thiol and
alkene purities were greater than 97%. EpB (>98%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar
and all gases were ultrahigh purity and were obtained from Airgas.
Preparation and characterization of catalysts. Before thiol deposition and/or
testing, 7.0 mg (uncoated case) or 50.0 mg (coated cases) of 5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst
diluted to 300 mg with Al2O3 was packed into a glass reactor tube and cleaned by
oxidation at 573 K in 20% oxygen for two hours. The catalyst was then reduced
at 473 K in 20% hydrogen for greater than 2 h and cooled to room temperature
in an inert flow of He. Thiol coatings were deposited by immersing the packed
catalyst bed at room temperature in 10 mM ethanolic solutions of propanethiol,
hexanethiol or dodecanethiol or 1 mM ethanolic solutions of octadecanethiol for
24 h, except where specified otherwise. The coated catalyst was dried in an inert
flow of nitrogen or helium for at least 12 h before being tested. Sulphur-coated
catalysts were prepared by exposing 50.0 mg of 5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst packed in a
glass reactor tube to 1,000 ppm H2S in N2 at a flow rate of 200 s.c.c.m. for varying
amounts of time and then purging with N2. The catalysts aged in alkenes were
prepared by exposing 50.0 mg of 5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst to a flow of helium with 1%
propylene or 1-hexene or 0.1% 1-dodecene for 4 h at 373 K.
Coated and uncoated catalysts were characterized using DRIFT spectroscopy
to collect spectra in the C–H stretching region (2,800 cm−1 to 3,000 cm−1) using
a Thermo Nicolet 6,700 FTIR. DRIFT spectra were corrected by subtracting a
background spectrum of oxidized and reduced 5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst and adjusting
for baseline drift. A resolution of 4 cm−1 was used.
CO chemisorption (Quantachrome Autosorb-1) was also used to characterize
the surface area of exposed Pd on the coated and uncoated catalyst. We measured
a metal surface area of 3.74 m2 g−1 on the uncoated catalyst that dropped to
0.23 m2 g−1 after coating with hexanethiol using CO chemisorption, indicating
that 94% of the metal surface was modified by the adsorbed thiol. The palladium
metal dispersion was 16.8% and the average metal particle diameter (assuming a
spherical shape) was 6.7 nm.
Catalytic tests. Reaction products were quantified using a gas chromatograph
(HP5890) equipped with a flame ionization detector, a Poraplot-Q capillary
column (Varian) and peak simple software (SRI). The packed catalysts were
exposed to a feed stream with a 10:1 H2 to EpB ratio, produced by entraining
EpB in a He flow at 298 K with a bubbler. A constant feed flow rate of 25 s.c.c.m.
for thiol- and sulphur-coated catalysts was chosen to produce 5±2% conversion
of EpB unless otherwise noted. Reactions were conducted at 313, 323 and 333 K
by heating the glass reactor tubes in a temperature-controlled clamshell-style
furnace. Selectivities were calculated by dividing the conversion to one product
by the total EpB conversion. Turnover frequencies were calculated on the basis
of the metal surface area of the uncoated catalyst. This method does not account
for reductions in the number of active sites resulting from the thiol coating or
carbonaceous deposits and may underestimate the true turnover frequency.
Experiments testing crotonaldehyde hydrogenation were conducted similarly using
a 25:1 H2 to crotonaldehyde feed ratio and 1 g of uncoated or hexanethiol-coated
5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst at 313 K.
