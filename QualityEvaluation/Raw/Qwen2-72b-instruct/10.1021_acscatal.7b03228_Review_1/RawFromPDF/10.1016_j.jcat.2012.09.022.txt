Supported Au catalysts modiﬁed by the addition of small amount of Pd (Au/Pd atomic ratio (10) were pre-
pared according to three different methods, co-deposition–precipitation with urea (DPU), deposition of
colloids stabilised either by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or by tetrakis (hydroxypropyl) phosphonium chloride
(THPC) on two oxide supports, alumina and titania. In all cases, after thermal treatments (under H2 at
300 C for DPU samples and under air then H2 at 500 C for PVA and THPC samples), the metal particles
were smaller than 5 nm. Characterisation by DRIFTS coupled with CO adsorption revealed that the par-
ticles are bimetallic and that Pd is present on the particle surface as isolated Pd by Au atoms and as
Pd dimers. In addition, the surface composition depends on the preparation method and the Au/Pd ratio
and evolves under CO exposure towards a gradual enrichment in palladium.
AuPd catalysts showed improved catalytic properties compared to Au catalysts in selective hydrogena-
tion of butadiene in presence of excess of propene. Activity was higher and directly related to the Pd con-
tent. The nature of the support has no inﬂuence on the catalytic properties. An optimised selectivity to
butenes with poor formation of alkanes (propane and butane) could be achieved for an atomic Au/Pd ratio
of 20. THPC-based catalysts showed higher activity than DPU samples in spite of slightly larger metal par-
ticles, and this was attributed to the presence of residual phosphorus after catalyst activation. PVA-based
catalysts, which contained slightly larger metal particles, were slightly less active, but were more selec-
tive to butenes. This was related to the absence of Pd dimers, responsible for overhydrogenation.

1. Introduction
The use of gold catalysts for hydrogenation reactions has
encountered a growing interest in the recent past years. The high
selectivity to partially hydrogenated products attested by gold cat-
alysts in the hydrogenation of alkynes and alkadienes is indeed
remarkable [1] and reference therein. However, the gold catalysts
exhibit much lower activity than the group VIII metals. This signif-
icantly lower activity of gold is related to its limited capacity to
dissociate H2 [2], which is strongly dependent on the amount of
low coordination sites available on the gold nanoparticles and is
thus favoured when the size of the particles decreases [3,4]. In a
former paper [5], it was shown that alumina-supported Au cata-
lysts modiﬁed by the addition of small amount of Pd (Au/Pd atomic
ratio P10) and prepared either by co-deposition–precipitation
(DPU) or by co-impregnation in excess of solution (IES), resulted
in the formation of bimetallic AuPd particles that were able to pro-
mote gold catalysts in selective hydrogenation of butadiene in the
presence of excess of propene. With a Au/Pd ratio of 20, the opti-
mised ratio, it has been possible to combine the high selectivity
of gold with poor activity, with the high activity of palladium,
but poor selectivity, to make a more active catalyst than gold,
but almost as selective at the temperature corresponding to 100%
conversion (T100%). We had also previously reported that 100%
selectivity in partial hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene to p-
chloroaniline could be obtained using similar AuPd/Al2O3 catalysts
with high Au/Pd atomic ratio (P20) [6]. The DPU method appeared
more efﬁcient than the IES method to obtain reproducible and
homogeneous bimetallic and small nanoparticles. However, DPU
did not allow to perfectly control the Au/Pd ratio since in contrast
to gold, the yield of Pd deposition did not reach 100%.
The goal of this paper was to extend this study to other methods
of preparation to attempt to better control the yield of deposition
of each metal and the formation of small metal particles. It was
also to investigate another oxide support, titania, to determine
whether the support has an inﬂuence on the catalytic properties
or not. Note that for monometallic gold catalysts, the catalytic
properties in selective hydrogenation of butadiene did not depend
on the oxide support [7].
As other preparation methods, we chose to use methods involv-
ing the deposition of preformed bimetallic particles. The advantage
of colloidal methods is that the particles preformed in solution are
supposed to be homogeneous in composition and size and to not

contain chlorides; the particle size depends on the nature and con-
centration of reductant and stabiliser. Deposition on supports can
be performed through mere impregnation, but adsorption was pre-
ferred in this work to achieve better particle distribution, but this
requires the control of the yield of deposition. The main drawback
with preparation methods involving colloids is that the stabilising
agents must be removed before catalytic reaction in gas phase to
provide access of the metallic sites to the gas reactants. This
decomposition is usually performed by calcination treatment,
which should be followed by a reducing treatment to undoubtedly
obtain metallic particles. However, sintering or restructuration of
the particles may occur during these treatments.
Preparations via deposition of Au and AuPd colloids on acti-
vated carbon have been widely studied by Prati’s group, especially,
with methods involving polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as stabiliser [8–
11]. PVA-stabilised gold sol was ﬁrst deposited onto the carbon
support. Then, in a second step, the Pd precursor was added and re-
duced on gold particles with H2 bubbling in the suspension. Tetra-
kis (hydroxypropyl) phosphonium chloride (THPC), which acts as
both a stabiliser and a reducing agent, was used by Baiker et al.
[12] to prepare Au catalysts supported on various oxides, and more
recently, by Prati et al. to prepare Au and AuPd catalysts on acti-
vated carbon [11] and by Baiker et al. [13] for deposition on alu-
mina, titania and silica.
These two preparation methods were used in the present paper
to prepare oxide supported AuPd catalysts as well as monometallic
Au catalysts. The results are compared to those obtained by DPU, in
terms of yield of deposition of each metal, metal particle size,
bimetallic character of the particles and catalytic properties in
selective hydrogenation of butadiene. Note that the determination
of the bimetallic character of particles containing atomic metal ra-
tios far from 1 is not facile. EDX or XAFS is hardly usable. However,
as it will be shown in this paper, the combination of IR spectros-
copy and catalytic testing can provide pertinent elements of
information.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Alumina (AluC Degussa, 110 m2 g1, d-type) and titania (P25,
Degussa, 50 m2 g1, 70% Anatase, 30% Rutile) were used as sup-
ports. HAuCl43H2O (Acros Chemicals) was used as gold precursor
and Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Sigma–Aldrich) as palladium precursor.
2.1.1. Deposition–precipitation with urea
The monometallic gold catalysts (1 wt% Au) were prepared by
deposition–precipitation with urea (DPU) as described previously
[14–16] using TiO2, CeO2 and Al2O3 as supports. A 300 mL solution
containing 6 mL of a HAuCl4 solution (2.5  102 M), 0.9 g of urea
(cUrea  100  cAu) and the support (3 g) was stirred at 80 C for
16 h in a dark, closed reactor. The solid was separated by centrifu-
gation, washed with distilled water and centrifuged three or four
times, that is, chlorides could not be detected in the washing solu-
tion with silver nitrate. The sample was then dried under vacuum
at RT for 12 h. All samples were washed and dried according to this
procedure whatever the method of preparation. They were called
‘‘as-prepared’’ samples.
A reference Pd/Al2O3 sample with a Pd loading of 300 ppm,
which corresponds to the Pd loading in bimetallic samples with a
Au/Pd ratio of 20, was prepared by deposition–precipitation with
Na2CO3 according to the procedure described in [5].
Bimetallic AuPd/Al2O3 samples with Au/Pd atomic ratios of 5, 10
and 20 were prepared by the same DPU method. The procedure
was the same as that described above, except the addition of Pd
(Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2). For example, for the Au/Pd atomic ratio of 20
(1 wt% Au and 270 ppm Pd), 300 mL of water solution containing
6 mL of HAuCl4, 3H2O (2.5  102 M), 1.6 mL of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2
(4.7  103 M) and 0.9 g of urea were vigorously stirred at 80 C
for 16 h in the absence of light. The solid was then washed and
dried.
2.1.2. Deposition of colloids stabilised with PVA
The preparation method of monometallic gold catalysts was
based on the preparation a gold sol, which was then deposited onto
a support. In a beaker containing 200 mL of distilled water, 6 mL of
a solution of HAuCl4 (2.5  102 M) and 1.5 mL of a polyvinyl alco-
hol solution (PVA, Mw 89,000–98,000, 2 wt% solution) were added
under vigorous stirring. After 3 min of stirring, 4.5 mL of a solution
of NaBH4 (0.1 M) freshly prepared was added to the mixture
(NaBH4/Au molar ratio = 3). A change in colour from light yellow
to red was immediately observed, indicating the reduction of AuIII
into Au0. Three gram of support was then added to the mixture,
which was maintained under vigorous stirring at room tempera-
ture for 2 h. The solid was then washed and dried.
The synthesis of bimetallic PVA–AuPd catalysts was performed
as follows. First, a 1 wt% Au catalyst was prepared and washed
according to the protocol described above. The solid, still wet,
was suspended again in 200 mL of distilled water. 0.047 mL of
PVA solution (2 wt% solution) was added under vigorous stirring
then 1.6 mL of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 (4.7  103 M for a Au/Pd ratio of
20). Hydrogen gas was then bubbled into the reactor with a ﬂow
rate of 50 mL/min during 2 h. The mixture was stirred for another
16 h before washing and drying.
2.1.3. Deposition of colloids stabilised with THPC
For the monometallic gold catalysts, 14.5 mL of NaOH solution
(0.2 M freshly prepared) was added 150 mL of distilled water in a
beaker, under vigorous stirring. After 5 min, 3 mL of a 0.05 M solu-
tion of tetrakis (hydroxypropyl) phosphonium chloride (THPC) was
added to the mixture followed by 6 mL of HAuCl4 (2.5  102 M). A
colour change from colourless to brown was immediately observed
and revealed that gold was reduced. 3 g of support was then added
to the solution mixture, which was maintained under vigorous stir-
ring at room temperature during 2 h. Again, centrifugation-wash-
ings and then drying were performed.
For the bimetallic AuPd catalysts, the unique difference with the
protocols of synthesis of monometallic Au was that gold and
palladium were simultaneously introduced, for example, 6 mL
HAuCl4,
3H2O
(2.5  102 M)
and
1.6 mL
of
Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2
(4.7  103 M), which corresponds to an Au/Pd atomic ratio of 20.
After drying, all the as-prepared samples were stored under vac-
uum in a desiccator, in the dark in order to prevent any uncon-
trolled
reduction
of
gold
[17].
The
as-prepared
DPU–AuPd
samples were directly reduced under hydrogen at 500 C (100 mg
of catalyst under 100 mL min1 H2 with a heating rate of
3 C min1 then a 15 min plateau at 500 C) and the gold catalysts
at 300 C, that is, according to the same procedure as that de-
scribed in [5]. The reduction temperature of 500 C was chosen
for AuPd catalysts because DPU–AuPd/Al2O3 catalysts were found
more active after activation under hydrogen at 500 C than at
300 C [5]. After reduction, the samples were cooled down to RT
under nitrogen ﬂow and transfer in air before characterisation. In
the case of the colloids (PVA and THPC)-based catalysts, a calcina-
tion treatment at 500 C (100 mg of catalyst under 100 mL min1
air with a heating rate of 2 C min1 then a 60 min plateau at
500 C) was performed before the same reduction treatment as
for the DPU samples. The calcination temperature of 500 C was
chosen based on TGA experiments performed on both PVA–Au/
TiO2 and THPC–Au/TiO2, which showed that this was the minimal
80

temperature to remove the stabilising agent (no loss of mass be-
yond 500 C).
2.2. Techniques
Chemical analyses of Au, Pd, Cl and Al in the as-prepared sam-
ples were performed by inductively coupled plasma atom emission
spectroscopy at the CNRS Centre of Chemical Analysis (Vernaison,
France) and/or with a X-ray ﬂuorescence (XRF) Spectrometer XE-
POS HE (AMETEK). The metal weight loadings of the samples were
expressed in weight percentage, for example, wt% Au = [mAu/
(mAu + mPd + msupport)]  100.
TEM analysis of the reduced samples was performed, using a
JEOL JEM-100 CX II microscope operating at 100 kV. Gold particle
size measurements were performed using software ITEM on
digitised micrographs. Note that the particles were measured one
by one and not automatically. The size limit for the detection of
gold particles on Al2O3 is ca. 1 nm, but it was easier to measure
gold particles on titania than on alumina. The average metal
particle sizes dAu were determined from the measurement of at
least 300 particles and were expressed as the volumic mean,
dAu ¼ P nid
3
i = P nid
2
i where ni is the number of particles of diame-
ter di.
Diffuse Reﬂectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy
(DRIFTS) was performed with an IFS 66 V Bruker spectrometer.
The colloid-based catalysts were ﬁrst calcined ex situ in air at
500 C. The sample compartment of the cell (collector from Spec-
tratech) was ﬁlled with the samples (20 mg), which were reduced
in situ in 50 cm3 min1 of 5% v/v H2/Ar to 300 C (Au/Al2O3 or TiO2)
or 500 C (Pd/Al2O3 and Pd–Au/Al2O3 or TiO2) at 2 C min1. The
samples were maintained at the ﬁnal temperature during 2 h.
Then, the cell was cooled to RT and ﬂushed with He. A spectrum
was recorded under He and used as reference. Then, a ﬂow
(50 cm3 min1) of 1% v/v CO in He was introduced at RT. The inten-
sity of the spectrum under CO/He was expressed as logð1
R0Þ. The rel-
ative reﬂectance R0 is given by R0 ¼

2.3. Catalytic reaction
The reaction of hydrogenation was carried out with 100 mg of
catalyst (sieve fraction, 125–200 lm) in a plug-ﬂow microreactor
in Pyrex (4 mm of internal diameter). The catalysts were activated
in situ, under pure H2 (100 mL min1) from RT to 500 C for the
AuPd and Pd samples and to 300 C for the Au samples (2 C min1)
and hold for about 15 min at the ﬁnal temperature. The PVA and
THPC–AuPd catalysts were ﬁrst calcined ex situ at 500 C. Then,
the catalysts were cooled to room temperature under H2, and the
reaction mixture consisting of 0.3% butadiene, 30% propene and
20% hydrogen in He was introduced at RT with a total ﬂow rate
of 50 mL min1, which corresponds to a space velocity of 30 L g1
h1 (GHSV = 20,000 h1). The catalysts were heated under this
gas mixture at a rate of 1 C min1, up to 300 C. Gas analysis at
the outlet of the reactor was performed every 15 min, that is, every
15 C, between 30 and 300 C. The analysis of the reaction products
was performed by gas chromatography (Perichrom PR 2100, FID
detector) using a 7.5 m column (1/8 in.) ﬁlled with Sebaconitrile
25% Chromosorb PAW 80/100 Mesh). Retention times and sensitiv-
ity factors for the reactants and products were calibrated using
several gas mixtures. Software Winilab 4.0 was used for data
acquisition and extraction of the concentrations of the different
gases detected. Supports alone did not show activity. As mentioned
in [7], tests were made with gold catalysts to attest that under the
catalytic conditions described, and at low conversion, internal and
external diffusion limitations could be neglected. Additional mea-
surements of apparent activation energies showed that all Au
and Au–Pd(20) catalysts have an Ea in the range 47–55 kJ/mol at
low conversion, that is, comparable to the value of 50 kJ/mol re-
ported previously for the DPU–Au/Al2O3 sample [18]. Tests of
repeatability and reproducibility were also performed over gold
catalysts to validate the conditions of reaction [18].
The activities of the catalysts expressed in lmol s1 g1
metal were
compared at 60 C. When activity was very low at this tempera-
ture, which was especially the case for monometallic gold cata-
lysts, activity was calculated from the apparent activation energy
deduced from the straight part of the Arrhenius plot ln(activity)
versus 1/T. TOF expressed per surface metal atom was estimated
as follows: TOF = activity D/Mmetal. The dispersion D was deduced
from the volumic average particle (dav.) measured by TEM and
plots of the dispersion versus average platinum particle size [19].
Mmetal is the molar mass of gold; the amount of Pd present in the
samples was neglected.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Metal loadings and particle sizes
Table 1 reports the results of chemical analysis and the TEM
measurements of average size of the metal particles present in
the DPU–Au and AuPd samples supported on alumina. In agreement
with former studies on Au/Al2O3 [14–16] and AuPd/Al2O3 [5] also
prepared by DPU, the Au loadings correspond to the nominal value
of 1 wt%. In contrast, the Pd loadings in the DPU–AuPd samples are
lower than those expected, that is, the Au/Pd atomic ratios are high-
er than the nominal ones, for Al2O3. This conﬁrms our earlier work
[5] that the method of co-deposition–precipitation with urea does
not permit the deposition of the whole Pd present in solution on
alumina. It was proposed that the formation of highly soluble cat-
ionic palladium–ammine or palladium–urea complexes could ex-
plain the incomplete deposition of palladium on alumina; these
Pd complexes could be eliminated during the step of centrifuga-
tion-washing. In the case of TiO2, the Pd content was close to the
nominal value. The lowest PZC of titania (PZC  6) compared to alu-
mina (PZC  8) may favour the restraint of the palladium species.
The chlorine content is as low in the DPU–AuPd samples as in the
Au ones (Table 1). The average sizes of the metal particles in
DPU–Au and AuPd samples on alumina or titania are roughly the
same (2.2–2.8 nm) (Table 1 and Fig. 1) in spite of the higher temper-
ature of reduction for AuPd (500 C instead of 300 C).
The PVA method by sequential deposition used for the prepara-
tion of the AuPd catalysts corresponds to the one that Prati re-
tained after several trials of sequential Au and Pd depositions
and of co-deposition on activated carbon (AC) [9,11]. During co-
deposition, NaBH4 induced Pd segregation [8], whereas with
sequential deposition, the use of milder reducer as H2 avoided Pd
segregation and favoured the formation of bimetallic particles [9].
According to the gold loadings of the PVA samples reported in
Table 2, one can deduce that most of the gold in solution has been
transformed into colloids and adsorbed onto the supports whether
the ﬁnal catalyst is mono or bimetallic. The major part of Pd is also
deposited onto the supports, since the experimental Au/Pd ratios
are close to the nominal ones, in contrast to the DPU method. In
the PVA samples, the metal particles sizes are slightly larger
(3.6–4.5 nm) than those obtained by DPU, and the size distribu-
tions are also broader (Table 2 and Fig. 2).
The THPC method, which was developed ﬁrst by Baiker et al.
[12] for the preparation of gold colloids supported on oxides, was
also used by Prati for the preparation of bimetallic AuPd/AC cata-
lysts (activated carbon) [11]: after deposition of gold colloids stabi-
lised by THPC, palladium was reduced by H2 in the presence of
PVA. The particles were found less homogeneous than when
PVA–gold colloids were used for the ﬁrst step and less active in
N.E. Kolli et al. / Journal of Catalysis 297 (2013) 79–92
81
the reaction of liquid-phase oxidation of glycerol. In contrast to our
catalysts that are used in gas-phase reactions, their catalysts were
tested without further treatment, that is, in the presence of the sta-
bilising agents. We also tried a method of sequential deposition,
deposition of gold colloids stabilised by THPC then addition of
the Pd salt reduced and stabilised by THPC, but not successfully
either. For this reason, we rather studied the deposition of AuPd
colloids co-reduced and stabilised by THPC whose results are pre-
sented in this paper.
In the case of the THPC samples, the gold loadings are also close
to the nominal values for both the monometallic and bimetallic
samples (Table 3). For the latter, the Pd loadings are around 3–4
times lower than the nominal ones and even lesser than in the
DPU ones. One can also note that the chlorine content is slightly
higher than in DPU and PVA samples. Moreover, all the THPC sam-
ples still contain residues of phosphorus (700 ppm in each sample)
after calcination and reduction. The metal particles are smaller (3–
3.8 nm) (Table 3 and Fig. 3) than those obtained with PVA, but
slightly larger than those in DPU samples. These particle sizes are
comparable to those obtained by Prati et al. [11] on activated carbon
(AC), 3.4 nm or 3.9 nm for PVA–AuPd/AC and 3.7 nm for THPC–
AuPd/AC. Note that in a very recent paper, Baiker et al. [13] also used
a THPC method involving the co-reduction of Au and Pd to prepare
AuPd catalysts supported on titania, alumina and silica.
In summary, the whole gold is deposited on the oxide supports
(100% yield) whether the samples are mono or bimetallic, but the
yield of deposition of palladium depends on the preparation meth-
ods: PVA–AuPd (100%) > DPU–AuPd (40%) > THPC–AuPd (25%);
only in the case of the PVA method, the Au/Pd ratio corresponds to
the nominal one. The metal particles sizes are slightly different
from one preparation to the other and vary as follows: DPU–
AuPd < THPC–AuPd < PVA–AuPd. In the following, the Au/Pd atom-
ic ratios reported correspond to the experimental values deter-
mined by chemical analysis (as in the ﬁrst column of Tables 1–3)
and not the nominal ones.
3.2. Characterisation by DRIFTS coupled with CO adsorption
The DRIFT spectra of the three monometallic Au/Al2O3 samples
in the range of the carbonyl region (1800–2400 cm1) are reported
in Fig. 4. They are presented after 10 min under CO/He ﬂow, but as
a matter of fact, they barely changed between 2 and 10 min under
CO, and they did not change beyond this time. The three spectra
exhibit a single band of CO linearly adsorbed on metallic Au nano-
particles; CO is supposed to be adsorbed on low coordination sites
since CO does not adsorb on ﬂat surfaces [20–22]. However, the CO
band frequencies are slightly different: 2105 cm1 for DP–Au,
2114 cm1 for THPC–Au and 2120 cm1 for PVA–Au. These differ-
ences could result from the slightly different average sizes of gold
particles in these samples: 2.3, 3.0 nm and 3.9 nm, respectively
(Tables 1–3). As previously proposed in the literature, the decrease
in the proportion of low coordination sites when particle size in-
creases leads to a decrease in the CO coverage and thus of the di-
pole–dipole interaction [23,24]. This interpretation is consistent
with the fact that when DP–Au/Al2O3 is pretreated in the same
way as the colloids-based samples, that is, calcination at 500 C
then reduction at 300 C, the gold average particle size increases
to 3.2 nm and the CO band shifts to 2115 cm1 (Fig. 4b).
The DRIFT spectra of the three AuPd/Al2O3 samples with Au/
Pd = 20 reported after 2 min under CO (Fig. 5b–d) look roughly
the same with an intense band at 2120 cm1, a smaller one at
2075 cm1 and a weak and broad one at 2000–1850 cm1. For
comparison, the spectrum of DP–Pd is also reported in Fig. 5a.
The band attributions of the latter have already been discussed
in [5] and can be summarised as follows: The spectra can be di-
vided into two carbonyl regions, at high frequency (2150–
2000 cm1) and low frequency (2000–1800 cm1). The band at
2075 cm1 has been assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on metallic
Pd, and the broad and less intense one centred at 1900 cm1 has
been attributed to bridging CO adsorbed on metallic Pd planes with
twofold
(2000–1895 cm1)
and
threefold
bound
CO
(1920–
1830 cm1). As a consequence, in the AuPd/Al2O3 spectra, the most
intense band around 2120 cm1 can be assigned to CO linearly ad-
sorbed on metallic gold. This band is roughly at the same position
as in the corresponding monometallic gold spectrum (Fig. 4). The
band with lower intensity at 2074 cm1 is also at the same posi-
tion as that of CO linearly adsorbed on Pd in the monometallic pal-
ladium sample (Fig. 5a). The bands in the low frequency range
differ from those of the monometallic Pd sample; they look rela-
tively

1900 cm1 with no band below 1900 cm1; this indicates the ab-
sence of threefold bridging CO. The latter observation combined
with the weak intensity of the band at 1950 cm1, and even its ab-
sence in the case of PVA–AuPd/Al2O3 (Fig. 5c), is an indication that
the three AuPd/Al2O3 samples with Au/Pd = 20 contain very few or
no monometallic Pd particles. By analogy with observations re-
ported for AuPd ﬁlms [25], AuPd particles on silica ﬁlms [26] and
on alumina [5], these results not only indicate that these samples
contain bimetallic AuPd particles, but also that Pd is diluted by
gold at the surface of the particles as isolated atoms and dimers.
The possible presence of monometallic gold particles cannot be ex-
cluded. It is worth to underline that the PVA method appears to in-
duce the exclusive formation of isolated Pd atoms in the metal
particles. One can also note that the phosphorus present in the
THPC sample does not seem to have an inﬂuence of the electronic
properties of the Au or AuPd particles since the IR bands of ad-
sorbed CO are not shifted with respect to those of PVA and DPU
samples (Figs. 4 and 5).
The evolution of the spectra with time on stream under CO/He
and then under He conﬁrms this interpretation. Indeed, the spectra
of DP and PVA–AuPd(20)/Al2O3 evolve with time on CO/He stream
(Fig. 6a and b) (the same trend was also observed for the THPC–
AuPd/Al2O3 sample); the band of CO adsorbed on gold decreases
in intensity, whereas the ones of linear and bridging CO (not visible
on the PVA sample) adsorbed on Pd increase. The most drastic
change in the relative intensity of the bands of linear CO vibration,
I(COAu)/I(COPd), is observed for DPU–AuPd/Al2O3, which contains
the smallest metal particles. One can note that for PVA–AuPd/
Al2O3, the band of bridging CO on Pd never appears. After 1 h under
CO/He, the CO/He gas ﬂow was switched to pure He. The CO bands
gradually decrease in intensity (Fig. 6c and d) and that of CO ad-
sorbed on gold totally disappears within less than 10 min, whereas
those of CO adsorbed on Pd remain visible, but decrease in inten-
sity. This conﬁrms former results obtained by Hadjiivanov and
Vayssilov [27] that CO interacts more strongly with Pd than with
Au. It must be mentioned that additional experiments indicated

that particle restructuring under CO is almost completely revers-
ible when the ﬂow of CO in He in the DRIFTS cell was replaced
by pure He.
The spectra of the PVA–AuPd/Al2O3 sample deserve several
comments. In the one recorded after 2 min under CO in Fig. 5c,
the band of CO linearly adsorbed on Pd is observed (2073 cm1)
in spite of the fact that according to the preparation method in
two steps (see Section 2), particles with Au core and Pd shell are
expected to form in solution. This indicates that the metal particles
restructured during thermal pre-treatment, that is, during calcina-
tion to decompose the stabilising agent and/or reduction under H2
at 500 C. If one assumes that the DRIFT spectra recorded after
2 min under CO reﬂect the state of the particle surface just after
thermal treatment, one can note that PVA–AuPd/Al2O3 seems to
shows the highest I(COAu)/I(COPd) ratio (Fig. 5c), that is, the small-
est proportion of Pd on the particle surface. Moreover, the fact that
this spectrum does not show bands of bridging CO on Pd indicates
that the Pd atoms are atomically dispersed on the metal particle
surface, which is consistent with the low proportion of Pd atoms
on surface. The reason may be that this sample possesses the
largest metal particles. This is conﬁrmed by a mere calculation
based on the hypothesis that after thermal pre-treatment, the par-
ticles have a cuboctahedral shape, which is the equilibrium shape
of particles in the absence of support and consists of homogeneous
alloy both on surface and in the core [28]: If one compares a metal
particle of 3 nm, that is, of size intermediate between those of
DPU–AuPd/Al2O3 (2.7 nm) and THPC–AuPd/Al2O3 (3.4 nm), with a
particle of 4 nm, that is, of size of PVA–AuPd/Al2O3, one can calcu-
late that the proportion of surface atoms is lower for the larger par-
ticle (Table 4), thus the probability of ﬁnding Pd atoms on surface
is lower.
Under CO exposure, the band of CO adsorbed on gold de-
creases in intensity while the ones on palladium increase; this
is observed for the three AuPd/Al2O3 samples but to various ex-
tents. The strongest changes are observed for the DPU sample
(Fig. 6a), which possesses the smallest metal particles. This result
is a strong indication that particle restructuring occurs under CO
at RT, with Pd atom migration towards the surface of the parti-
cles. It is possible that Pd migration is favoured by the small par-
ticles present in the DPU samples. Goodman et al. [25,26] also

observed similar evolution of the CO bands in AuPd samples and
explained it by a phenomenon of particle restructuring under CO
with gradual surface enrichment in Pd atoms. Since CO is sup-
posed to adsorb only on gold atoms of low coordination, that is,
on corners and edges according to Freund et al. [29], the decrease
in the intensity of the COAu band reﬂects the replacement of Au
atoms by Pd atoms on edges and corners while the increase in
the intensity of the COPd bands (linear and bridging) reﬂects
increasing number of Pd atoms on surface, not only on edges
and corners, but also on planes. If one makes the hypothesis that
all the Pd atoms migrate on the particle surface and are located
only on edges and corners, one can calculate that for a 4 nm par-
ticle with a Au/Pd ratio of 20, these sites will contain 104 Pd
atoms and 52 Au atoms (Table 4); therefore, the probability to
have Pd atoms isolated from each other is low and bands of
bridging CO should be detected for the PVA samples. It is there-
fore probable that all Pd atoms do not migrate on the particle sur-
face, or if they do, they also drift on planes.
The inﬂuence of the Au/Pd atomic ratio on the DRIFT spectra
was investigated in the case of the PVA–AuPd/Al2O3 samples with
Au/Pd ratios of 20, 15 and 10, after 2 min under CO. Fig. 7I shows
that as the Au/Pd ratio decreases from 20 to 15 and 10, that is, as
the Pd content increases, the band of bridging CO on Pd initially
nonvisible starts to develop. This indicates the presence of larger
proportion of Pd atoms on the particle surface. For the sample with
Au/Pd = 10, one can note that the bands of linear CO on Au appears
broader. The same trend was observed for DPU–AuPd/Al2O3 sam-
ples with different Au/Pd ratios in a former paper [5], and this
was explained by the presence of new contributions when the
amount of Pd increases, for instance due to interactions of gold
with neighbouring Pd atoms.
Regarding the inﬂuence of the oxide support, DPU–AuPd(15)/
Al2O3 and DPU–AuPd(15)/TiO2 exhibit the same CO spectrum with
the same band position (Fig. 7II), which indicates no support effect,
in agreement with Abbott et al. [30] who studied CO adsorption on
model AuPd catalysts prepared by deposition of Au and Pd atoms
on several well-ordered thin ﬁlms (Fe3O4(111), MgO(100) and
CeO2(111)).
3.3. Selective hydrogenation of butadiene
Fig. 8 reports the evolution of the concentrations of butadiene,
butenes and alkanes (propane and butane) as a function of the
reaction temperature for the three Au/Al2O3 catalysts, DPU (a),
PVA (b) and THPC (c). Fig. 8 and Table 5 show that the minimum
temperature at which butadiene is totally converted (T100%) de-
pends on the samples: THPC–Au/Al2O3 < DPU–Au/Al2O3 < PVA–
Au/Al2O3. Fig. 8 also shows that at T100%, very low amount of al-
kanes forms and that at 300 C, it does not exceed 2500 ppm,
which corresponds to less than 0.1% propene conversion. This re-
sult conﬁrms the high selectivity of gold catalysts for butene for-
mation [7] and reveals that it does not drastically depends on the
preparation method.
The

were

from
the
activities
(lmol s1 g1
metal) measured at 60 C (Table 5); the DPU and PVA–
Au/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit similar TOF while THPC–Au/Al2O3 is
more active. The peculiarity of the later catalyst is that it contains
residues of phosphorus (700 ppm) arising from the decomposition
of THPC. Several patents report the use of phosphorus as modiﬁers
to improve selectivities and activities in reactions of selective
hydrogenation of highly unsaturated compounds [31,32]. To inves-
tigate the possible inﬂuence of phosphorus on the catalytic activ-
ity, a DPU–Au/Al2O3 sample was prepared with a support pre-
impregnated with THPC (700 ppm of P) and dried. After calcination
at 500 C and reduction under H2 at 300 C, the average gold parti-
cle size was 2.5 nm, that is, almost the same as in DPU–Au/Al2O3
catalyst (2.3 nm). However, the activity was improved with T100%
of 150 instead of 165 C and activity at 60 C twice as large (Ta-
ble 5). Hence, it is possible that the presence of phosphorus, as a
residue of THPC calcination, is responsible for the positive effect
on the catalytic properties.
The evolution of the selectivities to butenes with the reaction
temperature depends on the catalyst. If at T100%, 1-butene is the
main product for the three catalysts (Fig. 8a–c), the selectivities
to 2-butenes vary. At T100%, the selectivity to cis-2-butene is larger
than that to trans-2-butene with the DPU sample, almost equal for
the PVA one and smaller for the THPC sample. Then, as the reaction

temperature increases and reaches 300 C, the selectivities to bu-
tenes are at variance: the product distribution, 1-butene > cis-2-
butene > trans-2-butene, almost do not change over the DPU–Au/
Al2O3 catalyst with only a slight isomerisation of 1-butene into
2-butenes; over THPC–Au/Al2O3, it tends to resemble the one of
DPU–Au/Al2O3, whereas more drastic changes are observed for
PVA–Au/Al2O3 above T100% (165 C) with trans-2-butene > cis-2-bu-
tene > 1-butene. The reasons for these differences of selectivities
may result from difference in particle size.
Thermodynamically, trans-2-butene is the most stable butene.
Based on DFT calculations, Yang et al. [33] proposed that the for-
mation of the cis-2-butene might be favoured by the preferential
adsorption of this compound on the low coordination sites (edges,
corners) of the gold nanoparticles, compared with the trans-2-bu-
tene. Moreover, they found that the cis/trans-2-butene ratio is
decreasing with the increase in the gold particles size. The change
in product distribution results from isomerisation of 1-butene to 2-
butenes [34–36]; this has been largely discussed in [7]. Note that
1-butene is the most desirable product for further applications,
and that the selectivities must be considered at T100%, and that at
this temperature, 1-butene is the main product over the three
catalysts.
As mentioned in the introduction, according to our previous
study on AuPd/Al2O3 [5], the best compromise in terms of activ-
ity-selectivity was obtained for the Au/Pd atomic ratio of 20. It is
worth to specify that over a mechanical mixture of Au/Al2O3 and
Pd/Al2O3 with Au/Pd ratio of 20, containing 300 ppm Pd, the reac-
tion ran away as soon as the reaction mixture was introduced at
RT, and the temperature of the catalytic bed increased up to
80 C. Even though the catalytic bed was cooled down in an ice
bath, all hydrogen was consumed and around 50% of propene
was hydrogenated into propane.
Fig. 8 also compares the evolution of the concentrations of buta-
diene, butenes and alkanes over the three AuPd(20)/Al2O3 samples,
DPU (d), PVA (e) and THPC (f). The ﬁrst observation is that the AuPd
samples are more active than their monometallic gold counterpart;
T100% is shifted to lower temperature by several tenths of degrees,
which corresponds to an increase in the TOF at 60 C by a factor of
two (Table 5). The selectivities to butenes remain high at T100%,
since almost no alkane is formed. For instance, butadiene can be
totally converted into butenes at 60 C on the THPC–AuPd catalyst
with the formation of only 2500 ppm of alkanes (0.8% propene con-
version). However, at higher reaction temperature, the amount of
alkanes formed increases more rapidly than over the monometallic
gold counterparts.
As for the monometallic gold samples, the PVA–AuPd/Al2O3 cat-
alyst, which possesses the largest particles, is the least active one,
and the THPC–AuPd sample is more active than the DPU–AuPd one
in spite of comparable metal particle size (Table 5). Again, this may
be due to the presence of phosphorus. Fig. 8 also shows that the
PVA–AuPd sample is more selective to alkenes since less alkanes
are formed above T100%. One can note that with the THPC catalyst,
the formation of alkanes decreases above 120 C whereas for the
DPU–AuPd one, it seems to reach a maximum around 300 C. This
may be due to the deactivation of the catalyst via the formation of
‘‘green oil’’ by oligomerisation, favoured by the higher activity of
the THPC catalyst. In our former paper [7], it has already been

observed that activity of Au/Al2O3 at a given temperature is lower
when, after reaction up to 300 C, the reaction temperature is
decreased.
It is noticeable that for all the AuPd catalysts, the selectivities to
butenes below T100% follow roughly the same trends (Fig. 8d–f) and
that the formation of trans-2-butene is favoured towards cis-2-bu-
tene; in contrast to the monometallic counterparts (Fig. 8a–c),
above T100%, the selectivity to 1-butene decreases while those to
2-butenes continue to increase, and trans-2-butene becomes the
main butene formed. This difference with the monometallic cata-
lysts indicates that the isomerisation of 1-butene is favoured on
AuPd catalysts, which corresponds to the typical catalytic behav-
iour of Pd catalyst. Indeed, for palladium catalysts, 1-butene is
the main product of hydrogenation of butadiene as long as T100%
is not reached; then beyond T100%, isomerisation suddenly occurs,
and 1-butene transforms to 2-butenes and mainly to trans-2-bu-
tene [37,38]. One can note that this is for the PVA–AuPd catalyst
that the temperature at which the concentration of trans-2-butene
equals the one of 1-butene is the highest and the farthest from
T100%; it is therefore the catalyst which presents the most different
behaviour from Pd.
The catalytic performances of the DPU–AuPd/Al2O3 catalysts
with different Au/Pd ratio (10, 15 and 20) have been already re-
ported in [5]. Those of the PVA–AuPd/Al2O3 catalysts are reported
in Fig. 9. As for the DPU samples [5], activity increases and larger
amounts of alkanes are formed as the Pd loading increases. How-
ever, at T100%, the amount of alkanes formed is rather low
(1000 ppm) except for AuPd(10)/Al2O3, for which 17,000 ppm of al-
kanes is already formed at 75 C. When the Pd content increases,
the temperature at which trans-2-butene becomes the main

butene decreases (Fig. 9). This can be related to the fact that isom-
erisation of 1-butene into mainly trans-2-butene is favoured by Pd,
which is present on the particles surface in larger proportion when
the Au/Pd ratio decreases, as attested by the presence of bands of
bridging CO on Pd in the DRIFT spectra (Fig. 7I).
As for the DPU–Au catalysts, the nature of the support, alumina
or titania has no inﬂuence on the catalytic properties of the DPU–
AuPd samples. In the case of DPU–AuPd(10), the average metal
particle sizes are almost the same on alumina and titania, 2.6
and 2.2 nm, respectively, and the activities and selectivities are
similar (Fig. 10a and b). Titania or alumina has no noticeable inﬂu-
ence either on the catalytic properties of the PVA–AuPd(15) sam-
ples (Fig. 10c and d) with average metal particle size around
4 nm. The absence of inﬂuence of alumina and titania supports
on the catalytic results can be correlated to the DRIFT spectra,
which are also comparable for the two types of samples (Fig. 7II).
One can deduce that the support, titania or alumina, has no inﬂu-
ence on the composition of the AuPd metal particles catalysts for a
given preparation method and this conﬁrms the results obtained
with the monometallic Au catalysts [7] that the support does not
participate to the reaction.
The inﬂuence of the preparation method on the catalytic prop-
erties of the bimetallic AuPd samples can be interpreted in terms of
different particle sizes and different proportions of Pd on the par-
ticle surface for a given Au/Pd ratio. For the Au/Pd ratio of 20,
PVA–AuPd is slightly less active than the two other catalysts
(DPU and THPC), but it is the most selective to butenes. This higher
selectivity to butenes can be correlated with the absence of bridg-
ing CO on the metal particles (Fig. 5c), that is, with the presence of
only isolated Pd atoms (Pd monomers). Here, one must note that
implicitly, we are making the hypothesis that the ﬁrst IR spectrum
recorded under CO provides an image of the particle surface after
reduction, that is, before particle restructuring under CO. Implic-
itly, we also assume that the particles do not reconstruct during
hydrogenation reaction. This issue is not well documented. One
can cite only one paper [39] related to butadiene hydrogenation,
but over single crystal of Pd–Au (70–30%). An increase in the activ-
ity was observed during the reaction at RT (in this paper, Au was
added to modify Pd activity, and Au addition led to lower activity).
Several reasons are invoked to explain this evolution: H diffusion
from the bulk, adsorption-induced segregation modiﬁcation and/
or surface restructuring corresponding to a surface enrichment in
Pd or the formation of a surface hydride modiﬁcation. One can
mention that the catalytic activity of DPU–AuPd/Al2O3 sample
was stable during butadiene hydrogenation in isothermal condi-
tions at 50 C for 16 h [16], possibly indicating the absence of par-
ticle restructuring; this would validate our hypotheses even
though we cannot exclude that restructuring occurs during butadi-
ene hydrogenation at higher reaction temperature.
For lower Au/Pd ratios in the PVA samples, bridging CO appears
in the IR spectra (Fig. 7), the catalysts become more active, but
selectivity to butenes decreases (Fig. 9). It turns out that the pres-
ence of Pd monomers on particle surface would improve the cata-
lytic activity of gold without deeply affecting its high selectivity to
butenes, whereas the presence of Pd as dimers would provide cat-
alytic properties approaching those of palladium. The presence of
contiguous Pd sites on AuPd nanoparticles was revealed to have
either detrimental or positive effect on the catalytic activity,
depending on the considered reaction. Indeed, segregation of Pd
under CO/O2 during CO oxidation was found to increase the activ-
ity of the AuPd(100) surface, which was related to the ability of
adjacent Pd atoms to dissociate O2 [24,40]. The presence of Pd
ensembles is also required for N2O decomposition into N2 and O
on Au–Pd alloy catalysts [41]. On the other hand, a higher rate of
formation of vinyl acetate from acetic acid and ethylene was ob-
served for AuPd(100) surface containing Pd monomers sites, and
the authors suggest that the active sites were Pd ‘‘monomer pair’’
with Au nearest-neighbours [42,43]. The high selectivity towards
vinyl acetate was ascribed to the lowest formation of by-products
such as CO and CO2 on Pd monomers. Higher activity of Pd

monomers in AuPd nanoparticles have also been reported in the
selective oxidation of glycerol [10].
Thus, provided that Pd ensembles are/do not formed, the addi-
tion of Pd to gold leads to a catalyst more active and almost as
selective as gold. Isolated Pd sites could dissociate H2 as previously
proposed [44], delivering the atomic hydrogen required for the
hydrogenation reaction. Spillover of hydrogen from isolated Pd
on Au surface has not been found to occur [44], but it might be pos-
sible on Au nanoparticles with a high amount of low coordination
sites, which could receive such hydrogen atoms. Considering Au–Pt

bimetallic systems, DFT calculations recently showed that the sub-
stitution of only one Au atom by one Pt atom in a Au13 cluster
strongly enhances the dissociation of H2 [45]. The same group suc-
ceeded in preparing highly active and selective supported Au–Pt
catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene by add-
ing very low amount of Pt (0.01 wt%) to a Au/TiO2 catalyst (1.5 wt%
Au), which corresponds to an atomic Au/Pt ratio of 15 [46]. The
surface characterisation of the latter catalyst was not performed,
but it is plausible that Pt exists as isolated sites surrounded by
Au atoms.
4. Conclusion
Activity of gold-based catalysts in selective hydrogenation of
butadiene was improved by the addition of small amount of Pd
using three different procedures. Total conversion of butadiene
can be achieved at temperature 690 C, that is, at much lower tem-
perature than monometallic gold, while preserving low alkanes
formation at T100%, with catalysts containing Au/Pd atomic ratio
P15. The presence of residual phosphorous (700 ppm) resulting
from THPC decomposition seems to have an additional beneﬁcial

effect on the activity of both Au and AuPd catalysts. The larger par-
ticles obtained with the PVA method induce a lower activity in
butadiene hydrogenation compared to the DPU and THPC catalysts,
but the amount of alkanes formed remains low even at high tem-
perature. Moreover, this is the only method, which allows the con-
trol of the deposition of both metals. According to the DRIFTS study
coupled with CO adsorption, the PVA method leads to the most
homogeneous distribution of Pd on the surface of the bimetallic
particles for a given Au/Pd atomic ratio and favours the formation
of isolated Pd sites. The absence of Pd ensembles, such as dimers,
appears to be the condition to limit the undesired hydrogenation
of alkenes (butenes and propene) into alkanes. DRIFTS also showed
that the surface composition of the AuPd metal particles evolved
during CO exposure, attesting particle restructuring with a gradual
surface enrichment by palladium whatever the preparation meth-
od; the most drastic changes were observed for the DPU samples
that possess the smallest metal particles.
