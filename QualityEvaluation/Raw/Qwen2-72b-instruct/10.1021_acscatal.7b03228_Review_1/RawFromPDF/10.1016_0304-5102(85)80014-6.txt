Summary 
Catalysis by metals will be reviewed in this paper because of the prog- 
ress in this sub-field of heterogeneous 
catalysis since 1965. Preparation of 
supported metals has become reproducible under controlled conditions, and 
reaction rates can now be measured in the absence of limitations by mass 
and heat transfer. With correct rates obtainable on reproducible catalysts, it 
is increasingly common to report rates not as an ill-defined ‘activity’ but as 
turnover rates, i.e., molecules reacting per second per surface metal atom 
titrated by standardized methods of selective chemisorption. 
Turnover rates for a number of reactions on several metals have been 
reproduced by different 
investigators using different preparations. Agree- 
ment has been found between turnover rates on catalysts with 100% of 
metal exposed and on large single crystals. Hence, for reactions that are 
called structure-insensitive, 
no bulk metal (subsurface atoms) is needed to 
obtain the surface behavior of bulk samples. It is also clear that metal- 
support interactions 
can be totally absent. For other reactions, i.e. those 
which are structure-sensitive, certain sites consisting of ensembles of surface 
atoms exhibit enhanced turnover rates. Identifying and counting these metal- 
lic sites are challenging tasks that have been tackled successfully only in the 
case of the synthesis of ammonia on iron. 
Introduction 
In heterogeneous catalysis many simple questions have long been asked, 
and until recently the answers have often been contradictory. 
This is because 
a measure of catalytic activity is not quantitative unless it is reported as a 
turnover number, N, more appropriately 
called a turnover frequency, 
or 
turnover rate, which is the number of molecules transformed per unit time 
per catalytic site. Without a knowledge of N, catalytic data cannot be re- 
produced and remain qualitative. In enzymatic and homogeneous catalysis, 
values of N have been reported for many years, as it is easy in principle to 
count the number of catalytic entities in solution. In heterogeneous catal- 
ysis, counting sites remains a formidable obstacle to scientific advances. Yet, 
over the past twenty years, much progress has been made in counting the

atoms 
on metallic 
surfaces, 
or in using single crystals, 
for which counting 
surface 
atoms 
is trivial. 
However, 
the number 
of surface atoms is not nec- 
essarily 
equal to the number 
of catalytic 
sites. Moreover, 
even on a perfect 
single crystal 
surface, 
a molecule 
can be bound 
in different 
ways. Thus 
carbon monoxide 
can be held on a single atom or it can bridge two or more 
adjacent 
atoms, 
and react in these various binding states at different 
rates. 
Thus, even in an ideal situation, 
a value of N might be only an average one. 
If the surface is not perfect, 
there is always the chance that the reaction 
will 
take place, in whole 
or in part, on a small number 
of defects, 
e.g. steps, 
kinks, edges and corners. 
In spite of these difficulties, 
values of N obtained 
by counting 
metallic 
surface atoms have proved immensely 
useful over the past 20 years in com- 
paring data obtained 
in different 
laboratories 
and in answering 
an old ques- 
tion in heterogeneous 
catalysis: 
as particle 
size grows from that of a small 
cluster to infinite 
value for a single macroscopic 
crystal, how does the value 
of N change for a given reaction 
on a given metal? Does it change at all? If 
it does not change appreciably, 
as has been repeatedly 
found in the past 15 
years, what does this behavior tell us about the mechanism 
of the reaction? 
Counting surface atoms 
To prepare 
a stable collection 
of catalytic 
metal particles for the study 
of size effects, 
use is made of a carrier 
or support consisting 
of a porous 
matrix which allows in-and-out 
flow of reactants 
and products, 
contains the 
metal particles 
in its pores and itself takes no direct 
part in the catalytic 
reaction 
on the metal. 
The support 
may be alumina, 
silica, amorphous 
or 
crystalline 
(zeolitic) 
aluminosilicates, 
magnesium 
oxide 
or carbon. 
The 
appropriate 
metal salt is introduced 
into the support 
by adsorption 
or ion 
exchange, 
and then is reduced, 
usually in flowing hydrogen, 
to form zero- 
valent metallic 
clusters 
or particles. 
The size of the latter 
depends 
on the 
details of the preparation. 
Its determination 
by physical 
tools such as X-ray 
diffraction 
or transmission 
electron 
microscopy 
is usually cumbersome 
and 
is carried out mainly as a check of the chemical technique 
chosen to obtain 
not the size but the dispersion of the metal in the sample, i.e., the fraction 
of metal atoms exposed. Dispersion 
is defined 
as the ratio of the number of 
surface 
metal atoms 
to the total 
number 
of metal atoms. 
The number 
of 
surface 
atoms is equal to the number 
of molecules 
of a chemisorptive 
gas, 
e.g. Hz, 02, CO, held to the metal and to the metal only (‘selective 
chemi- 
sorption’) 
at a suitable 
temperature 
and pressure, multiplied 
by an empirical 
coefficient 
which takes into account 
possible 
dissociation 
of the adsorbed 
molecule, 
e.g. Hz into 2H, as well as the stoichiometry, 
i.e. the number 
of 
atoms or molecules 
bound per surface atom. The latter must be determined 
separately 
by chemisorption 
and physisorption 
or physical 
tools on samples 
used for calibration. 
To relate the calibration 
data to dispersion, 
assumptions 
must then 
be made to translate 
measured 
particle 
surface 
area or size or 
29 
volume 
of the calibration 
samples into number of surface atoms. It must also 
be assumed that the adsorption 
stoichiometry 
does not change with particle 
size, as calibration 
is done by necessity 
on larger particles. 
No wonder 
that 
adsorption 
stoichiometries 
are still in doubt, 
even for the most 
studied 
metal, platinum, 
and the most common 
chemisorptive 
gases Hz, O2 and CO. 
There is an additional 
difficulty 
to be taken into account, 
namely the shape 
of very small metallic 
particles, 
their change of shape as a result of chemi- 
sorption 
[l] 
and the unknown 
relationship 
between 
shape and adsorption 
stoic@iometry. 
At the present time, comparisons 
of turnover 
frequency 
must 
be made 
on the basis of the same assumed 
adsorption 
stoichiometry. 
At 
worst, 
this may lead to consistent 
errors 
by a factor 
of two in reported 
values of dispersion. 
Because 
the shape of very small particles 
is unknown, 
the relationship 
between 
size and shape is not clear. This was first pointed 
out in an early 
study 
of platinum 
dispersion 
in commercial 
platinum 
reforming 
catalysts 
[2]. In that study, it was reported 
that the metal was present in the form of 
small clusters 
which, in spite of a dispersion 
approaching 
unity, 
were prob- 
ably not atomically 
dispersed, 
but were in the form 
of rafts, which have 
recently 
been identified 
by electron 
microscopy 
in the case of ruthenium 
on 
silica gel [3]. In fact, there is no authenticated 
case of atomic dispersion 
in 
which a single accessible 
zero-valent 
.metal atom is known to be stable on a 
support. 
For instance, 
it was claimed 
that 
zero-valent 
platinum 
could 
be 
atomically 
dispersed in the supercages 
(1.3 nm in diameter, 
accessible through 
0.8 nm windows) 
of a Y-zeolite 
[4]. Later work could not find evidence in 
favor of atomic 
dispersion, 
but suggested 
the existence 
of platinum 
clusters 
cu. 1 nm in size [ 5 - 71. A recent 
study of Pt/Y-zeolite 
by X-ray scattering 
reveals that the platinum 
clusters in the supercages 
of Y-zeolites 
possess the 
normal 
face-centered 
cubic structure 
of the bulk metal with lattice spacing 
the same as for bulk platinum 
[ 81. This is true when the clusters are covered 
with hydrogen. 
When they are bare, there appears to be a slight contraction 
in the lattice parameters, 
and when they are covered 
with oxygen, 
the crys- 
talline 
structure 
of platinum 
is almost completely 
destroyed 
[9]. Although 
not 
atomically 
dispersed, 
these 
clusters 
exhibit 
a measured 
dispersion 
of 
unity. 
Yet they 
may contain 
quite a few atoms, as a tetrahedron 
of close- 
packed 
spheres having four spheres on each edge of the tetrahedron 
contains 
20 spheres, 
with 19 of them exposed 
at the surface. If the spheres are plati- 
num atoms, the edge of the tetrahedron 
measures 
1.35 nm, but its dispersion 
is virtually 
unity. 
In reality, 
no crystalline 
shapes can be recognized 
on high 
resolution 
electron 
micrographs 
of small metallic 
clusters;.rather, 
they look 
like irregular 
spheres. 
Crystal habit is seen only for particles cu. 3 nm in size 
or more. 
Thus any relation 
between 
dispersion 
D and spherical 
size d is obscured 
by the shape factor. 
For convenience,.the 
conversion 
formula 
d = (l/D) 
nm 
is adequate 
for transition 
metals, e.g., a dispersion 
of one-half corresponds 
to 
a size equal to 2 nm. The formula 
fails if the clusters exhibit 
an extended 
raft structure.

Measuring turnover frequency 
In heterogeneous catalysis, the usual problems of measuring rates of 
reactions are compounded by the necessity of transferring heat and mass to 
and from the catalytic surface at a rate fast enough so that these physical 
rates do not interfere with the chemical one. To cope with these effects, 
chemical engineers have evolved elaborate theories with practical experi- 
mental criteria [lo]. 
With supported metals, a particularly simple criterion 
first proposed by Koros and Nowak [ll] 
provides a test of good kinetic 
behavior. The method is simple: prepare two or more catalysts with metal 
loadings as different as possible, measure the number of surface atoms and 
the rate of reaction at two temperatures [ 121, and calculate the turnover 
frequency N. If N is the same at each temperature for the two or more 
samples, the kinetic measurement is correct. The criterion of course works 
as well for homogeneous catalysts attached to a solid surface. 
With proper safeguards, it is now possible to reproduce the value of N 
on a given metal, under identical conditions of pressure, temperature and 
composition, 
measured on different catalysts, prepared in different labo- 
ratories by different methods with different supports. An example, that of 
the hydrogenation of cyclopropane to propane, will be discussed below. The 
quantification and duplication of reaction rates on metals is perhaps the 
most significant recent advance in heterogeneous catalysis, a field of chem- 
ical reactivity with an ingrained reputation for qualitative and h-reproducible 
results. 
Expectations for particle size effect 
First of all, as we grow a cluster starting with one atom, the coordina- 
tion number, i.e. the number i of nearest metal neighbors, of an exposed 
surface atom clearly goes up steadily until it reaches average values of six 
to nine, characteristic of low-index faces on large crystals [13]. Similarly, 
the relative fraction of exposed atoms Ci with coordination number i changes 
with particle size, as will the relative fraction of surface sites B, defined as 
locations above the surface with j nearest metal neighbors [14]. The effects 
measured by Ci and Bj will be called structural. 
They should vary more 
markedly as a 1 nm cluster is grown up to a size of 5 nm, a range which is 
critical for the observation of such effects. Above 5 nm little effect is 
expected, as regular crystallographic habits become fully developed. In a 
way, changing particle size in the range from 1 to 5 nm is similar to looking 
at different crystallographic planes on a macroscopic single crystal. But 
below 1 nm, other effects, not observable on large crystals, may become 
important as the relative proportion of surface atoms with very low co- 
ordination numbers becomes appreciable, if not dominant. This is the 
essence of the concept of Taylor’s active center. 
31 
Calculations of the electronic structure of clusters of transition metals 
support the expectation 
of their anomalous properties [15], and many 
results have been obtained by means of the fruitful X, Scattered Wave SCF 
Method of Slater and Johnston [16]. 
Experiments reveal chemical and 
physical properties of metallic clusters that differ from those of bulk crystals 
[ 171. For example, palladium particles supported on silica gel in the disper- 
sion range from 0 to 0.8 exhibit a spin paramagnetism [18] and a hydrogen 
solubility [ 
191 which both decrease linearly with increasing dispersion. 
Different properties of supported clusters are also expected as a result 
of their possible interaction with the support. As metallic clusters below 3 
nm change shape readily [l], 
depending on their contact angle with the 
support, they will change their surface structure together with their shape 
[3]. They may also exhibit preferred or anomalous structures because of 
epitaxial growth on the support [20]. Finally, there may be an electronic 
charge transfer between the metal and the non-metallic support, an effect 
well-known in solid state physics and first formulated by Schwab and co- 
workers in the case of supported metal catalysts [21, 221. Depending on 
whether the effect is observable as a change in catalytic activity of the 
support or of the metal, it is convenient to refer to it as the Schwab effect 
of the first kind or of the second kind, respectively. Clearly, if they exist, 
these metal-support 
interactions must become more important as cluster 
size decreases. There are also cases where the support participates in the 
catalytic reaction by transfer of a reaction intermediate from the metal 
to the support, as in dual-function catalysis [23] or hydrogen spillover 
[24]. Artefacts may also arise due to the transfer of impurities from the 
support to the metal [25,26]. 
In brief, particle size should affect binding energies of reactants, 
catalytic intermediates and products and, hence, the turnover frequency. 
How important the effect will be and to which of its many possible causes 
it can be ascribed are questions that can be answered today only by experi- 
ment. Some of the evidence will now be reviewed. 
The hydrogenation of cyclopropane 
This reaction, when leading to propane, resembles the hydrogenation 
of alkenes and not hydrogenolysis, the latter reaction leading to methane 
and ethane. At low temperatures, hydrogenation is the sole reaction on 
platinum, and isomerization of cyclopropane to propene on the support can 
also be neglected. An early study of the reaction on platinum unsupported 
and supported on alumina or silica gel showed, to our surprise, that when the 
dispersion of the metal was varied essentially between - 0 and - 1, the turn- 
over frequency did not vary by more than a factor of two, being larger for 
the catalysts with the larger dispersion [27]. The same conclusion has been 
reached qualitatively and quantitatively in a particularly careful and exhaus- 
tive check of the work of our group by another group [28]. The turnover 
32 
frequency 
reported 
by both groups has also been obtained 
on a macroscopic 
single crystal of platinum, 
when the reaction 
was studied 
at pressures 
com- 
parable to those used by the other two groups 
[ 291. It is in excellent 
agree- 
ment with the other results, the margin of error being due to an extrapola? 
tion in temperature 
(not pressure) 
necessary 
to compare 
the results on the 
macroscopic 
single crystals 
and the microscopic 
single crystals of platinum. 
That the turnover 
frequency 
is virtually 
the same on a large crystal and on 
crystallites 
1 to 1.5 nm in size supported 
on alumina or silica is a result that 
deserves further 
discussion 
[ 301. 
In our earlier paper 
[ 271, it was said that because of the lack of effect 
of particle 
size on the rate of hydrogenation 
of cyclopropane, 
the reaction 
was a facile one. This was an unfortunate 
choice of adjective 
because facile 
simply 
means 
easy to the organic 
chemist. 
At the suggestion 
of Charles 
KernbaIl, it was switched 
from facile to structure-insensitive, in keeping with 
the rationale 
expounded 
in the previous section 
[ 311. Correspondingly, 
reac- 
tions that were called demanding [ 271 became 
known as structure-sensitive 
[311. 
Structure-insensitive 
and structure-sensitive 
reactions 
In a critical review, I have collected 
information 
pertaining 
to the effect 
on turnover 
frequency 
of three factors: 
first, the effect of particle size in the 
critical 
range 
and of crystallographic 
orientation 
for macroscopic 
single 
crystals; second, the effect of alloying an active Group VIII metal such as nickel 
with a less active Group 
Ib metal such as copper; 
and third, the effect 
of 
changing 
from one Group 
VIII metal to another 
of the same group [32]. 
More recent references 
are found in [30-j. Reactions 
have been classified into 
two groups. In Group I are reactions 
involving breaking (or making) of H-H, 
C-H, 
or O-H 
bonds, 
and in Group II are reactions 
involving 
breaking 
(or 
making) 
of C-C, 
N-N, 
or C-O bonds 
[33]. 
Reactions 
of Group I are less 
sensitive 
than reactions 
of Group II to changes of structure, 
to alloying, 
or 
to the nature 
of the metal. 
It is proposed 
that these three 
changes 
cause 
changes in binding energy that are magnified 
for reactions 
of Group II since 
these require 
surface sites consisting 
of more metal atoms than do reactions 
of Group I, which may necessitate 
only one surface atom. The advantages 
of 
this explanation 
are its simplicity 
and its ability 
to predict 
behavior. 
For 
instance, 
it predicts that reactions 
of Group II require a homogeneous 
transi- 
tion metal catalyst 
containing 
more than one metal atom 
[34]. It suggests 
that dihydrogen 
may require 
only one surface atom for its dissociation, 
and 
not 
two adjacent 
ones as traditionally 
assumed 
[35]. 
Similarly, 
it favors 
formation 
of a z-complex 
between 
an alkene and a single metal atom 
[36] 
rather than that of an eclipsed 
1,2-diadsorbed 
alkane on two adjacent 
metal 
atoms 
[ 371. Nevertheless, 
it would be foolhardy 
to claim that the proposed 
explanation 
of structure-insensitivity, 
if correct, 
is unique. 
In fact, three 
other 
plausible 
explanations 
of structure-insensitivity 
will be considered 
below: 
surface 
reconstruction 
[39], 
extractive 
chemisorption 
1401, and 
33 
formation of a catalytic metal-alkyl 
overlayer [ 411. This wealth of specula- 
tion underscores the usefulness of studies on the effect - or laclz of effect - 
of particle size on turnover frequency. 
Alternative explanations of structure-insensitivity 
In heterogeneous 
catalysis by metallic chlorides, oxides and sulfides, 
there are many examples of extreme anisotropy in which a particular crys- 
tallographic orientation does all the catalytic work. This is especially marked 
with catalysts which consist of layer lattices: only the planes exposing co- 
ordinatively unsaturated transition metal ions are catalytically active. There 
are also examples of such catalysts where only a minute concentration 
(1 in 105) of surface defects is catalytically 
active. By contrast, structure- 
sensitivity 
with metals, when it exists, is much less dramatic, 
involving 
changes in turnover frequency 
by a factor of not more than 10 - 100 in 
order of magnitude. Much more surprising are the recent studies with metal- 
lic catalysts exhibiting structure-insensitivity. 
Note that insensitivity does 
not mean invariance. There is a fuzzy area between insensitivity and sen- 
sitivity. Differences 
in reactivity are magnified by operation at low tem- 
peratures and smoothed out at high temperatures. To draw the boundary in 
the fuzzy area clearly requires a value judgment. 
Thus, in the more recent study of hydrogenation of cyclopropane on 
supported platinum, it is concluded that a factor of two in turnover fre- 
quency means structure-sensitivity 
[ 281, whereas in the older study the same 
factor of two was interpreted as a case of structure-insensitivity 
[27]. It is a 
tribute to progress in experimentation that a monotonic increase of turnover 
frequency with dispersion by a factor of only two can be considered sig- 
nificant enough to deserve an explanation, 
namely that corner and edge 
atoms are more reactive than other atoms with higher coordination numbers. 
It is truly surprising to find a reaction which exhibits structure-insensitivity 
within the experimental error of less than 5% in turnover frequency. This is 
the case for cyclohexene hydrogenation, which will be discussed later in this 
paper. 
The hydrogen-oxygen 
reaction on platinum: surface reconstruction 
When the reaction between Hz and O2 on supported platinum is studied 
on the same catalysts in the same apparatus, it is found that the reaction is 
structure-sensitive 
in excess hydrogen 
but structure-insensitive 
in excess 
oxygen [ 381. Since the kinetics indicates that the rates under these condi- 
tions are determined by chemisorption of dioxygen and dihydrogen respec- 
tively, the general explanation mentioned earlier would suggest that more 
surface atoms are required for splitting dioxygen than for splitting dihy- 
drogen. While this is reasonable, another explanation can be suggested [38]. 
In excess oxygen, the surface is probably covered with an almost complete 
monolayer of oxygen. This monolayer may reconstruct the platinum surface 
so as to obliterate the structural details originally present on particles of 
different 
dimensions 
[8]. 
By contrast, 
in excess hydrogen, a hydrogen- 
34 
covered surface would remain unreconstructed. 
Hence structure-insensitivity 
in one case and sensitivity in the other. Support for this view is provided by 
an X-ray scattering study of 3 nm platinum particles in a Y-zeolite, in atmo- 
spheres of both hydrogen and oxygen [8]. In oxygen, the successive peak 
intensities in the radial distribution function for the platinum structure are 
diminished by an amount corresponding to the amount of destruction of 
the normal platinum lattice in the outermost metallic layer of the particle. 
More strikingly, exposure to oxygen at room temperature of 1 nm clusters 
of platinum in the supercages of the zeolite almost completely destroys the 
normal lattice structure 
exhibited 
by the same platinum clusters when 
covered with a layer of hydrogen. Quite recently, the reaction between Hz 
and O2 on supported platinum catalysts has been reinvestigated by the 
Boreskov Group [39]. Their data show structure-insensitivity in both excess 
Hz and excess OZ. The difference between the results of both this investiga- 
tion and those found by us may be due to a substantial difference in pretreat- 
ment of the catalysts. The effect of these pretreatments on surface composi- 
tion or structure needs further study. 
Hydrogenation of di-t-butyl acetylene on platinum: extractive chemisorption 
The idea behind such a study of liquid-phase hydrogenation is that the 
triple bond of the substrate is so shielded by the bulky substituents that it 
cannot approach surface atoms of a flat crystal plane. Hence it may well 
react only, or preferentially, at corner and perhaps edge atoms of very small 
particles. This logic was contradicted in a study[40] 
using cyclopentene as a 
reference 
compound: 
all runs with di-t-butyl acetylene were sandwiched 
between two runs with cyclopentene, and runs were discarded when the two 
cyclopentene 
runs of the sandwich gave a turnover frequency differing by 
more than 5%. Not only does the hindered substrate get hydrogenated 
almost as fast as cyclopentene, but if there is a significant trend in this appar- 
ently structure-insensitive reaction, it is the opposite of that expected; name- 
ly, the particles with the lower dispersion (flatter planes) are more reactive 
than the particles with high dispersion (edges and comers). The ingenious 
explanation of the authors of this fascinating study is extractive chemisorp- 
tion. If the metal atoms are extracted from their normal metallic habitat 
during the formation 
of the catalytic intermediate, 
structure-insensitivity 
becomes understandable. Another possible explanation [41], to be discussed 
next, is considered briefly by the same authors but dismissed. 
Hydrogenation 
of cyclohexene 
on platinum and palladium: formation of a 
metal alkyl catalytic species 
This reaction has been studied in both liquid and gas phases on sup- 
ported palladium and platinum catalysts [42 - 441. The reaction was struc- 
ture-insensitive. 
In particular in the liquid phase, the turnover frequency 
remained remarkably invariant as the metal dispersion was varied over the 
critical range. This was especially striking for the data concerning liquid 
phase reaction on platinum; these data remained the same irrespective of 
35 
support, metal loading or dispersion, The unusual reporting of rates with 
three significant figures was justified by the reproducibility of the data and 
by the fact that the rate, at constant pressure, was strictly zero-order with 
respect to hydrocarbon, 
and hence a constant very easily measured with 
precision and accuracy. Two of the catalysts studied exhibited a platinum 
dispersion of unity, thus having a characteristic dimension of 1 nm or less. 
These results can be explained by the assumption that a reaction will be 
structure-insensitive 
if the critical intermediate 
requires only one surface 
atom, or perhaps two adjacent ones. Yet the remarkable insensitivity of the 
reaction to structural changes brought about by variation in particle size 
makes it attractive to consider another explanation, which may also be an 
alternative to that of extractive chemisorption discussed above. This inter- 
pretation, advanced to explain a large number of observations on the cata- 
lytic hydrogenation of olefins [41], suggests that the metal is covered with 
a partially dehydrogenated 
adsorbed olefin, whose role is to transfer dihy- 
drogen from the fluid phase to the substrate to be hydrogenated. 
The 
elaborate mechanistic interpretations 
[37] carried out since 1934 to check 
the original mechanism of Horiuti and Polanyi [45] 
for hydrogenation of 
alkenes on metals remain unchanged; however, the nature of the catalytic 
entity is postulated to be not a site at the metallic surface, but an alkyl- 
metal complex formed by interaction between the metal and the substrate. 
Such a view might be helpful for understanding the relative success of 
asymmetric hydrogenation performed on ordinary metal catalysts pretreated 
with optically active chemisorbed molecules [ 46,471. 
Structure-sensitive reactions 
The exploration 
of the effect of particle size on the crystallographic 
orientation of supported metals has revealed that the nature of the reaction 
clearly influences the magnitude or trend of the effect. Thus, as discussed 
above, some reactions have a turnover frequency 
which is little or even 
negligibly affected 
by the structural details of the surface. In contrast, 
ammonia synthesis on supported iron has a turnover frequency which in- 
creases monotonically 
as dispersion increases [48]. This was interpreted as 
reflecting the need for special surface atoms, CT, with coordination number 
seven to chemisorb dinitrogen in or prior to the ratedetermining 
process. 
According to theoretical 
considerations 
[ 141, the relative concentration 
of 
C, atoms is less on small particles than on larger ones. The assignment of 
enhanced activity to C, atoms has been recently supported by findings on 
single crystals of iron [49]. In a high-pressure study of ammonia synthesis, 
it was found that the (111) planes of iron which expose C, atoms are more 
active by two orders of magnitude than are other planes of iron. When these 
data on Fe(ll1) 
are extrapolated down in pressure and temperature to the 
conditions 
corresponding to those of a study of ammonia synthesis on a 
commercial catalyst [ 501, it is found [ 511 that the turnover frequency is 
identical (to within less than a factor of two) on Fe(ll1) 
and on the com- 
mercial catalyst. 
36 
The reaction 
between 
H, and 0, in excess H, on supported 
platinum 
is an example 
of a reaction 
for which the turnover 
frequency 
is larger on 
larger particles 
than on smaller 
ones [38]. 
This may be explained 
by the 
fact that the dissociation 
of O2 on platinum 
is more rapid on surface atoms 
of lower coordination 
than that found 
on smaller particles 
or on stepped 
single crystals 
of platinum, 
exposing 
active steps with lower coordination 
numbers 
among 
inactive 
terraces 
having atoms 
with higher 
coordination 
numbers 
[ 521. 
Conclusion 
In summary, 
the study of particle size effect on turnover 
frequency 
has 
proved 
to be an incisive tool in heterogeneous 
catalysis. 
The largely unex- 
plored domain involving particle sizes below 1 nm appears the most challeng- 
ing for the future 
in terms of preparation, 
characterization 
and potential 
enhancement 
of reactivity 
[6]. 
Moreover, 
here the domain of heteroge- 
neous 
catalysis rejoins the domain of homogeneous 
catalysis or that 
of 
heterogeneous 
catalysis 
by free or immobilized 
organometallic 
metal cluster 
complexes 
[53]. 
Finally, 
in this size range metal-support 
interactions 
are 
expected 
to be particularly 
important. 
Much remains to be done to under- 
stand the nature of these interactions 
[ 541. 
For the future, 
three other avenues of research appear promising. 
First, 
the symmetry 
and size of the ensembles responsible 
for the activity 
of metals 
in structure-sensitive 
reactions 
must be determined, 
and the number of active 
sites must be counted. 
Progress 
toward 
that goal has been achieved 
in the 
case of ammonia 
synthesis 
on iron. Second; the nature of the Schwab effect 
of the second kind must be understood 
and exploited 
in the case of metal- 
support 
interactions 
that 
involve 
the support 
as a ligand to modify 
the 
activity 
of metal clusters. 
Such interactions 
have been identified 
in the case 
of platinum 
clusters 
in acid Y-zeolites. 
Third, 
new materials 
must be ex- 
plored, 
including new supports 
such as those exhibiting 
basic properties, 
new 
metals 
such as molybdenum, 
and metals 
modified 
with non-metallic 
(e.g. 
carbon) 
or metallic 
additives. 
In all three 
categories, 
it is expected 
that 
model 
systems 
will play an increasing 
role. These model systems consist of 
metal particles 
deposited 
on. non-porous 
supports 
by methods 
used in the 
microfabrication 
of electronic 
devices. Such systems can be characterized 
by 
the large range of instruments 
used in surface science. 
In closing, let us discuss some recent 
results obtained 
with the model 
systems just mentioned, 
dealing with another 
example 
of a structure-insensi- 
tive reaction, 
namely 
the low pressure 
oxidation 
of carbon 
monoxide 
on 
palladium 
clusters deposited 
on single crystals of a-Al*Os [55]. It was found 
that at 445 K, the turnover 
frequency 
for CO oxidation 
remained 
unchanged 
on clusters between 
1.5 and 8 nm in average size, and under identical 
condi- 
tions was also the same as that reported 
on large single crystals of palladium 
[ 561. The apparent 
increase 
in turnover 
frequency 
by a factor 
of three on 
37 
particles of palladium smaller than 3 nm when the CO oxidation was run at 
518 K [55] disappears when the sites responsible for the reaction are proper- 
ly counted [ 571. It is in~resting to note that the subsequent re-investigation 
[57] led to interesting facts concerning a structure-sensitive side reaction, 
namely the d~propo~ionation 
of CO to COZ and surface carbon, which is 
favored on palladium clusters less than 3 nm in average size. The re-investiga- 
tion in turn was prompted by the difficulty to explain the previous observa- 
tions suggesting that CO oxidation was structure-insensitive at 445 K but 
structure-sensitive at 518 K. 
~atever 
the ultimate explanation of these findings, it appears that the 
concept of structure insensitivity or sensitivity can be fruitful in spotting 
anomalous behavior, the underst~ding 
of which is always of scientific or 
practical interest. The concept can also be applied to suggest that homoge- 
neous transition metal catalysts with only one coordinated metal are suitable 
for structure-insensitive reactions, while metallic clusters are necessary in the 
case of structure-sensitive reactions.
