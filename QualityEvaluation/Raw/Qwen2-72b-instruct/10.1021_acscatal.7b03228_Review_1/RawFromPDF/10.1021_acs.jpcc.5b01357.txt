Abstract
Pd–Ag alloy catalysts with very dilute amounts of Pd were synthesized. EXAFS results demonstrated that when the concentration of Pd was as low as 0.01 wt %, Pd was completely dispersed as isolated single atoms in Ag nanoparticles. The activity for the hydrogenation of acrolein was improved by the presence of these isolated Pd atoms due to the creation of sites with lower activation energy for H2 dissociation. In addition, for the same particle size, the 0.01% Pd/8% Ag alloy nanoparticles exhibited higher selectivity than their monometallic counterparts, suggesting that the Pd atom may act as a site for the favorable bonding of the acrolein molecule for facile hydrogenation of the aldehyde functionality.

1.0 Introduction
The creation of atomically uniform sites in heterogeneous catalysis remains a long-standing goal of the catalysis community. To this end, several groups have recently attempted to heterogenize homogeneous catalysts either through tethering to the support (1-5) or by exchanging ligands with active center-support bonds that tune the electronic structure of the active site. (6-14)Another strategy for atomically uniform sites comes from the example of Sykes et al., who showed that single Pd atoms could be embedded in a Cu(111) surface and act as active sites for the selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene and the hydrogenation of styrene to ethylbenzene. (15) The creation of single-atom alloys is based upon the creation of a metal nanoparticle (of a relatively inert metal) with an active metal embedded in the particle. Here we exploit this idea to show an enhancement in another selective hydrogenation reaction: the hydrogenation of acrolein.
Acrolein is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde which is particularly difficult to selectively hydrogenate to produce α,β-unsaturated alcohol compared to all the other higher homologues due to a lack of substituents on the C═C bond (a reaction scheme is shown in Figure 1). Typical hydrogenation catalysts using platinum, palladium, or ruthenium are very active but not selective to allyl alcohol (the desired product). Instead the primary metal of choice is Ag, (16-18) which has been shown to exhibit higher selectivity but low activity. This low activity is not surprising since silver is known to exhibit poor hydrogen activation. Therefore, one factor for increasing the reaction is to facilitate the dissociation of H2. However, there is a trade-off between high selectivity and high activity in that high selectivity to allyl alcohol is a result of the weak binding of acrolein (which is favored over Ag), whereas the efficient dissociation of H2 takes place over metals such as Pd and Pt which are too reactive for molecular adsorption of acrolein and selectivity shifts toward undesired products. (19-22)

Alloys have been employed previously for the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. For example, Rh–Cu/SiO2 alloy catalysts showed both higher selectivity and activity to crotyl alcohol in the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. (23) While the selectivity to crotyl alcohol was 55% and 18% on pure Cu and pure Rh catalyst, respectively, the selectivity to crotyl alcohol increased to 74% over a Rh–Cu alloy (having 33% atomic ratio of Rh) catalyst. Similarly, the turn over frequency (TOF) was increased from 7.6 × 10–3 s–1 over pure Rh/SiO2 to 11.7 × 10–3 s–1 over 0.33Rh–Cu/SiO2. It was thought that the improved catalyst performance was due to better Rh dispersion when Cu was present.
In another study of alloy effects in selective hydrogenation, Marinelli and Ponec examined Sn for its ability to improve the selectivity of Pt catalysts for acrolein hydrogenation and found that the selectivity to allyl alcohol increased from 1% to 27% after the addition of tin. (24) The authors suggested that tin was not present as an alloy (based on the fact that PtCu systems, which form an alloy, did not show enhanced selectivity) but rather as SnOx. However, Sautet and co-workers used density functional theory studies of the adsorption of crotonaldehyde and acrolein on PtSn surfaces to show that perhaps reactive ensembles involving Sn could be important. (25) The hydrogenation of acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and prenal were studied over two Pt–Sn alloy surfaces, p(2 × 2) Pt3Sn(111) and (√3 × √3) R30° Pt2Sn(111). The adsorption energies on alloy surfaces were lower than on pure Pt for each of the unsaturated aldehydes studied in every configuration. However, the changes in the adsorption energies varied such that the adsorption of the unsaturated aldehyde in the proper configuration for selective hydrogenation was favored on the Pt3Sn and Pt2Sn surfaces due to charge transfer from Sn to Pt, leading to a Sn+ site which allows for bonding with the aldehyde functionality. The repulsive effect of the substituents on the C═C bond was also found to increase as the molecule size increased, so the selectivity enhancement was most prominent for prenal. (25, 26)
Subsequent experiments by Haubrich et al. on the adsorption and thermal decomposition of crotonaldehyde on the same Pt–Sn alloy surfaces (i.e., Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111)) and the Pt(111) surface as a comparison (26) showed that the higher the surface composition of Sn, the smaller the desorption peak of crotonaldehyde observed in the TPD spectra, implying weaker interaction between crotonaldehyde and the surface with addition of Sn. Accompanying DFT calculations suggested that the saturation coverage of crotonaldehyde on Pt3Sn and Pt2Sn involves the favorable η1-top-OSn configuration which could explain better selectivity to unsaturated alcohol over Pt–Sn alloys.
Bimetallic alloys can also adopt core–shell configurations whereby the surface is uniform but the presence of the alloying metal in the subsurface affects its reactivity. One unique version of a core–shell type alloy is a sandwich alloy by which a single layer of one metal is inserted into the second layer of a slab of the second host metal. Chen and co-workers have examined the effect of a Pt sandwich alloy with Ni present in the subsurface. (27, 28)Acrolein would not bond to Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) via the di-σ-C═O configuration but does bond in this configuration to the Pt/Ni/Pt(111) surface. The authors speculate that the selectivity could be further improved with proper tuning of the electronic structure of the surface to shift the binding energy difference between different adsorption configurations of acrolein.
In another study of selective acrolein hydrogenation showing a different type of geometric effect, Claus and co-workers studied Au catalysts that were coated with indium. (29) High-resolution TEM images showed that the indium coated the terraces of the Au nanoparticles leaving only the edges exposed. The gold particles covered with indium were still half as reactive as those not covered by indium with a much better selectivity to allyl alcohol (63% vs 34%). This led the authors to conclude that the exposed corners and edges must be the reactive site for the selective hydrogenation of the C═O group.
Ag alloys have been previously considered for acrolein hydrogenation. In a prominent example of improved selectivity, Lucas and Claus reported that a 9Ag–0.75In/SiO2 (9 wt % of Ag, 0.75 wt % of In) catalyst had a selectivity of 61% to allyl alcohol even when acrolein was fully converted (conversion = 97%). (30, 31) X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements showed that a Ag3In alloy phase was formed when the catalyst was reduced at 603 K, which might provide the active sites for the outstanding performance. In this case, the presence of In is speculated to serve as a binding site for the C═O bond of acrolein in a manner echoing the calculations of Delbecq and Sautet. (25) It is also observed that with an increase of particle size there is an increase in activity and selectivity. (18) This is believed to be related to a larger portion of (111) surfaces on larger particles, where acrolein adsorbs preferentially through the carbonyl bond. The computational efforts of Ferullo et al. (32) support the idea that the adsorption mode of acrolein is highly sensitive to coverage.
An extreme version of geometric (ensemble) effects would be the creation of an isolated atom in a matrix of another element termed by Sykes et al. as a single atom alloy (SAA). (15, 33-35) In their combined temperature-programmed desorption/scanning tunneling microscopy study, Kyriakou et al. (15) deposited 0.01 ML and 0.1 ML of Pd on the Cu(111) surface to form structures where individual Pd atoms were alloyed into the Cu(111) surface. Hydrogenation of acetylene and styrene was employed as test reactions to investigate the catalytic properties of the Pd@Cu SSA. The presence of hydrogen atoms was clearly observed on the 0.01 ML Pd/Cu(111) surface in STM images indicating that isolated Pd atoms were able to dissociate hydrogen molecules to H atoms which then spilled over to the Cu surface. DFT calculations predicted that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation was reduced from 0.40 to 0.02 eV but that the adsorption enthalpy (−0.35 eV on the alloy and −0.20 eV on Cu(111)) was not strongly affected. In agreement with this prediction, the desorption temperature (manifested as the barrier to association—the reverse of the dissociation process) dropped dramatically from 310 K on Cu(111) to about 220 K on 0.01 ML Pd/Cu(111) (and even lower to ∼180 K on 0.1 ML Pd/Cu(111)). Temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) results showed that the selectivity of acetylene hydrogenation to ethene (as opposed to overhydrogenation to ethane) was greatly improved on the Pd@Cu SAA surface. The selectivity to ethene for acetylene hydrogenation was >95% on 0.01 ML Pd/Cu(111), while the selectivity to ethene was only 33% on 1 ML Pd/Cu(111). Similar results were obtained for the selective hydrogenation of styrene to ethylbenzene (i.e., minimal hydrogenation of the aromatic ring).
Recently, Boucher et al. reported synthesis of Pd–Cu SAA nanoparticle catalysts via galvanic replacement of Cu with Pd. (36) Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 catalysts (numbers refer to mole percent) were observed to have more than an order of magnitude higher activity for phenyl acetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart while sustaining high selectivity (94%) toward styrene for several hours at high conversion. The presence of palladium in these systems greatly increases the activity, suggesting that hydrogen dissociation is a kinetically important step in the reaction. Previous work from Rosch et al. has found that the activation barrier for dissociation of hydrogen over Ag is higher than any single step in the acrolein hydrogenation mechanism. (37, 38) Previous experiments from Zanella et al. (39) also provide support that hydrogen dissociation is rate limiting for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation over Au/TiO2. This implies that increasing hydrogen activation could be beneficial to selective acrolein hydrogenation, provided that the presence of the palladium does not significantly decrease the selectivity.
Here we present results for the selective hydrogenation of acrolein over a Pd–Ag bimetallic system with dilute Pd in Ag as a host metal. The situation is similar to the Pd@Cu SAA described by Sykes and co-workers but extends to simple, scalable methods for making high surface area supported nanoparticles. The activity and selectivity (considering particle size effect) are both improved by addition of Pd compared to monometallic silver catalyst.
2.0 Experimental Section
2.1 Preparation of Catalysts
Silver alloy catalysts were prepared using inorganic precursors via incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) and SiO2 as the support (silica gel, Sigma-Aldrich, 250–500 μm, 285 m2/g). Depending on how the precursors (e.g., AgNO3 and Pd(NO3)2) were added to make the alloy, we name the impregnations as Co-IWI or Sequential IWI. For sequential impregnation, metal salts were dissolved in water separately and impregnated successively. Palladium aqueous solution was impregnated first, and the catalysts were dried at room temperature for an hour then at 125 °C overnight. Calcination was then performed at 250 °C for 2 h in a furnace open to the atmosphere but without flow. Silver solution was impregnated after calcination. The catalysts were dried again and reduced at 325 °C without being calcined. The reduction treatments were performed in a tube furnace with a 50 mL/min flow of 3.5% H2 for 2 h.
Two low Pd loading samples were made following the same procedure, 0.01% Pd + 8 %Ag/SiO2_Seq_IWI_R325 and 0.05% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2_Seq_IWI_R325. For coincipient wetness impregnation (co-IWI), the palladium solution is mixed with the silver solution. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at room temperature for an hour and at 125 °C overnight. Finally, these materials are reduced at 325 °C. The notation for naming the catalysts includes dilute metal loading, host metal loading, support, preparation method, and treatment. For example, sample 0.01% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2_Co-IWI_R325 is a 0.01 wt % loading of Pd with 8 wt % of silver supported over silica by co-incipient wetness impregnation and reduced at 325 °C. A 2 wt % palladium catalyst was prepared in the same way by incipient wetness impregnation, supported on silica, and reduced at 300 °C in a 1/2″ OD plug flow reactor with a 50 mL/min flow of 3.5% H2 for 2 h and was used for comparison.
2.2 Characterization
EXAFS
Ag K edge EXAFS was employed to estimate the particle sizes since the loading of palladium was very low, and therefore the particle size can be estimated directly from the Ag coordination number. (18, 40) Pd K edge EXAFS was used to investigate the environment of palladium. EXAFS spectra were taken at the beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT, 10-ID) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. However, for the Pd K edge of the SAA materials, we perform the experiment in the fluorescence mode, which enhances the sensitivity by orders of magnitude over transmission EXAFS. (41) Fluorescence EXAFS measurements were made using a log-spiral-bent silicon Laue analyzer with scintillation detectors as described by Kropf et al. (42) All the samples were ground and packed into a sample holder. They were then reduced in 3.5% H2/He at 200 °C for 1 h, cooled in H2/He, and scanned at room temperature in H2/He in an environmental cell. Samples were scanned in transmission mode at the Ag edge and in fluorescence mode at the Pd edge. Metal foils were scanned at the same time for energy calibration. The WINXAS 3.1 program was used to fit the data to calculate the coordination number and bond distance between neighboring Ag atoms, using a k2-weighted Fourier transform. The least-squares fit in R-space from 1.6 Å to 3.1 Å of the k2-weighted Fourier transform is done using data from 2.6 to 12.1 Å–1.The Ag–Ag phase and amplitude functions were acquired from the first coordination shell of Ag foil (NAg–Ag = 12 at 2.889 Å). An empirical relationship between the coordination number and particle size previously obtained from a series of platinum samples was used since both silver and platinum are fcc (face centered cubic) metals. (40) However, since there is no specific rule to choose the Debye–Waller factor (DWF), some error is introduced in our size estimation. This error in the fits was determined by fixing the difference in the DWF between the reference and the samples at 0.001 Å2. The error in the absolute particle diameter we estimate to be ±10% and in R was ±0.02 Å, (43) within the normal range of fitting errors of EXAFS. Fits were performed by changing the coordination number (CN), bond distance (R), σ2, and energy shift (E0). The σ2 value was fixed through all sample fits, and CN and R were allowed to change in turn to determine the correct fit.
2.3 Catalysis
Gas-phase acrolein hydrogenation was performed in a 1/2 in. OD stainless steel fixed-bed continuous flow reactor. Control of the reaction feed gas (hydrogen and argon) flow was done using mass flow controllers (Brooks Models 5964, 5850EM). Acrolein (Fluka ⩾95%) was delivered by a liquid pump (VICI M6), evaporated at 70 °C in a heat tape traced four way cross packed with quartz wool and carried into the system by reaction feed gas. The molar ratio of H2 to acrolein is kept constant at 20:1 with a pump set flow rate of acrolein 3.2 μL/min. Approximately 15–20 mg of catalyst was used for each test, depending on the activity of the catalyst. Before each run the concentration of acrolein was checked via a reactor bypass line that connects directly to the gas chromatograph (GC). Catalyst samples were reduced in situ in 20% H2/Ar flow at 200 °C for an hour before testing to ensure the catalysts are in a fully reduced metallic state. The reaction temperature was also 200 °C, and pressure was 5 atm. The reactor effluent was analyzed by an online GC (Agilent 6890) equipped with a dual column formed by an RT-Msieve 5A and an RT-QPLOT (Restek) for lighter gaseous species and a EC-Wax (Alltech) for less volatile species such as alcohols. The TCD (thermal conductive detector) and FID (flame ionization detector) were both utilized for detecting H2 and other organic/flammable compounds, respectively. The whole system was built with high-pressure-tolerant stainless steel parts and heat traced to avoid condensation of any product.
2.4 Density Functional Theory Calculations
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP). (44, 45) A plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 500 eV and projector-augmented wave (PAW) based pseudopotentials (45, 46) are employed. The Perdew–Wang (PW-91) form of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange and correlation functional is used in all calculations reported herein. (47) A five-layer slab model with 3 × 3 surface unit cell is adopted to model the Ag(111) surface. The Brillouin zone is sampled with a 3× 3 × 1 k-points grid. (48) The geometries of all structures were located with the conjugate gradient method and were considered to be converged with energy within 0.001 eV and forces of less than 0.025 eV/Å. The top three layers are allowed to relax. A vacuum space of 16 Å was applied to separate the slabs. The transition states (TS) are determined by the climbing nudged elastic band (NEB) method of Henkelman and Jónsson. (49)
3.0 Results and Discussion
Our initial study involves the creation of a series of PdAg alloy nanoparticle catalysts via sequential impregnation in varying Ag:Pd ratios (8:1, 160:1, 800:1) as well as their monometallic counterparts. The selectivities of the catalysts at 10% conversion and reaction rates of the four catalysts (the 8:1 Ag:Pd sample is excluded because its activity and selectivity are essentially identical to Pd) were analyzed and compared in Figure 2. As expected, Pd is extremely active but with no selectivity to allyl alcohol even under very mild reaction conditions. The reaction rate at 100 °C and 5 atm pressure is 38.9 × 103 mmol/(h·gPd), and selectivity to allyl alcohol is zero. In contrast, the 8% Ag/SiO2 catalyst has the highest selectivity for allyl alcohol. For this Ag catalyst, the selectivity can reach 37% at 200 °C and at 5 atm total pressure.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Activities (both per metal atom basis and TOF) and selectivities to allyl alcohol of Pd, Ag, and Pd–Ag catalysts synthesized via sequential IWI. All samples are supported on SiO2. 2% Pd/SiO2 and 0.05% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2 were tested at 100 °C and 5 atm pressure; the reaction temperature of 0.01% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2, 0.03% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2, and 8% Ag/SiO2 was 200 °C, and the reaction pressure of them was 5 atm.
Surprisingly, the 0.05% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2_Seq_IWI catalyst behaves more like Pd than Ag. Its activity approaches that of Pd alone (at T = 100 °C, the rate was 5.3 × 103 mmol/(h·gmetal), and its selectivity is only about 1% (Figure 2(a)). Our result implies that even at this dilute ratio the Pd is so much more active than Ag that its presence completely dominates the observed reactivity. In contrast, the selectivity of 0.01% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2 _SeqIWI to allyl alcohol is 31%, only slightly lower than 8% Ag/SiO2. In addition, the activity was almost double that of 8% Ag/SiO2 (303 vs 158 mmol/(h·gmetal), Figure 2(a)). Our result demonstrates that the Pd has a strong effect on the catalytic results, although the amount of Pd present is very small. It is important to mention that the reaction temperature for the Pd catalyst is 100 °C, while the less active Ag catalysts were tested at 200 °C. Since propionaldehyde is the thermodynamic product, we would expect that the selectivity to allyl alcohol should decrease as the temperature increases. Upon the basis of an estimate of the rate at 200 °C using an activation energy of 45 kJ/mol (obviously the activation energies are not the same for the Pd and Pd@Ag SAA catalysts), the results imply that the Pd catalyst is actually about 2000 times more active than Ag.
EXAFS experiments were performed in order to understand the increased activity but similar selectivity of the dilute alloy catalyst. By fitting EXAFS spectra, the coordination numbers and bond distances of the 0.01% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2_SeqIWI catalyst at both the Pd K edge and the Ag K edge were obtained and listed in Table 1. The numbers for bulk metals were also given for comparison. The coordination numbers at the Ag K edge were used to estimate particle size. The particle sizes of 0.01% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2_SeqIWI and 0.05% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2_SeqIWI are 5.8 and 5.4 nm, respectively. Although these two catalysts were treated in the same way that we used to prepare a pure silver catalyst (d = 8.7 nm), (18) the particle sizes of bimetallic samples are smaller than the monometallic sample. The addition of palladium seems to help disperse the silver nanoparticles probably due to the creation of nucleation centers of Pd upon which Ag aggregates. As discussed below, the size of the particle also has a critical effect on the reactivity (and selectivity).

Pd K edge spectra (Figure 3) give additional insight into the structure of the PdAg catalyst. For the 0.01% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2_SeqIWI catalyst, the coordination number of Pd is 10.5 (Table 1) which is very close to the value of Ag (10.2) and shows that Pd atoms are uniformly distributed and present both in the surface and in the bulk. If Pd atoms had segregated completely to the surface, they should be undercoordinated relative to Ag, and the coordination number should be smaller. In contrast, if all Pd atoms are in the bulk the coordination number will be closer to 12 since they would be completely coordinated in an fcc environment. From the EXAFS data we conclude that when the loading of Pd is very low (0.01 wt %) the Pd–Ag alloy forms in a way that silver serves as the host metal, while isolated single Pd atoms are uniformly atomically dispersed. In addition, the bond distance of the palladium atoms to the nearest neighbors is 2.82 Å (Table 1). The Pd–M bond distance is intermediate between the M–M bond distance in bulk silver (2.89 Å) and bulk palladium (2.74 Å). This result implies that Pd is surrounded only by silver atoms and that the Pd atoms are totally dispersed in Ag nanoparticles. Therefore, our materials seem to be nanoparticle analogues to the single crystal models of SAA catalysts described by Kyriakou et al. (15) In effect, our work has validated the ideas of Kyriakou et al. for yet another example of selective hydrogenation. We suggest that the dilute alloy is actually a SAA catalyst possessing isolated Pd atoms in a Ag matrix which accelerates the activation of H2 just as in the work of Kyriakou. Hydrogen atoms from dissociated H2 are then spilled over to the Ag surface where they are only weakly bound and therefore are easily consumed in the hydrogenation reaction.

Since the presence of Pd clearly improves the activity due to the ability of the alloy to activate H2, it is desirable to find the optimal Pd loading to maximize activity while maintaining selectivity. However, even a loading of 0.05% Pd resulted in a substantial loss of selectivity. We speculate this is due to the presence of contiguous Pd atoms which results in an unfavorable bonding configuration for acrolein. The alloy catalysts compared in Figure 2(a, b) were synthesized via sequential impregnation. It seems reasonable to suggest that by using a coimpregnation method the Pd will be better dispersed in the nanoparticle, and higher loadings of Pd could be used with comparable selectivity and higher activity. Therefore, co-IWI was employed in an effort to achieve better isolation of Pd at higher Pd contents and to avoid rapid nucleation of Ag around Pd. Three catalysts were made by changing the ratio of palladium doped in the silver catalyst (0.01%, 0.03%, and 0.05%) by simultaneously mixing the two metal precursors. It is found that the selectivity of 0.01% Pd + 8% Ag, made by coimpregnation, only improves the selectivity by 3–4% (from 31% to 34%) as shown in Figure 4(a). However, analysis of the coordination numbers (shown in Table 1 and Table 2) reveals that the silver particle size is decreased to 4 nm as compared to 5.4 nm (from Table S1, Supporting Information) by making Pd–Ag alloy via co-IWI instead of sequential IWI. The Pd–M bond is found to be 2.81 Å, once again implying that Pd atoms are completely surrounded by Ag. The weak antisegregation energies (50) combined with the high degree of dilution suggest the creation of single atom sites for catalysis. The results show that the method of preparation is critical to the catalyst performance and that the Ag is still nucleated by the presence of Pd in solution, resulting in smaller particles than the desired target.

Just as in the case for sequential impregnation, the samples made via coimpregnation showed a slightly lower selectivity for allyl alcohol by the 0.01% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2_CoIWI than the pure silver catalyst. (18) However, if we consider the particle size effect on selectivity (as shown in Figure 5), the selectivity is actually not reduced but improved by doping individual Pd atoms. The trend of selectivity vs particle size over silica-supported Ag samples shows that the selectivity of a monometallic silver catalyst (8% Ag/SiO2) having similar particle size to 0.01% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2_Seq_IWI_R325 is only around 15%, which is half of the selectivity achieved over 0.01% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2_Seq_IWI_R325 (Figure 2(a)). It seems unlikely that the addition of the Pd is changing the reactivity of Ag itself. Since the Ag–M bond distances are largely unchanged, no strain effect appears to be present. Similarly, changes in the local reactivity of Ag atoms neighboring Pd seem unlikely to be significant since most Ag atoms would have zero or one Pd neighbors. Another possible effect of the Pd is that the acrolein molecule adsorbs in a more favorable configuration for selective hydrogenation (i.e., C═O bond down to the surface as opposed to adsorbing through its C═C bond). DFT calculations of acrolein adsorbed on a Ag(111) slab with a single atom of Ag replaced by Pd (Figure 6) indicate that in fact while acrolein adsorbs weakly to the pure Ag surface in both orientations the presence of the Pd atom enhances acrolein adsorption through the C═C bond (1.36 eV) more dramatically than the C═O bond (0.45 eV O down to the surface and 0.87 eV with both O and C═C bonded to the surface). Extended ensembles of Pd also prefer bonding of acrolein through the C═C bond. For example, in the most extreme case, an extended Pd(111) surface, the acrolein adsorbs most strongly through the C═C bond (Eads = −2.15 eV) compared to bonding through the C═O bond (Eads = −0.85 eV, O down and Eads = −1.87 eV with both O and C═C bonded to the surface). It would appear that this is counter to our supposition that C═O orientation toward the surface is critical to selective hydrogenation. However, Sautet and co-workers have previously explained this result by noting that preferential attack of the C═O functionality may be possible even if the acrolein molecule is not bound to the surface by the aldehyde functionality. (51) The potential energy diagram shown in Figure 7 illustrates how introduction of single Pd atoms on the Ag(111) surface facilitates dissociation of hydrogen. Although hydrogen dissociation on Pd(111) is not activated (Ea ≈ 0 eV), the barrier for hydrogen dissociation on Ag(111) is rather high (1.15 eV) . In contrast, the binding energy of Ha on Ag(111) is 0.31 eV (endothermic), which is much weaker than that on Pd(111) (−1.23 eV). Interestingly, on the Pd/Ag(111) SAA surface, binding energy is reduced from −1.23 to −0.33 eV on Pd(111), while the activation energy is reduced to 0.31 eV from 1.15 eV on Ag(111). So, isolated Pd atoms on the Ag(111) surface help to activate the dissociation of H2 on the surface which results in spillover of H atoms to the Ag(111) surface. The H atoms have a significant barrier to recombination (0.56 eV) which is apparently on par with barriers for hydrogenation of acrolein. (37, 38) Kyriakou et al. (15) have shown how the presence of Pd atoms seems to result in a break away from the expected Bronsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relationship which correlates the reaction barrier with the reaction enthalpy. (52) Similarly, DFT calculations for our case revealed the same trend where the expected BEP relationship is not followed in the presence of Pd atoms. In the case of the Pd@Ag(111) alloy surface the barrier for dissociation is low (like Pd(111)), but the adsorption enthalpy for hydrogen is also low (like Ag(111)). This demonstrates a rare case of synergy where the alloy catalyst displays the “best behavior” of both metals.

Figure 7. Potential energy diagram showing how the Pd SAA surface has an effect on the energies compared to those for the Ag(111) and Pd(111) surface. Dissociation of H2 (white) on Ag(111) (blue) is a significantly activated process. On Pd(111) (green), H2 dissociation is practically barrierless; however, the binding energy of adsorbed atoms is high. For the Pd/Ag(111) SAA surface, the dissociation barrier is reduced, and binding energy of hydrogen is decreased allowing dissociated hydrogen to get spilled over to the Ag surface (Eact = activation energy, ΔE = reaction enthalpy).
4.0 Conclusion
Pd–Ag alloy catalysts with very dilute levels of Pd were synthesized using traditional impregnation methods in an attempt to create single-atom alloys as in the example of Sykes et al. (15, 35) Both the activity and the selectivity for the selective hydrogenation of acrolein were improved as compared to monometallic Ag catalysts of the same size. The EXAFS results indicate that isolated Pd atoms are atomically dispersed in Ag nanoparticles. DFT calculations suggest that the presence of isolated Pd atoms increases the activity by providing active centers for H2 dissociation and that the selectivity increases due to favorable changes in the configuration of adsorbed acrolein. The results suggest additional improvements may be possible if the larger Ag particles can be synthesized and if larger doping levels could be used while maintaining Pd in an atomically dispersed state.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. Acrolein hydrogenation scheme (red path shows desired pathway).
Figure 2
Figure 2. Activities (both per metal atom basis and TOF) and selectivities to allyl alcohol of Pd, Ag, and Pd–Ag catalysts synthesized via sequential IWI. All samples are supported on SiO2. 2% Pd/SiO2 and 0.05% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2 were tested at 100 °C and 5 atm pressure; the reaction temperature of 0.01% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2, 0.03% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2, and 8% Ag/SiO2 was 200 °C, and the reaction pressure of them was 5 atm.

Figure 5. Comparison of selectivities toward allyl alcohol of Pd–Ag alloys and pure Ag catalysts with various particle sizes. All samples are supported on SiO2. Selectivities compared at 200 °C, 5 atm, and 10% conversion.
Figure 6
Figure 6. Presence of Pd atoms preferentially changes the adsorption of acrolein. (a) Acrolein adsorbed on isolated Pd atom through the C═C bond and oriented horizontally (E = −1.36 eV). (b) Acrolein adsorbed on an isolated Pd atom through O and C═C bond and oriented horizontally (E = −0.87 eV). (c) Acrolein adsorbed on isolated Pd atom through the C═O bond and oriented vertically (E = −0.45 eV). Atoms by colors: Ag (blue), C (black), O (red), H (white), Pd (green).
Figure 7
Figure 7. Potential energy diagram showing how the Pd SAA surface has an effect on the energies compared to those for the Ag(111) and Pd(111) surface. Dissociation of H2 (white) on Ag(111) (blue) is a significantly activated process. On Pd(111) (green), H2 dissociation is practically barrierless; however, the binding energy of adsorbed atoms is high. For the Pd/Ag(111) SAA surface, the dissociation barrier is reduced, and binding energy of hydrogen is decreased allowing dissociated hydrogen to get spilled over to the Ag surface (Eact = activation energy, ΔE = reaction enthalpy).
