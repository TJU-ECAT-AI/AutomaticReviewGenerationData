Acetylene on GaPd2 and GaPd

1. Introduction
The selective hydrogenation of acetylene is a widely used in-
dustrial process for the purification of ethylene-rich streams
that are obtained from hydrocracking of the naphtha fraction
during the processing of crude oil.[1] Ethylene is mainly used
for its polymerization to polyethylene or partial oxidation to
ethylene oxide.[2] For these catalytic processes, the purity of
the reactant stream must be high.[3] Therefore, the aim of a pu-
rification step is the complete and selective hydrogenation of
acetylene to the desired ethylene [Eq. (1)], whereas the subse-
quent full hydrogenation to ethane [Eq. (2)] has to be avoided
for economic reasons. Additionally, the unwanted side reac-
tions [Eqs. (3) and (4)] can occur, leading to higher hydrocar-
bons and lowering the ethylene yield:

Classical catalysts for the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene
consist of finely dispersed Pd on Al2O3 or alloys of Pd with Ag
or Au on the same support material.[4] As this reaction is also
of high interest for basic research, other support materials
such as carbon or different oxides such as SiO2 and TiO2 have
been investigated.[5–8] The activity of elemental Pd catalysts is
somewhat high but the selectivity for ethylene is limited to
20% at 2008C, which is determined by the electronic and geo-
metric structure of the catalyst.[9] In such elemental Pd or Pd
alloy catalysts, each atom is surrounded by 12 other (Pd)
atoms in the first coordination shell. Based on the resulting
geometric arrangement of Pd atoms on the surface, it was
shown that some geometries are clearly energetically favored
for the adsorption of acetylene, resulting in the unwanted full
hydrogenation to ethane and the formation of higher hydro-
carbon species.[10]
For selective hydrogenation of acetylene it is necessary that
acetylene is adsorbed at a p bond on the surface, which is un-
favorable if the distance between potential adsorption centers
is too small.[11] This finding led to the development of the
active-site-isolation concept, according to which the adsorp-
tion centers have to be spatially separated so that the adsorp-
tion of acetylene at a p bond is energetically favored.[11] The
addition of promoters such as Ag, Au, Cu or Sn results in in-
creased selectivity and greater long-term stability of the cata-
lysts.[4,8,12,13] In contrast, Ga is not used as classical promot-
er.[13–19] Ga forms intermetallic compounds with Pd that possess
well-defined crystal structures, which is contrary to the wide-
spread formation of substitutional alloys using transition metal
promoters. Thus, the spatial separation of Pd atoms and the
Intermetallic GaPd2 is a highly selective and stable catalyst for
the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. Knowledge of the under-
lying reaction kinetics is essential to gain a deeper understand-
ing of the selective hydrogenation on this catalytic material. To
date, there has been no experimental kinetic data published
for this reaction on a well-defined intermetallic catalyst pos-
sessing isolated active sites. Kinetic measurements are per-
formed at 140–2008C, revealing an apparent activation energy
of 29(2) kJmol1. GaPd2 is shown to be the first binary catalyst
material, which shows a positive reaction order (0.89) with re-
spect to acetylene at 2008C. The influences on the extent of
acetylene conversion, specific activity and selectivity to ethyl-
ene, ethane, and higher hydrocarbons are determined by a 24
factorial experiment following a design of experiments ap-
proach. Temperature and pressure have the strongest impact
on these values. The results allow optimal operation for achiev-
ing high ethylene yields. A comparison of the reaction kinetics
on GaPd2 with experimental results obtained for GaPd reveals
different orders of reaction of H2 and C2H2 on the two com-
pounds.

distance between the active Pd sites is defined by the well-or-
dered intermetallic crystal structure, and the active-site-isola-
tion concept can be applied accordingly.
Examples of intermetallic compounds are GaPd and Ga7Pd3,
in which seven and eight Ga atoms surround each Pd atom in
the first coordination sphere, respectively. In the intermetallic
compound GaPd2, each Pd atom is neighbored by five Ga and
also eight Pd atoms in the first coordination shell. The result-
ing isolated active sites in all compounds led to huge improve-
ments in the selectivity for forming ethylene and stability of
the Ga–Pd catalysts.[16,17] The latter advantage results partly
from the lower segregation tendency of one of the constitut-
ing elements to the surface of the intermetallic Ga–Pd com-
pounds, which is caused by the covalent bonding behavior in
the intermetallic structures. Additionally, these catalysts are
much more selective in forming smaller amounts of hydrocar-
bons of the form C4H4+2x or higher as well as carbonaceous de-
posits. Thus, they show improved long-term stability for the
semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. These beneficial effects of in-
termetallic Ga–Pd compounds in this reaction were also dem-
onstrated under reaction conditions.[15–19]
The majority of kinetic studies for the semi-hydrogenation of
acetylene have been performed on or calculated for supported
Pd, the Pd(111) surface or alloyed Ag–Pd catalysts over a wide
range of reaction conditions.[10,20–27] Most of these studies yield-
ed kinetic results at temperatures up to 1008C, but the pro-
moting effects of other elements and diverse catalytic materi-
als have also been widely discussed. Thus, these studies pres-
ent very different kinetic data, as, for example, the apparent
activation energy EA and the reaction orders depend on tem-
perature, pressure, and the relative concentrations of the reac-
tants.[28] Recent publications discuss, for example, the influence
of temperature, gas flow and H2/C2H2 ratio.[29–31] Experimental
activation energies of 36–65 and 32–40 kJmol1 were obtained
for supported Pd[20,22,26,27,32–34] and Ag–Pd catalysts, respective-
ly.[27,33,34] Furthermore, kinetic measurements on Ag–Au–Pd and
Pd–Sn nanoparticles resulted in activation energies of 38–41
and 30 kJmol1, respectively, but evidence for the possible for-
mation of intermetallic compounds is missing in these stud-
ies.[13,31] Therefore, the present work represents, to our knowl-
edge, the first experimental investigation of reaction kinetics
of the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene conducted on interme-
tallic compounds.
Kinetic studies on the bulk intermetallic compounds GaPd
and GaPd2 are presented, including the investigation of the in-
fluence of process conditions (temperature, pressure, gas flow,
and H2/C2H2 ratio) on the response values for acetylene conver-
sion, activity and selectivity for the production of ethylene,
ethane as well as higher hydrocarbons. The catalytic measure-
ments were conducted according to a 24 factorial design,
which follows the design of experiments approach.[35] This ena-
bled a statistical analysis of the obtained data and revealed
the optimal operating parameters for the selective hydrogena-
tion of acetylene.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Preparation
The single-phase nature of the as-prepared GaPd2 (Figure 1)
and GaPd (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) was con-
firmed by powder X-ray diffraction.[15,36] The samples were sub-
sequently crushed in agate mortars and sieved to obtain the
corresponding particle size fractions. The size of the sieve frac-
tions was controlled by using SEM imaging that confirmed the
appropriate size for the 26 mm (Figure S2) and 90 mm GaPd2
(Figure S3), as well as the 26 mm (Figure S4) and 90 mm GaPd
particles (Figure S5).
2.2. Catalytic Studies
The catalytic measurements were performed in quartz glass
tube and stainless steel plug–flow reactors for determining the
reaction kinetics of the hydrogenation of acetylene on the in-
termetallic compounds GaPd and GaPd2. First of all it is essen-
tial to show that there are no mass transport limitations for
the investigated materials and its range of parameters.
2.2.1. Mass Transport Limitation
Studies on the kinetics of catalysis in terms of apparent activa-
tion energy and reaction order requires the exclusion of mass
transport limitations. Thus, reliable data for these kinetic pa-
rameters can be obtained. According to Equation (5):

there is evidence for mass transport limitation if the reaction
rate ri is influenced by different gas flows. _
V is the total volu-
metric flow rate, VR represents the volume of the catalyst bed
and cj,0 is the starting concentration of compound j, which
here is acetylene. For a first-order reaction, the conversion Xj
would be expected to be halved as consequence of a doubling
of the gas flow. For 26 mm particles of GaPd and GaPd2, 9 and
4% and 58 and 29% conversions were obtained for a total gas
flow of 39.2 and 78.4 mLmin1, respectively. In contrast to this
ideal behavior, the behavior of 90 mm particles of the two in-
termetallic compounds diverge. Conversion values of 43 and
9% and 65 and 36% were measured on GaPd and GaPd2 for
the lower and higher gas flows, respectively. Thus, there is a
slight mass transport limitation for the larger GaPd2 particles,
which is more pronounced for GaPd. Hence, mass transport
limitation is excluded for the 26 mm particles of GaPd and
GaPd2, which is a prerequisite for the following kinetic studies.
2.2.2. Estimation of Apparent Activation Energy
Conversion values obtained on GaPd2 (Table 1) were measured
between 140 and 2008C in 15 K steps for the heating and cool-
ing phases. The catalytic data for GaPd are summarized in
Table S1. The precision for very high and low conversion levels
is limited as the relative error of the volume fractions deter-
mined by gas chromatography is somewhat high below 5%
and above 95% conversion. Conversely, the percentage con-
version must not be too high, because in this case the selec-
tive hydrogenation of acetylene might be influenced by the
chemical equilibrium of the reaction as well as diffusion prob-
lems. Accordingly, this temperature range was chosen to keep
the conversion between 5 and 15%. Catalyst deactivation ef-
fects should not affect the obtained activities as Ga–Pd inter-
metallic compounds have long-term stability as reported in
the literature.[41]
The resulting Arrhenius plots follow linear trends with high
precision values for both GaPd2 (Figure 2) and GaPd (Fig-
ure S6); the fitted plots show only slightly different slopes. The
apparent activation energies obtained for GaPd2 are 30(1) and
28(1) kJmol1 in the heating and cooling phases, respectively.
Averaging the two values yields an activation energy of
29(2) kJmol1. Nearly identical apparent activation energies of
30(1) and 29(1) kJmol1 were obtained on GaPd for the heat-
ing and cooling phases, respectively. The mean apparent acti-
vation energy of 30(2) kJmol1 is only slightly higher than that
of GaPd2. Considering the error margin of the Arrhenius plots,
no significant differences of the apparent activation energies
are revealed for either GaPd or GaPd2. A comparison with the
literature shows that the activation energy for GaPd2 is at the
lower range of the data reported for the semi-hydrogenation
of acetylene on Pd catalysts, which were measured under con-
ditions that are claimed to be free of mass transport limita-
tions. The experimental apparent activation energies measured
on supported Pd (36–65 kJmol1),[20,22,26,27,32–34] Ag–Pd (32–
40 kJmol1),[27,33–34] Sn–Pd (30 kJmol1)[13] and Ag–Au–Pd (38–
41 kJmol1)[31] range between 30 and 65 kJmol1, which is in
good agreement with our values on GaPd and GaPd2. The rela-
tively low apparent activation energy determined for GaPd
and GaPd2 emphasize their high potential for future applica-
tions. Many density functional theory (DFT) calculations have
been performed for different surfaces of several intermetallic
compounds, which provide energies of the rate-limiting step.
Those calculations take into account just some crystallographic
surfaces and surface terminations. Thus, an overall activation
energy cannot be determined with high accuracy as, for exam-
ple, surface interactions cannot be fully considered as well. For
the rate-limiting steps of the selective hydrogenation of acety-
lene on ZnPd, AlPd, GaPd and GaPd2 surfaces activation barri-
ers of 56,[37] 71,[38] approximately 70–106[38,39] and approximate-
ly 80 kJmol1[38] have been calculated, which are significantly
higher than experimental values. Calculations for monometallic
Pd surfaces (32–60 kJmol1)[23,25,40] are in agreement with ex-
perimental values, owing also to the high variance of mea-
sured and calculated activation energies.
2.2.3. Determination of Reaction Orders for C2H2 and H2
The determination of the orders of reaction of acetylene and
hydrogen in the semi-hydrogenation over GaPd and GaPd2 is
essential for characterizing this reaction and provides hints for
further catalyst optimization. Due to the excess concentration
of one reactant, the reaction rate is only affected by changes
of the concentration of the minor reactant. By applying the
natural logarithm, Equation (15) simplifies to the following

To obtain the essential data, measurements were made at
2008C and ambient pressure and the initial concentrations of
acetylene and hydrogen were slightly varied. The slopes of the
resulting plots for GaPd2 (Figure 3) and GaPd (Figure S7) equal
the values of a and b, respectively. The two intermetallic com-
pounds exhibit great differences in both reaction orders. In the
case of GaPd2, reaction orders of a=0.89 (2008C) and b=0.49
(2008C) were obtained for acetylene and hydrogen, respective-
ly, resulting in a total reaction order of 1.38. Contrary to this,
the orders for C2H2 and H2 reacting on GaPd are a=1.18
(2008C) and b =1.09 (2008C), respectively, which yields a total
reaction order of approximately zero.
According to experimental literature data and calculations
on elemental Pd, the Pd(111) surface or Ag–Pd alloys, the reac-
tion orders of acetylene and hydrogen were mostly deter-
mined at 508C. The temperature dependence of the order of
the reaction of acetylene was investigated on Pd/Al2O3 by Vin-
cent et al.,[26] who applied a Langmuir–Hinshelwood model
and determined up to 1508C an order of reaction for acetylene
of 0.5 to 0, at which point it switched to a first-order reac-
tion. Nevertheless, mostly negative reaction orders for acety-
lene between 0 and 0.7 were obtained,[23,24,27,32] which might
indicate rate inhibition by this reactant. This means that acety-
lene limits the reaction on common catalyst surfaces, which
happens mainly due to strong adsorption of acetylene on the
active Pd sites. Furthermore, hydrogen has a relatively lower
adsorption tendency at higher temperatures owing to acety-
lene blocking adsorption sites.
As the reaction order with respect to hydrogen is positive
and approximately one for GaPd, the adsorption of hydrogen
is the rate-limiting step of the selective hydrogenation under
these conditions. Thus, it can be expected for such materials
that the reaction rate and thereby the conversion will decrease
at higher temperatures, which has been shown on GaPd.[17] An-
other hint toward the negative order of reaction of acetylene
on GaPd is that the maximum conversion was observed at
1608C, above which the conversion dropped with increasing
temperature. Because the active sites are isolated for interme-
tallic GaPd2,[14] the adsorption energy of acetylene is lowered,
which is beneficial for the activity, stability, and selectivity of
the catalyst. The order of reaction with respect to hydrogen is
significantly smaller compared to reaction orders obtained
from the literature, which are mainly in a range of 1–1.5.[23,24,27]
This hints at an improved, but still competitive, adsorption be-
havior of hydrogen at higher temperatures, which favors the
catalytic reaction.
The total reaction order of 1.38 for GaPd2 is slightly higher
than that reported for all previously mentioned systems. Con-
sequently, an increased activity per accessible active center on
GaPd2 can be concluded from this, which can also be an ex-
planation for the previously observed high activity and out-
standing selectivity of GaPd2 nanoparticles.[41]
2.3. Statistic Evaluation of Parameter Influences
The statistical evaluation of catalytic measurements enables
quantification of the influences of parameters on the main re-
sponse values such as conversion, activity, and the selectivities
for ethylene, ethane, and higher hydrocarbons. In contrast to
this approach, the literature reports only qualitative trends for
the effect of one or two parameters that our results confirm in
the following sections.[29–31] To obtain quantitative statements
on the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene with the least effort,
the systematic design of experiments approach was applied,
giving the main and interaction effects of all investigated pa-
rameters.[35] For calculating the main effects, multifactor inter-
actions and significance levels, the equations given by Box
et al. were utilized.[35] This factorial design consists of the four
parameters temperature T, pressure p, gas flow f and H2/C2H2
ratio r, where each parameter is varied on two levels (Table 2),
resulting in a 24 factorial experiment. Hence, for a complete
description of the factorial design 24=16 measurements with
different parameter combinations had to be performed.

tion of acetylene and hydrogen for determining the reaction orders a and b,
respectively, on GaPd2.

The main effects a were calculated for all the parameters. To
obtain this effect, one parameter is changed and the others
are kept constant, which gives a comparison of the means on
the positive and negative levels of each parameter, respective-
ly. Furthermore, there are two- (a  b), three- (a  b  c) and
four-factor interactions (a  b  c  d), where the correspond-
ing number of parameters are varied on both levels. The given
D-values represent the absolute change of a response value if
the corresponding parameters are varied from the lower to
higher level. Additionally, the significance levels (dashed lines
in Figures 4–6) indicate if a main effect or a multifactor interac-
tion has a significant impact on the investigated response
value. According to this evaluation, it is possible to identify op-
timal operating points regarding aspects such as maximum
conversion, selectivity, or ethylene yield.
2.3.1. Conversion
The percentage conversion is one of the most important re-
sponse values of a catalytic reaction as it can directly deter-
mine the quality of a catalyst material in a given reaction. The
influence of the main effects on conversion are as expected
(Figure 4). An increased flow has to lead to a decreased acety-
lene conversion, which was already shown by testing for mass
transport limitations. The increasing conversion at elevated
pressure follows Le Chatelier’s principle.[42] As the number of
gas molecules is reduced during the semi-hydrogenation from
two to one, the pressure is concomitantly reduced during the
reaction. Thus, the reaction equilibrium as well as the conver-
sion can be shifted towards the product using a higher process
pressure. The rise in conversion holds also for increasing tem-
perature as the reaction kinetics can be improved up to a tem-
perature at which the free energy of the reaction becomes
positive or the adsorption of the reactants on the surface be-
comes too weak. In addition, the two-factor interactions p  f,
T  p, and T  f behave as expected from the main effects. The
remaining interactions possess no significant impact on the
conversion and are not further discussed here.
2.3.2. Specific Activity
The specific activity is an important response value for compar-
ing different catalyst materials or catalytically active compo-
nents. Here, it is normalized per hour and amount of palladium
in the catalyst sample. All significant changes of the parameter
interactions for the activity are positive (Figure 5). Because the
conversion correlates directly with the activity, temperature
and pressure increases have a beneficial impact on this re-
sponse value whereby the same behavior has to be observed
for their two-factor interactions as well. Additionally, the in-
creased H2/C2H2 ratio in the reaction mixture influences the ac-
tivity positively as this allows higher H2 occupation on the cat-

alyst surface. This is in agreement with the lower reaction
order with respect to H2 obtained for GaPd2 in comparison to
other Pd-based catalyst materials. The total gas flow has only a
very small and insignificant influence on the activity, which is
further evidence that no mass transport limitation is in effect
for the selective hydrogenation on GaPd2. The positive effect
of the three-factor interaction p  f  r has to be mainly relat-
ed to the strong influence on the main effects p and r, as the
influence caused by the gas flow is negligible.
2.3.3. Selectivity for Ethylene
Ideal catalyst materials possess high selectivity for the desired
molecule, which is ethylene in this case. If too many undesired
side reactions take place, the yield of the target molecule will
be lowered, which reduces the economic benefit of a catalytic
reaction. Additionally, it can be much more difficult to control
the process itself, and the lifetime of the catalyst material
might be adversely affected due to the formation of carbona-
ceous deposits. High selectivities in the range of 48–80% were
obtained for the tested parameter combinations. Here, the se-
lectivity is only influenced significantly by the main effects of p
and T (Figure 6). The negative influence of the pressure on the
selectivity also follows Le Chatelier’s principle.[42] This means
that the driving force for the full hydrogenation to ethane is
increased at higher pressure as the number of molecules and
concomitantly the pressure is reduced even more. A tempera-
ture-dependent increase of the selectivity can be attributed to
the lowered occupation of adsorbed molecules on the catalyst
surface resulting in less side reactions. In contrast, the highly
exothermic full hydrogenation to ethane is thermodynamically
less favored at higher temperatures, as the free energy for this
reaction becomes too low.
2.3.4. Selectivity for Ethane
The selectivity of the reaction to produce ethane describes the
tendency for the full hydrogenation of acetylene, which is un-
welcome for many reasons. Firstly, this process consumes more
hydrogen and lowers the yield of ethylene. Secondly, this exo-
thermic reaction produces even more heat, which impedes the
control of temperature in the reactor. An inverse behavior of
the selectivity for ethane—as observed for ethylene—is ex-
pected and was indeed observed (Figure S8). A pressure rise
showed the strongest influence because it promotes the for-
mation of ethane, whereas a temperature increase causes
lower ethane selectivity. This is understandable as full hydroge-
nation of acetylene is even more exothermic than semi-hydro-
genation. The influence of the third main effect, the hydrogen-
to-acetylene ratio r, is positive as expected because a higher
volume fraction of hydrogen promotes the formation of the
fully hydrogenated ethane. Furthermore, the three-factor inter-
action T  p  f leads to decreased ethane selectivity, which
can be related to the higher but insignificant effect of this pa-
rameter combination on ethylene selectivity. Last but not least,
the interaction T  f  r only slightly favors ethane formation.
2.3.5. Selectivity for C4H4+2x Hydrocarbons
The second undesired side reaction of the hydrogenation of
acetylene is the dimerization of two molecules containing two
carbon atoms and a varying number of hydrogen atoms. Feed
molecules, products and intermediate C2 compounds are po-
tential reaction partners, which principally form C4 hydrocar-
bons. Further dimerization steps would lead to higher hydro-
carbons as well as carbonaceous deposits. Here, all main ef-
fects have significant influence on the response value (Fig-
ure S9). The elevated pressure hinders the formation of higher
hydrocarbons as the full hydrogenation to ethane is further
promoted under these conditions. Additionally, the main ef-
fects of temperature and H2/C2H2 ratio, as well as the three-
factor interaction p  f  r negatively affect the selectivity for
C4 hydrocarbons. As the partial pressure of hydrogen in the re-
action mixture becomes higher, an increased hydrogen-to-
acetylene ratio promotes full hydrogenation, and thus lowers
the tendency of the reaction to form C4 hydrocarbons. The
temperature increase promotes desorption of the product mol-
ecules and lowers thereby the occupation of reactant mole-
cules on the surface, which results in less undesired side reac-
tions. Gas flow has the only positive influence on the selectivi-
ty for C4 hydrocarbon. This can be related to the surface cover-
age of acetylene and hydrogen, which is decreased at higher
flow rates. As hydrogen is more weakly adsorbed on the cata-
lyst surface than the hydrocarbons, the absolute amount of hy-
drogen atoms on the surface is even smaller. Hence, relatively
more hydrocarbons are present on the catalyst surface, which
might react by formation of a CC bond and enhance the
yield of C4 hydrocarbons.
2.3.6. Best Operating Points
The best operating points can be concluded from a statistical
evaluation focusing on the yield, which represents the relative
amount of acetylene molecules that are converted to ethylene.
Thus, it is a multiplied combination of acetylene conversion
and selectivity to ethylene. The highest yield and thereby the
best operating point was found at the higher values of tem-
perature (2008C), pressure (8 bar), and H2/C2H2 ratio (10), as
well as the lower flow level (19.6 mLmin1), for which a yield
of 44.2% was observed. Another good operating point was
found for the same levels of T (2008C), p (8 bar) and f
(19.6 mLmin1) but at the lower hydrogen-to-acetylene ratio of
6, which results in a yield of 43.2%. A small difference between
these operating points could be expected, as the influence of
this ratio was not significant for either conversion or selectivity.
For all other parameter combinations, the yield was below
18%, which emphasizes the importance of finding an optimal
operating point for GaPd2 as a promising catalytically active
material.

studied. First, mass transport limitations were examined for the
definition of optimal later investigated parameters and particle
size. The estimated apparent activation energies of 30(2) and
29(2) kJmol1 for GaPd and GaPd2, respectively, are at the
lower limit that has been reported for binary Ag–Pd or Sn–Pd
catalysts, but lower than what was observed for supported ele-
mental Pd catalysts (35–65 kJmol1). As the calculated activa-
tion barriers for binary intermetallic Pd-based compounds are
much higher than experimental values, direct comparisons are
neither quantitatively nor qualitatively meaningful. The biggest
difference to other Pd-based materials is the positive reaction
order for acetylene (0.89 at 2008C) in the case of GaPd2, which
demonstrates that there is no rate limitation of acetylene con-
centration and occupation on the catalyst surface. In contrast
to acetylene, the order of reaction with respect to H2 (0.49) for
the same catalyst is significantly smaller than values given in
the literature for other Pd catalysts, resulting in a total reaction
order for GaPd2 of 1.38, which is slightly higher than literature
data reported to date. In addition, the influences of the four
parameters temperature, pressure, H2/C2H2 ratio, and gas flow
were investigated by a 24 factorial experiment to determine
the most influencing parameters. Temperature and pressure
changes were found to affect all response values strongly. The
H2/C2H2 ratio was of limited impact and the parameter of least
influence was gas flow. By utilizing this factorial design, it was
possible to find optimal reaction conditions of 2008C, 8 bar,
19.6 mLmin1 gas flow and a H2/C2H2 ratio of 10 depending on
the purpose, such as high specific activity or selectivity for
ethylene.
Experimental Section
Preparation
GaPd and GaPd2 with Ga/Pd atom ratios of 1:1 and 1:2, respective-
ly, were prepared under protective argon atmosphere in a high-fre-
quency furnace (Httinger TIG 5/300) by melting the appropriate
amounts of Pd (ChemPur, 99.95%) and Ga (ChemPur, 99.999%) in
glassy carbon crucibles. The subsequent annealing of the 1 g
ingots was achieved in evacuated quartz glass ampoules at 9008C
over 13 days. The single-phase nature of the samples was demon-
strated by powder X-ray diffraction on a Huber image plate Guinier
camera G670 with CuKa1 radiation (l=1.540598 ) and a Ge mon-
ochromator. SEM investigations were conducted on a Philips XL 30
scanning electron microscope.
Catalytic Studies
The catalytic measurements were conducted in two separate plug–
flow reactors. For measuring the reaction kinetics, a quartz glass
tube reactor (GR) with an inner diameter of 7 mm was used. The
catalyst bed (catalyst weight 0.28–52.10 mg) was fixed in the reac-
tor by a sintered quartz glass frit. This setup was utilized at ambi-
ent pressure and at 2008C. For determining the influence of the
process parameters, the catalytic measurements were performed
using a stainless steel reactor (SR) in a microactivity reference
system from PID Eng&Tech (Madrid, Spain). The inner diameter of
the reactor tube was 9.1 mm. Here, the catalyst (0.68–6.70 mg) was
fixed in the reactor by an exchangeable quartz glass fleece in the
middle of the isothermal zone. The gauge pressure and tempera-
ture of this reactor setup was varied over the ranges of 0–8 bar
and 50–2008C, respectively. To prevent sintering of the intermetal-
lic catalyst particles and to exclude the formation of hot spots
during the experiments, 150 and 420 mg of catalytically inactive
boron nitride (Alfa Aesar, 99.5%, 325 mesh) were used to dilute
the catalyst bed in the GR and SR, respectively. The second reason
for using a filling material was the enhancement of the gas-flow
properties during the catalytic conversion of acetylene, whereby
plug–flow conditions were generated. For kinetic studies (GR),
GaPd2 was crushed in an agate mortar, sieved to the appropriate
particle size fraction, diluted with boron nitride and added into the
reactor inside an argon-filled glove box (O2 and H2O levels
<1 ppm). This precaution was aimed at protecting the catalyst
from oxidation so that no pre-reduction was necessary. For the pa-
rameter tests (SR), all preparation steps were completed in air. To
exclude partial oxidation of the intermetallic surface, the catalyst
was pre-reduced at 4008C for 5 h using a hydrogen flow of
20 mLmin1 (10 vol.%) in helium.
The reactants were supplied and mixed using Bronkhorst mass
flow controllers. For the kinetic measurements a total gas flow of
30 mLmin1 (GR) was used, whereas for the parameter tests (SR)
the values were varied in a range of 20–80 mLmin1. The initial gas
mixture consisted of 0.5 vol.% C2H2 (Praxair, 2.6, 5 vol.% in He, 4.6),
5 vol.% H2 (Praxair, 5.0), 50 vol.% C2H4 (Westfalen Gas, 3.5) and He
(Praxair, 5.0). A Varian CP 4900 micro gas chromatograph was used
to analyze the product gas stream at 5 min intervals on three col-
umns in parallel. A 5  molecular sieve column was used to sepa-
rate hydrogen and helium from the feed gas as well as nitrogen
and oxygen, which would be detectable in the case of small leaks
in the experimental set-up. Acetylene, ethylene and ethane were
separated on an alumina column. A CP-Sil 5 CB column was used
to separate the higher hydrocarbons, which were n-butane, 1-
butene, trans- and cis-2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene. Higher C6 and
C8 hydrocarbons were not quantified as their concentrations are
too low and thus, not significantly detectable.
For a basic analysis of the catalytic performance, the conversion of
acetylene (X) and the specific activity of the intermetallic catalyst
(A) were calculated. Additionally, the selectivities for ethylene (S),
ethane (SC2H6) and the C4 hydrocarbons (SHC) were determined,
which are of greater interest for the evaluation of the parameter
tests.
The percent conversion X was calculated by Equation (8), where fin
and fout are the volume fractions of acetylene in the feed and
product stream, respectively:
X ¼ fin  fout

The specific activity was applied to compare various catalyst mate-
rials or the same catalyst with different masses and was calculated

T (258C) and the universal gas constant R (8.3144 Jmol1K1). As all

catalytic tests were performed in a 100-fold excess of ethylene
compared to acetylene, the small change of this volume fraction
cannot be measured accurately enough and thus, cannot be used
to calculate the ethylene selectivity. The calculation of this selectivi-
ty is based on the assumption that only acetylene, which is hydro-
genated to ethylene, can be further hydrogenated to ethane. The
selectivities were calculated by Equations (11)–(13) where the
volume fractions of C2H6 and the sum of all C4H4+2x hydrocarbons
were taken into account because these compounds are the main
by-products and strongly affect other selectivities.

Mass Transport Limitation
To test for mass transport limitation, particle size and gas flow
were varied on two levels. The smaller particle fraction was sieved
to 20–32 mm and the larger one to 80–100 mm. The particle size
was monitored by SEM imaging. In the following sections, these
fractions are denoted as 26 and 90 mm, respectively. The total gas
flows were 40 and 80 mLmin1, respectively.
Estimation of Apparent Activation Energy
The apparent activation energy is an important intrinsic property
of a catalytic material, which allows different catalyst materials to
be compared in terms of their catalytic performance in the same
reaction. The catalytic tests in this work were conducted as isother-
mal steps in the temperature range 140–2008C, which allows esti-
mation of the apparent activation energy based on the Arrhenius
equation with the pre-factor Ai and the universal gas constant R
[Eq. (14)]:

which describes the exponential coherence of the temperature T
with activation energy EA and reaction rate constant k.
Determination of Reaction Orders for C2H2 and H2
For the determination of the orders of reaction of acetylene and
hydrogen, catalytic studies were conducted at 2008C and ambient
pressure with a varying excess (1–10-fold) of one of the reactants,
and the conversion of the other measured. This was necessary to
enable the application of the following equation [Eq. (15)]:
ri ¼ k ca
C2H2 cb
H2
ð15Þ
where ri is the reaction rate, k is the reaction rate constant, a and
b are the reaction orders, and cC2H2 and cH2 represent the concen-
tration of acetylene and hydrogen, respectively. Because the con-
version of the corresponding reactant never exceeded 2%, precise
and correct measurements were guaranteed.

Kinetic Parameters for the Selective
Hydrogenation of Acetylene on GaPd2
and GaPd
Laws and order: The kinetics of the
semi-hydrogenation of acetylene are in-
vestigated for intermetallic compounds
GaPd2 and GaPd. The apparent activa-
tion energies and orders of reaction of
H2 and C2H2 are experimentally deter-
mined. GaPd2 is shown to be the first
binary catalyst material, which showed
a positive reaction order (0.89) with re-
spect to acetylene at 2008C. A 24 facto-
rial experiment is applied and allows
optimization of ethylene yields.
