rate of ~10−7 M⊙year–1 for this system in
outburst (25). A smaller distance of ~80 pc
would be required to bring SS Cyg's peak
accretion rate in line with typical values for DNe
(25). Using this distance and an accretion rate of
~5 × 10−9 M⊙year–1 during the rise, we obtain
a flux of ~0.7 mJy, in agreement with the
observations (the uncertainty of the correlation
is a factor of ~2). However, if the HST distance
is correct and the accretion rate is indeed as high
as ~10−7 M⊙year–1, we have to assume an
accretion rate during the rise of ~5 × 10−8 M⊙
yr–1. The predicted radio flux is then ~4 mJy,
which is still roughly consistent with the mea-
sured values. In this case, the jet emission of SS
Cyg, especially during the optical plateau, may
correspond to the highest accreting states in
XRBs and not to the hard state. For such high
accretion rates, jet launching for CVs has been
suggested by Soker and Lasota (5).
The similarities in the radio luminosity, as
well as in the relation of the radio emission to the
accretion states, suggest that we did observe a jet
from a nonmagnetic DN. The detection of a jet in
a DN with similar disc/jet coupling as that seen in
XRBs suggests that there may be a common jet-
launching mechanism in CVs and XRBs. The radii
of WDs lie roughly halfway in log-space be-
tween those seen in young stellar objects (YSOs)
and those of black holes, so WDs connect YSOs to
XRBs. With the exception of source classes similar
to soft-state XRBs, all accretion-powered jet-
emitting sources from YSOs (26), via AGN
(27) to gamma-ray bursts (28), seem to have a
jet-launching efficiency (that is, the ratio of the
jet power to the power liberated in the accretion
flow) of ~10%. This suggests that there may be
a common disc/jet coupling in all accreting
objects from YSOs to gamma ray bursts.

Identification of Non-Precious Metal
Alloy Catalysts for Selective
Hydrogenation of Acetylene
Felix Studt,1,2 Frank Abild-Pedersen,1,2 Thomas Bligaard,1 Rasmus Z. Sørensen,3

The removal of trace acetylene from ethylene is performed industrially by palladium hydrogenation
catalysts (often modified with silver) that avoid the hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane. In an effort to
identify catalysts based on less expensive and more available metals, density functional calculations
were performed that identified relations in heats of adsorption of hydrocarbon molecules and
fragments on metal surfaces. This analysis not only verified the facility of known catalysts but identified
nickel-zinc alloys as alternatives. Experimental studies demonstrated that these alloys dispersed on an
oxide support were selective for acetylene hydrogenation at low pressures.
T
he ethylene used in the production of poly-
mers needs to contain less than a few parts
per million of acetylene in order not to af-
fect the polymerization process (1, 2). Ethylene is
produced in steam crackers and typically con-
tains on the order of 1% of acetylene (3), which is
removed by hydrogenation, but the hydrogena-
tion process should not convert ethylene to ethane.
The most common industrially used catalyst for
this process is based on Pd modified by the ad-
dition of Ag (4). This system leaves ample room
for improvement, particularly in terms of price.
We show how alternative alloy catalysts for this
reaction have been identified. Density functional
theory (DFT) calculations identified why Ag pro-
motes the selectivity of the Pd for this process.
We then developed scaling relations between dif-
ferent adsorption energies of reactants and inter-
mediates and used that analysis to identify a
descriptor for both catalytic activity and selectiv-
ity. We screened a number of alloys as potential
catalysts and singled out Ni-Zn intermetallic com-
pounds as promising candidates. Subsequent syn-
thesis,characterization,and catalytic testing showed
these systems to have a high selectivity.
Following Sheth et al. (5–7), we first con-
sidered acetylene hydrogenation over Pd(111)
(Fig. 1A). The process is facile (under appropri-
ate conditions); acetylene adsorbs exothermally,
and the transition-state energies for the first and
second hydrogenation steps are both below the
energy of gas-phase acetylene. Once ethylene is
formed on the surface, it can desorb or react
further; the latter outcome will lead to the
unwanted formation of ethane. Ethylene from
the gas phase can also adsorb on the surface and
has the same possibility of further hydrogenation
to ethane. A selective catalyst that hydrogenates
only acetylene should have an activation barrier
for the hydrogenation of ethylene that is greater
than the barrier for desorption. For Pd(111), the
two barriers are comparable. For PdAg(111), the
barrier for desorption is smaller (Fig. 1A). How-
ever, the adsorption of acetylene is still sufficiently
exothermic that its hydrogenation is facile. This
analysis explains the basis for the addition of Ag
to Pd in the industrial catalyst (4–7). Ag primarily
changes the stability of adsorbed acetylene and

ethylene, rather than activation energies. The
metal-independence of the activation barriers for
hydrogenation has also been observed for a num-
ber of other hydrogenation reactions (8), which
suggests that the stabilities of the two adsorbed
species are the dominant parameters determining
the potential activity and selectivity of the cat-
alyst, as suggested previously by Bond (9).
The use of the acetylene and ethylene heats of
adsorption, DEC2H2 and DEC2H4, as the parame-
ters determining the turnover rate and selectivity
is a large simplification. However, calculating
these energies for a large number of systems is
still demanding. We can simplify this problem
considerably by introducing scaling relations be-
tween these adsorption energies and the adsorption
energies of even simpler molecules, as illustrated
in Fig. 2A. Based on calculations for a number of
transition-metal surfaces, we find that the acety-
lene and ethylene adsorption energies scale with
the methyl adsorption energies on the same me-
tals. Such scaling relations were first established
for CHx molecules with differing numbers of H
atoms (10). The results of Fig. 2A show that
scaling relations also exist for more complicated
molecules that are of interest in heterogeneous
catalysis. The slope of the scaling relations is 4 for
C2H2 and 2 for C2H4. This result can be viewed as
a manifestation of bond order conservation for the
C atoms; adsorbed CH3 forms one s bond to the
surface, whereas C2H2 forms four s bonds and
C2H4 forms two. In this sense, the approach is
related to that of Shustorovich and Bell (11).
A good catalyst is characterized by having a
high stability of adsorbed acetylene (DEC2H2 as
negative as possible) and a low stability of ethyl-
ene (DEC2H4 as positive as possible). The former
determines the overall rate of acetylene removal,
whereas the latter determines the selectivity. The
results in Fig. 2A show that DEC2H2 and DEC2H4
are correlated, and one cannot just find a metal
with a weak ethylene bond and a strong acetylene
bond; the optimum catalyst is a compromise.
In Fig. 2A, we have illustrated the values of
DEC2H2 and DECH3, where the turnover rate is on
the order of 1 s−1 at a total pressure of 1 bar, a
temperature of 375 K, and 1% acetylene in the feed.
More positive values of DECH3 should give lower
rates, whereas increasing the temperature will move
the value of DECH3 corresponding to a turnover rate
of 1 s−1 to more positive values. In Fig. 2A, we also
show the values of DEC2H4 and DECH3, where the
rates of ethylene desorption and hydrogenation are
comparable. A larger value of DECH3 will now corre-
spond to a more selective catalyst, because the acti-
vation barrier for the hydrogenation of ethylene,
Ehyd2, will be greater than the desorption activation
energy, –DEC2H4. This analysis leaves an optimum
range of values of DECH3. Because the DFT values
used in establishing this range have an inherent un-
certainty, and the model we used is simple, we al-
lowed for a region around these values in our further
search for new catalysts, as illustrated in Fig. 2B.
We screened about 70 different bimetallic
compounds made from the elements for methyl
binding energies (Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Pd, Pt, Ag, Au,
Zn, Cd, Hg, Ga, Tl, Ge, Sn, and Pb) (Fig. 2B). A
number of alloys fall in the region of interest.
Several PdAg alloys are there, as expected, and
adding more Ag increases the selectivity; in fact,
the commercial catalysts contain up to 80% of
Ag (4). We also identified Pd-Ga, Pd-Pb, and
Pd-Au alloys, which have recently been shown to
have a good activity and selectivity for this pro-
cess (12–15). Because one of the problems with

respectively, are highlighted for Pd.

the ethylene binding energy is less than
the barrier for further hydrogenation (blue)
and where the reactivity of the acetylene

on Ni and Rh has been accounted for by
specifically choosing the methyl binding site
to be on top of Ni and Rh (even though the
most stable adsorption site is threefold),
which corresponds to the site of adsorp-
tion of the carbons in ethylene. (B) Price

the Pd-based catalysts is that they are extremely
expensive, we have included the cost of raw ma-
terials of the catalysts as a parameter in Fig. 2B.
Apart from Cu, which is known to be selective
(16, 17), Co-Ga, Fe-Zn, and Ni-Zn alloys stand
out in this plot as particularly interesting. We
have also calculated the stability of the different
alloys, and here the Co-Ga and Ni-Zn alloys
stand out, with heats of formation that are very
exothermic, below –0.9 eV (87 kJ/mol). We have
chosen the cheaper of the two, the Ni-Zn com-
pounds, for further study.
Both NiZn and NiZn3 are predicted to have
good selectivity (Fig. 2B). For NiZn3, we have
not performed complete DFT calculations, be-
cause the correct structure according to the phase
diagram (18) should be Ni16Zn53, but for the
NiZn alloy we have made a complete DFTcalcu-
lation of the reaction path for the close-packed
(110) surface on the experimentally observed
body-centered cubic (bcc) structure. The full po-
tential energy diagram for the reaction (Fig. 1B)
shows that NiZn should be active and quite se-
lective. In Fig. 3, the acetylene and ethylene
adsorption structures on the NiZn intermetallic
compound are shown. The adsorbents bind to the
Ni sites, showing that the change in adsorption
properties is not the result of bonding to the Zn.
Rather, Zn changes the electronic properties of Ni
in the surface (19, 20). We have also examined
the segregation properties of the NiZn inter-
metallic compound. Segregation of Ni and Zn to
the surface of NiZn in the bcc (110) structure
costs 1.23 and 0.33 eV, respectively. This result
means that the NiZn bimetallic compound is
quite stable, which is expected for such a highly
ordered alloy (21, 22). We have concentrated
here on the close-packed surfaces. Steps and
other low-coordinated sites on catalyst surfaces
will bind ethylene and acetylene more strongly
and would be able to break the C-C bonds (23).
We therefore expect those sites to be poisoned
here.
Although calculations can point to possible
candidates, many properties apart from activity
and selectivity determine whether a particular ma-
terial is suited as a catalyst. We have already
mentioned intrinsic stability and segregation
properties, and we can add resistance to coking
and poisoning by other molecules in the reaction
mixture, sintering properties, particle size dis-
tribution, and the ability to dissociate hydrogen.
For example, Cu has been found to deactivate
rapidly (24, 25). Thus, experiments are needed to
verify the suitability of a given candidate material.
We synthesized a series of Ni-Zn alloy cat-
alysts on MgAl2O4 spinel supports that had a Zn
content between 45 and 75% and tested their
selectivity in the hydrogenation of acetylene in a
gas mixture of 1.33% ethylene, 0.0667% acety-
lene, and 0.67% hydrogen (26). The ethane pro-
duction as a function of acetylene conversion is
shown in Fig. 4. A highly selective catalyst will
have very low ethane production, even at high
conversion, where the amount of acetylene in the
reactants is small. We compared different Ni-Zn
catalysts with the well-established Pd-Ag system.
Pure Ni has rather poor selectivity, as also ob-
served for pure Pd. The Pd-Ag alloy, on the other
hand, shows a very good selectivity under high
conversion. As expected from Fig. 2B, the selec-
tivity increases substantially as the amount of Zn is
increased. The Ni-Zn catalyst with the highest Zn
content had an even greater selectivity than the
best Pd-Ag catalyst we tested. The Ni-Zn catalysts
we studied appeared to be more stable than has
been reported for Cu (23–25). We know of no
previous mention of NiZn alloy catalysts for selec-
tive hydrogenation. There are reports of Ni cata-
lysts supported on ZnAl2O4 spinels (27), but these
catalysts are reported to not contain a NiZn alloy.
The width of the interesting range of methyl
binding energies in Fig. 2B is quite broad, ~0.5 eV
,
which is relatively large compared to both typical
DFT– generalized gradient approximation errors
(~0.2 eV) and the scatter in scaling plots such as
Fig. 2A (~0.15 eV). It shows that even with the
present accuracy of our theoretical treatment, it
can be used as guidance toward new catalysts.
