How do single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions, and what are the essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts in terms of reaction conditions, metal properties, and specific advantages over traditional catalysts, including their ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems?
