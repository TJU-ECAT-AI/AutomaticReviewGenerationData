[1] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy,we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."

1.Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by substantially lowering the energy barrier to hydrogen uptake and subsequent desorption. This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene. Very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals. Minority Pd atoms (1%) in a Cu surface activate hydrogen, which then populates bare Cu areas (99%) where it is weakly bound and effective for hydrogenation, yielding a bifunctional surface with different regions facilitating different steps in the reaction. From a practical application standpoint, the small amounts of precious metal required to produce SAAs generates a very attractive alternative to most traditional bimetallic catalysts.

1.单原子合金，特别是嵌入铜表面的钯原子，通过大幅度降低氢气吸收和后续脱附的能量障碍，增强了选择性氢化反应中的催化性能。这种在钯原子位点的容易氢气解离和与铜的弱结合，使得对苯乙烯和乙炔的氢化非常有选择性。非常小量的孤立的催化活性金属原子可以显著影响较不反应性金属的催化性质。在铜表面的少数钯原子（1％）激活氢气，然后填充裸露的铜区域（99％），在那里它与铜弱结合，对氢化有效，产生具有不同区域促进反应不同步骤的双功能表面。从实际应用的角度来看，生产SAA所需的少量贵金属产生了一种非常有吸引力的替代大多数传统双金属催化剂的方案。
