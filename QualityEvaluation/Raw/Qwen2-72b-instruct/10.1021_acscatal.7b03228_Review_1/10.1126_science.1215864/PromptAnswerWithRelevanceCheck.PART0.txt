[1] "Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis."
[2] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy,we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."
[3] "This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone."
[4] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals."
[5] "Minority Pd atoms (1%) in a Cu surface activate hydrogen,which then populates bare Cu areas (99%) where it is weakly bound and effective for hydrogena- tion, yielding a bifunctional surface with different regions facilitating different steps in the reaction."
[6] "From a practical application standpoint, the small amounts of precious metal required to produce SAAs generates a very attractive alternative to most traditional bimetallic catalysts."
