[1] "Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis."
[2] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy,we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."
[3] "This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone."
[4] "The Pd/Cu SAA surface displays a rather uncommon energetic landscape for the dissociation and chemisorption of hydrogen."
[5] "The net effect is a surface that can easily activate H2 dissociation (as evidenced by efficient uptake at 85 K) but also bind it weakly."
[6] "The Pd/Cu SAA also catalyzed the hydrogenation of acetylene to ethene with high selectivity."
[7] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals."
[8] "From a practical application standpoint, the small amounts of precious metal required to produce SAAs generates a very attractive alternative to most traditional bimetallic catalysts."

1.Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by lowering the energy barrier for hydrogen uptake and subsequent desorption, facilitating facile hydrogen dissociation and weak binding of intermediates. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include the ability to easily activate hydrogen dissociation while binding it weakly, which breaks scaling rules and improves selectivity. SAAs offer advantages over traditional catalysts by requiring smaller amounts of precious metals, making them a more attractive alternative. The unique energetic landscape of Pd/Cu SAAs allows for efficient and selective hydrogenation of molecules like styrene and acetylene.

1.单原子合金，特别是嵌入铜表面的钯原子，通过降低氢吸收和后续解吸的能量障碍，促进氢的容易解离和中间体的弱结合，从而在选择性氢化反应中增强催化性能。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括容易激活氢解离，同时弱结合氢，这打破了比例规则，提高了选择性。SAA相对于传统催化剂的优势在于需要更少的贵金属，使其成为更具吸引力的选择。Pd/Cu SAA的独特能量景观允许有效和选择性地氢化像苯乙烯和乙炔这样的分子。
