[1] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy,we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."
[2] "This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone."
[3] "The Pd/Cu SAA surface displays a rather uncommon energetic landscape for the dissociation and chemisorption of hydrogen."
[4] "The net effect is a surface that can easily activate H2 dissociation (as evidenced by efficient uptake at 85 K) but also bind it weakly."
[5] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals."
[6] "From a practical application standpoint, the small amounts of precious metal required to produce SAAs generates a very attractive alternative to most traditional bimetallic catalysts."

1.Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by substantially lowering the energy barrier for hydrogen uptake and subsequent desorption. This facilitates facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu, allowing for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene compared to pure Cu or Pd metal alone. The Pd/Cu SAA surface presents an uncommon energetic landscape for hydrogen dissociation and chemisorption, resulting in a surface that can easily activate H2 dissociation while also binding it weakly. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include the use of very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms, which can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals. From a practical standpoint, the small amounts of precious metal required to produce SAAs make them a very attractive alternative to most traditional bimetallic catalysts.

1.单原子合金，特别是嵌入铜表面的钯原子，通过大幅降低氢气吸收和后续解吸的能量障碍，增强了选择性氢化反应中的催化性能。这促进了钯原子位点的氢气容易解离和与铜的弱结合，使得与纯铜或钯金属相比，对苯乙烯和乙炔的氢化具有很高的选择性。Pd/Cu SAA表面呈现出氢气解离和化学吸附的非常规能量景观，导致一个表面可以轻松激活H2解离，同时也能弱结合氢气。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括使用非常少量的孤立的催化活性金属原子，这些原子可以显著影响较不反应性金属的催化性质。从实用的角度来看，生产SAA所需的少量贵金属使它们成为大多数传统双金属催化剂的非常有吸引力的替代品。
