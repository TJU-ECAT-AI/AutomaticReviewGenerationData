[1] "Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis."
[2] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy,we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."
[3] "This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone."
[4] "The Pd/Cu SAA surface displays a rather uncommon energetic landscape for the dissociation and chemisorption of hydrogen."
[5] "Unlike Pd, the pristine Cu(111) surface is inert toward the dissociation of unactivated H2 in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) because of the dissociation barrier on the order of 0.4 eV."
[6] "Critically, we find that a small quantity of Pd atoms in the Cu surface makes the SAA active toward the uptake of H2,which can dissociate on the Pd monoatomic entities and then spill over onto the bare Cu(111) terraces."
[7] "The net effect is a surface that can easily activate H2 dissociation (as evidenced by efficient uptake at 85 K) but also bind it weakly."
[8] "The Pd/Cu SAA also catalyzed the hydrogenation of acetylene to ethene with high selectivity."
[9] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals."
[10] "Minority Pd atoms (1%) in a Cu surface activate hydrogen,which then populates bare Cu areas (99%) where it is weakly bound and effective for hydrogenation, yielding a bifunctional surface with different regions facilitating different steps in the reaction."
[11] "From a practical application standpoint, the small amounts of precious metal required to produce SAAs generates a very attractive alternative to most traditional bimetallic catalysts."

1.Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by lowering the energy barrier for hydrogen uptake and subsequent desorption, facilitating facile hydrogen dissociation and weak binding of intermediates. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include the use of a less reactive host metal (Cu) that binds hydrogen weakly and an active metal (Pd) that activates hydrogen efficiently. The specific advantages over traditional catalysts include the ability to break scaling rules, improve selectivity across various catalyst systems, and use very small amounts of precious metals, making them a cost-effective alternative to traditional bimetallic catalysts.

1.特别是嵌入铜表面的钯单原子合金，通过降低氢吸收和随后脱附的能量障碍，促进氢的容易解离和中间体的弱结合，从而在选择性氢化反应中增强催化性能。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括使用弱结合氢的较不反应的宿主金属（铜）和有效激活氢的活性金属（钯）。与传统催化剂相比，其具体优势包括打破比例规则的能力，提高各种催化剂系统的选择性，并使用非常少量的贵金属，使其成为传统双金属催化剂的经济高效的替代品。
