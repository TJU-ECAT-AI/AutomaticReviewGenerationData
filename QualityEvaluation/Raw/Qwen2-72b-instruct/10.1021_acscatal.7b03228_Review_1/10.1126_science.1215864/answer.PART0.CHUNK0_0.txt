[1] "Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis."
[2] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy,we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."
[3] "This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone."
[4] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals."
[5] "Minority Pd atoms (1%) in a Cu surface activate hydrogen,which then populates bare Cu areas (99%) where it is weakly bound and effective for hydrogena- tion, yielding a bifunctional surface with different regions facilitating different steps in the reaction."
[6] "From a practical application standpoint, the small amounts of precious metal required to produce SAAs generates a very attractive alternative to most traditional bimetallic catalysts."

1.Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by substantially lowering the energy barrier to hydrogen uptake and subsequent desorption. This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include the facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates, which are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis. Compared with traditional catalysts, SAAs require very small quantities of precious metal, making them a very attractive alternative. They can break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems by providing a bifunctional surface with different regions facilitating different steps in the reaction.

1.单原子合金，特别是嵌入铜表面的钯原子，通过大幅降低氢气吸收和后续解吸的能量障碍，增强了选择性氢化反应中的催化性能。这种在钯原子位点的容易氢气解离和与铜的弱结合，使得对苯乙烯和乙炔的氢化非常有选择性。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括反应物的容易解离和中间体的弱结合，这是高效和选择性催化的关键要求。与传统催化剂相比，SAAs只需要极少量的贵金属，这使它们成为一个非常有吸引力的替代品。它们可以通过提供一个具有不同区域促进反应不同步骤的双功能表面，打破尺度规则，提高各种催化剂系统的选择性。
