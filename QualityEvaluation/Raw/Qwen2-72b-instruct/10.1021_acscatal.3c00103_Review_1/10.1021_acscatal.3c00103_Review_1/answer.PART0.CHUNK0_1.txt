[1] "The reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2."
[2] "However, whether the dissociative adsorption process or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-controlling step of PDH process remains to be confirmed."

1.The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is widely recognized for describing the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. It divides the process into three stages: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species, leading to the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2. There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by leaving a critical aspect of the reaction kinetics unresolved, which is essential for optimizing the reaction conditions and catalyst design.

1.1934年提出的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制被广泛认可，用于描述丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程的动力学。它将整个过程分为三个部分：(i) 烷烃的解离吸附，其中一个氢原子被消除；(ii) 从吸附的物种中提取β-H，同时形成H2和CC双键；(iii) 烯烃和H2的解吸。然而，关于PDH过程中是解离吸附过程还是β-H的提取是速率控制步骤，仍然存在争议。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它留下了一个关键的反应动力学方面未解决，这对于优化反应条件和催化剂设计至关重要。
