                The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), proposed in 1934 \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\], is widely acknowledged for describing the kinetics of the PDH process. It divides the process into three stages: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species, leading to the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2. The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction impacts our understanding of the PDH process by leaving a critical aspect of the reaction kinetics unresolved, which is essential for optimizing the reaction conditions and catalyst design \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\]. Some studies suggest that the CH cleavage steps are the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin is the rate-controlling step \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. This uncertainty affects the interpretation of experimental results and the development of theoretical models. For example, DFT calculations on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. However, the positive effect of Sn on catalytic activity is explained by the facile desorption of propylene, which hinders further dehydrogenation of the adsorbed propylene. This suggests that the rate-controlling step may depend on the catalyst and reaction conditions \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the unresolved debate over the rate-controlling step in the PDH process, there is a pressing need for advanced experimental techniques and computational methods to elucidate this critical aspect. Future research efforts might focus on developing catalysts with tailored active sites that can selectively enhance either the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction step, thereby optimizing the PDH reaction. Additionally, the exploration of novel catalysts beyond Pt and PtSn alloys, such as bimetallic or multimetallic systems, could provide new insights into the PDH mechanism and potentially lead to more efficient and selective catalysts. The integration of in situ spectroscopic methods with kinetic modeling could also shed light on the dynamic behavior of the PDH reaction under realistic conditions, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the reaction pathway and the role of the catalyst.

                1934年提出的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制广泛被认可为描述丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程动力学的机制\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\]。它将过程分为三个阶段：(i)烷烃的解离吸附，其中一个氢原子被消除；(ii)从吸附物种中提取β-H，形成H2和CC双键；(iii)烯烃和H2的脱附。关于PDH反应中解离吸附过程或β-H提取是否为速率控制步骤的持续辩论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它留下了反应动力学的关键方面未解决，这对于优化反应条件和催化剂设计至关重要\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\]。一些研究表明，CH裂解步骤是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则提出，烷烃的解离吸附是速率控制步骤\[10.1021/cr5002436\]。这种不确定性影响了实验结果的解释和理论模型的开发。例如，PD反应期间在Pt、Pt3Sn和Pt2Sn(111)表面上的DFT计算揭示，烷烃的解离吸附是速率限制步骤\[10.1021/cr5002436\]。然而，Sn对催化活性的正面影响被解释为丙烯的容易脱附，这阻碍了吸附丙烯的进一步脱氢。这表明速率控制步骤可能取决于催化剂和反应条件\[10.1021/cr5002436\]。

                综合理解与未来展望：鉴于PDH过程中速率控制步骤的未解辩论，迫切需要先进的实验技术和计算方法来阐明这一关键方面。未来的研究努力可能集中在开发具有定制活性位点的催化剂，这些催化剂可以有选择地增强解离吸附或β-H提取步骤，从而优化PDH反应。此外，除了Pt和PtSn合金之外，探索新型催化剂，如双金属或多金属系统，可以为PDH机制提供新的见解，并可能导向更高效和选择性的催化剂。原位光谱方法与动力学建模的结合也可以揭示PDH反应在实际条件下的动态行为，提供对反应途径和催化剂作用的更全面理解。
