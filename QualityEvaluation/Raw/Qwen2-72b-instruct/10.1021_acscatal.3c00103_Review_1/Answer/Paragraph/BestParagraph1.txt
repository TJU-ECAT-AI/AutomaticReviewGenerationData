The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), proposed in 1934 \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\], is widely acknowledged for describing the kinetics of the PDH process. It divides the process into three stages: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species, leading to the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2. There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\]. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by leaving a critical aspect of the reaction kinetics unresolved, which is essential for optimizing the reaction conditions and catalyst design.

                Some studies suggest that the CH cleavage steps are the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin is the rate-controlling step \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. This uncertainty affects the interpretation of experimental results and the development of theoretical models. For example, DFT calculations on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. However, the positive effect of Sn on catalytic activity is explained by the facile desorption of propylene, which hinders further dehydrogenation of the adsorbed propylene. This suggests that the rate-controlling step may depend on the catalyst and reaction conditions.

                Propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90010-0\]. The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining. The last step, desorption of π-bonded propene, has a comparatively low activation energy. The difference in negative reaction order, with respect to hydrogen, between platinum and its diluted alloys reflects a lower steady-state θH on Pt atoms surrounded by Au atoms vis--vis Pt atoms on a Pt surface \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90010-0\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing more accurate theoretical models that can predict the rate-controlling step under various reaction conditions and catalyst compositions. This could involve the integration of machine learning algorithms with DFT calculations to enhance the predictive power of computational models. Additionally, experimental techniques that can provide real-time insights into the reaction mechanism, such as in-situ spectroscopy, could be employed to validate theoretical predictions and further elucidate the role of different catalysts in the PDH process. The development of new catalysts that can selectively enhance the desired rate-controlling step could also be a promising direction for future research, potentially leading to more efficient and sustainable PDH processes.
