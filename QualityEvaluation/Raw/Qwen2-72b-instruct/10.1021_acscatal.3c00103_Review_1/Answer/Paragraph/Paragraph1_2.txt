                The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), proposed in 1934, is widely acknowledged for describing the kinetics of the PDH process \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\]. It divides the process into three stages: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species, leading to the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2. There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\]. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by leaving a critical aspect of the reaction kinetics unresolved, which is essential for optimizing the reaction conditions and catalyst design. DFT calculations on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. However, the positive effect of Sn on catalytic activity is explained by the facile desorption of propylene, which hinders further dehydrogenation of the adsorbed propylene, suggesting that the rate-controlling step may depend on the catalyst and reaction conditions \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the unresolved debate on the rate-controlling step in the PDH process, there is a pressing need for advanced experimental techniques and theoretical models to elucidate this critical aspect. Future research might focus on developing catalysts that can selectively enhance the rate of the β-H extraction or the dissociative adsorption, depending on which is found to be the rate-limiting step. Additionally, the integration of in situ spectroscopic methods with computational studies could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the PDH mechanism, potentially leading to the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for PDH.

                1934年提出的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制广泛被认可，用于描述丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程的动力学\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\]。它将过程分为三个阶段：（i）烷烃的解离吸附，其中一个氢原子被消除；（ii）从吸附物种中提取β-H，导致H2和CC双键的形成；以及（iii）烯烃和H2的解吸。关于PDH反应中解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争议持续存在\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\]。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使反应动力学的关键方面未解决，这对于优化反应条件和催化剂设计至关重要。在PDH反应期间对Pt，Pt3Sn和Pt2Sn（111）表面进行的DFT计算揭示了解离吸附烷烃是速率限制步骤\[10.1021/cr5002436\]。然而，Sn对催化活性的正面影响可以通过丙烯的容易解吸来解释，这阻碍了吸附丙烯的进一步脱氢，表明速率控制步骤可能取决于催化剂和反应条件\[10.1021/cr5002436\]。

                综合理解与未来展望：鉴于PDH过程中速率控制步骤的未解争议，迫切需要先进的实验技术和理论模型来阐明这一关键方面。未来的研究可能集中在开发能够选择性增强β-H提取或解离吸附速率的催化剂，具体取决于哪一步被发现是速率限制步骤。此外，将原位光谱方法与计算研究相结合，可以提供PDH机制的更全面理解，可能引导设计更高效和选择性的PDH催化剂。
