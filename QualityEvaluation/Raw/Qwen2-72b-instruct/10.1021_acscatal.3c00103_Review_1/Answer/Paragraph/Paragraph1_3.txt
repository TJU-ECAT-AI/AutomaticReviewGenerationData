                The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), proposed in 1934 \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\], is widely acknowledged for describing the kinetics of the PDH process. It divides the process into three stages: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species, leading to the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2. The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\] leaves a critical aspect of the reaction kinetics unresolved, which is essential for optimizing the reaction conditions and catalyst design. Some studies suggest that the CH cleavage steps are the rate-limiting step \[10.1021/cr5002436\], while others propose that the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin is the rate-controlling step \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects the interpretation of experimental results and the development of theoretical models.

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the unresolved debate on the rate-controlling step in the PDH process, there is a need for advanced experimental techniques and computational methods to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Future research efforts might focus on developing catalysts that can selectively enhance the rate of the proposed rate-controlling step, whether it is the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction. This could involve the synthesis of novel bimetallic catalysts or the modification of existing ones to alter the adsorption properties of propane and the extraction of β-H. Additionally, the development of in situ spectroscopic methods could provide real-time insights into the reaction intermediates and help resolve the ongoing debate. The integration of experimental data with computational models, such as density functional theory (DFT), could also contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the PDH mechanism.

                1934年提出的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制 \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\] 广泛被认可为描述丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程动力学的机制。它将过程分为三个阶段：(i) 烷烃的解离吸附，其中一个氢原子被消除；(ii) 从吸附物种中提取β-H，形成H2和CC双键；(iii) 烯烃和H2的脱附。关于PDH反应中解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的持续辩论 \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_1\] 留下了反应动力学的关键方面未解决，这对于优化反应条件和催化剂设计至关重要。一些研究表明CH裂解步骤是速率限制步骤 \[10.1021/cr5002436\]，而其他研究则提出烷烃的解离吸附是速率控制步骤 \[10.1021/cr5002436\]。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了实验结果的解释和理论模型的开发。

                综合理解与未来展望：鉴于PDH过程中速率控制步骤的未解辩论，需要先进的实验技术和计算方法来阐明反应机制。未来的研究努力可能集中在开发能够选择性增强所提出的速率控制步骤速率的催化剂上，无论是解离吸附还是β-H提取。这可能涉及新型双金属催化剂的合成或现有催化剂的修改，以改变丙烷的吸附性质和β-H的提取。此外，原位光谱方法的发展可以提供有关反应中间体的实时见解，有助于解决持续的辩论。实验数据与计算模型（如密度泛函理论（DFT））的结合也可以为PDH机制提供更全面的理解。
