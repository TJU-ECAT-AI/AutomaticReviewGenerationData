The literature does not provide detailed information on the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), nor does it discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. However, it does suggest that propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom. The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining. The last step, desorption of π-bonded propene, has a comparatively low activation energy. The difference in negative reaction order, with respect to hydrogen, between platinum and its diluted alloys reflects a lower steady-state θH on Pt atoms surrounded by Au atoms vis--vis Pt atoms on a Pt surface.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is widely recognized for describing the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. It divides the process into three stages: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species, leading to the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2. There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by leaving a critical aspect of the reaction kinetics unresolved, which is essential for optimizing the reaction conditions and catalyst design.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin. There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. Some studies suggest that the CH cleavage steps are the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin is the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects the interpretation of experimental results and the development of theoretical models. For example, DFT calculations on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step. However, the positive effect of Sn on catalytic activity is explained by the facile desorption of propylene, which hinders further dehydrogenation of the adsorbed propylene. This suggests that the rate-controlling step may depend on the catalyst and reaction conditions.
