The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, a pivotal concept in the field of catalysis, particularly in propane dehydrogenation, involves a three-step process that has sparked significant debate among researchers regarding the rate-controlling step. Initially, propane binds to the catalyst surface, followed by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom, and finally, the desorption of the product, propene. The controversy lies in identifying which of these steps governs the overall reaction rate. Some argue that the initial binding of propane to the catalyst is the rate-determining step, while others propose that it is the hydrogen abstraction or the desorption of propene that controls the reaction's pace. This ongoing debate underscores the complexity of surface chemistry and the need for advanced experimental and computational methods to elucidate the true kinetics of propane dehydrogenation.
