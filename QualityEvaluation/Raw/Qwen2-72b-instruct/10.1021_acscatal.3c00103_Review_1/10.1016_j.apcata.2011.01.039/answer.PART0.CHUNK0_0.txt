1.The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), nor does it discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. The uncertainty about the rate-controlling step does not impact our understanding of the PDH process as presented in the literature, as the focus is on the kinetics and modeling of the reaction rather than the mechanistic details.

1.文献没有提供丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制的详细解释，也没有讨论关于在该反应中，解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的持续争论。关于速率控制步骤的不确定性并没有影响文献中我们对PDH过程的理解，因为文献的重点是反应的热力学和建模，而不是机制的细节。
