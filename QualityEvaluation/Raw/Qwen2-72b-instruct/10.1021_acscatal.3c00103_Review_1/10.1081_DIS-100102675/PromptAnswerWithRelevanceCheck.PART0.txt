Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

1.The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction cannot be explained as the provided literature does not contain any relevant information on this topic. The uncertainty regarding the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process by hindering the development of more efficient catalysts and reaction conditions, but without specific scientific literature, it's impossible to provide a detailed analysis.

1.由于提供的文献中没有包含关于丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制，包括其三个步骤（解离吸附、β-H提取和解吸），以及关于解离吸附过程或β-H提取是否是该反应速率控制步骤的持续争论的相关信息，因此无法解释丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制。关于速率控制步骤的不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，阻碍了更高效催化剂和反应条件的开发，但没有具体的科学文献，无法提供详细的分析。
