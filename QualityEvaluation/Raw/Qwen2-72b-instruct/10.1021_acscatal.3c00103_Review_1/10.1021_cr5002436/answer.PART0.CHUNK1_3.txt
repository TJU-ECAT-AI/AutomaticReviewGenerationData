[1] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."
[2] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[3] "Several studies have been performed on Pt and PtSn catalysts to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "DFT calculations performed on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step."
[5] "The positive effect of Sn on catalytic activity is explained by the facile desorption of propylene, which hinders further dehydrogenation of the adsorbed propylene."

1.The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin. There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. Some studies suggest that the CH cleavage steps are the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin is the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects the interpretation of experimental results and the development of theoretical models. For example, DFT calculations on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step. However, the positive effect of Sn on catalytic activity is explained by the facile desorption of propylene, which hinders further dehydrogenation of the adsorbed propylene. This suggests that the rate-controlling step may depend on the catalyst and reaction conditions.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆向Horiuti-Polanyi机制主要包括四个步骤：石蜡的解离吸附、第二个氢原子的CH断裂、氢分子的形成以及随后的氢和烯烃的解吸。关于脱氢反应的速率控制步骤是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取，目前存在争议。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了实验结果的解释和理论模型的开发。例如，对Pt、Pt3Sn和Pt2Sn（111）表面在PDH反应中的DFT计算表明，烷烃的解离吸附是速率控制步骤。然而，Sn对催化活性的积极作用是由于丙烯的容易解吸，这阻碍了吸附丙烯的进一步脱氢。这表明速率控制步骤可能取决于催化剂和反应条件。
