Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

[1] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."
[2] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."

1.The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of four main steps: the dissociative adsorption of propane, the cleavage of a second hydrogen atom (β-H extraction), the formation of a hydrogen molecule, and the subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin. There is an ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by leaving open questions about the fundamental kinetics and the most critical step in the reaction mechanism.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆向Horiuti-Polanyi机制主要包括四个步骤：丙烷的解离吸附，第二个氢原子（β-H提取）的裂解，氢分子的形成，以及随后氢和烯烃的脱附。关于脱氢反应的速率控制步骤是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取，目前仍存在争议。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它留下了关于基本动力学和反应机制中最关键步骤的未解之谜。

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）的Horiuti-Polanyi机制主要包括四个步骤：石蜡的解离吸附，第二个氢原子的CH裂解，氢分子的形成，以及随后氢和烯烃的解吸。石蜡的解离吸附和CH裂解步骤都被认为是脱氢反应的速率控制步骤。在PDH反应中，对Pt，Pt3Sn和Pt2Sn（111）表面的DFT计算表明，烷烃的解离吸附是速率控制步骤。在Pt（111）上，脱氢可能通过1-或2-丙基中间体进行，而在PtSn合金上，1-丙基中间体更受青睐。Sn对催化活性的正面影响可以通过丙烯的容易解吸来解释，这阻碍了吸附丙烯的进一步脱氢。关于解离吸附过程或β-H提取是否是该反应的速率控制步骤的持续争论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了实验结果的解释和更有效催化剂的开发。

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by leaving open the question of which step is the true rate-determining step, which is crucial for the development of more efficient catalysts and reaction conditions.
