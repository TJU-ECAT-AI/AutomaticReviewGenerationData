1.No relevant information was found in the provided literature to explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How this uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process is also not addressed in the literature.

1.在提供的文献中没有找到相关的信息来解释丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制，详细说明其三个步骤(解离吸附、β-H提取和解吸)，以及批判性地讨论关于解离吸附过程或β-H提取是否是该反应速率控制步骤的持续争论。这种不确定性如何影响我们对PDH过程的理解在文献中也没有提及。
