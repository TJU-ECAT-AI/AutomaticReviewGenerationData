Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

1.The literature does not provide detailed information on the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), nor does it discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. However, it does suggest that propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom. The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining. The last step, desorption of π-bonded propene, has a comparatively low activation energy. The difference in negative reaction order, with respect to hydrogen, between platinum and its diluted alloys reflects a lower steady-state θH on Pt atoms surrounded by Au atoms vis--vis Pt atoms on a Pt surface.

1.文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制的详细信息，也没有讨论关于脱氢吸附过程或β-H提取是否是该反应的速率控制步骤的持续争论。然而，它确实表明，丙烷在铂和合金上的脱氢通过相同的反应机制进行，即丙烷在单个铂原子上的解离化学吸附，该原子与两个吸附位点相关联，其中一个位点携带一个氢原子。随后，丙基自由基通过β-氢消除转化为π键丙烯，这似乎是速率决定性的。最后一步，π键丙烯的解吸，具有相对较低的活化能。铂和其稀释合金之间关于氢的负反应级数的差异反映了θH在被Au原子包围的Pt原子上的稳态较低，与Pt表面上的Pt原子相比。
