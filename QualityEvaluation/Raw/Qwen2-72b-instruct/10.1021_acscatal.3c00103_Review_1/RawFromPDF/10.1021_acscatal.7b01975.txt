Abstract
The activity and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts are strong functions of the morphology of the catalytic active phase, which governs both the density and type of active sites. To realize materials with the desired reactivity, cutting-edge catalysts are often the product of novel synthetic strategies and advanced computational studies. Combining these approaches allows for the prediction and fabrication of active motifs in a directed manner. However, catalyst active phases are ordinarily in the nanometer or atomic regime, and small morphological changes can result in large differences in catalytic properties. Given painstaking efforts to design and fabricate active materials at the nanoscale, it is essential that these engineered structures and superior catalytic properties are preserved during working conditions. The stability of a highly active catalyst morphology is crucial for long-term, sustained activity, especially for industrial applications. Unfortunately, catalyst sintering, or processes in which active surface area is lost due to irreversible agglomeration of atomic species or particles, inevitably leads to reduced active surface area and decreased catalytic activity. This problem has led to the development of many schemes, applied with varying degrees of success, which attempt to counteract these aging processes. Undoubtedly, for the directed development of stable, sinter-resistant, heterogeneous catalysts, a fundamental understanding of the species and mechanisms contributing to sintering processes is required. To highlight the importance of fundamental mechanistic understanding of sintering processes, the first portion of this perspective highlights recent approaches to characterize sintering dynamics in heterogeneous catalysts. Next, we showcase recent examples illustrating intentional measures taken to protect against particular sintering mechanisms. We believe that by reviewing examples with mechanistic understanding of these aging phenomena, we can select approaches with the highest probability of successful application to new catalytic systems. These approaches are divided into two main categories: chemical approaches, which are based on modification of the chemistry of the catalytic materials, and physical approaches, based on increased physical barriers to sintering. Our goal is to stimulate more work both on the fundamental understanding of sintering mechanisms, and on the production of stable catalysts by directly targeting and suppressing specific sintering processes.

1 Why Is Preventing Sintering Important?
Activity and selectivity are crucial parameters to consider when designing an effective catalyst. Unfortunately, if the catalyst does not maintain these properties for a reasonable amount of time (from a few seconds to a few years, depending on the application (1)), it is unlikely that it will be translated into industrial practice. Stability is of the utmost importance for industrial applications, as catalyst replacement and regeneration are very expensive tasks due to a loss of productivity during reactor downtime. Stability is especially critical when rare or expensive noble metals are used as catalyst active phases. Notable examples include fuel cells, where the cost of Pt can approach half the overall stack cost, (2) and catalytic converters which each harbor up to 15 g of rare platinum-group metals. (3) Nevertheless, sooner or later any catalyst unavoidably expires; to best delay this event, the study of catalyst deactivation phenomena is crucial. Finding universal strategies to avoid deactivation and maintain catalytic activity and selectivity is a broadly important challenge—general solutions will have widespread appeal and impact for several catalytic applications.
Different phenomena can lead to catalyst deactivation according to chemical, mechanical, and thermal mechanisms. (4, 5) Among the several causes of catalyst loss of activity, sintering occupies a central position. Sintering is the process by which large catalyst nanoparticles (NP) grow at the expense of smaller nanoparticles, leading to an overall loss of active surface area. Such processes are especially common under demanding conditions where atom and particle mobility is increased. Often, sintering is couched in terms of catalysts that operate at high temperatures for extended periods of time during which the thermal energy is sufficient to change the morphology of the catalyst. However, sintering is not only a concern for traditional, large-scale thermal catalysis. Sintering is also observed in low-temperature systems, like proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). (6-8) Although sintering processes are clearly a concern in terms of long-term catalytic operation, start-up/shut-down operations and temperature/voltage excursions can also be particularly challenging on a material because they abruptly expose the catalyst to very different environments (temperature, reaction atmosphere, potential). A classic example is that of automotive catalytic converters, for which ceria-zirconia has been discovered as a crucial additive to promote textural and catalytic stability by acting as oxygen buffer to reduce the variability in the feed that the catalyst is exposed to. (9) These start-up/shut-down operations will become more important in the future due to coupling of intermittent, renewable sources of energy with traditional methods of energy conversion, which would require catalysts that can operate for shorts period of time at high activity, and in a resting state for some other periods of time. (10) Successfully designing catalytic systems that can couple to intermittent resources will also require developing tools and materials to fundamentally understand and tolerate such demanding conditions.
Reflecting morphological changes at the nanoscale, sintering will usually manifest itself in decreased catalytic activity or selectivity. Sintering is particularly detrimental for nanostructured catalysts because:
(i) available active surface area decreases, thus reducing the overall active site density, which is crucial especially when utilizing expensive materials (e.g., noble metals, engineered nanostructures);
(ii) small particles may contain large fractions of specific active sites, such as undercoordinated atoms at edges, corners, and vertices, (11) that are lost if particles change morphology and/or size;
(iii) electronic properties may change, as those of small particles are different from larger ones, which could provide very different adsorption energies of reactants on the catalytic active phase (12) and thus very different reactivity. Gold, in this respect, is an exemplary case. (13-15)
The need for improved stability in catalytic systems has increased especially since tools to synthesize and prepare highly functional materials with atomic accuracy are now more readily available. Synthesis procedures to obtain non-equilibrium materials with high-energy structures, (16, 17) nanocrystals of specific shapes that expose particular crystallographic facets, (18) single-atom catalysts, (19) and atomically precise clusters (clusters with a specific number of atoms, according to the stability of filled shells, also known as magic-size clusters), (20, 21) or materials with specifically designed interfacial active sites (22) have recently emerged as powerful tools to explore the reactivity of tailored nanostructures in catalytic processes. The drawback is that the special properties of these materials are lost if morphology and structure are not stable under reaction conditions, questioning the efforts in obtaining these structures in the first place. Luckily, advanced synthetic techniques can be used not only to generate highly active and selective catalysts but also to preserve them. The development of more active catalysts therefore must be coupled with strategies that can maintain the structure (hence, the activity) of these materials under demanding reaction conditions.
In this Perspective, we highlight promising methods and strategies that can be used to prevent sintering in heterogeneous catalysts. In doing that, we ask the following fundamental questions: How does sintering occur? How can we study these processes? What strategies can we use to prepare sinter-resistant catalysts? These questions are strongly connected to each other: if we understand how sintering processes occur, we can better craft strategies to avoid sintering. To tackle these questions, we highlight examples spanning thermal and electrocatalytic systems to underline similarities in hopes of inspiring connections in designs and strategies from one area of research to another. We aim to highlight successful schemes that show a fundamental understanding of the underlying sintering processes, because we think these examples will be most translatable to new systems. It is in the spirit of this Perspective to provide a critical report of these areas of catalysis research through published examples and general strategies that both characterize sintering processes and aim to prevent them.
2 How Does Sintering Occur? How Can We Study These Processes?
Fundamental understanding of the sintering processes that lead to catalyst deactivation is crucial in designing materials that can withstand these processes. Although loss of catalyst surface area and activity may occur in many ways, in this Perspective, we limit our focus to studying sintering mechanisms of the catalyst active phase in supported systems, avoiding cases where support morphology or irreversible material loss from the system contribute to catalyst deactivation. In the following, we highlight recent and promising approaches used to unravel these underlying sintering processes. Many illuminating strategies involve either carefully designed materials and/or detailed spectroscopic observation. We hope these studies elucidating fundamental behavior of sintering mechanisms will both motivate future mechanistic studies on sintering and translate into new synthetic methods to protect against them.
2.1 Do Sintering Processes Occur?
Recognizing that sintering has occurred in a catalyst is the first step toward understanding this mechanism of catalyst deactivation. While a decrease in mass activity may be indicative of sintering, it is not definitive proof of a loss of active surface area. One needs to consider how changes in reaction conditions, oxidation state, or restructuring might be affecting the overall catalytic activity. Ultimately, an in-depth analysis of the active phase dispersion is required in order to demonstrate that sintering is the major cause of loss of activity.
Many ex situ methods have been developed that give static pictures describing the state of catalytic dispersion. In thermal and electrocatalysis, it is possible to identify changes in dispersion of a supported phase through several techniques that provide direct or indirect measurements of particle-size distributions. Chemisorption and electrochemical surface area measurements are indirect methods based on the use of probe molecules that bind to surface atoms of the active phase. Electron microscopy (EM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) are often used to provide atomic detail of catalyst morphology. (23) Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques are indirect methods used to extract average particle size and particle-size distributions from metal coordination number, coherence length of ordered crystallographic structures, and scattering form factor, respectively. Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) also provides indirect information on particle morphology by indicating the relative populations of specific facets, edges, and other geometric features. In electrocatalytic systems, impedance spectroscopy produces data typically fitted to an equivalent circuit model which is used to estimate surface area or extract interfacial charge transfer properties. Each of these methods has pros and cons, and complete analysis requires agreement between multiple techniques. Of all these techniques, EM is the only one that provides local, single-particle information on realistic powder catalysts; all other techniques provide average results based on an ensemble of many particles. Unfortunately, small variations are harder to be evidenced using bulk techniques. However, in EM, the analysis may not be statistically representative of the entire sample, which is instead true for bulk techniques such as EXAFS, XRD, and SAXS. Thus, direct and indirect characterization are required complementary tools to describe overall catalyst morphology.
A detailed analysis of the catalyst before and after exposure to reaction conditions is the first step toward understanding what changes have occurred to the sample as a consequence of the catalytic reaction. Unfortunately, at a molecular level, snapshots of a sintered catalyst before and after reaction often provide limited information on exactly how the sintering process occurred. In some cases, this information may even be misleading as some processes may be reversible and therefore very challenging to probe with pre- and post-reaction analysis, such as in the case of processes that involve metal redispersion, (24) which may accompany sintering in some cases. (25) (While beyond the scope of this sintering perspective, metallic dispersion via ex-solution is a promising technique for the development of durable catalysts; in these systems, active phases can be atomically dispersed within a solid solution and precipitated on the surface of the material under reducing conditions. (26-28)) Depending on the sintering mechanism, particularly in atomic ripening, stopping a sintering process at certain stages may lead to increased dispersion. Fundamental knowledge of how sintering occurs can be translated toward the development of sinter-resistant materials. (29-31) To effectively combat sintering processes and design sinter-resistant catalysts, research must turn toward obtaining a fundamental mechanistic understanding of the underlying sintering processes at an atomic level, via in situ observation or by using uniform model materials.
2.2 How Do Sintering Processes Occur?
Identifying how deactivation occurs is crucial for designing better materials for an appropriate application. As a notable example, ceria-based supports were initially thought to deactivate through loss of their oxygen storage ability, such as during the water–gas shift-reaction, (32) which would preclude their utilization under reducing conditions. However, detailed studies clearly showed a dependence of catalytic rates on exposed metal surface area and a decrease in overall metal surface area after reaction, thus demonstrating that sintering was instead the main cause of catalyst deactivation. (33) This knowledge inspired the development of strategies based on geometrical approaches to encapsulate Pd particles within ceria-based supports in catalysts that showed stable activity for this reaction. (34, 35)
Most sintering processes can be broadly classified into two categories: particle migration and coalescence (PMC) and atomic ripening (AR) (Figure 1). PMC involves the coordinated motion of multiple metal atoms, or nanoparticles, and it is related to temperature-induced increased mobility and to the lower melting point of small particles. (36) AR involves the movement of species containing one metallic atom (in many cases bonded to other atoms to form oxides or complexes, such as in the case of volatile carbonyl species) from smaller to larger nanoparticles, either on the surface of the support, or in the vapor or electrolyte phases. (37) We decided here to use the term AR over the widely used Ostwald Ripening as a more general term to indicate any process involving the migration of atomic species. The thermodynamic driving force in both PMC and AR is minimization of surface energy, which is relatively high in nanoparticles of small sizes which contain a large fraction of undercoordinated surface atoms.

(d) Final sintered state showing a larger aggregate.
Kinetic models often provide a useful framework toward understanding the atomic motions associated with sintering. For PMC sintering mechanisms, rates of particle diffusion and rates of particle coalescence stands as important physical parameters governing the aging process. For AR mechanisms, one must consider whether the system is operating in an “interface control” regime or a “diffusion control” regime; either regime will be described by a unique governing equation. (38) Assumptions on particle geometry, wetting, free energy, surface features, etc. also help provide a valuable mindset on sintering dynamics. (39) Although it may be difficult to directly measure the physical parameters for these models, researchers have had success. (40)
Certainly, distinguishing between the modes of sintering is not straightforward, and controversy exists over these mechanisms, which are highly dependent on the material system (type of metal and support) and on the reaction conditions and temperature. In the past decade, carefully designed model systems, operando/in situ spectroscopic tools, computation, and theory have aided in differentiating between these mechanisms, allowing us to start targeting approaches that mitigate sintering processes. Ideal techniques and approaches for characterizing sintering processes achieve (1) minimal perturbation/interference of the observed system; (2) monitoring of nanoparticles on realistic catalysts, under realistic conditions; (3) atomic resolution; (4) frequent system sampling; and (5) high throughput analysis. Often successful characterization of a phenomenon will rely on corroboration between multiple experimental techniques (bulk and nonbulk), as well as computation and theory.
2.3 How To Distinguish between Different Sintering Mechanisms
2.3.1 Electron Microscopy
Electron microscopy (EM) is perhaps the most powerful way of understanding morphological changes in a catalyst. In order to investigate sintering processes, EM studies were originally performed by comparing particle size and shape distributions before and after a catalyst treatment performed ex situ. Although in principle particle-size distributions may help in distinguishing between the two main sintering mechanisms, information gained from such studies is often limited due to nonuniform materials and difficulty in relocating a unique sample region between treatments; so while such characterization is indeed broadly useful for identifying sintering, it is generally accepted that these analyses often provide little mechanistic insight. (41) Recent approaches have involved careful control over uniform catalyst starting materials, such that any particular micrograph is more representative of the overall composition. More importantly, modern electron microscopy techniques have been developed toward filming “atomic movies” of the evolution of powder catalysts under realistic working conditions using environmental TEM, special sample holders, and nanofabricated cells, to allow in situ and operando characterization of catalysts while treating them with gases at atmospheric pressure. (42-44) A major risk in EM characterization of catalysts is the potential role of the highly reducing electron beam in modifying the morphology and evolution of nanostructured materials, and appropriate measures have to be taken in order to clearly demonstrate which changes are due to reaction environment and which to beam effects. (45)
Uniform nanoparticles offer a well-defined starting state for a system, thus making it simpler to characterize evolution of a nanoparticle ensemble. Hu et al. investigated size-dependent sintering mechanisms on atomically selected Au nanoparticles containing a precise number of atoms (magic sizes) on a TEM grid using particles that were synthesized via magnetron sputtering gas condensation. (46) The researchers observed a size-dependent shift in ripening mechanism for Au nanoclusters during the CO oxidation reaction via ex situ analysis of Au nanoparticles’ size distributions. The use of size-selected nanoparticles with a well-defined geometry allows the authors to gain insight from a post-aging particle-size distribution. Specifically, when starting with small clusters, the particle-size distribution broadens, with the formation of nanoparticles even smaller than the original particle size. This could only arise from atomic ripening. On the other hand, when starting with larger nanoparticles, sintering produces only aggregates that are equal to or larger than any of the particles in the original sample. When the integrated HAADF signal is used to indicate particle size, discrete particle sizes corresponding to dimers, trimers, and higher combinations of the original particles are observed, a strong indication of PMC. Thus, atomically uniform nanocrystals demonstrate a size-dependent shift from atomic ripening at smaller nanocrystal sizes, to PMC at larger nanocrystal sizes.
For samples where nanoparticle catalysts must be dispersed on flat, conductive substrates, such as in the case of electrochemical studies, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) offers a way to capture the nanoscale detail of the electrode and follow sintering processes. (47) Importantly for electrochemistry, SEM, unlike transmission techniques, does not require thin samples. This advantage enables SEM to easily characterize actual electrodes both before and after use. While frequently used as a means to confirm that minimal structural changes have occurred in an electrode rather than to study them directly, work done by Manthiram et al. leverages SEM to identify particle migration and coalescence in a model system composed of gold nanoparticles deposited on a carbon support (Figure 2). (48) Perhaps surprisingly, rich dynamics are observed in a system operating at room temperature and −1.2 V. Under the relatively mild reducing potentials of the hydrogen evolution (or CO2 reduction) conditions, the gold particles move randomly around the electrode until they collide, at which point they either stick to each other, or detach and continue in their random motion. This sticking leads to dendritic structures, which can be clearly seen with SEM and quantitatively reproduced via computational modeling. Because the electrode can be visualized as-removed from the electrochemical cell, with no elaborate or damaging sample preparation, there is little doubt that the electrochemistry led to the observed sintered morphology. However, this study does not directly probe the chemical nature of the particle–particle and particle–surface interactions. This, for example, means that we cannot understand the origin of the particle movement. Especially for low-temperature systems, where thermal energy is not as large as it is for high-temperature catalysis, it is important to understand why particles move and if other factors, like gas evolution or electric fields, may play a role.

In situ electron microscopy is one of the most powerful techniques to distinguish between particle migration and atomic ripening sintering mechanisms. (49) However, this technique comes with a unique set of challenges. Care must be taken to prevent the entire column from being exposed to atmosphere, necessitating differential pumping or specialized cells. The electron beam can also interact with the gas layer, exacerbating beam effects. In a powerful example of this technique, Helveg and co-workers first revealed a ripening-mediated sintering of Pt NPs on an idealized planar support in 10 mbar oxygen atmosphere. (50, 51) Although the work reports a clear demonstration of atomic ripening, it is not yet a realistic catalyst because of the planar nature. Further work tended toward modeling sintering processes under conditions closer to catalytic applications, with more realistic powder catalysts. In 2011, under 3.6 mbar of H2O/H2, Datye and co-workers clearly identified ripening as the mechanism of sintering in Ni/MgAl2O4 systems. (52) By performing microscopy on a single location, the authors were able to show that small nanoparticles shrank but did not move under these conditions. While the change in particle size of large particles was not detectable, the kinetics of metal evaporation would be too slow to account for the loss, since changes occurred in the space of few minutes. The data was fit to a kinetic model that assumed fast surface diffusion, where the rate-limiting step was moving an atom from the particle to the surface.
The powerful combination of advanced materials and in situ electron microscopy is an emerging class of approaches which is invaluable for the identification of mechanisms and driving forces behind sintering. An example of advanced materials for these types of studies are size-controlled clusters and nanocrystals. Synthetically, the advantage of size-controlled materials is not only in the uniformity of the materials, but also in the fact that these building blocks can be dispersed onto arbitrary supports with tunable concentration. In a direct exploitation of this advantageous feature, it is possible to program particle-size distributions by using particles of different sizes, such that atomic ripening mechanisms on and off. (40) By creating an artificial bimodal distribution with Pt particles of either ∼2.2 or ∼4.4 nm onto an alumina support, and using an atmospheric gas cell TEM holder with temperature control, it has been shown that when there is a size difference between the particles, the mechanism of deactivation is predominantly atomic ripening (Figure 3). However, when a sample with a single uniform particle size is used, this driving force is removed, and migration and coalescence is mainly responsible for any sintering. In this monomodal case, it is observed that smaller nanoparticles have a much higher mobility compared to larger ones, thus leading to increased sintering via particle migration and coalescence in smaller nanoparticle catalysts. Due to a lower mobility, monomodal catalysts with larger nanoparticles are observed to be much more resistant to sintering. Rather than relying exclusively on nanoparticle-size distributions, direct observation of nanoparticle growth events are used to substantiate these mechanistic claims (Figure 3b−e).

2.3.2 Scanning Tunneling Microscopy
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), similarly to TEM, is a powerful technique for atomic resolution of mobile nanoscopic species. While both techniques achieve atomic spatial resolution, the unique advantage of STM lies in distinguishing electronic signatures of a sintering process. For example, while the effect of organic species cannot be observed in TEM, in STM one may notice the distorted electronic state of a metal coordinated to organic species. Using this technique, coordinating moieties such as H, (53) OH, (54) and CO (55) have been shown to play strong roles in the diffusion or anchoring of atomic surface species. Unfortunately, STM can only be used on very simplified systems, such as single-crystal surfaces, and often under significantly reduced pressures. The presence of large features (i.e., sintered aggregates) can make STM difficult to operate. For these reasons, the applicability of STM is often limited to conditions that are far removed from realistic catalytic applications.
In 2013, Parkinson and co-workers performed an in-depth study, from single-atoms to larger clusters, of the sintering dynamics of a model Pd–Fe2O3 catalyst using STM. (55) Interestingly, the authors show that sintering initiates via a CO-induced coalescence of atomic Pd-CO species (Figure 4). After the formation of sintered nanoclusters, further coarsening occurs via cluster diffusion and coalescence. Hydroxyl groups have the opposite effect: these groups act to anchor Pd atoms. The effects of these CO and OH moieties were deduced from electronic states of the scanned material, over multiple hours of scanning at reduced pressures (∼10–10 mbar). This study shows how adsorbed species can influence sintering dynamics and how STM can be used to deduce the effects of these coordinating species.

In a similar study, Yang et al. used in situ STM to directly probe the sintering dynamics of Au NPs under CO oxidation conditions. (56) At temperatures up to 137 °C and relatively high pressures (0.1 Torr) of reactant gases, the authors observe an atomic ripening mechanism, at which large particles grow at the expense of nearby smaller ones (Figure 5). This process is evidenced by the disappearance of small particles, while larger particles grow without noticeable translational motion. Surprisingly, this mechanism is only facilitated in the presence of both reactive gases (CO, O2). The authors postulate a reaction-induced mechanism, seen in other systems, (57) where the energy generated from CO oxidation might be transferred to the nanoparticle and facilitate the formation of migrating atomic species.

2.3.3 In Situ/Operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
Electron and scanning tunneling microscopy techniques are powerful tools to observe individual nanoparticles and atoms in small ensembles. However, they are limited to collecting information about only a small fraction of the sample. Such techniques can be complemented by bulk spectroscopies, which provide information about the entire sample. X-ray spectroscopies, due to their small wavelength, can easily probe the length scales (<1 Å) involved in sintering processes. In such spectroscopies, X-rays interact with a sample and produce either photons or electrons which are counted and used to extract information about the sample. Since the energies are appropriate to eject core electrons into free-electron states, element-specific information about oxidation states and coordination environment can be extracted. In situ/operando bulk spectroscopies provide exciting future directions in high-throughput spectroscopic characterization of sintering phenomena. (57) Such throughput would likely not be possible in TEM/STM; in spectroscopies, one might simply translate a stage or move a beam—in TEM/STM, one has to wait for stage/thermal equilibration, or risk the drift or damage of the particular observation area.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is typically a surface-sensitive technique, limited by the mean free path of ejected electrons, used to investigate the first few atomic layers of a material. It is often well-suited for characterizing the surface of large particles, or the entirety of a highly disperse catalytic active phase. While XPS has been ubiquitous in surface science for decades, its use in pressure regimes of interest to catalysis is challenging. (58) However, recent developments allow pressures up to a few mbar, and high-pressure XPS shows promise as a technique to characterize the electronic state of species under sintering conditions. Using XPS in combination with atomic force microscopy (AFM), Porsgaard et al. identified the mobility of gas-phase oxidized platinum species (PtOx) under 0.5 Torr of O2 and temperatures exceeding 450 °C. (59) Interestingly, smaller particles result from these aging experiments, but neither PMC nor AR are observed. The ordered starting and ending states of these materials directly imply that although nanoparticle sizes decrease, no sort of PMC aging mechanism may be present under these conditions, since interparticle distance remains constant after the aging experiment. The lack of aggregates larger than the original starting nanoparticles rule out atomic ripening. These observations implicate the gas-phase species as the primary mobile platinum species and suggests that such volatile species may play a role in sintering processes in other systems with different catalyst morphologies or flow patterns.
In situ XRD and SAXS offers another perspective, in which the average crystallinity of a sample can be monitored. Ingham and co-workers demonstrate via synchrotron radiation that on a model mica/silicon substrate, gold nanoparticles sinter via ligand desorption, aggregation, and coalescence to a polycrystalline structure, and sequential annealing to remove stacking faults and to form crystalline aggregates. (60) Although a clever application of combining synchrotron radiation with temperature control, as this technique develops, future directions should target the introduction of gases and more realistic nonplanar model systems.
In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has also shown promise to both identify sintering processes, as well as to posit the nature of the stabilizing species. Throughout the in situ treatment, by collecting spectra, one can back out important parameters such as coordination numbers, environments, and average atomic sizes. Taking spectra throughout thermal and gas treatments, Matos et al. demonstrate how Pt nanoparticles sinter as a function of temperature under reducing conditions (Figure 6). (61) For example, they show that sintering under reducing conditions is not extensive until ∼800 °C, and that at this temperature sintering reaches an upper bound of ∼2 nm Pt nanoparticles. Furthermore, extracting information regarding oxidation state, the authors identify interfacial PtOx species as potentially stabilizing to small Pt nanoparticles.

2.3.4 Indirect Nanoplasmonic Sensing (INPS)
Langhammer and co-workers recently developed a novel technique to monitor changes in metal dispersion in real-time using plasmonic detectors. (62) Indirect nanoplasmonic sensing (INPS) is a time-resolved method to observe nanoparticle sintering in situ, under operating conditions (Figure 7e). By supporting catalyst particles on a nanoplasmonic array, either directly or by first depositing a mesoporous supporting material, one can detect morphological changes in the nanoparticle system by monitoring the centroid shift of the underlying nanoplasmonic sensor as changes in particle size affect the electronic environment of the plasmonic device. In studying the sintering of Pt nanoparticles, these researchers used this technique to probe the effect of support, and found that Pt sinters more strongly on Al2O3 compared to SiO2, and again more strongly in O2 than in NO2. Additionally, increasing the O2 partial pressure leads to increased sintering. (63) Originally, these nanoplasmonic arrays were fabricated with plasmonic gold disks underneath a thin, planar silica spacer layer, onto which Pt nanoparticles were deposited. Moving toward increasingly realistic systems, Adibi et al. showed how the technique can be extended to three-dimensional porous oxides, further measuring the kinetics of Pt sintering inside a mesoporous oxide matrix. (64) As in TEM experiments above, the stability of uniform particles and their resistance to atomic ripening has also been nicely demonstrated in systems where size-selected clusters are created through physical deposition methods (Figure 7a–d). (65) Indirectly, this work demonstrates that atomic ripening is not as active when particles are sufficiently similar in size, thus offering a valuable strategy for reducing deactivation under reaction conditions.

2.3.5 Computational Approaches
Computational approaches, backed by theory, are invaluable for interpretation of experimental results and high-throughput analysis of sintering energetics. (37) However, care must be taken to ensure that experimental observations guide the physical considerations in computational models. One must also be aware of the fact that certain complex systems might be intractable using modern computational resources and hence need to be simplified to be computationally accessible. As in the development of kinetic models, parametrizing experimental results into computable variables allows researchers in both experimental and computational fields to better understanding their own findings.
Computation can be especially useful for characterizing vapor-phase sintering pathways, which can be difficult to understand experimentally. Work by Plessow et al. clearly demonstrates the relevance of the vapor-phase PtO2 sintering mechanism on Pt NP sintering. (66) Although it is a longstanding problem to clarify the mobile species and sintering dynamics of Pt in oxidizing conditions, many computational works neglect the possibility of a vapor-phase sintering mechanism, although volatility of PtOx has been often posited experimentally. (59, 67) By comparing a vapor-phase sintering model with experimental results, the authors conclude that under high-temperature conditions, PtO2,(g) often more accurately describes the symptoms of the sintering phenomena. Work by the same group also targets understanding the support effect on Pt sintering under oxidizing conditions (O2 and H2O). (68) While it can be challenging to differentiate between atomic ripening and particle migration experimentally, Plessow et al. contend that energetically, the diffusion of atomic species over the stable SiO2 surface would be highly unfavorable. Specifically, by calculating adsorption energies of Pt atoms on different reconstructed α-quartz surfaces, the authors find either very unstable Pt-surface bonds, or the formation of too strong Pt covalent bonds which would inhibit atomic diffusion. Instead, the authors posit that particle migration and coalescence, or gaseous PtO2 sintering processes, may be the dominant aging mechanisms.
3 What Strategies Can We Use To Prepare Sinter-Resistant Catalysts?
Understanding fundamental sintering mechanisms allows us to intelligently choose strategies to best counteract them and allow maintained dispersion and activity. However, many methods to prevent sintering may lead to new chemical and electronic properties of the catalytic active phase, decreased overall reactive surface area, and mass-transfer limitations, which can lower the overall activity of the catalyst. Implementing strategies that balance these considerations requires fundamental understanding, creative design, and synthetic control. Broadly, antisintering involves modifying either the chemical or physical structure of catalytic materials. Chemical modifications involve changing the electronic nature and interactions of the active phase or support to increase the material’s intrinsic resistance to sintering. Physical approaches alter the spatial arrangement of active and supporting phases, leading to increased physical barriers toward sintering. In the following, we draw from recent literature examples in which synthetic approaches successfully reduce nanoparticle sintering, leading to increased catalyst stability. Our aim is to highlight particularly translatable examples, in which a solution is inspired by, or leads to, a fundamental understanding of the underlying sintering process.
3.1 Chemical Approaches
Here, we define a chemical approach as an antisintering strategy that is based on changing catalyst chemistry; at the atomic scale, this means modifying the chemical or electronic environment or structure of the catalyst and/or support, such as to stabilize the desirable catalyst morphology. An intuitive example is alloying two metals to create a new phase, which may have a higher melting point and thus be more resistant to sintering. A variety of strategies can be applied generally to combat both atomic ripening as well as particle migration and coalescence. Examples of electronic interactions include organic support functionalization, engineered electronic metal–support interactions, or modification of the electronic structure of the active phase itself. Although often difficult to intuit the success of such approaches a priori, powerful examples have emerged due to collaborations between theory and experiment, which have allowed for a more targeted design process in identifying and synthesizing robust catalysts.
3.1.1 Organic Support Functionalization
One way to change the chemical environment of a supported active phase is to directly modify the surface with an organic, functionalized molecule. These moieties can act as diffusional barriers for surface processes, or as anchors for catalyst active phases.
For example, much work has been done on the introduction of chemical functionalities into mesoporous silica frameworks (69) because of the ordering of these materials and the large body of work in silane chemistry developed throughout the years. Taking advantage of such chemistries, it has been shown that grafting aminopropyl triethoxylsilane onto silica bead support particles leads to these organic tethers successfully mitigate Cu NP growth in methanol synthesis catalysts (Figure 8). (70) Composed of copper, zinc oxide, and aluminum oxide, these catalysts are much studied because of the relevance of these systems to industrial reactions. First, the authors rule out a gas-phase sintering mechanism, citing the relatively low temperature of methanol synthesis, as evidence that the sintering mechanism must be dependent on the formation of surface-mobile copper species. Atomic ripening is known to be a strong function of nanoparticle size and distribution; hence, the authors synthesize similar particle-size distributions on functionalized and nonfunctionalized supports for fair comparison. By synthesizing a catalyst with a few much larger particles and showing these materials to be less stable, they conclude that atomic ripening is the dominant sintering mechanism. This is because the addition of larger, relatively motionless aggregates should not affect particle migration behavior yet serve as a sink for atomic species emitted from undercoordinated, smaller nanoparticles. Further experiments found aging to be independent of metallic catalyst loading (i.e., interparticle distance), which would further corroborate an atomic ripening mechanism. However, it is to be remembered that this assumes an interface limited sintering regime, where the rate-limiting sintering step is the emission of an adatom from a nanoparticle, and atomic diffusion along the surface is quick. The authors conclude that in the synthesis, functionalization leads to increased spacing between ligands; thus, longer migration distances for atomic species, with higher activation energy barriers, lead to this decrease in atomic ripening on functionalized supports. On the other hand, it is to be considered that if sintering is found to be independent of interparticle distance, diffusion is not the rate-determining step. In this light, one might consider if instead it is the emission of atomic species from each nanoparticle that is rate-limiting in this atomic ripening process. The use of size-selected nanocrystals, rather than phases produced by incipient wetness impregnation, may allow for easier comparability between supports in future works.

Authors argue that in (b), increased diffusional distance between ligands, and stronger interactions between Cu adatoms and grafted aminopropyl ligands, lead to slower diffusion of atomic adsorbates between nanoparticles.

Despite extensive research efforts in the development of cheap and stable cathodes for fuel cell applications, stability of platinum electrocatalysts remains challenging. (7, 71) Although carbon black is the most frequently used supporting material, work has been done on studying graphene supports for fuel cell reactions because of its conductivity, high surface area, and stability. (72) Recently, functionalized graphene supports have attracted attention as stable supporting materials, where organic moieties may provide nucleation sites for increased dispersion, and anchoring sites for sustained dispersion. (73) Xin et al. took this material one step further by chemically modifying graphene to fundamentally study and enhance the interactions of the support and the nanoparticles. (74) Specifically, they investigated the stability of platinum nanoparticles on various chemically modified graphene sheets with either a sulfur- or nitrogen-containing aromatic ligands (Figure 8, R = SO3H, NH2) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in weak acid (0.1 M HClO4). These organic moieties are proposed to interact with the platinum nanoparticles, evidenced by enhanced stability for the oxygen reduction reaction, and by performing TEM characterization at identical locations before and after catalysis (Figure 9). Interestingly, a pendant amine anchor provides better stability than a sulfonic acid, both of which are better than the graphene alone. This is demonstrated via TEM images post aging tests, as well as comparing polarization curves before and after accelerated degradation tests. X-ray spectroscopy clarifies the interactions between platinum and the anchoring ligand. Via XPS spectra, a clear interaction between nitrogen or sulfur from the ligands, and platinum metal, is identified. These conclusions were corroborated with XANES spectra, where electron density is seen to be shifted away from Pt, to the functionalized graphene. This element suggests that it is the functionalized anchor modifications that cause the stability increase. Despite not distinguishing between an atomic ripening sintering process or particle migration and coalescence, this is an example of a successful strategy which led to an understanding of the mechanism of sintering prevention: increased electronic interaction of nanoparticle and support. It is expected that organic functionalization can be a promising avenue to explore in this type of low-temperature applications, although the fate of these organic moieties under the reaction conditions is a parameter to keep in mind as the support itself may not last during repeated catalytic cycles.

3.1.2 Alloying/Dealloying
Just as alloying is used in bulk materials to engineer mechanical or thermal properties, intimately mixing different elements at the nanoscale can produce catalysts with higher sintering resistance by changing the intrinsic chemical properties of the starting materials. However, the dynamics of multimetallic systems are complex, and it may be difficult to deconvolute maintained dispersion from phase evolution exclusively on the basis of catalytic activity. Especially if nanoalloys deviate from standard phase-diagrams, it may be nontrivial to predict the evolution of phases and properties in multimetallic catalysts. This element makes it vitally important to understand the reasons behind the enhanced stability of alloys. Another important point to keep in mind is that alloys may have a markedly different reactivity, in a positive or negative manner. In this section, we highlight strategies that use alloyed materials to create catalysts with greater stability.
The complex sintering and stabilizing mechanisms in bimetallic materials are illustrated in PtRh/barium hexa-aluminate (BHA) catalysts reported by Cao and Veser. (75) As a function of Pt content in Pt/Rh bimetallics, segregation, or stabilization of alloy phases is observed. In Pt-rich bimetallics, distillation of a lower-melting point Pt-phase and subsequent stabilization of a Rh-rich Pt/Rh phase occurs (Figure 10), while dispersion is maintained in Rh-rich bimetallic materials. By taking advantage of stability conferred by Rh, and combustion activity dominated by Pt, the authors found that Pt/Rh bimetallic materials perform well over multiple sequential light-off curves for methane combustion. Stability in bimetallic noble metal systems (i.e., Pt/Pd, for emissions control) finds similar composition-dependent stability motifs. (76, 77) In our own research, we observe that in uniform Pt/Pd nanocrystals, the ratio of Pt/Pd strongly governs sintering dynamics and the resulting catalytic activity for high-temperature methane combustion. (78) In addition to composition-dependent stability motifs, we observe size-dependent stability properties; given identical composition, larger Pt/Pd bimetallic nanoparticles phase segregate, while smaller nanoparticles maintain a homogeneous elemental distribution.

Core–shell materials are a class of materials, spanning thermal and electrocatalytic systems, (79) that often show enhanced stability when the shell is composed of a thermally stable compound such as an oxide. Usually, these materials take the form of an active core surrounded by porous stabilizing material (see sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3). This physical barrier provided by the thermally stable shell material provides advantageous stability in harsh environments, although it also brings issues with diffusion limitations of reactants and products in and out of the catalytically active core. However, the opposite approach is also valid—in an attempt to minimize Pt loadings in electrocatalysis, Hunt et al. coated carbide materials with Pt shells. (80) Surprisingly, these core–shell catalysts not only showed high Pt dispersion but also enhanced stability over traditional Pt electrocatalysts. These materials exploit the similar electronic structure of carbides and platinum to increase stability via tight interfacial bonds of the metal to the stable underlying carbide material. This strong binding leads to the formation of a very stable yet catalytically active shell. Still, electronic perturbation of the Pt electronic structure is demonstrated by the fact that the Pt coating is less susceptible to CO poisoning compared to conventional Pt catalysts. This example highlights the importance of finding a good match of electronic structure (i.e., d-band, Fermi level, etc.) and crystal structure (structure, lattice spacing, etc.) between the core and shell materials.
Dealloying is another pathway toward creating an active phase with high chemical stability. It entails producing a precursor alloy, which is then exposed to conditions that would leach out one of the metals preferentially (and almost entirely, but not completely). Usually a base metal is etched away, leaving noble metal atoms undercoordinated. In bulk materials, this provides a large driving force to condense the remaining noble metal atoms into porous nanostructures at the bimetallic interface. (81) At the nanoscale, however, this restructuring can lead to core–shell structures that exhibit high activity and stability. This process has been successfully applied to create stable platinum catalysts for fuel cell reactions. For example, in PtNi, dealloying is used to produce a phase that is both more active and more stable than either Pt on Ni alone for the oxygen reduction reaction. In a recent work, these materials were tested in a full polymer exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) to demonstrate their superior properties. (82) In this case, the initial catalyst particles were PtNi3, which were supported on commercial carbon black and subjected to various acid leaching steps. The resulting catalysts were characterized in full PEMFC testing (membrane electrode assembly [MEA], nafion, etc.), TEM for size and morphology, and EDS for elemental analysis. The MEA was analyzed in cross section with electron probe microanalysis and ICP to assess the distribution of Pt and Ni. The key insight is the critical size of nanoparticle that evolves to form the optimal core–shell structure with the dealloying treatment. For particles that are too large, the dealloying dynamics become similar to the bulk case and spinodal decomposition at the surface layer leads to the formation of nanoporous materials that ultimately result in the leaching of too much nickel. However, below this critical size, the dealloying procedure leads to the formation of a platinum-rich shell which is quite stable in fuel cell conditions. This valuable insight will aid in applying dealloying for other catalyst systems, as the formation of specific, sinter-resistant alloys is a strategy that can be extended to many combinations of catalytic materials.
3.1.3 Electronic Metal–Support Interactions
Engineering stable sites or facets on catalyst supports by exploiting electronic interactions between support and supported phases is an appealing class of methods to stabilize highly dispersed nanocrystals or single-site catalysts, without the introduction of mass-transfer limitations when compared to certain geometric approaches. Much work has been done on achieving and maintaining maximum catalytic dispersion, especially for Au, (83, 84) Pt, (85, 86) and Ir materials, via electronically stabilizing single atoms or nanoclusters on metal oxide and zeolite supports. (19) Experimentally, the extent of electronic metal–support interaction can be directly determined via metal adsorption calorimetry onto the particular support. (87) For example, by measuring the energy of adding another Ag atom as a function of Ag already deposited (a proxy for Ag nanoparticle size on the support surface), Campbell and co-workers backed out important thermodynamic parameters relevant to sintering processes, such as adhesion energies. (88) From such calorimetric data, activation energies of sintering processes can be calculated using kinetic models, (38) thus providing important knowledge toward understanding what materials combinations can lead to smaller or larger sintering tendancies.
Although stabilizing single-site/nanocluster catalysts has been the subject of complete reviews, (19, 89) we want to highlight specific works that emphasize a rational design approach which achieve this goal via engineered electronic support interactions. Groups have combined density functional theory calculations with experiments to find ways to create stable single atom catalysts. Such sites were identified on Pt/CeO2 catalysts to be Pt(II) stabilized in a square planar geometry bound to four oxygens on the [100] facet of ceria (cerium dioxide, CeO2). (90) Platinum atoms bound to this site are predicted to have a binding energy higher than the cohesive energy of platinum atoms in the metal, making these CeO2 sites—and thus the atomic dispersion—thermodynamically preferable. The platinum is also stably anchored on the surface, preventing it from entering the bulk of the support. Experimentally, Pt was deposited in these nanopockets using magnetron sputtering techniques and confirmed with synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electron microscopy also confirmed the existence of [100] nanofacets. Atomic Pt has been found stable on specific facets and shapes (nanorods, nanopolyhedra) of CeO2, which help maintain the extremely high dispersion of Pt on these materials. The atomic interaction between Pt and CeO2 features is so strong, that mobile Pt species from Pt nanoparticles supported on Al2O3 can be trapped on CeO2 facets. (91) These stable sites have been observed in different materials including alumina, (92-94) mostly due to support defects, and inspire ideas in purposely introducing defects into catalytic supports to stabilize high metal dispersions.
The stabilizing effect of specific support sites is not limited to single atoms. Even entire nanoparticles (88, 95) can achieve enhanced stability on CeO2 supports due to increased adhesion energies, caused by oxygen vacancies within the support structure. In particular, interfacial anchoring motifs have been demonstrated on CeO2 to stabilize entire Au nanoparticles. On CeO2 nanorods, Au/CeO2 is highly active for CO oxidation and WGS, yet loss of activity occurs due to collapse or restructuring at the Au/CeO2 interface, followed by subsequent sintering. Ta et al. demonstrated that CeO2 nanorods, compared to other CeO2 structures, contain an increased density of O vacancies, which strongly tether Au to the CeO2 interface, thus minimizing sintering and maintaining high catalytic activity. (95) Using TEM, they observed that samples subjected to a sufficiently rigorous calcination procedure at 400 °C formed gold nanoparticles with a truncated octahedral morphology. The authors claim that this shape allows for good contact between the (111) facets of both support and catalyst. As the nanoparticles are large enough (∼4 nm) to keep this interface “buried”, the strong attachment is maintained.
3.2 Physical Approaches
Geometric modification of supporting materials and introduction of physical barriers/features represent another promising class of approaches to engineering sintering resistance into catalytic materials. These strategies change the geometric arrangement of the materials around active phases to increase barriers toward nanoparticle migration or atomic ripening, mostly by modifying the transport of chemical species across the catalyst surfaces/structures. There are a few variations on this theme. High-surface-area nanostructured supports modify the effective interparticle distance, which increases the time scale of surface-mediated sintering processes. Catalysts with inorganic overlayers, in which active phases are at least partially covered by a shell material, present more substantial physical barriers toward the migration of nanoparticles, and serve to lock a nanoparticle into place, but usually diminish exposed surface area. Encapsulated systems serve as an ultimate protection against sintering, via complete spatial confinement of a catalyst active phase, but often come at the additional price of diffusional limitations. All of these methods often provide the flexibility to independently manipulate properties of both the active phase and the underlying support independently. Nevertheless, across schemes, increased stability often comes at the price of the accessibility of an active phase.
3.2.1 Engineered and Nanostructured Supports
High-surface-area supporting materials were initially introduced into catalysis to allow a highly disperse active phase without diminishing accessibility of active catalyst surface area. However, such supports also combat nanoparticle sintering: these materials increase interparticle distance (i.e., the 2D surface-diffusional distance of nanoparticles or atoms), which has been shown in many cases to be crucial toward minimizing sintering in catalytic materials. (96) However, the support design must also consider the diffusion of reactants and products to and from active sites, as well as gas-phase species between nanoparticles, to prevent mass-transfer limitations or gaseous sintering mechanisms. These spatial considerations serve as the motivation for nanostructuring support geometries toward the minimization of catalyst agglomeration and sintering.
Maximizing migration distance, while minimizing mass-transfer limitations, has been illustrated by Liu and co-workers by socketing Pt NPs in wide-mouthed cavities (Figure 11). (97) In a comparison of catalyst support geometries, the authors explore the stability of Pt/silica materials under high temperatures. Comparing Pt NPs in wide-mouthed bowls, to Pt NPs embedded in mesoporous silica, to NPs deposited on planar silica nanosheets, the work illustrates the impressive stability of silica nanobowls compared to these other support geometries. This stability is highlighted both in catalytic activity for CO oxidation, particle-size distributions, and in situ TEM observation. The authors credit increased interparticle distances as helping to limit nanoparticle sintering; however, it is unclear why the interparticle distance would be different given that the two materials have similar surface areas and metal loading. Instead, it is possible that different support chemistries due to different preparation methods also contribute to the increased stability of Pt NPs in the compartment-rich, bowl-shaped silica support. This work illustrates the importance of not only high-surface-area supports but also those constructed in a way as to minimize mass-transfer limitations.

3.2.2 Inorganic Overlayers
Catalysts with partially embedded active phases, in which a thermally stable compound or deposited structure partially covers a catalyst active phase, are an increasingly popular motif in catalyst design. (98, 99) These versatile approaches aim to stabilize active nanoscopic features by increasing the interface between a thermally stable inorganic material and the active system component.
Atomic and molecular layer deposition (A/MLD) are a class of methods that produce conformal thin films of a variety of metal and metal oxide materials. (100) By depositing thin films with specific properties (porosity, thickness, chemistry) onto catalytic materials, A/MLD offer many protection schemes to aid in stabilizing nanoparticle catalysts. (101) Promising ALD strategies involve either overcoating porous (102, 103)/cracked oxide structures, (104) selected-area ALD, (105, 106) or ALD on protected catalytic structures, with removal of protection post-ALD, leaving overhead space above the catalytic nanoparticle. (107, 108) There are also successful instances of similar wet chemical approaches that can also be used to selectively deposit overcoats to create protective coverings for nanoparticles. By controlling ligand populations on catalyst phases, selected-area deposition can be achieved, promoting deposition around catalyst nanoparticles, while avoiding directly depositing material onto the active phase itself. (109) These approaches provide increased catalyst stability either by physically locking a nanoparticle into place, thus preventing particle migration and coalescence, or by titrating high free energy undercoordinated features, thus mitigating atomic ripening. While an often-reported downside involves the trade-off between activity and stability with increasing deposition cycles, (110) many schemes have been developed that not only prevent catalysts from sintering but also avoid mass-transfer limitations and particle occlusion, prevent coke formation, (102) or even enhance catalytic activity. (111, 112)
Deposited coatings do not necessarily need to be thin, but then they must be porous. By depositing alumina overcoatings on Pd catalysts, Lu et al. show how deposited 8 nm mesoporous coatings on metal particles can have stabilizing effects against sintering and coking, leading to enhanced sustained catalytic activity. (102) However, initially after ALD deposition of the stabilizing overcoat layer, CO chemisorption peaks disappeared, indicating complete nanoparticle covering; nanoparticle surface accessibility was reachieved after oxidative and reductive calcination treatments. It was posited that sintering resistance was provided via selectively stabilizing the Al2O3 overcoat on edge and corner sites, but clearly (Figure 12a, a different work) an 8 nm thick 45-cycle ALD coat may entirely lock the nanoparticle into place, rather than selectively titrating certain sites. Additional work by many of the same authors confirmed the mechanistic intuition behind this successful approach by exploring the stability of ALD-Pd/Al2O3 for methanol combustion, this time by introducing few ALD layers (Figure 12b,c). (112) With an increasing number of ALD cycles, confirmed via diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), alumina first deposited onto free support hydroxyls, then onto undercoordinated Pd-sites, and finally onto bulk Pd facets. Increased catalyst stability, even after a small number of deposition cycles, is attributed either to decreasing particle mobility due to anchoring the nanoparticle, or decreasing the driving force for ripening, due to the deposition of stabilizing alumina at low-coordination sites.

Many embedding strategies have found success in the realm of electrocatalysis, especially when applied against the harsh conditions found in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). (113, 114) Active, resistant, and stable platinum catalysts embedded in conductive carbon supports can be produced via tunable synthetic schemes. As is the case with many high-surface-area carbon materials, often templating approaches are utilized. (113, 115) For example, platinum embedded in graphitic carbon has been seen to be thermally stable during fabrication (900 °C for 3 h), as well as catalytically and morphologically stable under electrocatalytic testing. (115) The increased sintering stability is attributed to an increased interface between the carbon support and the Pt NPs; this increased binding interaction both anchors Pt against sintering and prevents easy support oxidation or destruction. Graphitic carbon shows promise for electrochemical embedding strategies due to easy control over structure which allows researchers to control conductivity and stability, while managing mass-transfer limitations.
3.2.3 Encapsulated Systems
Encapsulated nanoparticle catalysts possess nearly complete three-dimensional spatial confinement to eliminate the possibility of nanoparticle migration and coalescence. Unfortunately, nanoparticle encapsulation with porous materials will likely have limited success against atomic sintering mechanisms, so this strategy is most effectively used to combat particle migration and coalescence mechanisms of deactivation. Although increasing nanoparticle/support interface area, without changing the fundamental electronic nature of the metal–support interaction, encapsulation introduces no added kinetic barrier toward the formation of volatile gas-phase species, or the surface migration of atomic species.
Although silica-based encapsulation strategies such as hollow sphere (116, 117) or porous shell encapsulation (118-120) are nowadays well-established, they are still an area of active research and many papers appear in the literature with novel building blocks or improved synthesis procedures to spatially control synthesized structures. For example, Zhang et al. demonstrated a new approach to encapsulate small nanoparticles, which are generally more difficult to successfully encapsulate, inside silica coatings, thus promising improved catalytic activity. The encapsulation of Au(OH)3 nanoparticles in silica (as opposed to the most commonly utilized metallic components) and the subsequent conversion into the metallic state, allowed for them to work around this challenge. (121) While encapsulation approaches generally result in promising stability, they may suffer from reduced accessible active phase or mass-transfer limitations. The most promising future directions target nanoparticle encapsulation schemes that minimize such limitations.
Graphene materials are promising electrocatalytic supports due to their high surface area and electrical conductivity. Under reaction conditions, however, supported graphene catalysts suffer from sintering of the catalyst active phase because of the relatively weak metal–support interactions with these carbon materials, as well as sheet aggregation and stacking, leading to severe mass-transfer limitations due to pore occlusion. An attempt to circumvent such shortcomings has been presented by introducing a thin covering of mesoporous SiO2 (mSiO2) into a system of supported Pt nanoparticles. (122) These coatings not only imbue sintering resistance via nanoparticle confinement into mesopores (Figure 13) but provide enhanced thermal stability of the supporting graphene oxide material. Although mass-transfer limitations or decreased overall dispersion are often problematic for such encapsulation approaches, this work actually finds the opposite. The thin mSiO2 coating and larger pore sizes (mesopores) minimize diffusional limitations of reactants to the active nanoparticles. Additionally, the amorphous nature of the mSiO2 covering minimizes π–π stacking and sheet aggregation, and thus act as spacer, preventing π–π stacking and nanoparticle occlusion. In this example, we see a method that successfully minimizes particle sintering via encapsulation, which also remedies traditional mass-transfer limitations in graphene supported catalysts.

As mentioned, although Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are well-known as active oxygen reduction reaction catalysts, over time they can suffer loss of activity via particle aggregation, atomic ripening, or losses in intrinsic activity due to dealloying processes. To reduce these issues, hollow graphene spheres have been demonstrated to be successful in encapsulating PtNi nanoparticles and preserving their size during catalysis. (123) The result is a highly active and stable catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction. These materials bypass typical degradation mechanisms: mesoporous entrenchment suppresses particle agglomeration, and the material shows resilience to voltage swings that might occur in the operating window of ORR catalysis. The authors perform an accelerated degradation test (0.4–1.0 VRHE) both on the encapsulated sample and on a commercial sample Pt/Vulcan. The encapsulated sample shows no loss in surface area, while the commercial material loses ∼20%. Further experiments explain that under these aging conditions, Pt is not lost to the electrolyte; therefore, loss of surface area on the control sample must be due to PMC. The articles concludes that it must be a pore-confinement effect within the novel mesoporous support network that helps protect the encapsulated sample against PMC. It must be considered, however, that the lack of Pt dissolution into the electrolyte may not entirely rule out atomic mobility on the support surface and therefore surface-mediated atomic ripening mechanisms. Similarly to other highly active and stable platinum–nickel systems, the authors observe stability against metal leaching and attribute this beneficial effect to a particular geometry of the active phase in which a platinum skin surrounds a platinum–nickel core.
CeO2 was shown above in other work to be a strong-binding support for noble metal particles; by increasing barriers to the emission of atoms or atomic diffusion, this material aids in the stabilization of supported single atoms or nanoparticles. Our own research has produced a novel strategy, using the self-assembly of CeO2 clusters around an active nanoparticle phase, to produce thermally and electrochemically stable materials. (124-127) It is established that the sintering of a metallic Pd phase can lead to decreased dispersion in high-temperature combustion applications. (128) CeO2 is well-known to affect the redox properties of supported catalysts. (129) Such redox-active encapsulation strategies may play a role not only as a physical barrier but also in driving systems toward a more stable oxidation state, thus reducing sintering, and in increasing interfacial sites that are known to be crucial for certain catalytic reactions. (130) Indeed, these encapsulated catalysts see higher temperatures of PdO decomposition compared to nonencapsulated materials. This strategy has proven to increase not only stability but also the activity of palladium catalysts for methane combustion. (126, 127) The same Pd@CeO2 core–shell materials have also been used as catalysts in solid-oxide fuel cell anodes, demonstrating impressive activity and stability after calcination and use at 900 °C especially when compared with conventional ways to deposit catalytic materials via infiltration (Figure 14). (116) These overlayers are therefore considered a promising way not only to limit sintering but also to tune and modify the activity and selectivity of catalyzed reactions by manipulating metal–support interface sites in a combined chemical and physical approach.

4 Conclusions and Future Directions
With the maturity of atomically precise processes and techniques to synthesize and characterize complex materials, the field of heterogeneous catalysis has turned toward the rational design of active and selective catalysts. These precise materials allow us to gain a fundamental understanding of motifs which confer activity and selectivity advantages, and to develop materials which maximize the presence of these beneficial features. This understanding is often translatable between systems, hastening the development of catalysts across classes of materials. Recently, the use of the same techniques has been applied toward the synthesis of stable catalytic materials. While many of these approaches have been met with some degree of success, we believe that too often these cases remedy the problem, without specifically targeting the underlying cause. Such trial-and-error approaches can not only be time-consuming and ineffective but also lead to strategies with unnecessary drawbacks, such as increased mass-transfer resistance or decreased dispersion. Additionally, such approaches are often successful on a case-by-case basis. Research needs to target a fundamental understanding of sintering mechanisms to (1) use strategies that minimally affect mass transfer and dispersion and (2) expedite the translation of strategies between systems, rather than designing a new approach for each new application.
Gaining insight into the transient phenomena of catalyst sintering is more difficult than correlating a fixed catalyst structure with a specific property. Understanding the cause behind dynamic changes in catalyst phase and morphology is more complex than the static characterization of a material before or after catalysis. However, targeted design against sintering requires this fundamental understanding. As highlighted in Section 2, modern techniques and strategies allow for atomic insight into the mechanisms behind loss of active catalyst surface area. Although cleverly crafted model systems allow for some degree of insight via pre- and postcatalysis analysis, the most successful techniques involve in situ/operando observation of sintering phenomena. Because sintering and catalyst deactivation in general are complex transient phenomena that depend on reaction atmosphere, temperature and sample history, only operando conditions can give truly detailed descriptions of this process. To move forward in the area of catalyst stability, the community needs to work on implementing these techniques in ever more realistic environments. In order to ensure that an in situ measurement is not affecting sintering dynamics, multiple spectroscopies should corroborate the same mechanistic claim. If possible, one should confirm that the before and after states of the in situ experiment match the before and after states of an ex-situ control experiment. For example, in electron microscopies, which we have identified as particularly promising, the additional challenge of beam effects needs to be addressed.
Distinguishing between atomic ripening and particle migration and coalescence is the first step toward full characterization of a sintering process. Additional questions easily follow: from where are mobile atomic species generated? Which structures and facets may limit these generating sites? How does particle mobility change as a function of particle size, shape, and oxidation state? In a catalyst, how may we distinguish between multiple mechanisms evolving together as a function of aging time? It is worth pursuing answers to these questions; in the academic realm, we have the expertise to craft precise catalysts that may take advantage of this fundamental understanding to realize more resilient materials. We also believe that to fully answer these questions, a combination of techniques that provide access to both the local environment (such as electron microscopy) and the overall picture (such as bulk spectroscopic techniques like XAS, FT-IR, and Raman) is necessary, especially when performed under reaction conditions.
The second half of this Perspective showcases strategies which either target a specific sintering mechanism in order to mitigate it, or deduce a fundamental understanding from a successful approach. These methods are divided into chemical approaches, or those that modify the chemical/electronic interactions of the material, and physical approaches, in which physical barriers offer resistance to particle agglomeration. While broadly classifying strategies based on the aforementioned motifs, we also cast a critical eye toward areas of improvement. In total, we hope that these examples will be particularly translatable to other systems and that examples from thermal and electrocatalysis may inspire schemes between fields.
Clearly, a singular antisintering strategy will not be satisfactory for all materials working under all conditions. High-surface-area supports may be a viable approach in systems where atomic ripening is not the main cause of deactivation, and particle migration is slow. While a porous overlayer may be ineffective in preventing ripening of a volatile metal oxide, alloying may successfully decrease the vapor pressure of the material. And although encapsulation or embedding seems generally effective, these approaches are often accompanied by severe penalties in terms of exposed surface area and simplicity in fabrication. So although successful strategies have evolved for specific systems, there lacks classes of strategies which are predictably effective and generally successful—we believe this to be due to a lack of fundamental understanding of how these materials sinter. Certainly, the community is moving in the right direction, and the existence of these strategies is testimony that promising approaches are emerging and continued collaborative work between fundamental understanding and novel material fabrication are crucial.
For decades, fundamental studies on nanoparticle activity and selectivity have led toward the design of more effective catalytic materials. Similarly we hope that fundamental studies on sintering processes may stimulate the design of more stable catalytic materials. By including sections on both mechanistic understanding and intelligent design, we aim to instill the mindset of rational strategies for improved catalyst stability, via fundamental understanding of underlying sintering mechanisms. Improved stability and fundamental understanding have a bidirectional relationship; while understanding intuitively leads to improved stability, the realization of a stable material may provide insight into the nature of the sintering mechanisms that were extinguished. With the development of novel techniques to understanding these nanoscopic processes, the evolution of well-known strategies, and the development of new strategies, we hope to see the rise of targeted and effective classes of strategies to predictably mitigate the root cause of sintering in a catalytic system.

Figure 14. (a) Nyquist plots of ac-impedance data obtained from symmetric cells under humidified hydrogen feed using lanthanum strontium chromium manganite (LSCM)/yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anodes with Pd and CeO2 catalytic materials synthesized through different formulations: by infiltration of Pd-only salt; by infiltration of a mixture of Pd and Ce salts; or by infiltration with preformed, colloidally prepared Pd@CeO2 core–shell structures. The anodes were calcined at either 700 (circles) or 900 °C (triangles), with the lowest resistance (highest activity) measured for the Pd@CeO2 sample before and after high-temperature aging treatment. (b) Maximum power density at 700 °C for conventional and core–shell-type catalyst that shows the stability with time of the Pd@CeO2 sample where sintering is suppressed. (c) and (d) are SEM images of the used anodes after reaction at 700 and 900 °C, respectively, showing minimal sintering occurring when overlayers are used to protect and improve the activity of Pd particles. (e) and (f) are SEM images of Pd+CeO2 coimpregnated anodes, after reaction at 700 and 900 °C, respectively. Reproduced with permission from ref 124. Copyright 2011 The Electrochemical Society.
