1.The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting oxygenates derived from renewable biomass into hydrogen, which can be used as a clean fuel or feedstock for chemical synthesis. This process offers several key advantages over traditional methods: it can produce hydrogen with lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization; it operates at lower temperatures, which can reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency; and it can produce hydrogen with low CO concentrations, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. The use of aqueous phase reforming, which operates in the liquid phase, eliminates the need to vaporize water and reactants, and allows the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed, making it a practical and efficient process for hydrogen production.
