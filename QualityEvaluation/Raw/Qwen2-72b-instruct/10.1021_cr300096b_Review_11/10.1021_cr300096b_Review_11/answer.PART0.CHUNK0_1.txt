[1] "Selective reforming of oxygenates is a promising way to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells, and syngas for production of chemicals and fuels, and in upgrading of feedstocks."
[2] "If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass, the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth."
[3] "Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

1.Selective reforming of oxygenates is a promising method for producing hydrogen for fuel cells and syngas for chemical and fuel production, as well as upgrading feedstocks. If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass, the reforming process can be CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth. Additionally, oxygenate reforming has the advantages of using low-toxicity and low-reactivity reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage.
