[1] "A novel approach to produce hydrogen from bio-oil was obtained with high carbon conversion (>90%) and hydrogen yield (>90%) at T < 500 C by using the electrochemical catalytic reforming of oxygenated-organic compounds over 18%NiO/Al2O3 reforming catalyst; thermal electrons play important promoting roles in the decomposition and reforming of the oxygenated-organic compounds in the bio-oil."
[2] "The production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, an environmentally friendly and rich feedstock, would open a new prospect for the utilization of the renewable biomass sources."
[3] "The carbon conversion significantly increased from 14.7 to 72.7% at 400 C with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A, and reached 96.5% at 500 C and 3.8 A. The yield of hydrogen also remarkably increased from 35.6 to 95.8% with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A at 500 C."
[4] "The thermal electrons in ECR significantly promoted the dissociation and the reforming reactions of the oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oil."
[5] "The present approach would be a promising option for production of hydrogen from bio-oil with higher energy efficiency and lower cost."

1.The electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of oxygenated-organic compounds over a 18%NiO/Al2O3 reforming catalyst is a novel approach to produce hydrogen from bio-oil. This method achieves high carbon conversion and hydrogen yield at relatively low temperatures, with thermal electrons playing a significant role in promoting the decomposition and reforming of the oxygenated-organic compounds. The production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass is environmentally friendly and opens up new prospects for the utilization of renewable biomass sources. The ECR process significantly increases carbon conversion and hydrogen yield, even at lower temperatures, compared to traditional methods. The thermal electrons in ECR significantly promote the dissociation and reforming reactions of the oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oil. This approach is a promising option for the production of hydrogen from bio-oil with higher energy efficiency and lower cost.
