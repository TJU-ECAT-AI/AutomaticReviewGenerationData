[1] "A novel approach to produce hydrogen from bio-oil was obtained with high carbon conversion (>90%) and hydrogen yield (>90%) at T < 500 C by using the electrochemical catalytic reforming of oxygenated-organic compounds over 18%NiO/Al2O3 reforming catalyst; thermal electrons play important promoting roles in the decomposition and reforming of the oxygenated-organic compounds in the bio-oil."
[2] "Hydrogen is an important raw material for the chemical industry and it is a potential clean fuel which could have an important role in reducing environmental emissions for the future."
[3] "By contrast, production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, an environmentally friendly and rich feedstock, would open a new prospect for the utilization of the renewable biomass sources."
[4] "The route of the steam reforming of bio-oil involves fast pyrolysis of biomass to generate bio-oil and reforming of it to produce a gaseous rich-hydrogen mixture."
[5] "Production of hydrogen from bio-oil reforming is probably one of the most promising options because it can achieve high hydrogen yield and high content of hydrogen."
[6] "The carbon conversion significantly increased from 14.7 to 72.7% at 400 C with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A, and reached 96.5% at 500 C and 3.8 A."
[7] "The yield of hydrogen also remarkably increased from 35.6 to 95.8% with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A at 500 C."

1.The electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of oxygenated-organic compounds in bio-oil over a 18%NiO/Al2O3 catalyst is a novel approach for hydrogen production. This method achieves high carbon conversion and hydrogen yield at relatively low temperatures, with thermal electrons playing a crucial role in promoting the decomposition and reforming of the oxygenated-organic compounds. Hydrogen is a key raw material for the chemical industry and a potential clean fuel that can significantly reduce environmental emissions. Producing hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, a renewable and environmentally friendly feedstock, opens new prospects for utilizing renewable resources. The ECR process, which involves the steam reforming of bio-oil, can achieve high hydrogen yield and content. The carbon conversion and hydrogen yield are significantly enhanced by increasing the current through the catalyst, even at lower temperatures.
