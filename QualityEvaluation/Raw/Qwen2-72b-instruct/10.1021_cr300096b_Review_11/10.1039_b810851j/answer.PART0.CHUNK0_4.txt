[1] "A novel approach to produce hydrogen from bio-oil was obtained with high carbon conversion (>90%) and hydrogen yield (>90%) at T < 500 C by using the electrochemical catalytic reforming of oxygenated-organic compounds over 18%NiO/Al2O3 reforming catalyst; thermal electrons play important promoting roles in the decomposition and reforming of the oxygenated-organic compounds in the bio-oil."
[2] "The production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, an environmentally friendly and rich feedstock, would open a new prospect for the utilization of the renewable biomass sources."
[3] "The carbon conversion significantly increased from 14.7 to 72.7% at 400 C with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A, and reached 96.5% at 500 C and 3.8 A. The yield of hydrogen also remarkably increased from 35.6 to 95.8% with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A at 500 C."
[4] "The thermal electrons in ECR significantly promoted the dissociation and the reforming reactions of the oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oil."

1.The electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of oxygenated-organic compounds over a 18%NiO/Al2O3 reforming catalyst is a novel approach to produce hydrogen from bio-oil. This method achieves high carbon conversion and hydrogen yield at relatively low temperatures, with thermal electrons playing a crucial role in promoting the decomposition and reforming of the oxygenated-organic compounds. The production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, such as bio-oil, is environmentally friendly and offers a promising avenue for utilizing renewable biomass sources. The ECR process demonstrates significant improvements in carbon conversion and hydrogen yield compared to traditional steam reforming, especially at lower temperatures. The thermal electrons in ECR significantly enhance the dissociation and reforming reactions of the oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oil.
