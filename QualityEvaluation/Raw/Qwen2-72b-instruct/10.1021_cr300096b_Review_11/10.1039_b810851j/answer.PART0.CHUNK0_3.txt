[1] "A novel approach to produce hydrogen from bio-oil was obtained with high carbon conversion (>90%) and hydrogen yield (>90%) at T < 500 C by using the electrochemical catalytic reforming of oxygenated-organic compounds over 18%NiO/Al2O3 reforming catalyst; thermal electrons play important promoting roles in the decomposition and reforming of the oxygenated-organic compounds in the bio-oil."
[2] "Hydrogen is an important raw material for the chemical industry and it is a potential clean fuel which could have an important role in reducing environmental emissions for the future."
[3] "By contrast, production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, an environmentally friendly and rich feedstock, would open a new prospect for the utilization of the renewable biomass sources."
[4] "The route of the steam reforming of bio-oil involves fast pyrolysis of biomass to generate bio-oil and reforming of it to produce a gaseous rich-hydrogen mixture."
[5] "Production of hydrogen from bio-oil reforming is probably one of the most promising options because it can achieve high hydrogen yield and high content of hydrogen."
[6] "The carbon conversion significantly increased from 14.7 to 72.7% at 400 C with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A, and reached 96.5% at 500 C and 3.8 A."

1.The electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of oxygenated-organic compounds over a 18%NiO/Al2O3 reforming catalyst is a novel approach to produce hydrogen from bio-oil. This process achieves high carbon conversion (>90%) and hydrogen yield (>90%) at temperatures below 500 degrees Celsius. Thermal electrons play a significant role in promoting the decomposition and reforming of the oxygenated-organic compounds in the bio-oil. Hydrogen is a crucial raw material for the chemical industry and a potential clean fuel that can significantly reduce environmental emissions. The production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, an environmentally friendly and abundant feedstock, opens up new prospects for the utilization of renewable biomass sources. The steam reforming of bio-oil, which involves the fast pyrolysis of biomass to generate bio-oil and its subsequent reforming to produce a rich hydrogen gas mixture, is one of the most promising options for hydrogen production due to its high hydrogen yield and content. The ECR process significantly enhances the carbon conversion and hydrogen yield, with the carbon conversion increasing from 14.7% to 72.7% at 400 degrees Celsius and reaching 96.5% at 500 degrees Celsius and 3.8 A of current. The hydrogen yield also increases remarkably from 35.6% to 95.8% with the increase of current from 0 to 3.8 A at 500 degrees Celsius.
