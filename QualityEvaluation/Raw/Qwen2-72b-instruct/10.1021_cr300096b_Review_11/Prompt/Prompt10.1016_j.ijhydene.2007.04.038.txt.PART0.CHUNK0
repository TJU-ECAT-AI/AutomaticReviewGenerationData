I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

International Journal of Hydrogen Energy 32 (2007) 32383247 www.elsevier.com/locate/ijhydene Review A review on reforming bio-ethanol for hydrogen production Meng Ni, Dennis Y.C. Leung, Michael K.H. Leung Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, PR China Received 7 August 2006; received in revised form 1 March 2007; accepted 20 April 2007 Available online 5 June 2007 Abstract Bio-ethanol is a prosperous renewable energy carrier mainly produced from biomass fermentation. Reforming of bio-ethanol provides a promising method for hydrogen production from renewable resources. Besides operating conditions, the use of catalysts plays a crucial role in hydrogen production through ethanol reforming. Rh and Ni are so far the best and the most commonly used catalysts for ethanol steam reforming towards hydrogen production. The selection of proper support for catalyst and the methods of catalyst preparation significantly affect the activity of catalysts. In terms of hydrogen production and long-term stability, MgO, ZnO, CeO2, and La2O3 are suitable supports for Rh and Ni due to their basic characteristics, which favor ethanol dehydrogenation but inhibit dehydration. As Rh and Ni are inactive for water gas shift reaction (WGSR), the development of bimetallic catalysts, alloy catalysts, and double-bed reactors is promising to enhance hydrogen production and long-term catalyst stability. Autothermal reforming of bio-ethanol has the advantages of lesser external heat input and long-term stability. Its overall efficiency needs to be further enhanced, as part of the ethanol feedstock is used to provide low-grade thermal energy. Development of millisecond-contact time reactor provides a low-cost and effective way to reform bio-ethanol and hydrocar- bons for fuel upgrading. Despite its early R&D stage, bio-ethanol reforming for hydrogen production shows promises for its future fuel cell applications. 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
