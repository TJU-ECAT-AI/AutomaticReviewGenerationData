Glycerol liquid phase conversion over monometallic and bimetallic catalysts: Effect of metal, support type and reaction temperatures Abstract Glycerol liquid conversion under catalytic aqueous steam reforming conditions was studied. For this purpose monometallic Ni and Pt and bimetallic PtNi catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and La2O3-modified γ-Al2O3 were employed. Activity measurements indicated that among the tested catalysts, the PtNi catalysts were, in general, the most active, whereas the Ni catalysts suffered from increasing deactivation as the temperature increased. In addition, glycerol conversion was mainly due to the production of intermediate oxygenated hydrocarbons at the reaction conditions investigated. In general, the presence of La2O3 improved this catalytic behaviour toward lighter gaseous products. The characterisation results, together with the activity results, suggested that the high activity of the PtNi catalysts can be associated with limited metal dispersion, the formation of metal PtNi alloy and the spill-over phenomenon. The last two effects hindered carbon deposition. Furthermore, the deactivation of the Ni catalysts was also associated with the oxidation of metallic Ni phases in the presence of adsorbed H2O.

Among the liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons, 1,2-propylene glycol was the main product.  Bimetallic catalysts showed good catalytic activity related with low dispersion of metallic active sites, PtNi alloy formation and H2 spill-over.  La2O3 addition improved the H2 yield by increasing Ni0 dispersion in Ni/γ-AM catalyst and surface exposure of Ni in PtNi/γ-AM catalyst.  Ni catalysts deactivation observed was due to oxidation by water.
1. Introduction
Renewable energy sources are a clear alternative to reduce greenhouse gases emissions from fossil fuel utilization and to decrease the European Union's dependency on external energy sources, improving the safety and sustainability of the energy supply. According to future forecasts, the European Union could increase its external energy dependency in the next 2030 years [1] and it is expected that the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere in 2100 will fluctuate between 540 ppm and 970 ppm [2] , which is a 205% increase in CO2 concentrations. Consequently, bio-based fuels are one of the most promising alternatives to the problems associated with the world's current energy system, because they are renewable and, theoretically, carbon dioxide neutral [3] .Among biofuels, biodiesel demand and production has seen exponential growth in the past few years. During the production of biodiesel by transesterification, glycerol is generated as a by-product. This transesterification reaction is a catalytic alcoholysis of biomass derived from FAME (fatty acid methyl esters), in which glycerol to biodiesel production ratio is 1:10 [4] . The production of large amounts of glycerol is becoming a problem for biodiesel producers because of its economical impact on the manufacturing of biodiesel. Therefore, it is important to look for alternatives that reduce the glycerol surplus and the costs associated with glycerol storage and management.One of the possible solutions to the glycerol surplus is glycerol marketing. The glycerol produced from biodiesel manufacturing could be commercialized as high purity glycerol [5] . However, the glycerol by-product must be purified first, which requires investments in technology that are too expensive for most biodiesel producers [6] ,[7] . Furthermore, there is not a significantly high demand [8] for glycerol to absorb the large amounts of glycerol produced leading to devaluation of the market price [6] ,[7] .These problems have thus provoked alternatives directed toward the utilization of the bioglycerol by-product as a raw material to produce value-added products, such as H2. This H2 has a wide variety of industrial applications, including fuel cell technology. Moreover, the use of H2 could help achieve the target established by the European Union for the use of biofuels in the European Union Green Paper [1] , which envisioned that 20% of the petrol and diesel used for road transport will be replaced with biofuels by 2020.Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised [9] . The glycerol aqueous phase reforming and the water gas shift take place according to the following reactions, respectively:
HOCH2CHOHCH2OH + 3H2O  7H2 + 3CO2
CO(g) + H2O(g)  CO2(g) + H2(g) The most suitable catalysts for ethylene glycol aqueous phase reforming are Pt [9] , Raney-Ni modified with Sn [9] ,[10] ,[11] and PtPd [12] catalysts. However, commercial reforming catalytic systems are typically based on transition metals, especially Ni [13] because of its low cost [14] and wide availability. In addition, as it was concluded in a previous work [15] ,[16] , Ni catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 modified with different La2O3 loadings, especially intermediate loadings, and with the incorporation of Pt to Ni based catalysts improved the Ni/Al2O3 capacity for producing only gas products (mainly H2 and CO2) due to steam reforming of intermediate oxygenated hydrocarbons. Glycerol aqueous phase reforming was also carried out over Ni catalysts supported on Al2O3 modified with CeO2, MgO, ZrO2 and La2O3 [17] . Nevertheless, these catalysts were severely deactivated under the reaction conditions for glycerol aqueous phase reforming, resulting in glycerol conversions below 5% after 24 h.
Based on this information, the aim of this work was to study the activity of Ni, Pt and PtNi catalysts supported on bare and La2O3-modified γ-Al2O3 in APR. For this purpose, the temperature, total pressure, space velocity, glycerol concentration in the feed and the catalyst mass were increased in comparison with operation conditions employed in a previous work [17] .
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Catalysts preparation and characterisation
Commercial γ-Al2O3, designated as γ-A, and La2O3-promoted γ-Al2O3 were used as supports for monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. The La2O3-modified γ-Al2O3, designated as γ-AM, was prepared by wet impregnation of γ-Al2O3 using an aqueous solution of the lanthanum precursor, La(NO3)3·6H2O. The precursor amount was selected to obtain a La2O3 content of 6 wt%. After impregnation by stirring, the both supports were dried at 393 K for 3 h and calcined at 923 K for 6 h.
Supported Ni and Pt catalysts, designated as Ni/γ-A, Ni/γ-AM, Pt/γ-A and Pt/γ-AM, were prepared by wet impregnation of the supports with aqueous solutions of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Aldrich) and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar), respectively. For preparation of Pt catalysts a NH4OH solution was used in order to achieve pH around 9.5 and facilitate the hydroxide precipitation. The amount of nickel and platinum precursors were selected to achieve contents of approximately 13 wt% Ni and 2.5 wt% Pt, in agreement with literature data for gas phase reforming processes [18] ,[19] . Finally, the Ni catalysts were dried at 393 K for 2 h and calcined at 773 K for 4 h. In the case of Pt catalysts, the drying and calcination were conducted at 383 K for 12 h and 573 K for 3 h, respectively. The calcination temperature for the Pt catalysts was lower than the one used for Ni catalysts because the Pt particles had lower thermal stability than the Ni catalysts. According to the results obtained by Hu et al.
[20] , localized heating during the calcination process could promote Pt particles sinterisation. The bimetallic catalysts, designated as PtNi/γ-A and PtNi/γ-AM, were prepared by impregnation of the Ni catalysts with corresponding nitrate platinum solutions and calcined at the same temperature as the Ni catalysts.
The chemical composition, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the H2 chemisorption results for monometallic Ni/γ-A and Ni/γ-AM catalysts were published elsewhere [15] ,[17] ,[21] . Additionally, some of the characterisation results of the Pt/γ-AM and PtNi/γ-AM catalysts appeared in our previous work [15] . The Pt/γ-A and PtNi/γ-A catalysts characterisation analyses were also performed and reported here.
The calcined and reduced catalysts were characterised by different techniques. The elemental analysis of the catalysts was carried out by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using a Perkin Elmer Optima 3300DV apparatus. The samples were first dissolved in acidic solutions, then microwaved for 15 min and diluted to concentrations within the detection range of the instrument. The BET specific surface area and the average pore volume of the calcined catalysts were calculated from N2 physisorption isotherms, using the BET volumetric method. The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms were obtained at 77 K over the whole range of relative pressures using a Micromeritics ASAP 2100 automatic device. Before measurements, the samples were degassed at 423 K for 12 h.
TPR experiments were carried out with a semiautomatic Micromeritics TPD/TPR 2900 apparatus equipped with a TCD detector. Prior to the reduction program, the samples were treated under an air stream at 573 K to remove water and possible contaminants, and to completely oxidise the active phases of the samples. TPR profiles were obtained by heating the samples from 298 K to 1173 K at a linearly-programmed rate of 10 K/min, while 50 mL/min of dried reduction gas (10% (v/v) H2 diluted in Ar) was passed through the sample.XRD patterns were obtained with a computerised Seifert XRD 3000P vertical diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15418 nm) equipped with a PW BraggBrentano θ/2θ goniometer, a bent graphite monochromator and automatic slit. The samples were scanned with Bragg's angles between 5 and 80 using a rate of 5 s per step (step size = 0.04). Metal crystallite average diameters were estimated from XRD patterns by applying the Scherrer equation. Metal dispersion and metal surface area on the reduced catalysts were measure by H2 chemisorption at 298 K with 50 mL/min of Ar and pulses of 0.1 mL (10% H2 in Ar) on the same device where N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms were obtained. Before chemisorption, all samples were in situ reduced at 923 K under H2/Ar flow (50 mL/min) for 1 h and subsequently flushed under Ar at 938 K. The PtNi catalysts were not characterised by this technique because it was not possible to determine the H2 consumed by Ni and Pt separately.XPS was used to study the surface chemical composition and oxidative state of the catalysts. Photoelectron spectra were recorded with a VG Escalab 200R electron spectrometer equipped with a Mg Kα X-ray source (hν = 1253.6 eV) and a hemispherical electron analyser operating at constant transmission energy (50 eV). After outgassing, the calcined or reduced samples were transferred to the ion-pumped analysis chamber for data acquisition. The C 1s peak at 284.6 eV was used as an internal standard.The reduction treatment to obtain reduced Ni and PtNi catalysts samples was carried out ex situ at 923 K, and at 623 K for Pt catalysts, for 90 min under 100 mL/min of H2/N2 (1/9, v/v) gas mixture. The reduced samples were collected under iso-octane and then transferred to the instrument. A second, in situ reduction treatment under the same gas mixture flow and at 623 K for 30 min was done only for the XPS characterisation.Finally, the spent catalysts were characterised by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). The oxidation experiments were carried out with a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e thermogravimetric analyser. TPO profiles were obtained using approximately 20 mg of sample, which were heated from 298 K to 1173 K at a linearly programmed rate of 5 K/min with 200 mL/min of N2 and 50 mL/min of O2 as the oxidant gas mixture.
2.2. Liquid phase reforming reaction
The activity measurements for the liquid phase reforming reaction were performed in a bench-scale fixed bed reactor, in which 300 mg of catalyst were diluted with inert SiC (catalyst/SiC=1:9 wt). Prior to the reaction, all catalysts were reduced or activated in situ under 75 mL(STP)/min of pure H2 at a total pressure of 0.1 MPa, and at a temperature of 973 K for Ni and PtNi catalysts and at 623 K for Pt catalysts for 2 h.
The activity test was performed using an aqueous solution of 10 wt% synthetic glycerol, 10 times higher than the one used in the previous study [17] . This new feed composition was similar to the glycerol content obtained from biodiesel production after alcohol removal and acid neutralisation of the glycerol fraction. Liquid phase conversion of glycerol was conducted under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 2 h1, a total pressure of 4 MPa, and temperatures between 498 K and 513 K. Before the test at 513 K, the catalysts were reactivated under the same conditions of the activation treatment. Additionally, to maintain the high pressure necessary for this process, a N2 stream conducted directly to the liquid and gas phase separator was employed to avoid modification of the space velocity. The gas products were then analysed by on-line TCD and FID detectors, while liquid products were collected and analysed by an off-line AED detector.
The acquired experimental data were treated to define the following parameters: Glycerol conversion: Gas total flow: Liquid products molar ratio on a dry basis: Liquid phase molar composition (%) on a dry basis: The measured volume corresponds to the volume of produced gas measured by a manual flowmeter and the time indicates the time needed to measure the gas volume produced. The value of Nproduct (mol/min) was calculated on a dry basis and took into account the non-reacted glycerol.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Calcined and reduced catalyst characterisation
3.1.1. Chemical composition and textural properties
The results obtained from ICP-AES and N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms are shown in Table 1 . The ICP-AES results indicated that the experimental chemical composition of the catalysts prepared was similar to those that were theoretically predicted.

The Ni addition to the Al2O3 support reduced the BET specific area due to the incorporation of Ni species into the Al2O3 structure, decreasing pore volume. Nevertheless, in the Ni/γ-AM catalyst the SBET remained nearly constant, when compared with the γ-AM support. This fact could be related to the reported capacity of the La2O3 to form a dimensional monolayer over the Al2O3 support [21] ,[22] . In the case of catalysts that contained Pt, the SBET increased when compared to analogous supports and Ni catalysts, achieving for the Pt/γ-A and PtNi/γ-A catalysts, and for the Pt/γ-AM and PtNi/γ-AM catalysts a similar value of specific area. As was published in the literature, the specific area could be compensated by the exposed area of the added metal species [23] .
3.1.2. Temperature programmed reduction
The TPR characterisation technique was used to obtain reducibility profiles for calcined catalysts. As was reported in previous papers [15] ,[17] , the TPR profiles of Ni/γ-A and Ni/γ-AM catalysts had a wide reduction peak. The shape of this peak was due to the contribution of different reducible species formed during catalyst calcination. In particular, the deconvolution of the wide peak indicated that three species were formed at approximately 800 K, 930 K and 1053 K. These peaks were associated with the reduction of the following species: NiO species interacting weakly with the Al2O3 support [15] ,[17] (NiO-Al2O3), non-stoichiometric nickel aluminate species (NiAlxOy) and stoichiometric nickel aluminate species (NiAl2O4) [15] ,[17] , respectively. Moreover, the relative proportion of NiAlxOy, calculated from the H2 consumption, for the Ni/γ-AM catalyst increased in comparison with the Ni/γ-A catalyst. Based on the literature, this increase could be related to the generation of Ni2+ species interacting with the lanthana species that were reduced at temperatures between 823 K and 973 K [24] ,[25] . These interactions could then give rise to the formation of perovskite species, such as LaNiO3 and La2NiO4.
Fig. 1 shows the TPR profiles of the Pt and PtNi catalysts. As can be seen, the Pt/γ-A and the Pt/γ-AM catalysts presented a shared reduction peak at approximately 500 K. According to the literature [26] this peak could be ascribed to the reduction of PtOx species interacting weakly with the Al2O3 support (PtOxAl2O3). The presence of these species could then be related to the capacity of the Al2O3 to stabilize the oxidised Pt particles over its surface [27] . For the Pt/γ-AM catalyst, an additional peak was observed at 650 K. The mass spectrometry analysis of the gases produced during TPR of the Pt/γ-AM catalysts revealed that the H2 consumption at 644 K was associated with the formation of CH4. This hydrocarbon could be generated from methanation of surface carbonates over metallic Pt by the following reaction [28] ,[29] : La2O3 + CO2(g)  La2O2CO3. Surface carbonates are easily adsorbed on rare-earth oxides, such as La2O3, which then have a tendency toward carbonation when in contact with atmospheric CO2 [30] ,[31] .

Reducibility profiles of Ni, Pt and PtNi catalysts obtained from TPR analysis and the deconvolution of the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst's profile.The reduction profiles of the PtNi/γ-A and PtNi/γ-AM catalysts showed similar peaks to the Ni and Pt catalysts [15] . These reduction peaks were assigned to PtOxAl2O3, NiOAl2O3, NiAlxOy and NiAl2O4 species detected at 490 K, 675 K, 840 K and 1025 K, respectively. In the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst, the methanation of surface carbonates could also occurs in the same temperature range at which the Ni2+ species were reduced. For the PtNi catalysts, the peaks associated to PtOxAl2O3 and nickel aluminate species were not well defined due to scale of the graph. For this reason, the deconvoluted TPR profile of the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst is included in Fig. 1 as an example.Interestingly, the reduction temperature of the NiOAl2O3, NiAlxOy and NiAl2O4 species was lower for the PtNi catalysts than for the Ni catalysts [15] . This observation indicated that the Pt addition to the Ni catalysts facilitated the reduction of Ni2+ species due to the H2 spill-over phenomenon [32] and limited the interaction between nickel species and Al2O3.
3.1.3. X-ray diffraction
The XRD results published for Ni/γ-A, Ni/γ-AM, Pt/γ-AM and PtNi/γ-AM catalysts [15] demonstrated that, in the calcined and reduced Ni, Pt and PtNi catalysts, poorly crystalline Al2O3 reflections were detected and assigned to a mixture of Al2O3 and NiAl2O4 phases [33] . For Ni/γ-AM, Pt/γ-AM and PtNi/γ-AM catalysts diffraction angles attributed to La2O3, LaNiO3 and/or La2NiO4 phases were not observed, indicating that the these species were well dispersed on the support. This observation was in agreement with the results obtained from the N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms. In addition, calcined and reduced Ni and PtNi catalysts showed diffraction lines associated to crystalline NiO and Ni0, respectively. However, in the case of the calcined and reduced Pt/γ-AM and PtNi/γ-AM catalysts, only reflections ascribed to Pt0 particles were detected. Furthermore, the TPR profiles revealed the presence of PtOxAl2O3 species in the calcined catalysts, and the XRD only showed reflections associated to Pt0 particles. These observations suggested that the PtOx species presented particle sizes too small to be detected by this technique.
As can be observed in Fig. 2 , the calcined and reduced Pt/γ-A and PtNi/γ-A catalysts showed the same Al2O3 (37.4, 46 and 66.8) [17] ), nickel and platinum phases as the Pt/γ-AM and PtNi/γ-AM catalysts [15] . In addition, the calcined and reduced Pt/γ-A catalyst recorded reflections for Pt0 particles near 39.9 [34] . Specifically, a diffraction peak at 39.53 was registered for Pt catalysts. Furthermore, the calcined and reduced PtNi/γ-A catalysts, apart from the Pt0 particles, presented diffraction lines for NiO (37.2, 43.3, 62.9 and 75.6 [15] ,[17] ) and Ni0 (44.4, 51.8 and 76.3 [15] ,[17] ) particles, respectively. In the case of PtNi catalysts, the reflections associated to Pt0 species were detected at 39.83. Therefore, Pt0 reflections shifted to slightly higher 2θ angle in PtNi catalysts. According with the literature [35] ,[36] , this observation suggests some PtNi alloy formation.

The average size of the NiO, Ni0 and Pt0 crystalline particles, determined by the Scherrer equation, for calcined and reduced catalysts are reported in Table 2 . These data indicated that the addition of Pt to the calcined Ni catalysts did not significantly change the NiO particle size. However, the Pt0 particle size did increase with respect to the analogous calcined Pt catalysts. The considerable enhancement of the Pt0 particle size suggested that the Ni presence on the support hindered Pt deposition during the preparation of this type of catalytic system, promoting the agglomeration of metallic Pt particles.

After reduction treatment of the Ni/γ-A, Ni/γ-AM, Pt/γ-AM and Pt/γ-A catalysts, the Ni0 and Pt0 particle diameter decreased slightly in comparison to the NiO and Pt0 species in the calcined catalysts, indicating that the dispersion of the metallic species did not significantly differ. In the case of the Pt catalysts, this observation was due to the fact that the reduction conditions were not mild enough to maintain the dispersion of the Pt0 species.
It is important to note at this point that the Ni0 particle size in the reduced PtNi/γ-A and PtNi/γ-AM catalysts was similar to the analogous Ni catalysts. The literature [32] indicated that the addition of Pt, or other metals such as Co and Cr [37] , improved the Ni0 dispersion because Pt reduces the particle diameter. In addition, the second impregnation, in presence of an ammonium solution, and calcination stages of Ni catalysts, which were employed to develop PtNi catalysts, could favour Ni particles dissolution [38] ,[39] and subsequent redispersion. On the other hand, the reduction treatment increased the Pt0 particle diameter in the bimetallic catalysts, as a consequence of a sinterisation effect. This phenomenon was produced in the PtNi catalysts because they were reduced at the same temperature as the Ni catalysts (973 K), whereas the Pt catalysts were reduced at 623 K.
3.1.4. H2 chemisorption
Surface metallic atom characteristics, such as dispersion and particle diameter, were investigated by H2 chemisorption. The measured parameters are presented in Table 3 for Ni and Pt catalysts. The data for PtNi catalysts are not shown because it was not possible to differentiate between the metallic Ni and Pt species.

a a Data for analogous Ni catalysts inside the parenthesis.
The Ni0 species diameter decreased from 16.1 nm to 11.5 nm in Ni catalysts when the La2O3 was added. This phenomenon was not observed for the Pt catalysts. Furthermore, as can be seen in Table 3 , the presence of La2O3 nearly doubled the Pt0 species particle diameter. This observation was in agreement with the lower dispersion [40] recorded for the Pt/γ-AM catalyst.
Comparing the Pt0 particle diameter in the Pt catalysts with the same parameter determined by XRD, the values were found to be similar. In the case of Ni catalysts, the values for Ni0 species diameters measured by chemisorption were higher than those determined by XRD. Tsipouriari and Verykios [41] suggested that the difference between the values for metallic particle diameter measured by XRD and chemisorption was due to the decoration of the Ni metallic particles by species from the support. Zhang et al.
[42] reported that the XRD did not show an increase in Ni0 particle size in the prepared Ni catalysts, but the H2 chemisorption provided a lower Ni0 species dispersion, which was similar to that of the Ni/γ-A and Ni/γ-AM catalysts. These researchers attributed these differences to the incomplete reduction of metal species and the decoration of crystals with species from the support. This decoration could be related to interactions between nickel and alumina or lanthana, which were corroborated by TPR analysis. These interactions could be related to the affinity of Ni2+ ions for Al3+ vacancies on the alumina and La3+ vacancies on the lanthana [43] . But it is possible that the Al3+ and La3+ ions from the support could be incorporated onto the surface of NiO species, creating the decoration phenomenon [15] ,[17] .
For the Pt/γ-A and Pt/γ-AM catalysts, Pt0 species were more highly dispersed on the Pt/γ-A catalyst than on the Pt/γ-AM catalyst, as the XRD and H2 chemisorption analyses showed. This observation could be related to the presence of interactions between Pt0 and Al2O3 species that remained after the PtOxAl2O3 species reduction. As was seen by TPR analysis, reducible PtOxAl2O3 species were formed during the calcination of the Pt catalysts. In addition, the PtOxAl2O3 species reduction temperature was 14 points lower for the Pt/γ-AM catalyst than for the Pt/γ-A catalyst, indicating that the interactions were stronger in the Pt/γ-A catalyst than in the Pt/γ-AM catalyst. This temperature reduction could be due to the formation of additional interactions between PtOx and lanthana species that hindered the formation of PtOxAl2O3 species. Therefore, the strong interactions detected in the Pt/γ-A catalyst could have been responsible of the good dispersion of Pt0 species.
3.1.5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
The binding energies (BE) of the Ni 2p3/2, Pt 4d5/2, Al 2p and La 3d5/2 energy levels and the surface Ni/Al and Pt/Al atomic ratios were determined by XPS analysis of the calcined and reduced Ni, Pt and PtNi catalysts. These data are reported in Table 4 .

Furthermore, the catalysts that contained La2O3, as a support modifier, presented binding energies centred around 835.8 eV, which is associated to La2O3 species with high levels of dispersion [44] . These results were corroborated by a high specific area obtained for the catalysts supported on La2O3-modified Al2O3.
The binding energies values for the Ni 2p3/2 core level for calcined Ni and PtNi catalysts were centred on 856.3  0.2 eV. This value was closer to the value reported in the literature for NiAl2O4 phases (856.1  0.1 eV) than for NiO phases (854.5  0.1 eV) [15] ,[17] ,[43] ,[44] . For the reduced catalysts, additional binding energies were detected at 852.2  0.1 eV and 852.8  0.1 eV which are commonly associated with Ni0 phases [15] ,[17] ,[44] .
For the calcined Pt catalysts, just as for the PtNi catalysts, binding energies of the Pt 4d5/2 level were recorded at 317.3 eV and at 315.0 eV, that were related to surface PtO and Pt0 phases, respectively [45] . The detection of surface PtO species indicated that the calcination process only promoted the reduction of some Pt2+ species, hence the TPR profiles showed peaks associated with the reduction of PtO species weakly interacting with the support. In addition to this, the diffractograms indicated that, in the calcined catalysts, only Pt0 species were formed, suggesting that the PtO species were well dispersed on the support. After reduction, however, only binding energies for Pt0 species were detected, except for the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst. For this reduced catalyst the detection of binding energies associated to PtO and Pt0 species indicated that the reduction treatment was not sufficient to change the oxidation state of surface PtO species.
The comparison of binding energy of Pt 4d5/2 core level for reduced Pt and PtNi catalysts showed that binding energy was slightly higher for Pt catalysts (315.0 eV) than for PtNi catalysts (314.5 eV). Bakar et al.
[35] ,[36] assigned this decrease in binding energy to the formation of metallic bonds or alloying. This observation is also supported by XRD results.
As can be observed in Table 4 , the value of the Ni/Al surface atomic ratio obtained from XPS for the calcined Ni/γ-AM catalyst was higher than the value determined for the Ni/γ-A catalyst. This observation suggested that the La2O3 addition to Al2O3 improved the Ni2+ species dispersion [46] . In the case of the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst, however, this effect was not observed. Moreover, for both bimetallic catalysts, the Ni/Al (XPS) atomic ratios were slightly lower than analogous Ni catalysts. These Ni/Al atomic ratio differences could be due to the fact that addition of Pt was done after the Ni incorporation on the supports, favouring Pt deposition over Ni. Then, the Ni presence during Pt addition could be the cause of the lower dispersion showed by Pt on PtNi catalysts as determined by XRD and chemisorption techniques. This theory could be supported by the observation that the Pt/Al surface atomic ratio for the calcined PtNi/γ-A catalyst was slightly higher than analogous Pt/γ-A catalyst.
Decreased surface atomic ratios for the catalysts treated under reducing conditions suggested a possible sinterisation of surface Pt and Ni species [47] . For the PtNi catalysts, the sinterisation phenomenon was corroborated by XRD data. Nevertheless, the Ni/Al atomic ratio drop was much larger than the Pt/Al ratio, which could indicate that the Ni surface species were covered by support species [27] , resulting in the decoration phenomenon [15] ,[17] . This phenomenon was subsequently confirmed by the XRD, the H2 chemisorption [42] and the presence of binding energies attributed to nickel aluminate species. As the literature [32] indicated, the decrease of the surface Ni/Al ratio after reduction could have also been due to the incorporation of metal species into the porous structure of the support, as values for pore volumes derived from N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms demonstrated.
By comparing the surface Ni/Al atomic ratios results obtained for the reduced PtNi and Ni catalysts, it was observed that the ratios were slightly larger for the PtNi catalysts than for the Ni catalysts. This fact suggested that the presence of Pt on the Ni catalysts seemed to limit the loss of Ni0 dispersion [32] . This observation was in agreement with the improvement in dispersion of Ni0 particles dispersion observed by XRD when the Pt was added to the Ni catalysts.
3.2. Catalytic activity
The glycerol conversion, gas total flow, liquid products molar ratios and molar composition data obtained from glycerol conversion, under APR conditions at 498 K and at steady state, are presented in Table 5 . The data predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium (Thermod. Eq.) calculations are also presented here. As can be seen, all of the tested catalysts provided glycerol conversions between 13% and 27%. In comparison with the data presented in the previous work [17] , this represented an improvement in the glycerol conversion. The PtNi/γ-AM catalyst demonstrated the highest glycerol conversion at 498 K, followed by: Ni/γ-A  Ni/γ-AM  PtNi/γ-A > Pt/γ-AM  Pt/γ-A catalysts. However, a lower net formation of H2 and other gas products was observed for all the catalysts because of the smaller gas flows.

This fact indicated that the catalysts were not able to reform the oxygenated hydrocarbons into gaseous products. The gas stream components were discovered to be H2, CO2, CH4 and traces of C2 and C3 alkanes. CO was not detected because the WGS reaction is favoured under APR conditions [9] . The OHCs produced under these conditions were 1,2-propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, ethanol and methanol. According to the literature [48] ,[49] ,[50] ,[51] , these liquid products are formed by dehydration/hydrogenation and CC bond cleavage processes.
The liquid product molar ratios and liquid stream molar composition data for the Ni, Pt and PtNi catalysts indicated that 1,2-propylene glycol was the major detected liquid product. This observation suggested that these catalysts favour dehydration/hydrogenation reactions over CC bond cleavage.Among the Al2O3-supported catalysts, the PtNi/γ-A catalyst showed the best behaviour toward OHCs production, providing a glycerol conversion of 21.2%. Nevertheless, the Ni/γ-A catalyst gave slightly higher glycerol conversion and lower OHCs proportion than the PtNi/γ-A catalyst. These small differences in conversions were possibly related to the Ni/γ-A catalyst capacity to reform glycerol and intermediate liquid products into gaseous products, creating slight enhancement in the gas flow. However, this H2-poor gas stream resulted in a lower H2 yield (see Fig. 3 ). In the case of the Pt/γ-A catalyst, although the gas flow obtained was the same as for the Ni/γ-A catalyst, the glycerol conversion was the lowest among Al2O3-supported catalysts, because it produced lower proportion of liquids products, and the H2 yield produced was the highest, because of its capacity to reform CH4 (the gas chromatography did not detect CH4 in the produced gas stream) into H2.

The presence of La2O3 in the catalysts improved the glycerol conversion (except in the case of the Ni/γ-AM catalyst) and the amount of gas produced and H2 yield when compared with the Al2O3-supported catalysts. The Ni/γ-AM catalyst provided a similar gas flow to the Ni/γ-A catalyst and a lower proportion of OHCs, so the glycerol conversion was slightly lower. In the particular case of the bimetallic catalysts, the addition of La2O3 modifier to the Al2O3 support provided increased gas flow from 0.60 mL(STP)/min for the PtNi/γ-A catalyst to 1.97 mL(STP)/min for the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst and H2 yield from 0.26% to 1.07%.
As the data represented in Fig. 3 shows, the H2 yields obtained with the catalysts were higher than that predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium. Nevertheless, they were low when compared with the yields obtained in conventional steam reforming.
After the experimental test at 498 K and reactivation treatment of all the catalysts at the same conditions employed in the first activation procedure, the operation temperature increased to 513 K. The catalytic activity results obtained and the data predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium at 513 K were then collected and are displayed in Table 6 for monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. Based on the glycerol conversion results, the activities were ordered as follows: PtNi/γ-AM > PtNi/γ-A > Pt/γ-A > Pt/γ-AM > Ni/γ-A > Ni/γ-AM.

Between these catalysts, the PtNi/γ-A catalyst provided the highest glycerol conversion, as witnessed by the major production of gas, H2 yield and OHCs. This improvement observed with the Pt/γ-A and PtNi/γ-A catalysts could be due to the fact that the increased temperature favoured endothermic reactions, as reforming and dehydration.
In the case of the Ni/γ-A catalyst, the temperature enhancement reduced the glycerol conversion from 24.7% to 17% and the activity toward OHCs production, while the produced gas flow and H2 yield increased. The Pt/γ-A catalyst, unlike the Ni/γ-A catalyst, had a lower gas flow and higher values for OHCs production and glycerol conversion. These observations suggested that the glycerol conversion was mainly due to the formation of OHCs, as the results obtained at 498 K indicated.
The presence of La2O3 on the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst was observed to improve the capacity of this bimetallic catalyst to transform more glycerol into gas and liquid products than the PtNi/γ-A catalyst at 513 K. The La2O3 addition also improved the H2 yield obtained.
The glycerol conversion provided by the Pt/γ-AM and Ni/γ-AM catalysts at 513 K was lower than the conversion obtained with the Pt/γ-A and Ni/γ-A catalysts at 513 K. This observation indicated that, in these cases, the addition of La2O3 did not influence the activity of the Pt/γ-A and Ni/γ-A catalysts at the investigated temperature. Nevertheless, the Pt/γ-AM catalyst was able to transform more glycerol into liquid products than the Ni/γ-AM catalyst with the increase in temperature, whereas the Ni/γ-AM catalyst was able to produce more gas flow than the Pt/γ-AM catalyst. Even though low gas flows were measured for Pt/γ-AM catalyst, this catalyst, as well as the rest of Pt catalysts, provided higher H2 yields than Ni catalysts as a result of their capacity to transform CH4 into H2. On the other hand, the conversions obtained with the Ni/γ-AM and Ni/γ-A catalysts at 513 K were lower than those obtained at 498 K. These results indicated that the Ni catalysts seemed to suffer from deactivation.
The Ni/γ-A and the Pt/γ-A catalysts formed higher proportions of 1,2-propylene glycol at 513 K (4.3% and 7.4%, respectively) than C1C2 oxygenated hydrocarbons (2.4% and 6.9%, respectively), indicating that these catalysts were slightly more active toward dehydration/hydrogenation reactions. For the PtNi/γ-A catalyst, the sum of ethylene glycol, ethanol and methanol (23.9%) was considerably higher than the proportion of 1,2-propylene glycol (17.7%), suggesting that this bimetallic catalyst had higher affinity for CC bond cleavage than for dehydration/hydrogenation. Furthermore, the Ni/γ-AM, Pt/γ-AM and PtNi/γ-AM catalysts presented more activity toward dehydration/hydrogenation than the Ni/γ-A and Pt/γ-A catalysts, as seen from their higher production of 1,2-propylene glycol.
As the activity results suggest, the oxygenated hydrocarbons produced at 513 K were the same detected at 498 K. However, taking into account the proportion of 1,2-propylene glycol and C1C2 oxygenated hydrocarbons at different temperatures, the proportion of C1C2 oxygenated hydrocarbons increased with the temperature for the Pt/γ-A and PtNi/γ-A catalysts. This phenomenon indicated that the temperature enhancement favoured the CC bond cleavage. The cleavage of this type of bond could be promoted by the active phase of the catalysts or by the degradation of oxygenated hydrocarbons that occurs when the temperature increases [50] . CC bond cleavage [9] , favoured at higher temperatures, could also be responsible of the improvement observed in the H2 yields obtained.
It is important to remember that the values for glycerol conversion and products ratios reflected in Table 1 , Table 2 corresponded to the steady state. These values, however, were not stable during the first few hours of reaction, as can be seen in Fig. 4 . In this figure the evolution of the activity results with the time on stream for the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst is presented. This catalyst was chosen as it presented the best behaviour under the APR conditions. The rest of the catalysts, however, showed similar activity evolution to the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst.

This figure shows a rapid deactivation of catalysts during the first 24 h of reaction, being more pronounced at 498 K than at 513 K. At 498 K, the steady state was achieved after 23 h, while at 513 K the steady state was reached at approximately 4 h into the reaction.
3.3. Spent catalysts characterisation by TPO
The data derived from TPO analysis of the spent catalysts are collected in Table 7 . These data indicated that carbonaceous species were deposited on the catalysts under the APR conditions.
Table 7. Data obtained from thermogravimetric analysis of the Ni, Pt and PtNi catalysts used under APR conditions.
Catalyst C (g)/(g) catalyst Ni/γ-A 0.126 Pt/γ-A 0.181 PtNi/γ-A 0.099 Ni/γ-AM 0.146 Pt/γ-AM 0.178 PtNi/γ-AM 0.082 By comparing the amount of carbonaceous species deposited on the catalysts, it was observed that the PtNi catalysts had less carbonaceous deposits than the Ni and Pt catalysts. Praserthdam et al.
[52] reported that H2 spill-over on the surface of the catalysts could reduce the amount of coke deposits by gasification. In this sense, Shamsi et al.
[53] reported that soft coke, which is produced from secondary reaction products or intermediates, can be gasified by treatment in hydrogen. According to Trimm et al.
[54] , reduction of carbon formation could be due to the generation of alloys interferes with the process of carbon dissolution. On the other hand, between the Ni and Pt catalysts, the Pt catalysts produced higher amounts of carbonaceous species. In the case of modified support catalysts, except for the Ni/γ-AM catalyst, the presence of La2O3 slightly reduced the formation of carbonaceous deposits possibly due to the capacity of the La2O3 to promote coke gasification [55] . In this process, the La2O3 facilitates the removal of coke deposited on the catalyst through the formation of lanthana oxicarbonate species, La2O2CO3, because of its capacity to capture CO2 [30] ,[31] . The oxicarbonate species then promote the formation of a NiLa interphase in which the gasification of the adsorbed intermediate precursors of carbonaceous species [55] occurs by means of the following reaction, where S is the catalyst surface [56] : La2O2CO3 + CS  La2O3 + 2CO + S Focusing on the oxidation profiles for spent monometallic and bimetallic catalysts represented in Fig. 5 , it can be observed that the addition of La2O3 slightly reduced the oxidation temperature of various carbonaceous species. This indicated that the carbonaceous deposits generated in the La2O3-modified catalysts were more easily oxidised than those formed in the Al2O3-supported catalysts.

The oxidation profiles of the Pt/γ-A, Pt/γ-AM, PtNi/γ-A and PtNi/γ-AM catalysts showed a single weight loss event. This event appeared as a broad peak in the temperature range of 700800 K. The shape of the peak suggested that there was heterogeneity in the formed carbonaceous deposits [57] . In addition, the oxidation peak observed for the Pt and PtNi catalysts was centred at a temperature of 750 K. According to the literature [58] ,[59] , peaks registered at temperatures above 773 K are typically ascribed to coke with different degrees of graphitisation. Furthermore, this type of coke is commonly designated as catalytic coke since participation of metallic centres is required for its formation. The oxidation peaks registered at temperatures lower than 773 K could be associated to filamentous or encapsulated carbonaceous deposits [60] . The filamentous coke could be formed from nucleation of graphitic coke [59] , so filamentous coke formation also needs the presence of metallic centres [53] . Therefore, the oxidation peak showed by Pt and PtNi catalysts could be attributed to filamentous or encapsulated coke. Nevertheless, a slight weight loss was observed at temperatures above 773 K in the PtNi/γ-A and Pt/γ-A catalysts, suggesting the presence of a small amount of graphitic coke [59] . According to Valant et al.
[61] , the TPO of Rh based catalysts showed peaks at temperatures below 793 K, being ascribed to coke deposited on metallic centres and coke deposits near to the metal-support interface. Terry et al. reported [62] that the participation of metallic centres on coke formation could result in coke deposits on surface, which can encapsulate the metal and deactivate the catalyst, or coke dissolution on the metal and subsequent precipitation on the top of the support to form a filament. Taking into account all mentioned above, it seems that the encapsulated coke is formed on metallic centres and filamentous coke emerges from metal-support interface.
The weight loss profiles of the Ni/γ-A and Ni/γ-AM catalysts presented two, or even three, stages of weight loss at different temperatures. For the Ni/γ-A catalyst, two oxidation peaks were detected at 610 K and 750 K. In the case of the Ni/γ-AM catalyst, however, three oxidation peaks were registered at 490 K, 603 K and 771 K. The peaks detected at higher temperatures could be attributed to filamentous or encapsulated coke [59] , while the peaks at temperatures below 630 K were ascribed to easily oxidised amorphous monatomic carbon or to desorption of H2O adsorbed on the support [55] ,[56] . These observations suggested that, carbonaceous species and the proportion of the adsorbed species on the catalysts contributed in the carbon amount determined for Ni catalysts (see Table 7 ).
The detection of a peak at 490 K in the Ni/γ-AM catalyst, but not in the Ni/γ-A catalyst suggested the presence of adsorbed CO2. This was not implausible, since La2O3 is known to capture CO2 [55] . According to Koo et al.
[63] , the oxidation peaks detected below 573 K correspond to the removal of adsorbed CO2. This piece of information indicated that the Pt/γ-AM and PtNi/γ-AM catalysts should have had a peak around 490 K, but it was likely not detected. Based on the literature [64] , CO2 adsorption takes place in the adsorption centres near the metallic particles. Likewise, Lin et al.
[65] indicated that the perovskites also had the capacity to adsorb CO2. In addition, Zhang et al.
[66] suggested that the La2O3 generated from La2NiO4-type perovskites was transformed into La2O2CO3 due to the adsorption of CO2. Based on these affirmations, La2O3 adsorption centres near to Ni species, formed from perovskite species, were thought to favour the CO2 adsorption. Therefore, in the case of Pt/γ-AM, a peak corresponding to CO2 adsorption was not detected since perovskites were not present in this catalyst and the proportion of metallic species was low. The perovskites proportion on the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst was much lower than in the Ni/γ-AM catalyst [15] , due to the proportion of reducible species in the temperature range of 8001150 K being lower for the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst, as shown by the TPR profiles. For this reason, the peak attributed to CO2 adsorption in the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst was not registered.
3.4. Correlation between catalytic activity and catalysts characteristics
As the activity results indicate, glycerol is transformed into OHCs, especially 1,2-propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, ethanol and methanol, under APR conditions. These products detected in the output liquid stream were typically obtained from glycerol hydrogenolysis [48] ,[49] ,[50] ,[51] . This observation suggested that hydrogenolysis process favour these by-products formation more than the APR process, in which H2 and CO2 [9] ,[10] ,[11] are mainly produced. In accordance with the literature [12] , it has been observed that bimetallic catalysts show better activity results than monometallic catalysts at 498 K and 513 K. In addition, the increase in temperature enhanced the activity of Pt and PtNi catalysts, while activity of the Ni catalysts decreased, probably due to the deactivation. In addition, the H2 yields also increased with the temperature, possibly due to the endothermic characteristic of the reforming process. On the other hand, the activity results showed that La2O3 presence also improved the H2 yield by increasing Ni0 dispersion in Ni/γ-AM catalyst and surface exposure of Ni in PtNi/γ-AM catalyst.
As can be seen in Fig. 6 , in general, the activity results have showed that the activity order of the catalysts at 498 K was as follows: PtNi  Ni > Pt. The activity of the PtNi/γ-A, Ni/γ-AM and Ni/γ-A catalysts, however, was essentially similar. In addition, the dispersion on the reduced catalysts followed an inverse order of activity. These observations both suggested that the lower dispersion provided a higher catalytic activity under APR conditions. According to Miyazawa et al.
[49] during the hydrogenolysis of glycerol over noble catalysts, the selectivity toward 1,2-propylene glycol is minor for well-dispersed particles. Based on this study and taking into account higher amounts of 1,2-propylene glycol were produced during glycerol APR, it was possible to conclude that the activity of the prepared catalysts was due to the lower dispersion. Wang et al.
[67] reported that relatively larges Ag-Au alloy particles showed exceptional high activity in CO oxidation. On the other hand, a low dispersion could favour the reactant adsorption in the active sites [68] . In addition, the activity of PtNi catalysts can also be supported on that the effect of the addition of small amounts of Pt favoured the formation of nickel-platinum alloy and H2 spill-over. The alloys formation also contributed to this enhanced reactivity [35] and hindered the carbon dissolution [54] . The H2 spill-over provided resistance toward coke deposition [52] . In the case of Ni and Pt catalysts, it is interesting remind that the amount of Ni was quite higher than that of Pt.
Download: Download full-size image Fig. 6. Glycerol conversions obtained with the Pt, Ni and PtNi catalysts at 4 MPa, WHSV = 2 h1, 498 K () and 513 K () (steady state 2730 h).When the temperature increased (see Fig. 5 ), the activity order of the catalysts was modified to the following: PtNi > Pt  Ni. Surprisingly, the activity orders of the Pt and Ni catalysts changed, despite the Pt catalysts having better dispersion of metallic phases than the Ni catalysts. The activity decrease of the Ni catalysts was probably due to the catalysts undergoing changes to its properties after use in the reaction.
The results derived from the TPO analysis indicated that carbonaceous species were generated during glycerol liquid conversion. Moreover, it seemed that this species were deposited as a layer on the active metallic phases of the catalysts, partially blocking the active centres. This blocking effect could have produced the rapid deactivation observed for the Pt, Ni and PtNi catalysts during the first 8 h of reaction at 498 K and 513 K. The activity of the catalysts remained steady over the last 10 h of reaction, however, indicating that the influence of the carbonaceous deposits on the activity of the catalysts waned. In this sense, it is likely that coke produced during first reaction hours was formed in the metallic centres and then migrated to metal-support interface, where the filamentous coke was generated. In addition, the filamentous coke was not harmful to the catalysts [69] .
In the particular case of the Ni catalysts, the deactivation did not seem to be related to the amount of carbonaceous deposits, because they produced lower amount of coke than Pt catalysts under the same conditions. This deactivation could be due to the oxidation of the metallic Ni phases, which are typically more easily oxidised than metallic Pt phases. The TPO analysis also revealed the presence of adsorbed H2O in the Ni catalysts. Therefore, deactivation of the Ni catalysts could be associated with oxidation of the metallic Ni promoted by the presence of adsorbed H2O. This suggestion was supported by the characterisation results of the Ni/A-Z catalyst [17] , which indicated that the complete loss of its catalytic activity was due to the oxidation of Ni0 species to Ni2+.
Regarding the main reaction product, it is important to remark research published in the literature on glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-propylene glycol uses an external hydrogen addition in batch reactors employing catalytic systems mainly based on Cu and noble metals [48] ,[49] ,[50] ,[51] ,[70] ,[71] ,[72] . This work, however, showed that it is possible to obtain good glycerol conversions when using bimetallic catalysts in a continuous fixed bed reactor.
4. Conclusions
The main goal of this work was to investigate catalysts activity and stability for the glycerol valorisation by liquid phase reforming. According to the literature, the liquid phase reforming is used to produce H2. However, the activity results showed that glycerol conversion was especially due to the formation of liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons, mainly 1,2-propylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which are formed from glycerol hydrogenolysis, and the stability was reached after approximately 10 h of reaction.
Among the catalysts, the bimetallic ones presented the better behaviour, especially PtNi/γ-AM at 513 K, because of their lower metallic dispersion, as possible result of the presence of Pt-Ni alloy, and the H2 spill-over, which seem to be adequate for hydrogenolysis process. Thus, the highest glycerol conversion and selectivity toward oxygenated hydrocarbons obtained with bimetallic catalysts can be associated to a synergistic effect between two metals [73] , Pt and Ni. Regarding the Ni catalysts, they suffered from deactivation, especially at higher temperature that can be associated to the oxidation of metallic active centres.
