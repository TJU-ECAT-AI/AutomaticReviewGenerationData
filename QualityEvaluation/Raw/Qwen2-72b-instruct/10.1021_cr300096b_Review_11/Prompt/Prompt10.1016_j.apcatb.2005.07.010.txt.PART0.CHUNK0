Aqueous-phase reforming of ethylene glycol over supported Pt and Pd bimetallic catalysts Abstract More than 130 Pt and Pd bimetallic catalysts were screened for hydrogen production by aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of ethylene glycol solutions using a high-throughput reactor. Promising catalysts were characterized by CO chemisorption and tested further in a fixed bed reactor. Bimetallic PtNi, PtCo, PtFe and PdFe catalysts were significantly more active per gram of catalyst and had higher turnover frequencies for hydrogen production ( ) than monometallic Pt and Pd catalysts. The PtNi/Al2O3 and PtCo/Al2O3 catalysts, with Pt to Co or Ni atomic ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:9, had values (based on CO chemisorption uptake) equal to 2.85.2 min1 at 483 K for APR of ethylene glycol solutions, compared to 1.9 min1 for Pt/Al2O3 under similar reaction conditions. A Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 catalyst showed values of 0.34.3 min1 at 453483 K, about three times higher than Pt/Al2O3 under identical reaction conditions. A Pd1Fe9/Al2O3 catalyst had values of equal to 1.4 and 4.3 min1 at temperatures of 453 and 483 K, respectively, and these values are 3946 times higher than Pd/Al2O3 at the same reaction conditions. Catalysts consisting of Pd supported on high surface area Fe2O3 (Nanocat) showed the highest turnover frequencies for H2 production among those catalysts tested, with values of equal to 14.6, 39.1 and 60.1 min1 at temperatures of 453, 483 and 498 K, respectively. These results suggest that the activity of Pt-based catalysts for APR can be increased by alloying Pt with a metal (Ni or Co) that decreases the strengths with which CO and hydrogen interact with the surface (because these species inhibit the reaction), thereby increasing the fraction of catalytic sites available for reaction with ethylene glycol. The activity of Pd-based catalysts for APR can be increased by adding a water-gas shift promoter (e.g. Fe2O3).
1. Introduction
Fuel cells are promising devices for clean and efficient generation of power for global energy needs, and the full environmental benefits of hydrogen fuel cells are realized when hydrogen is produced from renewable resources, such as biomass. We have recently developed a process to produce H2 by aqueous-phase-reforming (APR) of renewable biomass derived oxygenated molecules (e.g. ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol) [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] . No net CO2 is produced in making H2 by APR of biomass resources (excluding CO2 made from fossil fuels during biomass production and transportation to a biorefinery [11] ), because CO2 formed during reforming is consumed by further biomass growth. The APR process involves CC bond cleavage combined with water-gas shift in a single reactor producing low levels of CO (<1000 ppm), whereas conventional steam reforming of hydrocarbons requires a series of reactors for hydrogen production [2] . The APR process occurs in the liquid phase, eliminating the need to vaporize the aqueous feedstock and improving the overall thermal efficiency of the process.The desired reaction pathway for production of H2 by APR reactions involves cleavage of CC bonds as well as CH and/or OH bonds to form adsorbed species on the catalyst surface. Adsorbed CO must be removed from the catalyst surface by the water-gas shift reaction to form CO2 and H2, because high surface coverages by CO lead to low catalytic activity. Byproducts may be formed via series pathways that involve hydrogenation of adsorbed CO and CO2 to form alkanes. Alkane byproducts can also form by parallel pathways involving cleavage of CO bonds. Thus, good APR catalysts must have high rates of CC bond cleavage and water-gas shift reaction, whereas these catalysts must have low rates of CO bond cleavage and hydrogenation of CO or CO2.Initial studies found that the activity (in terms of CO2 production rate) of silica-supported monometallic catalysts for the APR of ethylene glycol decreased in the following order [3] : The selectivity of these catalysts for H2 production decreased in the following order [3] : Further studies showed that catalysts consisting of Pt supported on alumina, carbon and titania were more active by over one order of magnitude compared to Pt supported on silica for H2 production by APR of ethylene glycol [8] . Therefore, in the present study, we have chosen to conduct further screening studies with alumina-supported catalysts using a high-throughput reactor (HTR) and fixed bed reactor, in an attempt to identify more active bimetallic catalysts for H2 production by the APR process.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation and characterization
The preparation and characterization of SiO2 supported Pt, Ni, Rh, Ru and Pd catalysts tested in this study are reported elsewhere [3] . A 3 wt.% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. Tetra-amine platinum nitrate (Strem Chemicals) was dissolved in water and added drop wise to Catapal-B γ-Al2O3 (Condea) until incipient wetness. The weight ratio of metal solution to Al2O3 was 0.61.0. The catalyst was then dried in an oven overnight at 373 K and calcined at 533 K for 3 h in flowing 20% O2 in He.
More than 70 alumina-supported Pt-bimetallic catalysts were tested for this study. To prepare the Pt-bimetallic catalysts the following metals salts were added to Pt/Al2O3 and Al2O3 by incipient wetness impregnation:
1.
Noble metals (Strem): Ru (ruthenium (III) nitrosyl nitrate), Rh (rhodium (III) nitrate), Pd (tetraammine palladium (II) nitrate), Ag (silver (I) nitrate), Au (hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (III) hydrate), and Ir (dihydrogen hexachloroiridate (IV) hydrate) at a Pt to noble metal atomic ratio of (2:1), (1:1), (1:2) and (0:1).
2.
Base metals (Strem): Co (cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate), Fe (iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate), Ni (nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate), and Cu (copper (II) nitrate trihydrate) at a Pt to base metal atomic ratio of (1:1), (1:5), (1:9) and (0:1).
3.
Reducible oxides (Aldrich): Ce (cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate), Mn (manganese (II) nitrate), Zn (zinc (II) nitrate, Strem), Mg (magnesium (II) nitrate), Ti (titanium (III) chloride), Mo (ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate), Cr (chromium (III) nitrate nonahydrate), K (potassium hydroxide), and Gd (gadolinium (III) nitrate hexahydrate) at 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 wt.% metal oxide.
After incipient wetness impregnation, the metal solutioncatalyst support mixture was dried under air at 373 K for 212 h. Multiple impregnations were required for some catalysts to achieve the desired loading of the second metal. The dried catalysts were then calcined at 533 K in air overnight. Monometallic catalysts supported on Nanocat (Fe2O3, BET surface area = 250 m2 g1, Mach I) were also prepared by this same technique.
Catalysts tested in the fixed bed reactor were characterized by CO chemisorption at 300 K, as described elsewhere [3] . Chemisorption measurements were performed on catalysts after reduction in flowing H2, and the number of catalytic surface sites was taken to be equal to the irreversible CO uptake. The metal loadings of catalysts tested in the fixed bed reactor were verified by atomic absorption spectroscopy of the calcined samples (AAS/ICP).
2.2. Reactors
2.2.1. High-throughput reactor
The high-throughput reactor (HTR) consists of 48 wells machined into a rectangular stainless steel block. The wells are 6 mm i.d. with 2 and 11 mm spacing between each well hole (see Fig. 1 ). Amounts of catalyst from 2 to 100 mg were loaded into 1 mL Pyrex vials and placed in the HTR wells. A graphite gasket (0.020 in. thick, Grafoil Grade GTB, Graftech Inc.) was placed on the reactor block, and a common headspace top plate ( Fig. 1 A) was bolted on top to allow gas flow through the reactor. The catalysts were reduced by placing the sealed reactor into a furnace, introducing flowing H2, and linearly ramping the temperature from 300 to 723 K over 8 h and holding at 723 K for 2 h. After reduction of the catalysts, the reactor was held at 723 K while He was passed through the reactor for 30 min to remove H2. The reactor was then cooled to room temperature in flowing He and sealed under He (5 psig) for transport to a glovebox. Inside the glove box, the common headspace top plate and graphite gasket were removed under a He atmosphere, and 400 μL of aqueous ethylene glycol or methanol feed solution was added to each of the vials with a pipettor. A silicone rubber gasket (1/16 in. thick, FDA Grade, 60 A, McMaster-Carr), degassed by heating in air to 513 K for 4 h, was placed on the reactor. Finally, the reactor was sealed using the isolated headspace top plate ( Fig. 1 B and C) and the bolts tightened to 30 in-lbf with a torque wrench.

Photos and schematic of high-throughput reactor showing (A) reactor with common headspace top plate (used for catalyst reduction) (B) reactor with isolated headspace plate (used for reaction and GC analysis) and (C) schematic of cross section of high-throughput reactor with isolated headspace plate.
The reaction was carried out by heating the reactor to the reaction temperature over 90 min and holding for 5 h, during which time the temperature gradient between wells was measured to be less than 1 K. Afterwards, the reactor was removed from the furnace and cooled by flowing air from 483 to 423 K (the temperature at which the reaction rate is negligible) in 4 min.
After the reactor reached room temperature, 50 μL of gas was removed from each well with a SampleLock Syringe (Model 1725SL, Hamilton) and injected into a Shimaduza GC with a Hayesep DB column and TCD detector. The GC was kept at 313 K and was used to analyze the reaction gases for H2, He and CH4 over a 6 min period.
The liquid phase products were analyzed by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). Droplets of the product solution (2.5 μL) were placed on a silica gel TLC plate (SiO2 layer 250 μm, EMD Chemicals). The plate was then developed using a methanolmethylene chloride solution for about 15 min. The methanolmethylene chloride ratio was adjusted depending on the product being analyzed. After the products were separated on the TLC plate, the plate was dried with flowing air and stained with a mixture of KMnO4 (3 g), K2CO3 (20 g), 5 wt.% aqueous NaOH solution (5 wt.%) and DI water (100 mL). The finished TLC plate was then scanned into a computer and analyzed with Scion Image software.
2.2.2. Fixed bed reactor
Promising catalysts from high-throughput studies were tested further in a fixed bed reactor system. This system utilizes a 6.3 mm o.d. (1/4 in.) and 5 mm i.d. stainless steel tubular reactor with a packed bed of powder catalyst held in place with quartz wool plugs. The furnace is a close-fitting, well-insulated aluminum block, heated externally with high temperature heat tape. This construction allows for effective heat transfer to the reactor wall and provides isothermal operation of the reaction zone. Prior to collecting reaction kinetics data, each catalyst was reduced in flowing H2 at 523 or 723 K.
After reduction of the catalyst, the reactor was cooled below 323 K, and N2 (500 cm3(STP) min1) was used to flush the reactor to remove adsorbed hydrogen. An ethylene glycol solution in deionized water was then introduced in an up-flow configuration with an HPLC pump (typically flowrate of 0.020.32 cm3/min), and the reactor was heated to reaction temperature over a 1 h time period. The total pressure of the system was maintained above the vapor pressure of water using a back pressure regulator and N2 carrier gas which bubbles through the effluent to sweep gaseous products to gas chromatographs (GCs) equipped with thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) for analysis. Hydrogen was separated via a Porapak Q column, while CO2 and alkanes were separated by a Hayesep D column. Carbon monoxide was detected by an infrared CO analyzer (Siemens Ultramat 5E). Liquid products were collected in the gas-liquid separator and analyzed after each run with a GC equipped with a flame-ionization detector (FID) and an Innowax column. Reaction kinetics data were collected from 6 to 24 h time on stream for each set of reaction conditions to assure that steady state was reached.
3. Results
3.1. Initial high-throughput reactor testing
Initial HTR studies for APR of a 0.4 wt.% glycerol solution using 3 wt.% Pt/Al2O3 catalysts showed that at conversions lower than 40%, the quantity of H2 produced and glycerol conversion increase linearly with the amount of catalyst. We note that the H2 detected by the GC was lower than the amount that would theoretically be produced by the conversion of glycerol. For example, at a conversion of 40%, 48 μmol H2 should be produced, but the GC measured only 20 μmol H2. This difference is probably caused by leakage of high pressure H2 either from the sealed well or the syringe prior to injection into the GC. No spatial variation was observed inside the HTR when the same catalyst was loaded into every well. This result indicates that all catalysts were subjected to similar pretreatments and similar reaction conditions.
Another initial test of the HTR is shown in Fig. 2 in which silica-supported monometallic catalysts were screened for APR of an aqueous 5 wt.% ethylene glycol solution. This figure shows that methane is produced even when no catalyst is in the HTR well, and this product must be caused by reaction of the silicone rubber gasket with water. Thus, to measure the methane from the APR reaction, the methane baseline values from the empty wells are subtracted from the amounts of methane that are formed in wells containing catalysts. The empty wells also showed a small amount of H2, which may be from leakage of H2 from nearby reaction wells. As shown in Fig. 2 , the activity of silica-supported monometallic catalysts in terms of H2 production decreases in the order: Download: Download full-size image Fig. 2. Comparison of high throughput reactor (HTR) with fixed bed reactor [3] for aqueous phase reforming of 5 wt.% ethylene glycol solutions over silica-supported monometallic catalysts. Key: Black, micromoles H2 from HTR; dark gray,from fixed bed reactor; light gray, micromoles CH4 from HTR; and white,from fixed bed reactor. Each point represents the average of six replicate wells. Each well contains the same number of surface sites based on CO chemisorption.
It is hard to measure the activity or selectivity of the Pd catalyst because it is so low. The selectivity to H2 in the high throughput reactor decreases in the order: The data from the HTR are in good agreement with the data from the fixed bed reactor reported by Davda et al.
[3] also shown in Fig. 2 . The major difference between these two reactors is that Rh and Ru both produce a large amount of H2 in the HTR, but little H2 in the fixed bed reactor. The Ru and Rh catalyst both produce similar amounts of CH4 in the fixed bed and HTR; therefore, the HTR is an adequate tool for screening the selectivity of this reaction. However, it is difficult to measure the selectivity of catalysts with low activity, such as Pd, in the HTR because of leakage of gases across the septum and CH4 production from the gasket.
3.2. Pt-bimetallic catalysts
Studies of Pt-bimetallic catalysts in the HTR show that addition of Ni, Co and Fe to 3 wt.% Pt/Al2O3 increases the catalytic activity for H2 production by two to three times on a mass basis, as shown in Fig. 3 . The conversion of ethylene glycol increases from 8 to 40% while maintaining high H2 selectivity when Ni is added to Pt at a 1:5 Pt:Ni atomic ratio. Similarly, the addition of Co to Pt at a 1:5 Pt:Co atomic ratio causes the conversion to increase from 10 to 40% with high selectivity to H2. The conversion can be increased from 10 to 30% by the addition of Fe to Pt at a 1:1 Pt:Fe atomic ratio again with high selectivity to H2. The activity of Pd-based catalysts can be improved by addition of Fe which causes a significant increase in the H2 production rate, as shown in Fig. 3 .

Results from high throughput testing of bimetallic catalysts produced by addition of Ni, Co and Fe to Pt/Al2O3 (3 wt.% Pt) and Fe to Pd/Al2O3 (3 wt.% Pd) ( micromoles H2, () micromoles CH4, and () conversion (%)) for aqueous-phase reforming of 2 wt.% ethylene glycol at 473 K for 7.5 h. Each point represents the average of four replicate wells containing the same amount of each catalyst and error bars are one standard deviation.
The results from the HTR for the PtNi and PtCo catalysts are in good agreement with data collected using a fixed bed reactor, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4 , Fig. 5 . The addition of Ni to Pt/Al2O3 more than doubles the turnover frequency for H2 production ( ) for Pt1Ni1/Al2O3 compared to Pt/Al2O3, while maintaining high H2 selectivity ( Fig. 4 A). Addition of more Ni leads to lower values of and eventually production of alkane byproducts, both characteristics of pure Ni catalysts. Interestingly, Pt1Ni8/Al2O3 produces only 1.2% alkanes, compared to 30.4% for Ni/Al2O3.
Fig. 4 C shows that the rate of H2 production is increased to as high as 525 μmol H2 gcat1 min1 for Pt1Ni8 compared to 150 μmol H2 gcat1 min1 for Pt/Al2O3 at 483 K. This large increase is caused by the higher ( Fig. 4 A) and the higher site density ( Fig. 4 C) for the PtNi catalysts. Thus, alloying inexpensive Ni with Pt leads to more catalytic sites, each with higher activity than pure Pt.

The addition of Co to Pt/Al2O3 also doubles the of these catalysts, similar to PtNi bimetallic catalysts ( Fig. 4 B). The presence of a small amount of Pt in Pt1Co9/Al2O3 completely suppresses the alkane production of Co/Al2O3, while increasing the by a factor of 15. The promoting effect of Co, however, is limited to this improvement in because no increase in the number of catalytic sites is observed when Co is added to Pt/Al2O3. Thus, the rate of H2 production increases to 377 μmol H2 gcat1 min1 for Pt1Co9/Al2O3 at 483 K ( Fig. 4 D), which is not as high as the rates observed for PtNi bimetallics.
Higher reaction temperature leads to higher rates of H2 production, as shown in Fig. 5 . The rates over Pt/Al2O3, Pt1Ni1/Al2O3 and Pt1Co5/Al2O3 increase dramatically between 483 and 498 K, but bimetallic catalysts with high base metal content do not perform well at 498 K because of catalyst deactivation. Pure Ni/Al2O3 catalysts deactivate over a period of hours from sintering of Ni particles in the aqueous environment [5] ,[9] . Similarly, catalysts with high Co content lose activity from elution of the metal into the reactor effluent, as observed by trace metal analysis. In contrast, the stability of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts is only limited by the degradation of the alumina carrier over a period of weeks or months. Thus, Pt1Ni1/Al2O3 and Pt1Co5/Al2O3 become the catalysts of choice for high temperature operations, with values of equal to 8.1 and 10.4 min1, respectively, and with lower amounts of alkane byproducts than Pt/Al2O3. These catalysts produce H2 at rates near or above 600 μmol min1 gcat1.
3.3. Iron promoted catalysts
Iron oxide is used commercially as a water-gas shift catalyst [12] . Also, Nanocat (Fe2O3, 250 m2/g) has previously been shown to have high activity for CO oxidation [13] . Catalysts consisting of metals (including Ni, Pt, Cu, Au, Co, Pd, Rh, Ir and Ru) supported on Nanocat were prepared and tested for APR of methanol in the HTR. Previous results have shown that catalysts with high activity for APR of ethylene glycol also have high activity for APR of methanol [1] ,[6] ,[7] . Thus, methanol is another effective probe molecule for the APR reaction. Palladium supported on Nanocat had the highest activity for APR of methanol of the monometallic/Fe2O3 catalysts. The only other metal that increased the activity of Fe2O3 for APR was Pt; however, Pt/Fe2O3 was only slightly more active than Fe2O3. The optimal Pd loading of the Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts was 6 wt.%. Bimetallic Pd/alumina catalysts were tested further in the HTR, including 40 Pd-bimetallics of Pd-Fe, Pd-Ni, Pd-Co and Pd-Mn. The high-throughput studies showed that Pd-Fe was the most active Pd-based bimetallic system, with Ni, Co and Mn giving slight promotional effects. As shown in Fig. 4 , the addition of Fe to Pd/Al2O3 causes a significant increase in the rate of hydrogen production. In contrast to PtFe, which showed a maximum rate of hydrogen production at a Pt:Fe ratio of 1:1 ( Fig. 3 ), the maximum in the rate of hydrogen production for the PdFe system is observed at or above a Pd:Fe atomic ratio of 1:18.
Table 2 lists data from the fixed bed reactor for APR of a 5 wt.% ethylene glycol solution over the alumina-supported bimetallic Pt1Fe9, Pd1Fe9 and monometallic Pt and Pd catalysts. Each experimental point was taken after 15 h time on stream. To study catalyst stability the data were collected at 453 K first, then at 423, 483 K and then again at 453 K for the PtFe and PdFe catalysts. The experimental points in Table 2 are listed in the order in which they were collected. The H2 selectivity in Table 2 is over 100% for some of the data because some of the H2 comes from dehydrogenation of ethylene glycol to produce glycolaldehyde, and the H2 selectivity only takes into account the gas phase molecules [7] . The data in Table 2 cannot be directly compared with the data from Table 1 because the data in the two tables are collected at different pressures. We have previously shown that increasing the system pressure decreases the reaction rate for APR with a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst [6] .

Iron has a promotional effect on both Pd and Pt catalysts, as shown in Table 2 . The for Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 is three times higher than for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at temperatures ranging from 423 to 453 K. At a temperature of 498 K the values of for Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 are similar, giving activation energies of 82 and 98 kJ mol1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6 .

Arrhenius plot for production of H2 by aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol solutions (reaction conditions: 5 wt.% feed at a system pressure 1 bar above the bubblepoint at each temperature) after catalyst reduction at 523 K (Pt-based catalysts) or 473 K (Pd-based catalysts). (Key: () Pt/Al2O3, () Pd/Al2O3, () Pt/Fe2O3, () Pd/Fe2O3, () Pt1Fe9/Al2O3, () Pd1Fe9/Al2O3.) The values of for Pd1Fe9/Al2O3 are 39 and 46 times higher than Pd/Al2O3 at temperatures of 453 and 483 K, respectively. Thus, iron has a larger promotional effect on Pd than it does on Pt. The Pd1Fe9/Al2O3 catalyst has a comparable with that of Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 at temperatures from 423 to 483 K. However, the Pd1Fe9/Al2O3 catalyst deactivates more extensively than Pt1Fe9/Al2O3, losing 80% of its activity after heating to 483 K under APR conditions. The Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 lost only 20% of its activity when treated in the same way. The 6 wt.% Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst had the highest of any catalyst tested, but did not have many surface sites (8 μmol g1), as titrated by CO adsorption. Unfortunately, the 6 wt.% Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst also deactivated, losing 50% of its activity after it was heated to 483 K under reaction conditions. A 3 wt.% Pt/Fe2O3 catalyst had low activity, as shown in Table 2 .
Fig. 6 shows the rate of H2 production per gcat over Pt/Al2O3, Pd/Al2O3, Pt/Fe2O3, Pd/Fe2O3, Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 and Pd1Fe9/Al2O3. As can be seen from this figure at temperatures lower than 460 K, the catalytic activity per gram decreases in the order Pd/Fe2O3  Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 > Pt/Al2O3  Pd1Fe9/Al2O3 Pt/Fe2O3 > Pt/Al2O3. Future catalyst development work should focus on how to prepare more stable PtFe and PdFe catalysts as well as how to prepare PdFe catalysts that have higher dispersions.
4. Discussion
4.1. High-throughput reactor
In an attempt to develop more active catalysts for APR, we developed a reactor to rapidly screen catalysts for our aqueous-phase reaction conditions. In our traditional APR fixed bed reactor, one catalyst is tested in a 34 h period. This amount of time includes 10 h for the reduction and 24 h time-on stream. High-throughput testing of catalysts, in which multiple catalysts are tested in a single reactor system, is a common method to rapidly screen a large number of catalysts [14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] . The APR reaction conditions required a unique high-throughput reactor to be designed. The APR reaction takes place in the aqueous-phase at high temperature (473 K), requiring the reactor system to maintain elevated pressures (e.g. 20 bar). The feed is a liquid, and the products are in the gas phase.
The HTR contained 48 reaction wells, and required approximately 30 h to run. This period of time includes 10 h to reduce the catalysts, 2 h to add the feed to the reactor in the glove box, 6.5 h for the actual reaction, 1 h for cooling of the reactor, 5 h for gas phase GC analysis, and 5 h for TLC analysis. Typically we tested each catalyst four times; therefore, catalysts could be screened over 12 times faster in the HTR than in the fixed bed reactor. The number of replicates necessary in the HTR is determined by the quality of data desired. If the goal of the study is to discover catalysts that are significantly more active than the base catalyst, then few replicates are needed. However, if it is desired to identify catalysts that are only slightly more active than the base catalyst, then more replicates are needed.
Examples of standard deviations from our HTR are shown in Fig. 3 . It is likely that future reactor designs could lead to reactors that have less noise and could operate at higher temperature without methane formation and with less H2 leakage. Our HTR system was made with standard materials (stainless steel) and used standard analytical equipment that is typically available in a catalysis research laboratory. No automation was done with our HTR system; however, future automation of the HTR would be desirable (e.g. automated analysis of gas and liquid phases).
4.2. Mechanism of aqueous phase reforming
A general reaction scheme for APR of ethylene glycol has previously been proposed for Pt/Al2O3 catalysts [6] ,[7] . In this scheme, adsorbed ethylene glycol undergoes dehydrogenation on the surface followed by CC bond cleavage and water-gas shift to give CO2 and H2 products. Adsorption of ethylene glycol, water, H2 and CO2 are assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium. Reaction kinetics measurements and FTIR studies have shown that the water-gas shift reaction is reversible, such that the ratio of the partial pressures of the products to the reactants divided by the water-gas shift equilibrium constant (i.e. ) is higher than 0.5 [6] ,[20] . In situ FTIR attenuated total reflectance (ATR) studies of APR of a 5 wt.% methanol solution at 423 K of a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst have shown that the surface coverage of CO is 35% while the surface coverage of CO for vapor phase reforming is 60% [20] . The rate of H2 production is fractional order with respect to feed concentration (0.4 order) for APR of ethylene glycol with Pt/Al2O3 [7] . The rates of APR of methanol and ethylene glycol on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are similar, indicating that the CC bond cleavage is probably not the rate limiting step [6] . Reaction kinetics studies for APR of ethylene glycol with Pt/Al2O3 catalysts have shown that H2 inhibits the rate of H2 production (0.7 order) indicating that surface H can block reaction sites under reaction conditions. Based on these results, we can suggest two approaches to improve the catalytic activity of Pt-based catalysts: (1) increase the rate for dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethylene glycol by alloying with a metal or metal oxide that has a higher rate of dehydrogenation or (2) increase the number of vacant Pt sites, perhaps by decreasing the heat of adsorption of strongly adsorbed species (e.g. CO* and H*) that block Pt sites under reaction conditions.
The reaction kinetics for APR over Pd-based catalysts have not been studied in as much detail as the reactions kinetics for APR over Pt catalysts. However, some key observations can be made about Pd-based catalysts. A Pd/SiO2 catalyst has an order of magnitude lower activity for H2 production by APR than Pt/SiO2 [3] . The rate of the water-gas shift reaction over Pd catalysts is lower than over Pt catalysts [21] ,[22] , while the rate of carbon-carbon bond cleavage in ethane hydrolysis is similar for Pd- and Pt-based catalysts [23] . Thus, the rate determining step for APR over Pd catalysts could be the water-gas-shift reaction, and one way to improve the activity of Pd-based catalyst is by adding water-gas-shift promoters such as iron oxide.
4.3. Bimetallic Pt catalysts
Bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts have turnover frequencies for H2 production 1.52.8 times higher than monometallic Pt catalysts at 483 K. The activity per surface site for PtNi catalysts is highest at an atomic ratio of 1:1. As more Ni or Co is added to the catalyst, the number of sites increases and the activity per site decreases. When stoichiometric amounts of Ni or Co are added to the Pt catalyst, it is likely that the catalyst forms a bulk PtNi (Pt1Ni1 or Pt1Ni3 [24] ) or PtCo (Pt1Co1 or Pt3Co1 [25] ) alloy. Surface alloys with different compositions than the bulk could also be formed when Ni or Co are added to the Pt [26] . When larger amounts of Ni or Co are added to Pt (such as Pt1Ni9), some of the Ni or Co may not alloy with the Pt, leading to an apparent decrease in the average activity per surface site, because Ni and Co have lower activities per site than Pt. In addition, adding large amounts of Ni or Co to the catalyst can cause the catalyst to deactivate, because monometallic Ni and Co catalysts exhibit extensive deactivation under APR conditions [3] ,[9] .
Addition of Fe to Pt, as shown in Fig. 3 , causes an increase in the specific activity of the catalysts. The Pt-Fe catalyst with the highest activity on a mass basis was Pt1Fe1/Al2O3, and the catalyst activity decreased when the Fe to Pt ratio was increased further. The value of for Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 was 1.2 and 2.63.3 times higher than Pt/Al2O3 at 483 and 453 K, respectively. Thus, Pt-Fe catalysts are not as active as Pt-Ni or Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts. The apparent activation energy for APR with Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 is lower than for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, and thus these catalysts have higher activity per surface site at lower temperatures.
Alloys of platinum with Ni, Co or Fe are effective electrocatalysts for medium and low temperature fuel cells [27] because they have higher activity and resistance to CO poisoning than pure Pt catalysts [28] ,[29] ,[30] . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show an electronic modification of Pt upon alloying with Ni, Co or Fe, and these calculations predict that Pt should segregate to the surface in these systems [31] . Experimental studies of PtNi, PtCo and PtFe supported on carbon have shown that the surfaces of these alloys are covered with Pt, leading to surface properties that are different than pure Pt [29] ,[30] ,[32] . Christoffersen et al.
[33] have shown that alloying Pt with Co or Ni causes a shift of the d-band center of Pt by 0.50.7 eV. Kitchin et al.
[34] have shown that addition of Ni or Co to the Pt causes a broading of the d-band and a shift of the Pt d-band from 2.44 eV to 2.60 and 2.74 eV for PtNi and PtCo alloys, respectively. Greeley and Mavrikakis [26] have also shown a decrease in the d-band when near surface PtNi and PtCo alloys are formed, causing an increase in the dissociative adsorption energy of H2 [34] , a decrease in the binding energy of hydrogen [26] , and a decrease in the binding energy of CO [30] ,[33] ,[35] . Density functional calculations have also shown that addition of Fe to Pt decreases the d-band center, similar to the effect caused by Ni and Co addition, which causes a decrease in the strength of adsorption of CO and H2 [26] ,[33] . Experimentally, hydrogen has also been shown to inhibit the APR of ethylene glycol on Pt catalysts [6] ; therefore, decreasing the heat of adsorption of hydrogen could improve the overall activity of the catalyst per surface site. Thus, we speculate that the PtNi, PtCo and PtFe catalysts have lower heats of H2 and CO adsorption than pure Pt, causing a decrease in the surface coverage of adsorbed hydrogen and CO, allowing more sites to be accessible to ethylene glycol under APR reaction conditions.
4.4. Bimetallic PdFe catalysts
When Pd is added to high surface area Fe2O3, the catalyst has the highest activity per surface site of any catalyst tested in this study, as shown in Table 2 . In contrast, when Pt is added to Fe2O3 the catalyst shows very low activity. The activity of the water-gas shift reaction on Pd is lower than Pt [22] , suggesting that the rate determining step for APR on Pd may be the water-gas shift reaction. Thus, a water-gas shift promoter like Fe will significantly increase the activity of Pd catalysts for APR. In fact, Wang and Gorte [36] showed that Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts were several orders of magnitude more active than Pd/SiO2 for the water-gas shift reaction. Iron can also significantly improve the activity of Pd/Al2O3 catalysts; however, a large ratio of Fe to Pd (18:1) is needed to achieve the maximum hydrogen production rate compared to the Pt-Fe system (1:1). Zhao and Gorte [37] showed that addition of Pd to Fe2O3 caused a 10-fold increase in the activity of Fe2O3 for the water-gas shift reaction, while addition of Pt to Fe2O3 did not cause any change in the catalytic activity further illustrating the difference between Pd and Pt for WGS reaction. Accordingly, we suggest that the high activity of Pd/Fe2O3 for APR is caused by the synergistic combination of Pd and Fe2O3, whereas the Pt/Fe2O3 system shows low activity for APR because Fe2O3 does not promote the water-gas shift activity of Pt and because the dispersion of Pt on Fe2O3 is low.
5. Conclusion
Several new PtNi, PtCo, PtFe and PdFe catalysts were identified for aqueous-phase reforming of ethylene glycol by testing over 130 metal combinations in a high-throughput reactor. These new bimetallic catalysts are significantly more active than monometallic Pt and Pd catalysts, as confirmed by more detailed studies using a traditional fixed bed reactor. Alumina-supported PtNi and PtCo catalysts with Pt to Co or Ni atomic ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:9 had of 2.85.2 min1 for APR of ethylene glycol solutions at 483 K, compared to a value of 1.9 min1 for Pt/Al2O3 under similar reaction conditions. The PtNi/Al2O3 and PtCo/Al2O3 catalysts at 483 K were 2.13.5 times more activity than the Pt catalyst per gram of catalyst. A Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 catalyst showed H2 turnover frequencies of 0.34.3 min1 at 453 to 483 K, and these values are about three times higher than Pt/Al2O3 under identical reaction conditions. A Pd1Fe9/Al2O3 catalyst had values of equal to 1.4 and 4.3 min1 at temperatures of 453 and 483 K, respectively, and these values are 3946 times higher than Pd/Al2O3 at the same reaction conditions. A catalyst consisting of Pd supported on high surface area Fe2O3 (Nanocat) had the highest intrinsic activity with values of equal to 14.6, 39.1 and 60.1 min1 at temperatures of 453, 483 and 498 K, respectively.
We suggest that alloying Pt with Ni, Co or Fe improves the activity for H2 production by lowering the d-band center, which causes a decrease in the heats of CO and hydrogen adsorption, thereby increasing the fraction of the surface available for reaction with ethylene glycol. The results of this study also suggest that the rate limiting step for APR of ethylene glycol on Pd-based catalysts is the water-gas shift reaction, and adding a water-gas shift promoter like Fe2O3 to Pd can improve the catalytic activity for APR. In general, bimetallic catalysts can have a significantly higher activity than monometallic catalysts for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol.
