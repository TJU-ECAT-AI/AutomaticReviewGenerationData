1.The process of selective oxygenate reforming, such as the conversion of glycerol, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by offering an alternative to fossil fuels. This process breaks down carbohydrates in plant matter into smaller oxygenates, which can then be further reacted to yield hydrogen for fuel cells or H2/CO mixtures for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to produce liquid alkanes. The key advantages include the potential for carbon-neutral and renewable energy supply without increasing greenhouse gas emissions, higher product yields on certain bimetallic surfaces compared to traditional methods, and the use of smaller oxygenates as models for reforming larger, biomass-derived oxygenates, which simplifies experimental studies and catalyst development.

1.选择性氧酸重整过程，如甘油的转化，通过提供化石燃料的替代品，对可持续能源和化学品生产做出了贡献。该过程将植物物质中的碳水化合物分解成较小的氧酸，然后可以进一步反应产生氢气用于燃料电池，或者产生H2/CO混合物用于费托合成以生产液体烷烃。其主要优势包括：潜在的碳中和和可再生能源供应，不会增加温室气体排放；与传统方法相比，在某些双金属表面上具有更高的产品产量；以及使用较小的氧酸作为模型，用于重整较大的生物质衍生氧酸，这简化了实验研究和催化剂的开发。

1.The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting biomass-derived oxygenates, such as glycerol, into hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which can be used in fuel cells or converted into liquid alkanes through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. This process offers several key advantages: it utilizes widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable biomass resources, potentially increasing energy supply without raising greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming can yield higher product yields of hydrogen and CO, as demonstrated by the increased production of H2 on the Ni surface monolayer on Pt(111). Additionally, the use of smaller oxygenates as models for the reforming of larger oxygenates can simplify experimental procedures and provide insights into reaction mechanisms, facilitating the development of more efficient catalysts and processes.

1.The process of selective oxygenate reforming, such as the conversion of glycerol into H2 and CO, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing biomass-derived feedstocks that are carbon-neutral and renewable. This method offers several key advantages over traditional methods: it increases the energy supply without raising CO2 emissions, produces H2 for use in fuel cells, and can generate H2/CO mixtures for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, yielding liquid alkanes compatible with existing infrastructure. The use of smaller oxygenates as models for reforming larger, biomass-derived oxygenates validates the approach and facilitates the development of bimetallic catalysts with enhanced reforming activity.

Additionally, the reforming activity trends are similar for smaller oxygenates like glycerol, ethylene glycol, and ethanol, suggesting that these smaller molecules can serve as good models for the reforming of larger, biomass-derived oxygenates. This understanding can guide the identification of other bimetallic catalysts for oxygenate reforming, enhancing practical implementation and efficiency.

This process breaks down carbohydrates from plant matter into smaller oxygenates, which can then be further reacted to yield hydrogen for fuel cells or H2/CO mixtures for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, producing liquid alkanes compatible with existing infrastructure. Glycerol, as a by-product of biodiesel production, is a promising feed molecule for this process. The key advantages include the potential for increased energy supply without increasing greenhouse gas emissions, as biomass is considered carbon-neutral and renewable. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming may offer higher product yields, as demonstrated by increased hydrogen production on bimetallic surfaces like Ni-Pt-Pt(111). Additionally, the use of smaller oxygenates as models for larger, biomass-derived oxygenates can simplify experimental design and analysis, making the process more practical for implementation.
