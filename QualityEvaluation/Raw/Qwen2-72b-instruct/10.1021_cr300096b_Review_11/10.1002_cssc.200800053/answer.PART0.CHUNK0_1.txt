1.The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting biomass-derived oxygenates, such as glycerol, into hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which can be used in fuel cells or converted into liquid alkanes through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. This process offers several key advantages: it utilizes widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable biomass resources, potentially increasing energy supply without raising greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming can yield higher product yields of hydrogen and CO, as demonstrated by the increased production of H2 on the Ni surface monolayer on Pt(111). Additionally, the use of smaller oxygenates as models for the reforming of larger oxygenates can simplify experimental procedures and provide insights into reaction mechanisms, facilitating the development of more efficient catalysts and processes.

1.选择性氧酸重整过程通过将生物基氧酸（如甘油）转化为氢气和一氧化碳，用于燃料电池或通过费托合成转化为液体烷烃，为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献。这一过程具有几个关键优势：它利用广泛可用、碳中和和可再生的生物质资源，有可能在不增加温室气体排放的情况下增加能源供应。与传统方法相比，选择性氧酸重整可以产生更高的氢气和CO产品产量，如在Pt(111)上的Ni表面单层上H2产量的增加所示。此外，使用较小的氧酸作为较大氧酸重整的模型可以简化实验程序，并提供反应机制的见解，促进更有效催化剂和过程的开发。
