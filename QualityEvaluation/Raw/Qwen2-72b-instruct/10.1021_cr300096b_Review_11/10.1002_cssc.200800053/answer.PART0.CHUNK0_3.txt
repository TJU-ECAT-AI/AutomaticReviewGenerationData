1.The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting biomass-derived oxygenates, such as glycerol, into hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which can be used in fuel cells or converted into liquid alkanes through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. This process offers several key advantages: it utilizes widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable biomass resources, potentially increasing energy supply without raising greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming can yield higher product yields of hydrogen and CO, as demonstrated by the increased production of H2 on the Ni surface monolayer on Pt(111). Additionally, the reforming activity trends are similar for smaller oxygenates like glycerol, ethylene glycol, and ethanol, suggesting that these smaller molecules can serve as good models for the reforming of larger, biomass-derived oxygenates. This understanding can guide the identification of other bimetallic catalysts for oxygenate reforming, enhancing practical implementation and efficiency.

1.选择性氧酸重整过程通过将生物基氧酸（如甘油）转化为氢气和一氧化碳，用于燃料电池或通过费托合成转化为液体烷烃，为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献。这一过程提供了几个关键优势：它利用了广泛可用、碳中和和可再生的生物质资源，有可能在不增加温室气体排放的情况下增加能源供应。与传统方法相比，选择性氧酸重整可以产生更高的氢气和CO产品产量，如在Pt(111)上的Ni表面单层上增加H2的生产所示。此外，甘油、乙二醇和乙醇等较小氧酸的重整活性趋势相似，表明这些较小分子可以作为较大、生物基氧酸重整的良好模型。这种理解可以指导其他双金属催化剂的识别，用于氧酸重整，增强实际实施和效率。
