Steam reforming of ethanol over PtNi Catalysts Abstract A parametric study was conducted over PtNi/δ-Al2O3 to explore the effect of Pt and Ni contents on the ethanol steam reforming characteristics of the bimetallic catalyst. Experiments with catalysts having 0.20.3 wt%Pt and 1015 wt%Ni contents indicated that the best ethanol steam reforming performance is achieved over 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni/δ-Al2O3. Kinetics of ethanol steam reforming was studied over this catalyst in the 673823 K interval using differential and integral methods of data analysis. A power-function rate expression was obtained with reaction orders of 1.01 and 0.09 in ethanol and steam, respectively, and the apparent activation energy of ethanol steam reforming over 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni/δ-Al2O3 was calculated as 59.3  2.3 kJ mol1.
1. Introduction
Environmental problems arising from the extensive use of fossil fuels and dwindling petroleum reserves have increased the search for diverse energy sources. Among the alternatives at hand, the use of hydrogen as a fuel is projected to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions significantly, and the proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell fuelled by pure hydrogen is currently the leading candidate for various stationary and mobile applications. Although natural gas, LPG, gasoline and methanol are generally regarded as the sources for hydrogen, ethanol has also attracted some attention in recent years [1] ,[2] ,[3] . Ethanol is a renewable resource that is easier to store, safer to handle and transport owing to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to methanol. Chemical storage of hydrogen in liquid fuels is considered to be an advantageous option for delivering hydrogen. Steam reforming (SR) has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among other alternatives such as partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming; the only inconvenience is its highly endothermic nature [4] . The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol and ethanol) requires considerably less energy per mole of H2 formed than the reforming of saturated hydrocarbons and produces mostly CO2 [5] .
(1) Investigation of hydrogen production from ethanol is fairly new. Ethanol SR proceeds at higher temperatures (350900 C) compared to methanol SR (200400 C) on account of its CC bond, and at relatively high water-to-ethanol ratios. Recent reviews of ethanol SR emphasize the significant effects of the type of catalyst, method of catalyst preparation and reaction conditions on ethanol conversion, hydrogen production and product distribution [1] ,[2] . Base metals such as Ni, Co, NiCu and noble metals such as Pt, Pd and Rh over appropriate supports show potential for ethanol SR, and the main problems to be tackled are byproduct formation and coke deposition. Side products observed on Ni-based catalysts are mainly CH4 and COx formed by ethanol SR with methane production, ethanol decomposition, methane SR or methanation depending on the reaction temperature [6] . Al2O3 and CeO2-supported noble metal catalysts were studied by FTIR, TPD and TPR methods to clarify possible reaction mechanisms, and it was reported that ethylene, resulting from ethanol dehydration, is typically formed over Al2O3-supported noble metals, while considerable acetaldehyde, resulting from ethanol dehydrogenation, is also formed on CeO2-supported catalysts [7] . Deactivation by carbon formation was observed on Rh/CeO2ZrO2, but total regeneration was possible at low temperatures [8] . Reports on intrinsic kinetics of ethanol SR over Ni and Ru catalysts include power-law rate expressions where ethanol consumption rate is first order with respect to ethanol and independent of steam [1] ,[9] ,[10] .
PtNi catalysts are efficient for the auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of hydrocarbon feeds and are potential candidates for energy efficient commercial processes [11] . ATR is a combination of total oxidation and SR along with high-temperature water-gas shift, and eliminates the need for an external source of heat. Kinetics of ATR is described by the simultaneous use of separate rate expressions for total oxidation and SR of the hydrocarbon fuel as well as a third rate equation for the concurrent water-gas shift. Computer simulations based on the thermodynamic analysis of a fuel processor utilizing ethanol and comprising ATR, low-temperature water-gas shift and selective CO oxidation reactors showed that the H2 yields obtained match up to about 65% of the theoretical [12] . Ethanol SR experiments over 0.2 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni/δ-Al2O3 at 673823 K demonstrated that the bimetallic catalyst was resistant to carbon formation even at water-to-ethanol ratios as low as 3.0, side products detected were CH4 and COx, and ethanol conversion rates were directly proportional to ethanol partial pressure and slightly inhibited by steam partial pressure [13] .
The present work contains a series of experiments conducted over PtNi/δ-Al2O3 catalysts with different Pt and Ni contents in order to select the most suitable PtNi catalyst on which ethanol SR proceeds well and is coupled with a kinetic study to extract the rate expression for describing ethanol SR kinetics in the simulation of ATR units of fuel processors.
2. Experimental work
2.1. Catalyst preparation
PtNi/δ-Al2O3 catalysts having different Pt (0.20.3 wt%) and Ni (1015 wt%) loadings were prepared by drying γ-Al2O3 at 423 K and calcination at 1173 K to obtain thermally stable δ-Al2O3, followed by sequential incipient-to-wetness impregnation using aqueous Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Merck) and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Aldrich) solutions, respectively, with an intermediate calcination at 873 K and a final calcination at 773 K [14] . The BET surface area of the δ-Al2O3 support was determined as 82 m2 g1 using a Micromeritics Flowsorb II apparatus. The catalysts tested were 0.2 wt%Pt10 wt%Ni, 0.3 wt%Pt10 wt%Ni, 0.2 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni and 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni.
2.2. Reaction experiments
Experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure and 673823 K in 4-mm i.d. stainless steel fixed-bed down-flow microreactors located in the center of a well-insulated 2.5-cm i.d. furnace tube with 50 cm length and having a constant temperature zone of about 30 cm and controlled to 0.1 K by a Shimaden FP-21 programmable controller. Reaction temperatures were measured just outside the 4-mm i.d. reactor tube with a thermocouple adjacent to the catalyst bed. Before the steam reforming reaction was started, fresh catalyst samples were reduced under 20 cm3 min1 pure hydrogen flow at 773 K for 4 h and then the reaction temperature was adjusted under inert N2 flow. Flow rates of H2 and N2 gases were monitored by calibrated Omega Model 5878 and Aalborg GFC171S mass flow controllers. Liquid waterethanol feed mixtures were evaporated into a preheated diluent N2 stream using a Jasco PU-1580 intelligent HPLC pump and mixed to ensure homogeneity prior to microreactor inlet. Liquid flow rates metered on the pump were converted into gas flow rates by using ideal gas law (normalized to 298 K and 1 atm), molecular weights, liquid densities and water-to-ethanol ratios [14] . All connecting lines were kept at 423 K to prevent condensation. Two gas chromatographs, Shimadzu GC-14A and Shimadzu GC-8A, with Porapak Q and Molecular Sieve 5A columns and TCDs, respectively, were used for the analyses.
In parametric experiments, 20 mg of 250422 μm fresh catalyst particles were diluted with inert δ-Al2O3 to a total bed weight of 250 mg. Preliminary experiments showed that δ-Al2O3 and the stainless steel reactor were inert, and externalinternal mass transfer resistances were negligible [13] . The microreactor was operated with an initial ethanol concentration of 6.25 vol.%, a water-to-ethanol ratio of 6.0 and a space time (Wcat/FEtOH) of 80 mg s mL1, for comparing catalyst performances at 673823 K. All samples were tested up to 375 min time-on-stream (TOS); stable ethanol conversion levels were attained after 200 min TOS and data obtained at 300 min TOS were used in catalyst comparisons. Before starting kinetic experiments, the 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni sample was tested up to 420 min TOS at 723 K with a stable ethanol conversion level. Kinetic experiments were conducted at 1 atm and 723 K, over 1040 mg of fresh catalyst samples diluted with inert δ-Al2O3 to 250 mg, using inlet ethanol concentrations of 5.07.09.0 vol.%, water-to-ethanol molar ratio of 6.0 and space times (Wcat/FEtOH) of 50200 mg s mL1 (0.331.32 g h mol1). The temperature dependence of the rate constant was determined at five temperatures in the 673823 K range, using initial ethanol and water concentrations of 7.0 vol.% and 42.0 vol.%, respectively, and space times of 0.331.0 g h mol1. Ethanol conversion data obtained at 375 min TOS were used in the evaluation of kinetic parameters. Deactivation or coke formation was not observed within the range of conditions used in this study.
Ethanol conversion and hydrogen yield were defined as mole of ethanol consumed per mole of ethanol in feed and mole of H2 formed per mole of ethanol in feed, respectively. In kinetic measurements, ethanol SR rates were calculated as follows:(2) where xEtOH is fractional ethanol conversion,is ethanol flow rate in the feed in mol h1, Wcat is catalyst weight in g and (rEtOH) is the reaction rate in mol g1 h1. Ethanol SR rates were obtained from the slopes of the tangents to the xEtOH versus curves at various points, using curves constructed from the data of at least six separate experiments for each feed composition.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of catalyst composition
The effect of catalyst composition was initially tested at 723 K with a constant space time of 80 mg s mL1 (or 0.53 g h mol1) over catalyst samples with 0.20.3 wt%Pt and 1015 wt%Ni loading. Initial ethanol and water concentrations were kept constant at 6.25 vol.% and 37.5 vol.%, respectively.
Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 indicate that catalysts with 15 wt% Ni loading are better in terms of both ethanol conversion and H2 production at 723 K, probably due to better dispersion and abundance of Ni sites promoting the reforming reaction. Previous work conducted by our group on SEM-BCI and EDX analyses of δ-Al2O3 supported 0.2 wt%Pt, 15 wt%Ni and 0.2 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni catalysts indicated that a 15 wt%Ni content uniformly covers the support surface [15] .

The same SEM-BCI and EDX study also showed that while Pt is well dispersed on the δ-Al2O3 support of the 0.2 wt%Pt catalyst with Pt particle sizes in the 1060 nm range, Pt clusters 70330 nm in size are nestled over the 15 wt%Ni environment covering the support surface of 0.2 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni [15] . In the present study, higher Pt content improves ethanol conversion capabilities of catalysts with 15 wt% and 10 wt% Ni, the improvement in H2 production rates of 10 wt% Ni-containing catalysts being more noticeable at 723 K. It may be speculated that this enhancement in catalytic activity is attributable to an improvement in Ni dispersion caused by the presence of Pt especially on catalysts with lower Ni content.The effect of temperature was studied at 673823 K on catalysts with 15 wt% Ni. The difference in the ethanol conversions of samples with 0.2 wt% and 0.3 wt% Pt was found to increase with temperature in favor of 0.3 wt% Pt and reach its maximum at 773 K ( Fig. 3 ). The corresponding H2 production rates (data not shown) measured on 0.2 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni were much lower (ca. 50 μmol g s1) at 673 K but increased quickly until 723 K to match the H2 production rate of 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni and then stayed constant up to 823 K. On the other hand, H2 production over 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni increased drastically with temperature from about 175 μmol g s1 at 673 K to 485 μmol g s1 at 773 K and stayed constant until 823 K.

The CH4 production rate increased only slightly from 8.1 μmol g s1 to 8.6 μmol g s1 in the entire 673823 K range. The highest CH4 production rate of 9.2 μmol g s1 was obtained over 0.2 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni at 732 K. The H2/CH4 production ratios (point selectivity values) presented in Fig. 4 indicate that the performance of 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni is better at all temperatures with a maximum point selectivity of almost 60 at 773 K. The highest H2/CO point selectivity is also observed for 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni at 773 K; however, both H2/CO and CO2/CO production ratios decline as the temperature rises from 773 K to 823 K ( Fig. 5 ). Decreases in the H2/CO and CO2/CO point selectivities may be explained by the information that the steam reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons produces mostly CO2 some of which is later converted to CO by the rapid reverse-water-gas shift reaction that occurs at high H2 concentrations [3] ,[5] . Taking all observations into account, it may be said that ethanol SR with CO2 and CH4 formation is important at 723 K over both catalysts; at higher temperatures, the distinctive properties of Ni are modified by the increasing Pt content to accommodate methane SR and water-gas shift reactions.

3.2. Kinetics of ethanol SR over 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni/δ-Al2O3
Kinetic data were obtained at 723 K using three different ethanol (579 vol.%) and steam (304254 vol.%) compositions at six different space times each ( Fig. 6 ). Ethanol SR rates were evaluated from integral reactor data obtained under isothermal conditions by numerical differentiation of the xEtOH versus curves to calculate individual reaction rates at all space times and also by extrapolation back to zero space time to calculate initial rates. Ethanol conversion data obtained at 375 min TOS were used in the evaluation of kinetic parameters. Data were processed by nonlinear regression in the MATLAB environment using the LevenbergMarquardt algorithm and the power-function rate expression of the following equation:(3) The rate parameters estimated are given in Table 1 .
Fig. 7 demonstrates the agreement between model-predicted and experimentally measured ethanol SR rates within the range of conditions tested ( Fig. 7 ). The positive first-order dependence on ethanol was also confirmed by neglecting the mild inhibition of 0.09 by steam partial pressure and using the integral method with a reasonably good fit of R2 = 0.97 to a plot of ln (1  xEtOH) versus (W/Ftotal).

Ethanol SR rates obtained in the same manner as described above at five different temperatures between 673 K and 823 K and fixed feed composition (7.0 vol.% and 42.0 vol.% ethanol and water, respectively) and Eq.
(3) were used to calculate the five rate constants (k values) required for estimating the activation energy (EA) of the Arrhenius functionality. The apparent EA of ethanol steam reforming over 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni/δ-Al2O3 was calculated as 59.3  2.3 kJ mol1 ( Fig. 8 ).

The reaction orders of 1.01  0.03 for ethanol and 0.09  0.02 for steam are in agreement with those obtained previously [13] on 0.2 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni/δ-Al2O3 at 673 K (1.25  0.05 and 0.215  0.05, respectively) to the extent that a positive order close to unity and a mildly negative order are obtained for ethanol and steam partial pressures. These reaction orders would indicate the presence of adsorbed water on the catalyst surface and a surface reaction involving relatively weakly adsorbed ethanol. An increase in the Pt content from 0.2 wt% to 0.3 wt% seems to strengthen ethanol adsorption to some extent, thus diminishing the surface coverage of water. The increase observed in the apparent EA values (59.3 kJ mol1 as compared to 39.3 kJ mol1 for 0.3 wt% and 0.2 wt% Ptcontaining catalysts, respectively) would also support this explanation.
4. Conclusions
Studies conducted on bimetallic PtNi/δ-Al2O3 with different compositions indicate that catalysts with Ni loading of 15 wt% are more efficient in ethanol SR and that a higher Pt content of 0.3 wt% is successful in promoting H2 production as well as H2/CH4 and H2/CO point selectivity. Ethanol SR performance of 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni/δ-Al2O3 is better in terms of both ethanol conversion and selectivity towards hydrogen production up to 773 K. The power-function rate expression proposed on the basis of an extensive kinetic study for determining intrinsic reaction rates at 723 K from integral reactor data under conditions extending up to about 70% ethanol conversion has reaction orders of 1.01 and 0.09 in ethanol and steam partial pressures, respectively, and can reliably be used for simulating ethanol SR or the SR component of ethanol ATR. The apparent activation energy of ethanol steam reforming over 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni/δ-Al2O3 in the 673823 K interval is calculated as 59.3  2.3 kJ mol1.
