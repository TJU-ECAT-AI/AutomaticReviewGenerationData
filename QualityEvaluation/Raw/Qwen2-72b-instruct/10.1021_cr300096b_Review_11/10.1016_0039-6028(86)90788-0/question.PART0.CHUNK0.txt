A STATIC SIMS/TPD
STUDY OF THE KINETICS
OF METHOXY
FORMATION
AND DECOMPOSITION
ON O/Pt(lll) * Sohail AKHTER and J.M. WHITE Department of Chemistry, University of Texas, Austin, Texas 78712, USA Received 19 July 1985; accepted for publication 17 October 1985 The kinetics and mechanism of the decomposition of methanol (CH3OD) on oxygen-covered Pt(lll) were studied using static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The initial sticking coefficient and the saturation first layer coverage of CH3OD are unity and 0.36 ML, respectively. The maximum amounts decomposed in TPD on O/Pt(lll) and clean Pt(lll) are 0.19 and 0.047 ML, respectively. At low methanol coverages (< 0.05 ML) on O/Pt(lll) the only reaction products were CO2, H20 and D20,whereas at saturation CO, H20, D20 and H 2 were observed. The decomposed amount did not saturate at or before the onset of molecular methanol desorption, but increased monotonically until saturation of the first layer. No oxygen exchange was observed between CH3OD and preadsorbed 180. A decomposition mechanism involving methoxy and a hydroxyl type species is proposed. Methanol coverages as low as 0.002 ML could be detected with SIMS. The CH- ion was the most intense ion in the positive SIMS spectrum of both methanol and methoxy. Larger ion clusters such as (CH3OD) + (n = 2, 3) developed successively at specific multilayer coverages. At low coverages on O/Pt(lll), methoxy formation occurs above 125 K and its decomposition becomes detectable above 150 K during temperature programming. In the isothermal mode, the SIMS CH- ion was used to follow the kinetics. Over the temperature range 120-145 K, the second order Arrhenius rate parameters for methoxy formation are E = 5.5 +-0.7 kcal/mol and A = 1.5 X 10- 7  0.6 cm2/s" molecule for an initial methanol coverage of 0.05 ML. Methoxy decom- position was studied in the temperature range 150-165 K and at an initial coverage of 0.015 ML.
The first order kinetic parameters, E=11.4+0.5 kcal/mol and A=5.3X10131 s -1 were derived. Advantages and limitations of using SIMS as a tool for kinetic studies are discussed.
I. Introduction
Methanol decomposition has been studied on a number of metallic surfaces [1-13,29] including clean and oxygenated Pt(111) [14-16]. The motivation of many of these studies was to explore the stability and reactivity of the methoxy intermediate and its relevance to catalysis of methanol synthesis and conver- sion. A common observation in many of these studies was that the formation and decomposition of methoxy occurred at low temperatures (usually below * Supported in part by the Office of Naval Research. 0039-6028/86/$03.50 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

300 K) such that no reaction limited product desorbed during either process.
Hence, using TPD techniques, it was not possible either to locate the tempera- ture regimes of formation and decomposition or to study their respective kinetics. Exceptions include methoxy decomposition on oxygenated Cu(ll0) [2] and Ag(ll0) [1] where decomposition is accompanied by desorption of reaction limited products. For these cases, kinetic parameters have been evaluated from TPD experiments. Use of spectroscopic techniques like HREELS [10,14,30] and XPS/UPS [3,4] have helped in identifying the reac- tion intermediate, the reaction mechanism and the temperature regions in which formation and decomposition occur. The limited time resolution of these techniques has precluded detailed kinetic studies.
SIMS provides information about changes in the adsorbed layer whereas, by comparison, TPD detects only desorption into the gas phase. The methods are complementary and, used together, provide a more complete picture [19,20].
Static SIMS has the capabilities of very high detection sensitivity and data can be collected rapidly [17,18]. These capabilities make it a good tool for kinetic measurements; particularly in cases such as methanol decomposition at low temperatures, where the products remain adsorbed during decomposition. Its applicability to kinetic studies has been previously demonstrated for several reactions on Pt(111): O(a) + H 2 [19], OH(a) + H 2 [24], HzO(a ) + O(a) [21,22],ethylidyne and propylidyne formation and decomposition [23] and H-D exchange in alkylidyne overlayers [25].
There were two primary objectives of this work: first, to obtain rate parameters for the formation and decomposition of a catalytically important intermediate and, second, to further assess the applicability of SIMS as a tool for kinetic studies. As a prerequisite for the second objective, we chose a system for which rate parameters were not available through other techniques.
Methanol decomposition on O/Pt(lll) is a good candidate [14] which has been studied by HREELS [14] and TPD [15,16]. These studies show that a saturation coverage of methoxy is stable below 170 K and decomposes to CO + H above that temperature. CO and H 2 then appear as desorption limited products above 300 K. However, no rate parameters have been measured.
In this study, positive SIMS has been used both in temperature programmed (TPSIMS) and isothermal modes. The isothermal mode has been used to gather rate data from which initial reaction rates and Arrhenius rate parame- ters have been derived.
2. Experimental
The experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber pumped by a 450 l/s turbomolecular pump. A base pressure of (2 4) x 10 10 Tort was routinely obtained. The chamber was equipped with a double pass CMA for

103 AES and a secondary ion quadrupole mass spectrometer for SIMS, TPD and RGA measurements.
The Pt(lll) sample could be cooled to 100 K with liquid N 2 and heated resistively to 1400 K. Two chromel-alumel thermocouples were spotwelded at different positions on the back of the crystal and their readings agreed to within 0.01 mV. Methanol exposures were done at 100-120 K through a glass multichannel doser and were calibrated against dosing by backfilling. All exposures have been corrected for ion gauge sensitivity factors.
All TPD experiments were done at heating rates of either 1.1 or 5.5 K/s as indicated in the figures. All temperature programmed SIMS experiments were done at a heating rate of 1.1 K/s.
SIMS and TPD spectra were taken with the sample surface in line-of-sight with the quadrupole. The ion intensities are reported as recorded and have not been corrected for quadrupole transmission efficiency. The Ar + ion beam (600 eV, < 3.0 nA) was rastered across the sample. Under these conditions the loss of adsorbates due to sputtering during SIMS measurements was very slow but was taken into account (see below).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. TPD study
CH3OD decomposition on O/Pt(lll) was studied over a coverage range of
0.015 ML to multilayers. Initially, a (2 × 2)O/Pt(111) surface was prepared by
adsorbing about 10 L 02 at 110-120 K followed by a brief flash to 250 K to remove molecular oxygen. This procedure results in a surface atomic O coverage of 0.25 ML [26]. One ML is taken to be the Pt(lll) surface atomic density (15.2 × 1014/cm2). With this definition, the first layer of methanol is complete at 0.36 ML (see below).
The product distribution for an initial methanol (CH3OD) coverage of 0.044 ML is shown in fig. 1. The only desorbing products observed were CO 2 (320-330 K), H20, HDO (not shown), D20 (195 K) and 02 (650-800 K). No CO, H2, HD or D 2 were detected. In order to confirm the origin of the CO 2 peak as being due to oxidation of CO after its formation on the surface, a small amount of preadsorbed CO was oxidized in excess 02. The resulting CO 2 peak temperature (320-330 K) was coincident with that from CH3OD decom- position. No molecular methanol desorbed below an initial coverage of 0.05
ML.
At higher coverages, molecular methanol (195 K), CO (460 K) and H 2 (350 K) were observed in desorption. Increased CO formation was accompanied by decreased CO

desorbed. The product distribution for a coverage slightly above saturation of 104

Indicated exposures in this and other figures have been corrected for ion gauge sensitivity. the first layer of CH3OD is shown in fig. 2. Note the presence of a small multilayer CHOD peak (this peak appeared for all exposures above 1.40 L).
The presence of H20 has mechanistic implications because it signifies that not all O is initially titrated by the D(a), even though excess molecular methanol is available. The initial titration step can be represented by the equation:
CH3OD + O = CH30 + OD.
(1) This provides a mechanism by which substantial amounts of oxygen may be left untitrated by CH3OD because the subsequent recombination of deuteroxyl groups recycles atomic oxygen:
OD + OD =
D20 + O.
This released oxygen is then available for reaction with H, generated from CH30 dissociation, to produce H20. The TPSIMS data, discussed later, are also consistent with this reaction.
The two insets in fig. 2 show the TPD profiles for CH1OD and C=sO for a monolayer of CH3OD on 0.25 ML sO/Pt(lll). It is evident that negligible exchange occurs with molecular CH3OD. A small amount of ClSO ( - 5 10% of CO) appears in the product CO. In part, this is probably due to exchange at Multilayer peak

Within that uncer- tainty, we conclude that little oxygen exchange takes place between methanol (or methoxy) and preadsorbed lSO.
Before proceeding further, the methods of calculating the coverages of various reactant and product molecules is described. The O(a) coverages were easily obtained from the O 2 TPD areas knowing the area corresponding to 0.25 ML of O(a). The water TPD areas were calibrated by normalizing to the area corresponding to 0.25 ML of water prepared by titrating a layer of 0.25 ML O(a) with 2 × 10 - Torr of H 2 at 135 K [19]. The same calibration was used for D20 (i.e., small differences in mass spectrometer sensitivity and pumping speed are neglected). The H 2, CO and CO 2 TPD areas were calibrated against water TPD in the following manner. At low coverages (below 0.05 ML) all methanol decomposed to CO 2 and water (fig. 1):
2 CH3OD + 80 ---, 2 CO
2 + 3 H20 + D20.
The CO 2 and water TPD areas from the above reaction will correspond to a stoichiometry of 1:2. Since the water area can be calibrated as above, this reaction provides a means of calibrating the CO 2 areas. The calibration of the 106
