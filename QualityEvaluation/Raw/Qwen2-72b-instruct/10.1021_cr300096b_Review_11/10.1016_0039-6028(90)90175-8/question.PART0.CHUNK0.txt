Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ 07974, USA Received 24 October 1989; accepted for publication 23 February 1990 Methanol decomposition to adsorbed CO and hydrogen on Pt(ll1) was observed using time-resolved high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy.
No reaction was seen at temperatures < 180 K, the molecular methanol desorption temperature.Between 180 and 200 K the decomposition reaction is controlled by the small amount of defects present on our carefully prepared sample.This was principally demonstrated by the fact that only l-2% of a monolayer of CO was formed regardless of the initial methanol coverage.A steady state reaction run between 200 and 240 K showed only a low rate of CO formation (only a few percent of a monolayer even after many langmuir exposure of methanol).At a 300 K surface temperature,decomposition proceeds much faster,with about 10% of a monolayer of CO being formed.The origin of this temperature dependence is attributed to the ability of the product H and CO to diffuse away from sites where they were initially formed.Using a He seeded methanol beam,there was no apparent incident energy dependence for the methanol decomposition reaction.
1. Introduction
The effects of steps and defects in controlling surface reaction pathways is by now a well known phenomenon.
Molecules,weakly bound to large,flat terraces can either desorb back into the gas phase or rapidly diffuse across the surface until they become trapped at defects. Most molecules tend to be more tightly bound at defect sites, and can often dissociate there. Examples of this have been shown for the systems NO/stepped Pd(ll1) [l], NH,/ stepped Fe(lOO) [2], NH,/ stepped Pt(lll) [3], and CO/stepped Ni [4]. In all cases,little or no dissociation is observed on the per- fect terrace.
Methanol adsorption,desorption,and decom- position on Pt(ll1) has been observed by Sexton using high resolution electron energy loss spec- troscopy
(EELS)
and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) [5]. The original purpose of our experiments was to measure the kinetics of this decomposition reaction using time-resolved elec- tron energy loss spectroscopy
(TREELS)
[6]. We will show, however, that at low temperatures the decomposition of methanol on Pt(lll),to ad- sorbed CO and hydrogen, appears to occur prim- arily at defect sites. As such, the reaction stops when the surface CO concentration reaches a few percent of a monolayer, independent of the initial methanol coverage. If the platinum sample is ex- posed to methanol at elevated surface tempera- tures, however, the CO coverage from the methanol decomposition reaction can approach 10% of a monolayer.
2. Experimental
All experiments were carried out using a novel high resolution electron energy loss spectrometer based on the principle of dispersion compensation [7]. This technique allows an increase in signal level of two to three orders of magnitude over conventional EELS spectrometers,with compara- ble resolution.
It is possible therefore to record spectra in a fraction of a second, which allows us to monitor surface reactions in real time. The current spectrometer is an advanced version of the one previously described [7]. The Pt(ll1) sample was dosed using a differentially pumped, pulsed molecular beam source so that gas-exposures could be accurately controlled and reproduced.
In ad- dition, the methanol beam could be seeded readily in helium so that the effects of increased transla- 0039-6028/90/$03.50 0 1990 - Elsevier Science Publishers

The Pt(ll1) single crystal (Metal Crystals, Ltd.,

pure) was cleaned of trace carbon,calcium,and silicon impurities by repeated cycles of neon ion bombardment (1000 eV, 10 PA/cm) at both 450 and 900 K followed by annealing in vacuum at 1250 K. In addition,heating the sample to 1000 K in 1 X lo- Torr of 0,aided in the removal of surface carbon.
Sample cleanliness and order were checked using Auger electron spec- troscopy and low-energy electron diffraction,re- spectively.
The absence of Si and Ca could also be confirmed by EELS,since their presence is indi- cated by an intense mode around 120 meV after oxygen treatment.
We note that although the surface was accurately oriented using Laue back reflection,a l/2 miscut is sufficient to leave - 1% steps and defects.
3. Results
The lower trace of fig. 1 shows a high resolu- tion EELS spectrum of a multilayer of methanol physisorbed on Pt(ll1) at 100 K. The mode as- signments are similar to those of bulk,liquid methanol and have been discussed in detail by Sexton [5]: 84 meV (O-H bend),120 meV (C-O stretch),175 meV (CH,deformation),363 meV
(C-H
stretch),399 meV (O-H stretch).
Sexton also recorded thermal desorption spectra for this system and found that a methanol multilayer de- sorbs at - 140 K, and the monolayer desorbs at about 180 K. In addition,some of the methanol was found to decompose to CO and hydrogen.
The middle trace of fig. 1 shows a spectrum taken after warming a multilayer of methanol from 100 to 220 K at 20 K/min,and holding this temperature for 5 min. There are now three clearly resolved modes:150 meV (adsorbed hydrogen

259 meV
(C-O
stretch),and 364 meV
(C-H
stretch) and a weak sloping baseline between 80 and 200 meV. The elastic peak intensity has also increased by more than a factor of twenty.
The frequency of the C-O stretch indicates that resid- ual carbon monoxide is adsorbed at atop sites,though our current resolution is not sufficient to Energy Loss (cm-) 30! loo0 2ooo so00 44 \

trace is an EELS spectrum of methanol physisorbed on Pt(ll1) at 100 K. The middle trace is a spectrum taken after the surface was heated to 220 K for 5 min.

The sloping baseline may be due to the adsorption of trace amounts of methanol since we have previ- ously observed a similar feature when dosing a clean Pt(ll1) surface with a few percent of a monolayer of methanol.
Unfortunately,we are unable to determine whether a stable surface methoxy species is produced,since the Pt-0

/ Step effects in methanol decomposition on Pt(l1 I) 61 stretch for this species is at 46 meV, an energy loss obscured by tailing from the elastic peak. Other modes which could distinguish methoxy from ad- sorbed methanol could not be spectroscopically resolved.
Finally, the top trace of fig. 1 shows the spec- trum obtained when the crystal is further warmed to 300 K for 5 min. The same three clearly re- solved vibrational modes are still seen, but there is no longer the sloping baseline between 80 and 200 meV. Further warming of the crystal, to about 350 K, causes the feature due to adsorbed hydrogen to disappear. The C-H stretching mode remains un- til the crystal has been heated to much higher temperatures,however. By observing the growth of this latter feature on a clean Pt(ll1) crystal over time, it is clear that only a small amount of its intensity is due to adsorption from the back- ground.
The amount of methanol decomposition can be estimated from the intensity of the C-O stretch,since appreciable CO desorption does not occur until the surface temperature is raised above 300
K. When the intensity of this peak is compared to
that of a (& X fi)R30 o CO overlayer,which contains approximately l/4 of a monolayer of CO adsorbed at atop sites [9,11], we conclude that the surface coverage is only 1 - 2% of a monolayer.
The exact coverage of CO is unclear since the scattering cross-sections for CO adsorbed at ter- race and defect sites may be different #l. Never- theless, the CO coverage is low and indicates that only a small amount of the methanol has decom- posed. Since the amount of adsorbed hydrogen can be no more than 4-8% of a monolayer, this also explains why the Pt-H stretching vibration is so weak. The ability to easily see such small fea- tures is one of the advantages of using a disper- sion compensation

spectrometer [7]. We note that these same results are observed indepen- dent of whether the surface is dosed with sub- monolayer or multilayer amounts of methanol.
Indeed, even when the initial coverage was only *I There is some controversy here, Hayden et al. [9] state that the oscillator strength of CO adsorbed at step and terrace sites differs by a factor of 2.7 while Reutt-Robey et al. [lo] claim that they are the same. 7ooo
