1.The process of selective oxygenate reforming, as described in the literature, does not directly address sustainable energy and chemical production or compare its advantages to traditional methods in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation. However, it does mention that the use of H2 could help achieve the target established by the European Union for the use of biofuels in the European Union Green Paper, which envisioned that 20% of the petrol and diesel used for road transport will be replaced with biofuels by 2020. Additionally, the literature highlights that the use of H2 could help achieve the target established by the European Union for the use of biofuels in the European Union Green Paper. Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised.

1.文献中描述的选择性氧酸重整过程没有直接涉及可持续能源和化学品生产,也没有将其优势与传统方法在产品产量、环境影响和实际实施方面的优势进行比较。但是,它确实提到氢的使用可以帮助实现欧盟绿色文件为欧盟生物燃料使用设定的目标,该目标设想到2020年,用于公路运输的汽油和柴油将有20%被生物燃料取代。此外,文献强调,氢的使用可以帮助实现欧盟绿色文件为欧盟生物燃料使用设定的目标。在催化重整过程中,杜梅西克等人开发的催化水相重整(APR)与催化蒸汽重整相比具有重要优势。这些优势包括:由于无需汽化进料,因此能耗降低;产生的气体富含H2,CO含量低(在APR过程中使用的温度和压力下,水煤气变换反应(WGS)受到青睐);在高温下发生的分解反应被最小化。
