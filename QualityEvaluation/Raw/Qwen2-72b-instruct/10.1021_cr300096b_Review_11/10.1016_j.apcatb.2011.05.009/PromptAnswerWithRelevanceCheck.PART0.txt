1.The process of selective oxygenate reforming, as described in the literature, does not directly address sustainable energy and chemical production or compare its advantages to traditional methods in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation. However, it can be inferred that the process aims to convert glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, into value-added products such as hydrogen and oxygenated hydrocarbons. This conversion could potentially contribute to sustainable energy by utilizing a renewable resource (glycerol) to produce hydrogen, which is a clean fuel. The environmental impact could be positive if the process reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel-based hydrogen production. Practical implementation advantages might include lower energy requirements due to the aqueous phase reforming process, which does not require feed vaporization, and the potential for higher hydrogen yields and lower carbon monoxide production due to the water gas shift reaction being favored at the temperatures and pressures employed.

1.文献中描述的选择性氧酸重整过程虽然没有直接涉及可持续能源和化学品生产,或与传统方法在产品产量、环境影响和实际实施方面的优势进行比较,但可以推断,该过程旨在将甘油(生物柴油生产的一种副产品)转化为增值产品,如氢气和含氧烃。这种转化可能通过利用可再生资源(甘油)来生产氢气(一种清洁能源)对可持续能源做出贡献。如果与基于化石燃料的氢气生产相比,该过程减少了温室气体排放,环境影响可能是积极的。实际实施的优势可能包括由于采用水相重整过程,不需要蒸发原料,因此能源需求较低,并且由于在所使用的温度和压力下,水煤气转换反应被促进,因此潜在的氢气产量更高,一氧化碳产量更低。

1.The process of selective oxygenate reforming, as described in the literature, does not directly address sustainable energy and chemical production or compare its advantages to traditional methods in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation. However, it does mention that the use of H2 could help achieve the target established by the European Union for the use of biofuels in the European Union Green Paper, which envisioned that 20% of the petrol and diesel used for road transport will be replaced with biofuels by 2020. Additionally, the literature highlights that the use of H2 could help achieve the target established by the European Union for the use of biofuels in the European Union Green Paper. Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised.

1.文献中描述的选择性氧酸重整过程没有直接涉及可持续能源和化学品生产,也没有将其优势与传统方法在产品产量、环境影响和实际实施方面的优势进行比较。但是,它确实提到氢的使用可以帮助实现欧盟绿色文件为欧盟生物燃料使用设定的目标,该目标设想到2020年,用于公路运输的汽油和柴油将有20%被生物燃料取代。此外,文献强调,氢的使用可以帮助实现欧盟绿色文件为欧盟生物燃料使用设定的目标。在催化重整过程中,杜梅西克等人开发的催化水相重整(APR)与催化蒸汽重整相比具有重要优势。这些优势包括:由于无需汽化进料,因此能耗降低;产生的气体富含H2,CO含量低(在APR过程中使用的温度和压力下,水煤气变换反应(WGS)受到青睐);在高温下发生的分解反应被最小化。

However, it can be inferred that the use of glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a feedstock for hydrogen production contributes to sustainable energy by utilizing a renewable resource and reducing waste. The catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) process, which is a key part of the selective oxygenate reforming, has advantages over traditional steam reforming methods, including reduced energy requirements, a gas product rich in hydrogen and poor in carbon monoxide, and minimized decomposition reactions at high temperatures.
