1.The process of selective oxygenate reforming, as described in the literature, does not directly address sustainable energy and chemical production or compare its advantages to traditional methods in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation. However, it can be inferred that the process aims to convert glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, into value-added products such as hydrogen and oxygenated hydrocarbons. This conversion could potentially contribute to sustainable energy by utilizing a renewable resource (glycerol) to produce hydrogen, which is a clean fuel. The environmental impact could be positive if the process reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel-based hydrogen production. Practical implementation advantages might include lower energy requirements due to the aqueous phase reforming process, which does not require feed vaporization, and the potential for higher hydrogen yields and lower carbon monoxide production due to the water gas shift reaction being favored at the temperatures and pressures employed.

1.文献中描述的选择性氧酸重整过程虽然没有直接涉及可持续能源和化学品生产,或与传统方法在产品产量、环境影响和实际实施方面的优势进行比较,但可以推断,该过程旨在将甘油(生物柴油生产的一种副产品)转化为增值产品,如氢气和含氧烃。这种转化可能通过利用可再生资源(甘油)来生产氢气(一种清洁能源)对可持续能源做出贡献。如果与基于化石燃料的氢气生产相比,该过程减少了温室气体排放,环境影响可能是积极的。实际实施的优势可能包括由于采用水相重整过程,不需要蒸发原料,因此能源需求较低,并且由于在所使用的温度和压力下,水煤气转换反应被促进,因此潜在的氢气产量更高,一氧化碳产量更低。
