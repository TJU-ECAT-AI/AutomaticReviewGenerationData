1.The process of selective oxygenate reforming, as described in the literature, does not directly address sustainable energy and chemical production or compare its advantages to traditional methods in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation. However, it can be inferred that the use of glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a feedstock for hydrogen production contributes to sustainable energy by utilizing a renewable resource and reducing waste. The catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) process, which is a key part of the selective oxygenate reforming, has advantages over traditional steam reforming methods, including reduced energy requirements, a gas product rich in hydrogen and poor in carbon monoxide, and minimized decomposition reactions at high temperatures.

1.文献中描述的选择性氧酸重整过程虽然没有直接涉及可持续能源和化学品生产,也没有将其优势与传统方法在产品产量、环境影响和实际应用方面进行比较,但可以推断,使用甘油(生物柴油生产的一种副产品)作为氢气生产的原料,通过利用可再生资源和减少废物,对可持续能源做出了贡献。催化水相重整(APR)过程是选择性氧酸重整的关键部分,与传统的蒸汽重整方法相比,它具有降低能源需求、气体产品富含氢气和贫含一氧化碳、高温下分解反应最小化等优点。
