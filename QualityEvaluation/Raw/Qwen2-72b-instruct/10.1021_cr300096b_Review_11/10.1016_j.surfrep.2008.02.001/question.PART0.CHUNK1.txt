Fig. 14 (a) shows the density of states, which is decomposed into contributions from different atomic orbitals by projection of the planewaves onto an atomic orbital basis set as implemented by the Dacapo software, of the four surfaces. A comparison of the DOS clearly reveals significant differences in the electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces. Comparing to Pt(111), the presence of subsurface Ni in PtNiPt(111) tends to increase the intensity of low energy states at the expense of higher energy states in the surface Pt atoms, thus shifting the average energy of the surface Pt d-band away from the Fermi level. In contrast, the NiPt(111) d-band was narrower than Pt(111) and Ni(111), moving the d-band center closer to the Fermi level.

(b) Calculated hydrogen binding energies vs. the d-band center of the surface metal atoms for relaxed slabs and unrelaxed slabs. In each case, the slab is frozen in the HBE calculation, as described in the text. The unrelaxed slabs are included to demonstrate the effect of relaxation on the HBE (from [26] ).
Fig. 14 (b) shows the calculated HBE values as a function of the surface d-band center of various Ni /Pt surfaces. In addition to the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures, DFT modeling is also performed on intermixed NiPt surface structures by incorporation of Ni into the Pt surface layer (e.g. Ni1Pt3, Ni3Pt1). The DFT results in Fig. 14 (b) show an approximately linear correlation between the HBE values and surface d-band center for both relaxed and unrelaxed surfaces. It is important to point out that the relaxation of the surface layers has a negligible effect on the calculated HBE values for the pure metal slabs (Pt and Ni). However, the HBE values on the bimetallic surfaces show a significant sensitivity to relaxation, as does the center of the d-band. In each case, relaxation reduces the magnitude of the HBE, with a corresponding change in the d-band center. The results in Fig. 14 (b), as well as DFT modeling for many other MBS systems, indicate that allowing the surface layer or layers to relax is a critical requirement when performing DFT modeling on MBS.
The trend in Fig. 14 (b) also reveals that the incorporation of Ni into the Pt surface layer increases the HBE on that surface, with all such surfaces (e.g. Ni1Pt3, Ni3Pt1) showing a higher HBE than pure Pt. A corresponding shift of the d-band center closer to the Fermi is observed for each surface. The full Ni-monolayer shows a HBE value that is slightly stronger than Ni(111), which is consistent with the TPD measurements. Most importantly, the comparison of the DFT modeling ( Fig. 14 (b)) and TPD ( Fig. 13 ) results provides verification of the existence of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure. The presence of subsurface Ni in Pt(111) is consistent with other studies of NiPt alloys [82] ,[83] ,[84] ,[85] . For example, for a Pt0.5Ni0.5 alloy, it has been reported that the surface is 88% Pt, the second layer is 91% Ni, and the third layer is 65% Pt [82] . The stability of Pt-terminated surfaces is also consistent with the DFT modeling of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface stability in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, as described earlier in Section
3.3
.
In order to verify the correlation between the DFT modeling and TPD results, Kitchin et al.
[26] calculated the heats of dissociative adsorption from the values of HBE on Pt(111), Ni(111), PtNiPt(111) and NiPt(111) surfaces. The barrier for desorption in this case is identical to the heat of dissociative adsorption of H2, and is equal to the gas phase dissociation energy minus twice the metalH bond strength. These values are compared to the heat of adsorption from the TPD measurements using the Redhead equation for second-order desorption [86] . Identical trend is observed for the four surfaces between DFT modeling and TPD experiments.
To further confirm the unique properties of the Pt-terminated PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure, TPD studies were performed for the desorption of H2 from the PtNi(111) surface prepared by depositing Pt on Ni(111) [78] . As shown in Fig. 15 , the desorption temperature of H2 is at 234 K from ML PtNi(111), which is lower than either Ni(111) or Pt(111) and is consistent with the lower desorption temperature from the PtNiPt(111) MBS structure. More about the general similarity and minor difference between the PtNi(111) and PtNiPt(111) surfaces will be discussed in Section
5.1
in the reactions of alkene molecules on these two types of surfaces.

4.1.2. Trends in HBE on 3d-Pt(111) and Pt-3d-Pt(111) MBS structures
Similar to the Ni /Pt bimetallic surfaces, the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures are thermodynamically stable in vacuum and in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen, as shown earlier in the DFT results in Section
3.3
. The values of HBE on these subsurface structures have been calculated using DFT [28] , which reveals that, as the 3d metal moves toward the left of the Periodic Table from Ni to Ti, the surface d-band center of Pt-3d-Pt(111) gradually shifts away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker HBE as compared to that on Pt(111). In order to further understand the general trend in HBE on different 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, DFT modeling and TPD experiments have been performed on selected MBS structures of Ti, Fe, Co and Cu surfaces on Pt(111) [87] .
Fig. 16 compares the HBE on the surface and subsurface monolayers of Fe, Co, Ni and Cu surfaces, using the VASP code with a 3x3 unit cell of 4 layer slab, with the top two layers allowed for relaxation. For each bimetallic system, the d-band center of the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structure is further away from the Fermi level than the parent metals, resulting in a weaker HBE. On the other hand, the d-band center of the 3d-Pt(111) surface MBS is closer to the Fermi level than the parent metals, leading to a stronger HBE. The exception is the Cu/Pt(111) surfaces, where the values of d-band center and HBE of PtCuPt(111) and CuPt(111) show relatively minor differences. This could be attributed to difficulties in describing Cu as a transition metal due to the high degree of d-band filling, as will be illustrated later for other bimetallic systems involving Cu, Ag or Au.

The corresponding H2 TPD results are shown in Fig. 17 for the subsurface and surface MBS structures of Co/Pt(111) and Fe/Pt(111). Consistent with the DFT prediction, the desorption temperatures from the PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) subsurface structures are lower than the parent metals, and those from the CoPt(111) and FePt(111) surface structures are higher than the parent metals. Combining these results with those shown earlier for the Ni /Pt(111) surfaces ( Fig. 13 ), it is clear that the adsorption energy of atomic hydrogen on Pt(111) can be either decreased or increased by the formation of the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface or 3d-Pt(111) surface MBS structures.

4.1.3. Monolayer Ni on Pt(111), Ru(0001) and W(110)  strain and ligand effects
As discussed earlier, the modification on the d-band center from the formation of bimetallic surfaces can be related to the combination of strain and ligand effects. The surface monolayers of NiPt(111), NiRu(0001), and NiW(110) are bimetallic surfaces where the strain and ligand effects work in opposite directions. The comparison of these surfaces with Ni(111) provides a good example on how the two effects lead to the overall modification on the surface d-band center and HBE. As illustrated in Fig. 18 , a Ni monolayer on W(110) is under substantial tensile strain (>10%) as compared to Ni(111), resulting in a narrowing in the d-band. At the same time, there is a significant broadening of the d-band due to the bonding interaction with the W substrate, as calculated from the interatomic matrix element using the semi-empirical equation (3.11) by Kitchin et al.
[40] . The net effect is dominated by the ligand effect, leading to a broadening of the d-band and correspondingly a shifting of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi level, from 1.22 eV on Ni(111) to 1.64 eV on NiW(110). For a Ni monolayer on Ru(0001), the tensile strain is similar to that on W(110), but the ligand effect is weaker [40] . Consequently, the band-narrowing due to the strain effect and the band-broadening effect due to the ligand effect cancels out, resulting a value of d-band center (1.18 eV) that is very similar to Ni(111). In contrast, for a Ni monolayer on Pt(111), the tensile strain is similar to the other two substrates, but the ligand effect is the weakest [40] . The net effect is dominated by the strain effect, leading to a narrowing of the d-band and a shifting of the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, from 1.22 eV on Ni(111) to 0.80 eV on NiPt(111). As summarized in Fig. 18 , the combination of the ligand and strain effects leads to the following trend of the Ni surface d-band center, NiW(110) < NiRu(0001)  Ni(111) < NiPt(111).Download: Download high-res image (188KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 18.

As shown earlier in Fig. 13 , the desorption temperature from the monolayer NiPt(111) surface is 355 K, slightly higher than that from the Ni(111) film at 311 K. As shown in Fig. 19 , the desorption temperature from the monolayer NiW(110) is centered at 265 K, and that from the monolayer NiRu(0001) is centerd at 332 K. Therefore, the TPD experiments show the following trend in the desorption temperature, NiW(110) < NiRu(0001)  Ni(111) < NiPt(111), qualitatively confirming the predicted trend from the DFT prediction.Download: Download high-res image (324KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 19.

4.1.4. Other bimetallic surfaces
In addition to the examples shown in previous sections, the DFT correlation between surface d-band center and HBE has been established on a wide range of other MBS structures. Pallassana et al.
[16] ,[34] ,[41] ,[88] ,[89] ,[90] have performed extensive DFT calculations of HBE on PdRe bimetallic systems, including monolayer PdRe(0001), RePd(111), and intermixed RexPd1x layers on both Re(0001) and Pd(111).
Fig. 20 shows the nearly linear relationship between the HBE and the weighted d-band center of these bimetallic surfaces [41] . These authors also investigated the effect between hydrogen bonding to a single type of metal atoms and to both Re and Pd metals. The results in Fig. 20 illustrate that the correlation of the HBE with d-band center holds for both types of bonding configurations.

Greeley and Mavrikakis have [32] compiled a comprehensive database for the adsorption of hydrogen on MBS structures.
Fig. 21 shows the correlation of HBE with surface d-band center for several classes of bimetallic surfaces, including the subsurface configurations of a wide range of admetals on the closed-packed substrate of Pt(111), Pd(111), and Rh(111), and Re(0001)-based MBS structures. A nearly linear trend is observed for all the bimetallic systems. The three individual lines were drawn by the authors to highlight the different slopes for bimetallic systems on the three different substrates, Pt, Pd and Rh, which are expected due to difference in the coupling matrix elements of the three substrates [32] . More about the different slopes will be discussed later for the binding energies of alkenes on various bimetallic surfaces in Section
5.1
, where the effect of differing coupling matrix elements becomes more significant.

Ogura et al.
[91] reported that hydrogen adsorption on surface monolayer AgPt(111) and AuPt(111) act similarly to that on Ag(111) and Au(111) single crystal surfaces. This phenomenon is explained by DFT modeling, which shows that the d-band center of AgPt(111) and AuPt(111) change only slightly as compared to Ag(111) and Au(111) surfaces, respectively. These results are consistent with HBE values shown earlier ( Fig. 16 ) for CuPt(111) and PtCuPt(111), which are similar to Cu(111). Altogether these results confirm that the bimetallic surfaces containing Cu, Ag and Au behave differently from those containing Group IV-VIII transition metals.
Fig. 22 shows an extension of the DFT trend from MBS systems to transition metal carbides [39] . This is an attempt to explain the observations that transition metal carbides, such as Mo2C, often show similar chemical properties as those of Pt-group metals [92] ,[93] . The correlation of HBE with the surface d-band center appears to extend to the carbide surfaces, which suggests the possibility of using the values of surface d-band to predict chemical properties of different carbide surfaces. The combination of bimetallic and carbide surfaces expands the d-band center values from near the Fermi level to approximately 3 eV below, which offers a wide range of selections for choosing materials with desirable values of electronic and chemical properties.

Finally, the DFT results in Fig. 21 , Fig. 22 both identified Pt/W as the surface with one of the lowest HBE values. This has been confirmed experimentally by Zellner et al. with H2 TPD on the PtW(110) surface monolayer [94] . The desorption of H2 occurs at 142 K, representing the lowest desorption temperature among all the MBS structures that have been studied experimentally.
From the results discussed in Section
4.1
, it is apparent that bimetallic surfaces with the subsurface monolayer structures bond to hydrogen more weakly than the parent metals. Typically a weaker HBE would suggest a higher activation barrier for the dissociation of H2 based on correlations from simple dissociation reactions [37] ,[95] ,[96] . However, as demonstrated by Greeley and Mavrikakis in Fig. 23 [32] , the subsurface monolayer structures have relatively low activation barriers for H2 dissociation. Even though the HBE on these surfaces could be as low as those on the relative inert metals such as Cu and Au, the activation barriers for H2 dissociation are much lower on the subsurface monolayer structures. As pointed out by the authors, the subsurface structures offer the unique combination of facile H2 dissociation and weakly bonded hydrogen, which should have significant effect in reactions involving H transfer, such as the hydrogenation of alkenes, as will be demonstrated in Section
5.1

4.2. Dissociative adsorption of oxygen and oxygen-induced segregation
4.2.1. Trends in oxygen binding energy on 3d/Pt surfaces
In recent years 3d-Pt bimetallic alloys have attracted much research attention for their potential application as cathode electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) type fuel cells. Specifically, electrodes composed of alloys of Pt with iron [68] ,[97] ,[98] , cobalt [97] ,[99] ,[100] ,[101] ,[102] , and nickel [97] ,[98] ,[99] ,[100] ,[101] ,[102] ,[103] ,[104] ,[105] have been shown to exhibit activity significantly greater than that of pure Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). For example, Stamenkovi and coworkers reported that, while Pt3Co and Pt3Ni electrodes showed improvements over pure Pt for the ORR, alternative Pt-skin of these alloys, with Pt occupying the top-most surface layer, possessed the maximum catalytic enhancement [100] ,[101] ,[104] . These experimental results were further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations from the Mavrikakis group, where the enhanced ORR activity on the Pt-skin system was partially attributed to the alleviation of oxygen poisoning by the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi Level [95] ,[106] . The Goddard group modeled and compared the chemisorption of atomic oxygen on Pt(111) and bimetallic Pt/Ni(111), concluding that oxygen was more tightly bound and more localized on Pt/Ni(111) than on pure Pt(111) [107] . All the experimental and theoretical results suggest that one of the main differences between Pt and 3d-Pt alloys is the different oxygen binding energy (OBE) on these surfaces.
Menning et al. have performed DFT calculations to compare the general trend in the OBE on the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) and surface 3d-Pt(111) structures [74] .
Fig. 24 shows the comparison of OBE as a function of surface d-band center on various Pt-3d-Pt(111) and 3d-Pt(111) MBS configurations. There is a nearly linear trend in the OBE on the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt structure. The OBE values of all subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures are weaker than that on pure Pt(111), with the weakest binding energy on PtTiPt and the strongest on PtNiPt. For the 3d-Pt(111) surface monolayer configuration, there is again a nearly linear trend in the OBE values with respect to the surface d-band center. However, this trend is opposite to that of the subsurface configuration, with the TiPt(111) surface having the strongest binding energy while the NiPt(111) surface the weakest. Overall, the OBE values on all the 3d-Pt(111) surface structures are stronger than that on pure Pt(111), suggesting that these bimetallic surface structures should have lower activity toward the ORR than Pt(111) due to poisoning by the strongly bonded oxygen atoms.

The DFT results in Fig. 24 also reveal two distinct slopes for the subsurface and surface structures. In all the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures the surface atom is Pt (5d metal), while 3d is the surface metal in all the 3d-Pt(111) surface MBS structures. The different slopes for the two types of structures are due to the Pauli repulsion in the electronic states between the metal surface and adsorbates, resulting in an increase in the kinetic energy that is proportional to the square of the adsorbate-metal d coupling matrix element
V
a d 2 . This coupling element varies with the increasing extension of 3d, 4d and 5d orbitals, which generally leads to different slopes in the correlation between binding energy and the surface d-band center for bimetallic surfaces with 3d, 4d and 5d metals. The differences become even more obvious for larger adsorbes, such as hydrocarbons as will be illustrated in Section
5.1
.
In order to provide insights into the unique properties of the Pt-skin electrocatalysts, Xu et al. have performed detailed DFT modeling of adsorption and dissociation of O and O2 on various surface structures of Pt3Co(111) and Pt3Fe(111) alloys [95] ,[106] . In this work the Pt-skin was modelled by one monolayer of Pt on either the Pt3Co(111) or Pt3Fe(111) substrate. The authors also compared the properties of 2% stressed Pt(111) to determine the effect of strain due to lattice mismatch between the surface Pt atoms with the bulk alloy substrate.
Fig. 25 shows a correlation between the OBE and the surface d-band center of various surfaces. The DFT results show that the d-band center of the intermixed Pt3Co(111) surface is much closer to the Fermi level than that of the Pt-skin structure, leading to a stronger bonding of O atoms on the former surface. These authors also confirmed the BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship between the OBE and activation barrier for the dissociation of O2 on the various surface structures, suggesting the possibility to correlate ORR activity with the value of OBE [95] ,[106] . Results from DFT calculations by Norskov et al. further confirmed that the ORR activity of the cathode electrocatalysts can be related to the binding energy of atomic oxygen on bimetallic surfaces [28] .

4.2.2. Oxygen-induced segregation in Pt-3d-Pt subsurface structures
While there is a general agreement that the ORR activity can be significantly improved by modifying Pt electrodes with a layer of subsurface 3d metal, the stability of these bimetallic systems remains unclear. Results from LEED studies revealed that alloy surfaces, such as Pt78Ni22(111), Pt80Ni20(001), Pt80Co20(111), and Pt80Fe20(111), all exhibited a pure Pt outermost layer with a 3d-rich layer underneath [25] . In the presence of oxygen, however, Bardi et al. observed the formation of bulk-like Co oxides on the surface of both the (100) and (111) faces of Pt80Co20, suggesting the segregation of the subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen [108] ,[109] .
Menning et al. have performed DFT calculations and experimental measurements to understand the thermodynamics and kinetics of the segregation of 3d metals in the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structures [74] . As shown earlier in Fig. 10 , the 3d-Pt(111) surface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the corresponding Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures in the presence of 0.5 ML of adsorbed O atoms. The stability of the Pt-3d bimetallic systems can be determined by comparing the difference in total energy,
Δ
E
, between the subsurface and surface configurations when exposed to a half monolayer of oxygen. The total energy difference should be proportional to the heat of reaction and should allow the prediction of which configuration is thermodynamically favored in the presence of adsorbed oxygen atoms. As shown in Fig. 10 , in each case the 3d-Pt(111) surface configuration is lower in energy than that of the corresponding subsurface configuration, indicating a thermodynamic driving force for the segregation of the subsurface 3d atoms in the Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures to produce the 3d-Pt(111) surfaces.
Using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), Menning et al. used the onset of the υ (NiO) or υ (CoO) mode to verify the segregation of subsurface Ni or Co from PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111) [74] . AES measurements were also performed in the presence of oxygen on PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) to estimate the activation barriers for the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms.
Fig. 26 (a) shows the AES measurements of oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni from PtNiPt(111), which were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni /Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time. These experiments were performed at several temperatures in order to estimate the activation barrier (
E
a ) for transforming the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure to the surface NiPt(111) in the presence of oxygen. The AES Ni /Pt ratio in Fig. 26 (a) is renormalized in such a way that a value of 0 represents only Pt in the first layer and 1 represents only Ni in the first layer. The rate of Ni segregation was estimated based on the time required to reach a Ni /Pt ratio of 0.5, or t1/2, for each temperature. The
E
a for the segregation of subsurface Ni is estimated to be 15 +
2 kcal / mol from the ln 1 / t 1 / 2 versus reciprocal temperature plot, as shown in Fig. 26 (b).

Similar AES measurements were conducted to estimate the
E
a value for transforming PtCoPt(111) to CoPt(111) in the presence of oxygen [74] , which was estimated to be 7 +
1 kcal / mol for the segregation of subsurface Co atoms. The difference between the
E
a values for Ni and Co suggests that the magnitude of the activation barrier is related to the difference in the total energy between, O/3d-PtPt and O/Pt-3d-Pt, with a smaller thermodynamic driving force in Ni /Pt(111) leading to a larger
E
a for the segregation of subsurface Ni. As shown earlier in Fig. 10 , the thermodynamic driving force becomes larger as the 3d metals move from Ni to the left side of the Periodic Table, which in turn suggests that the activation barrier for the segregation of other subsurface 3d metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe) should be even lower than that for Co or Ni [74] .
4.2.3. Other bimetallic surfaces
The examples in the previous section show that the 3d monolayer in Pt-3d-Pt(111) segregate from the subsurface to the surface region in the presence of oxygen. In contrast, the AgCu(110) monolayer surface provides an opposite example, where the presence of oxygen induces the inward diffusion of the surface Ag atoms into the subsurface region. Hirsimaki and Chorkendorff reported that, upon the deposition of Ag on Cu(100) in vacuum, Ag replaces Cu within the top layer to produce a surface alloy [110] . The O2 dissociation over Ag/Cu(100) is significantly lower than that of clean Cu(100) [110] , mainly due to steric blocking of the surface defects on the Cu(100) face by Ag atoms. The exposure of O2 to AgCu(100) at surface temperatures between 320473 K resulted in an induced segregation/diffusion of the surface constituents [111] . Utilizing AES along with Ar+ sputtering, it was determined that Cu segregated to the surface to produce Cu2O after exposure to O2 while driving Ag into the subsurface region and remaining in the metallic Ag state. The oxygen-induced diffusion of Ag was attributed to the significant thermodynamic difference in the heat of formation between Cu2O (169 kJ /mol) and that of the most stable Ag oxide Ag2O (31.1 kJ/mol). It is most likely that similar inward diffusion should occur for those bimetallic systems where the difference in the heats of oxide formation is larger than the segregation energy of the corresponding bimetallic surfaces.
In addition to being an important parameter for identifying the ORR activity, the value of OBE can also be a useful indicator in identifying catalytic materials for other reactions that involve the adsorption of oxygen, such as CO oxidation and NO reduction reactions [65] . Greeley and Norskov [112] have provided a comprehensive database of the OBE values and shifts in the surface d-band center for many MBS systems. Using these databases they developed a relatively simple model to estimate the values of OBE on bimetallic surface alloys on different metal substrates. In this model the change in the OBE is scaled to the shift in the surface d-band center of the corresponding MBS structures. This model allows the quick estimation of the binding energy of oxygen on the 3-fold site made of AAB surface mixtures on substrate A (designated as AABA) or substrate B (designated as AABB), where A and B represent different transition metals.
Fig. 27 shows a comparison of the OBE values obtained from this simple model and from full DFT calculations [112] , which shows a remarkable agreement with hundreds of bimetallic alloy surfaces. The systems that show deviation of more than 0.5 eV are labeled in Fig. 27 , which are alloy systems that involve the Cu, Ag, and Au elements. This is a reoccurring observation and further confirms that the d-band center might be inadequate to describe these three metals due to their d-band filling.

4.3. Adsorption of CO and trend in binding energy of molecular adsorbates
4.3.1. Correlation of desorption temperature of CO with surface d-band center
The adsorption and desorption of carbon monoxide have a long history of being used to probe the physical and chemical properties of surfaces, due to the fact that the bonding configurations of adsorbed CO are sensitive to the electronic structures of metal surfaces. The TPD measurements of the desorption temperature of CO are a simple and useful way to determine the bonding of CO on surfaces. Unlike the complications from the second-order recombinatory desorption of H2, the desorption of CO is first-order on most surfaces, with the shift in the peak desorption temperature corresponding directly to changes in the activation energy for desorption if the pre-exponential factor is a constant [86] . Assuming that the adsorption of CO is not activated, which is valid on most transition metal surfaces, the activation energy of desorption is equal to the adsorption energy. Therefore, a shift in the CO desorption temperature is related to a change in the adsorption energy, which offers a direct and simple way to determine the effect of bimetallic formation.
Many research groups, especially Goodman and coworkers, have performed systematic TPD studies of CO desorption from a wide range of MBS structures [7] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[113] ,[114] ,[115] ,[116] ,[117] ,[118] ,[119] ,[120] . The experimental results from these studies clearly indicated that the desorption temperature of CO from the bimetallic surfaces is different from that of parent metals, and that the change in the desorption temperature is related to the modification of the electronic structures due to bimetallic formation. These results have been discussed and debated in depth in many papers and reviews [7] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[113] ,[114] ,[115] ,[116] ,[121] ,[122] and will not be covered in the current review. The purpose of the current section is to use the adsorption/desorption of CO as an example to demonstrate the correlation between the molecular adsorption energy and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces.
Hammer at al.
[15] have performed DFT calculations to correlate the change in the CO desorption temperature with surface core level shift for several MBS structures, as shown in Fig. 28 . The shift in the CO desorption temperature is from the experimental data of Pd, Ni and Cu monolayers on many substrates by Rodriguez and Goodman [116] . The nearly linear correlation clearly demonstrates that the desorption temperature of CO is a useful probe to determine the changes in the electronic structures of MBS. These authors also proposed that the adsorption energy of CO is related to the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces [15] . Hennig et al. have also shown that the variations in the surface core level shifts of bimetallic monolayer systems are correlated with the differences in the core level binding energy of the monolayer surface and an unperturbed surface, termed the adlayer core-level shift (ACLS) [122] . The ACLS is the experimental equivalent of the d-band shift, which is determined as the difference between the d-band center of the metal surface with and without the admetal monolayer.

Kitchin et al.
[30] have compared peak desorption temperatures of CO from many MBS systems from the literature [7] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[113] ,[114] ,[115] ,[116] ,[117] ,[118] ,[119] ,[120] and estimated the shift in peak desorption temperature with respect to desorption from the pure overlayer metal. DFT calculations were performed for each bimetallic surface to determine the change in the surface d-band center as compared to the pure metal. The results are summarized in Fig. 29 , where the shift in CO desorption peak temperature is correlated with the shift in the surface d-band center using either relaxed or unrelaxed slab calculations. The trend in Fig. 29 confirms that the binding energy of CO, as experimentally determined from the desorption temperature of CO, is related to the surface d-band center for a wide range of bimetallic surfaces. These results also suggest that the TPD measurement of molecularly adsorbed CO offers a simple experimental method if one needs to estimate the direction and magnitude of d-band center shift in MBS structures.

4.3.2. Adsorption of CO on Pt-based and Ru-based bimetallic surfaces
The facile oxidation of CO to C O2 is a critical reaction in improving the CO-tolerance of anode electrocatalysts in PEM fuel cells. Currently PtRu bimetallic alloys are the leading CO-tolerant electrocatalysts [123] , resulting in many surface science and DFT studies of the interactions of CO with the PtRu bimetallic surfaces, as well as with Pt-based and Ru-based bimetallic surfaces. In this section we will provide a brief summary of literature in this area and conclude with some unanswered questions.
Koschel et al. used angle resolved UV spectroscopy to show that monolayer Cu modified Ru(0001) resulted in an increased interaction of CO with the substrate as compared to Cu(111) [124] , although the interaction is still weaker than CO on pure Ru(0001). The increase in the CO binding energy on the CuRu(0001) bimetallic surface was attributed to Cu 3d states coupling strongly to the Ru(0001) surface states. Hager et al.
[125] noticed a similar strong coupling for the Cu/Ru(0001) surface while examining PdCu surface alloys on Ru(0001). Engelhardt et al.
[126] ,[127] examined the effects of monolayer Cr modification of Ru(0001). They found that for Cr deposited and annealed between 7001000 K, Cr and Ru formed a surface alloy that enhanced the activity of CO dissociation as compared to Ru(0001).
Among the Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, Colen et al.
[128] examined the reaction rate of CO oxidation on submonolayer Cu modified Pt(111). It was found that the Cu modification of Pt(111) enhanced the CO oxidation rate to C O2. The enhancement was attributed to decreases in the apparent adsorption, desorption, and surface reaction activation energies. This conclusion was consistent with the DFT calculations by Mavrikakais et al.
[61] and Hammer et al.
[15] , who reported that the CO binding energy was weaker on Cu/Pt(111) than on pure Pt(111).
The most relevant bimetallic surface in PEM fuel cells, PtRu, has been synthesized using various methods, including the reduction of H2PtCl6 on Ru(0001) [129] ,[130] , the evaporation of Pt on Ru(0001) [131] , and the deposition of Ru on Pt(111) and Pt(100) [132] ,[133] ,[134] . Behm and coworkers have performed detailed studies of the adsorption and desorption of CO on Pt/Ru(0001) bimetallic surfaces utilizing TPD and STM [131] . Their results indicated that, in the absence of water or hydroxyls, the CO binding energy on Pt/Ru(0001) was significantly reduced as compared to Ru(0001) or Pt(111). Additionally, Schlapka et al.
[135] examined the CO adsorption on Pt/Ru(0001) using IRAS and found a significant decrease in CO adsorption on well annealed Pt/Ru(001) surfaces as compared to surfaces that were not annealed, as shown in Fig. 30 . They attributed the decrease in CO adsorption to increase in size of the Pt islands and an increase in their density when annealed, therefore causing the CO to adsorb at straight PtRu steps that were not present when the Pt was more dispersed in less dense smaller clusters. In both papers, the significant decrease in CO and CO2 desorption temperatures was cited as a likely explanation to the significantly enhanced CO oxidation activity of Pt/Ru fuel cell electrocatalysts.

Desai and Neurock [136] utilized DFT to model CO oxidation on Pt and Ru/Pt bimetallic surfaces. These authors have identified two competing mechanisms that could attribute to the enhancement of CO oxidation on the Ru/Pt bimetallic surface: (1) Similar to the correlation of CO binding energy with surface d-band center (shown earlier in Fig. 29 ), some Ru/Pt bimetallic structures weaken the interaction of CO with the surface and therefore reduce the activation energy for CO oxidation. (2) The addition of Ru acts as a promoter for the oxidation of water, which enhances a bifunctional mechanism that promotes the oxidation of CO through a COOH* intermediate. However, as pointed out by Desai and Neurock [136] , there is still debate over the dominant mechanism for the increased activity of CO oxidation. In this particular case, the comparison between the DFT modeling, performed in the presence of water and hydroxyl groups, and the UHV experiments is not straightforward. Furthermore, the stability of the various Pt/Ru structures, such as the surface and subsurface monolayer configurations, is not well understood in the presence of adsorbed CO, surface hydroxyl, and in the liquid environment with applied electrochemical potentials. More experimental studies and DFT calculations under realistic fuel cell operating conditions are needed to further understand the mechanism responsible for the enhanced CO-tolerance of the Pt/Ru bimetallic surfaces.
5. Correlating chemical activities with surface d-band center
The examples used in Section 4 provide a clear correlation of the binding energies of atomic and molecular adsorbates with the d-band center of MBS structures. In this section we will extend the correlation of surface d-band center to the chemical activities of the bimetallic surfaces using two types of surface reactions. The first one is the hydrogenation of molecules containing the C=C bond, which should require the surface to interact weakly with both atomic hydrogen and the C=C bond. Based on the examples given in Section 4 , the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface monolayer structures should be preferred over either Pt or the corresponding 3d metals. The second type of reaction is the reforming of oxygenates to produce H2 and CO, which should in principle require the surface to bond relatively strongly to both oxygenates and to the atomic hydrogen and CO products. In this case the 3d-Pt(111) surface monolayer structures should be favored as compared to the corresponding parent metals and to the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures.
Similar to the format in Section 4 , the examples in this section will attempt to compare results from UHV experiments and DFT modeling, with a focus on correlating hydrogenation and reforming activities with the surface d-band center. For this reason many of the elegant examples of reactions on bimetallic surfaces, such as the pyramidal monolayer surfaces by Madey and coworkers [9] , and the Sn/Pt surfaces by Koel and coworkers [17] , just to name a few, will not be covered in this review. We have summarized in Table 3 reactions of many molecules on different bimetallic surfaces, including those that will not be reviewed here. Interested readers are encouraged to read the relevant papers in Table 3 for the novel chemical activities of bimetallic surfaces.

5.1. Adsorption and hydrogenation of hydrocarbons containing C=C bond
5.1.1. Linear alkenes
5.1.1.1. Ethylene
The reaction of ethylene was used as a probe molecule to investigate the chemical properties of Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces by Fruhberger et al.
[137] .
Fig. 31 shows a comparison of the TPD spectra of the H2 product from the decomposition of ethylene on Pt(111), a Ni(111) thin film epitaxially grown on Pt(111), and a PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer. As expected, the Pt(111) and Ni(111) surfaces are active toward the decomposition of ethylene, as indicated by the production of relative intense H2 peaks. In contrast, the H2 peak area from PtNiPt(111) is nearly negligible, indicating that the subsurface structure is nearly inert toward the decomposition of ethylene. The results in Fig. 31 represent one of the first examples that convincingly demonstrate the unique chemical activities of MBS structures, which are distinctively different from those of either parent metals.

In order to confirm the unusual TPD results, Fruhberger et al.
[137] performed vibrational studies of ethylene on the three surfaces.
Fig. 32 shows the HREELS results following the adsorption of ethylene on PtNiPt(111) at 80 K and after heating to higher temperatures. The peak positions and the relative intensities of the vibrational features at 80 and 200 K are indicative of weakly π -bonded ethylene, which undergoes reversible molecular desorption by 300 K. HREELS measurements were also performed in the same study following the adsorption and decomposition of ethylene on Pt(111) and the Ni(111) film [137] . The results on Pt(111) confirm the literature data that ethylene undergoes decomposition to produce the ethylidyne intermediate, which further decomposes to produce H2 and atomic carbon at higher temperatures. On the Ni(111) film ethylene decomposes to produce acetylene, which also undergoes further decomposition to produce H2 and atomic carbon. These observations are consistent with the TPD results, clearly indicating that the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure interacts very weakly with ethylene.

In order to verify that the unique property of PtNiPt(111) is due to the interaction of Pt atoms with the subsurface Ni, Khan et al. have performed TPD and HREELS studies of the adsorption and decomposition of ethylene on Ni(111) with one monolayer surface Pt atoms [80] . The degree of ethylene decomposition on monolayer PtNi(111) is determined to be significantly less than on either Ni(111) or Pt(111), consistent with the results of PtNiPt(111). These studies indicate that in both cases the weaker interaction of between ethylene and the surface Pt atoms is related to the presence of subsurface Ni atoms. Similarly, Egawa et al.
[138] showed that monolayer Pt epitaxially grown on Ni(100) results in a narrowing of the surface d-band states. This in turn weakens the ethylene binding energy on the monolayer PtNi(100) surface.
The weaker interaction of ethylene on PtNiPt(111), as compared to either Pt(111) or Ni(111), was confirmed by DFT calculations of ethylene binding energy on these surfaces [139] . As shown in Fig. 33 the binding energy of ethylene on PtNiPt(111) is weaker than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The results also illustrate different slopes for the 3d, 4d and 5d surface metals in the correlation of binding energy with the surface d-band center. As explained earlier in Section
4.2
, the coupling matrix element in the DFT modeling varies with the increasing extension of 3d, 4d, and 5d orbitals [139] . This variation is relatively minor for small adsrobates such as atomic H, leading to a nearly linear trend in the HBE with the d-band center of 3d, 4d, and 5d metals. However, such variation becomes more significant for the interaction with larger adsorbates. Therefore, for correlation of molecular binding energy with surface d-band center, it is necessary to draw separate slopes for MBS structures with 3d, 4d, and 5d surface metals, as in the case in Fig. 33 . In addition to calculating the ethylene binding energies, Goda et al. have also calculated the binding energies of other C2 species, including acetylene, vinyl (C2H2) and ethyl (C2H4), on all the surfaces in Fig. 33 [139] . The trends in binding energy vs. d-band center of these C2 species are very similar to those for ethylene.

DFT calculations correlating ethylene binding energy to the surface d-band center for several single crystal and bimetallic systems. Three lines are drawn to show different slopes for 3d, 4d and 5d surface atoms (from [94] ).
DFT calculations also predict that several other MBS structures, such as monolayer PdMo(110) and PtW(110) surfaces, should also bond to ethylene very weakly [94] . Zellner et al. performed TPD and HREELS studies to confirm the DFT predictions [94] .
Fig. 34 shows the desorption of the H2 product following the decomposition of ethylene on Mo(110), thick Pd(111) film, and surface monolayer PdMo(110). Based on the desorption peak areas of H2, the degree of ethylene decomposition on monolayer PdMo(110) is significantly less than either Mo(110) or Pd(111) [94] , confirming the DFT predictions. TPD experiments monitoring the decomposition of ethylene on the monolayer PtW(110) bimetallic surface show the identical trend, with a significant decrease in the decomposition of ethylene on monolayer PtW(110) as compared to either W(110) or Pt(111) [94] . Further investigations of the monolayer PtW(110) system with HREELS reveal that ethylene adsorbs in the more strongly di- σ bonded configuration on both W(110) and Pt(111), but in the more weakly π -bonded configuration on monolayer PtW(110) [94] . The results from these combined experimental and DFT studies confirm that the d-band center can be used to predict the binding energies of ethylene on MBS structures.

Similar trends have been observed in the DFT modeling of the adsorption and reactions of ethylene on monolayer Pd on Re(0001), Ru(0001), and Au(111) surfaces by Pallassana and Neurock [34] .
Fig. 35 shows that on surfaces that exhibit a shift in the center of d-band away from the Fermi level, Pd/Re(0001) and Pd/Ru(0001) as compared to that of Pd(111), both ethylene and hydrogen bond more weakly than on Pd(111). The hydrogenation of ethylene to ethyl is examined through the addition of an adsorbed hydrogen atom into the CH bond as well as by the β -hydride elimination reaction of the ethyl intermediate. It is found that surfaces with weaker molecule/surface interactions with both ethylene and hydrogen demonstrate an increased activity and lower activation barrier for the hydrogenation reaction. Similarly, the surface that exhibits shift in the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, Pd/Au(111), the binding energies of both ethylene and hydrogen both increase as compared to Pd(111). The higher binding energies lead to an increase in the activity and a decrease in the activation barrier for the dehydrogenation of ethylene to vinyl. One of the important conclusions from this study is that surfaces with the d-band shifting toward the Fermi level are more reactive toward the dehydrogenation reaction, while those with the d-band center moving away from the Fermi level are more active toward the hydrogenation reactions. Such correlation of the hydrogenation activity with the d-band center will become more obvious in the examples shown below.

5.1.1.2. 1-butene and 1-hexene
DFT calculations of the binding energy of 1-butene are shown in Fig. 36 for several subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) and surface 3d-Pt(111) structures [140] . Two separate trends can be observed between the binding energy and d-band center, one for the Pt-3d-Pt(111) and Pt(111) where the surface atoms are Pt, and another one for 3d-Pt(111) where the surface layer is 3d metals. Except for the Cu/Pt(111) systems, one common observation in Fig. 36 is that the binding energy of the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structure is weaker than both Pt(111) and the corresponding surface 3d-Pt(111) structure. This is consistent with the trends discussed earlier for the binding energies of atomic H, atomic O, and ethylene on the corresponding surface and subsurface structures. DFT calculations of the binding energies have also been performed for 1-hexene on these MBS structures, which reveal similar trends as for 1-butene [140] .

The observation of weakly bonded alkenes and atomic H suggests that the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structures should be more active toward the hydrogenation of alkenes. Murillo et al.
[141] performed TPD studies following the reaction of 1-butene and 1-hexene with preadsorbed H on the PtNiPt(111), NiPt(111), Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film. The results reveal that only the subsurface PtNiPt(111) is active for the hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene under UHV conditions [141] .
Fig. 37 shows the production of the dehydrogenation products, butane and hexane, from PtNiPt(111) with and without preadsorbed hydrogen. In the absence of preadsorbed hydrogen, the reaction is termed self-hydrogenation (disproportionation reaction), where a fraction of adsorbed alkenes dehydrogenates to produce hydrogen for the subsequent hydrogenation reaction. The comparison in Fig. 37 shows that self-hydrogenation occurs for 1-hexene but not for 1-butene, and that the hydrogenation yield is significantly enhanced with preadsorbed hydrogen atoms [141] .

Another objective for that study is to determine the effect of increasing chain length of alkenes on the hydrogenation activity [141] . For weakly π -bonded alkenes, such as ethylene, 1-butene and 1-hexene on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure, the effect of increasing the hydrocarbon chain length is to increase the desorption temperature of alkene molecules from the surface. For each additional CH2 unit in the hydrocarbon chain length, approximately an extra 30 kJ of energy is needed for thermal desorption [142] . This phenomenon was found to play an important role in the hydrogenation and self-hydrogenation reactions of alkenes on PtNiPt(111). For ethylene, neither self-hydrogenation nor hydrogenation is detected [141] . For 1-butene, the self-hydrogenation is not detected but hydrogenation is observed, as illustrated in Fig. 37 . For 1-hexene, both self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation occur on PtNiPt(111). For the self-hydrogenation reaction, which first requires the availability of atomic hydrogen from the dehydrogenation of co-adsorbed alkenes, chain length plays a significant role. The absence of the self-hydrogenation reaction for ethylene and 1-butene is attributed to the weak binding energies, causing molecular desorption to occur prior to the dehydrogenation reaction that is necessary to produce atomic hydrogen. Because longer chain length molecules desorb at relatively higher temperatures due to their increased molecular weight, 1-hexene remains on the surface to higher temperatures than 1-butene, allowing the dehydrogenation reaction to proceed before molecular desorption and therefore allowing the self-hydrogenation reaction pathway. Similar argument can also be made for the hydrogenation of the three alkene molecules, where the hydrogenation with preadsorbed hydrogen would occur only if the alkene molecules do not desorb from the surface before the desorption of atomic hydrogen. This can explain why the hydrogenation does not occur for ethylene but for the longer chain 1-butene and 1-hexene [141] .
5.1.2. Cyclic hydrocarbons
5.1.2.1. Cyclohexene
The low-temperature self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Ni /Pt(111) are among the earliest examples that demonstrate the novel reaction pathways that are not present on parent metals [137] . In this section we will use the self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation of cyclohexene as probe reactions to correlate the hydrogenation activity with the surface d-band center of bimetallic surfaces.
Fig. 38 (a) shows the production of cyclohexane from the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene [143] . It is clear from the TPD results that the self-hydrogenation occurs on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure, but not on either Pt(111) or the Ni(111) film with thickness of 3 monolayer or higher.

In order to confirm that the onset of the self-hydrogenation pathway is due to the interaction of surface Pt atoms with subsurface Ni atoms, similar TPD measurements were performed on Pt-modified Ni(111) at various Pt coverages, as shown in Fig. 38 (b) [78] . Similar to PtNiPt(111), a low-temperature self-hydrogenation pathway is detected at 237 K. As quantified by Khan et al.
[80] , the product yield, in the unit of molecules per surface metal atom, is 0.031 C6H6 and 0.003 c- C6H12 on the ML PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure. Similarly, the self-hydrogenation yield on the ML PtNi(111) is calculated to be 0.027 C6H6 and 0.004 c- C6H12. The nearly identical yields demonstrate that both monolayer surfaces have similar activities toward dehydrogenation and self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 38 , the two types of surfaces show significant differences at a metal overlayer coverage of 3 ML. The 3 ML NiPt(111) surface starts to show activity similar to Ni(111), as indicated by the absence of the self-hydrogenation pathway. In contrast, the 3 ML PtNi(111) retains the self-hydrogenation activity, which is different from Pt(111). The latter is likely due to the inability of the larger Pt atoms to grow epitaxially on the Ni(111) substrate [80] . More importantly, the comparison in Fig. 38 reveals that the novel hydrogenation pathway can be achieved by either depositing one monolayer of Pt on bulk Ni or by one monolayer of Ni on bulk Pt. The former procedure should definitely be preferred in catalytic applications because of the higher cost of Pt.
The unique activity of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer toward cyclohexene is further confirmed using HREELS [143] , as shown in Fig. 39 . The vibrational spectrum of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). Based on detailed vibrational assignment [143] , the species on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface is weakly π -bonded cyclohexene. In contrast, the surface species is assigned as strongly di- σ bonded cyclohexene on Pt(111) and the benzene intermediate on Ni(111). These assignments were further confirmed from the polarization-dependence Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) measurements [143] . Results from both HREELS and NEXAFS measurements indicate that the interaction of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is much weaker than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111), responsible for the onset of the self-hydrogenation pathway on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure.

The weaker binding energy of cyclohexene on the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is confirmed by DFT calculations [140] , as shown in Fig. 40 . The DFT calculations also reveal that other subsurface MBS structures, such as PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111), also bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding surface monolayer structures. The trends are similar to those shown earlier for atomic H ( Fig. 16 ), atomic O ( Fig. 24 ), ethylene, 1-butene ( Fig. 36 ), and 1-hexene, further confirming that the surface d-band center is a reliable parameter in predicting the binding energies of both atomic and molecular adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces.

The DFT calculations indicate that both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111), predicting that the subsurface structure should be more effective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface structure. This is confirmed experimentally in Fig. 41 , which shows the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed on these two surfaces, with the results from Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film also being included for comparison [87] . The hydrogenation yield, based on peak areas of cyclohexane (84 amu), is much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111). Interestingly, the PtNiPt(111) surface is also more active toward the production of gas-phase benzene from the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene (78 amu). As discussed earlier in the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of ethylene in Section
5.1.1.1
, the surface with d-band center closer to the Fermi level should be more active for the dehydrogenation of ethylene [34] . Assuming the same trend applied for cyclohexene, it would mean that the NiPt(111) surface monolayer should have higher hydrogenation activity than the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer, which is not consistent with the observation in Fig. 41 . More in-depth DFT calculations of the activation barriers for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation pathways of cyclohexene will be needed to clarify this.

TPD spectra following the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed atomic hydrogen on Pt(111), Ni(111), PtNiPt(111) and NiPt(111) surfaces. The production of benzene, from the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene, is also included for comparison (from [87] ).
The general trend in the DFT calculations in Fig. 40 shows that the binding energies of cyclohexene on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) are weaker than that on PtNiPt(111). Even though the weaker binding energy of cyclohexene might favor the hydrogenation, the adsorption of cyclohexene needs to be strong enough for the hydrogenation to occur. We would therefore expect to observe a volcano relationship for the hydrogenation activity as the d-band center moves further away from the Fermi level, i.e. when the adsorption of cyclohexene is too weak for the hydrogenation to occur. This is verified experimentally in the results shown in Fig. 42 by Humbert et al.
[87] . The hydrogenation yield is the highest on PtNiPt(111), but starts to decrease on the PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) surfaces. Another point of comparison is the hydrogenation of cyclohexene on the monolayer PtW(110) surface, which has the d-band center even further away from the Fermi level than PtFePt(111) ( Fig. 33 ). The hydrogenation of cyclohexene does not occur on the PtW(110) [94] , which further confirms the volcano relationship in the hydrogenation activity with respect to the surface d-band center.

The self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene has also been used as a probe reaction on several Ni monolayers, NiPt(111), NiW(110), NiRu(0001) to correlate the chemical activities with respect to the surface d-band center. As discussed earlier for the adsorption of atomic hydrogen on these surfaces in Section
4.1.3
( Fig. 18 , Fig. 19 ), the d-band center of these monolayer surfaces are modified from Ni(111) due to a combination of strain and ligand effects. The distance between the d-band center and the Fermi level follows the trend of NiPt(111) < Ni(111)  NiRu(0001) < NiW(110). The results shown earlier in Fig. 38 (b) already reveal that the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene does not occur on Ni(111), due mainly to the strong bonding of cyclohexene. Based on the similar d-band center value between Ni(111) and monolayer NiRu(0001), one would expect that the self-hydrogenation doe not occur on the NiRu(0001) surface. This is confirmed in Fig. 43 (a), where the presence of monolayer Ni on Ru(0001) does not increase the self-hydrogenation pathway on Ru(0001). In comparison, based on the trend in the d-band center, the self-hydrogenation might occur on NiW(110) due to the weaker adsorption of cyclohexene. This is confirmed experimentally in Fig. 43 (b), where the presence of monolayer Ni on W(110) leads to the onset of the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene [80] . The presence of weakly π -bonded cyclohexene on NiW(110) is also confirmed using HREELS measurements [144] . The results in Fig. 43 further confirm the correlation of the self-hydrogenation activity with the value of the surface d-band center of MBS structures.Download: Download high-res image (344KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 43.

5.1.2.2. Benzene
The binding energy of benzene has been calculated on several Pt-3d-Pt(111) and 3d-Pt(111) surfaces [140] . Similar to the trends observed for linear and cyclic alkenes described earlier, benzene adsorb more weakly on the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures than on Pt(111) or the corresponding 3d-Pt(111) surface structures. Based on the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of linear and cyclic alkenes on the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures, it is natural to explore whether the hydrogenation of benzene also occurs on these surfaces. Murillo et al.
[141] have performed TPD studies of the self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation of benzene on PtNiPt(111). Unlike linear and cyclic alkenes, the hydrogenation of benzene does not occur under UHV conditions [141] . This was not unexpected, however, due to the nature of benzene being an aromatic molecule and therefore thermodynamically more stable as compared to the alkenes.
The adsorption and reaction of benzene have been studied on several other bimetallic surfaces. Domnick et al.
[145] investigated the adsorption of benzene on Ni/Cu(111) using XPS. At temperatures lower than 300 K, Ni grows layer-by-layer on top of Cu(111) and at temperatures between 300600 K Cu segregates to the top layer and Ni diffuses into the subsurface region. However, when benzene is adsorbed onto the 300 K NiCu(111) surface and the surface is subsequently annealed to 600 K, Cu does not segregate, leaving atomic carbon from the decomposed benzene bonded to Ni in the on-top sites. The change in the Cu segregation kinetics is attributed to a possible reduction of the surface energy of carbon-covered Ni-adlayer, or to the possibility of benzene kinetically hindering the Cu segregation through the Ni layer.
Koschel et al.
[124] have compared the binding energy of benzene on CuNi(111) and CuRu(0001) to that on the Ni(111) and Ru(0001) surfaces. On the CuNi(111) surface the HRXPS results show that benzene behaves similarly to that on the Cu(111) surface. However, on the CuRu(0001) surface, benzene is found to interact much more strongly than on Cu(111). DFT calculations of the two surfaces reveal a weak coupling of the Cu 3d states to the Ni substrate states, while the Cu states interact very strongly with the Ru substrate states, accounting for the strongly modified chemical properties of the CuRu(0001) monolayer surface [124] .
5.1.3. Unsaturated aldehydes
The hydrogenation of the C=C and/or C=O bonds in unsaturated aldehydes offers the possibility of improving both the hydrogenation activity and selectivity through the formation of MBSs. The selective hydrogenation of the C=O bond to produce unsaturated alcohols has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors [146] ,[147] . Comparing to monometallic surfaces, bimetallic surfaces have shown promise due to their better selectivity toward the hydrogenation of the C=O bond of some α ,β -unsaturated aldehydes. Koel et al. have studied the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (methyl substituted acrolein at the β carbon) on Sn/Pt(111) [148] . They found that the hydrogenation activity was enhanced on the bimetallic Sn/Pt(111) surfaces in comparison with Pt(111) by using a batch reactor at relative low pressures. Beccat et al. observed an enhancement on the selectivity of crotonaldehyde and methylcrotonaldehyde (CH3)2C=CHCH=O) toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohols on Pt80Fe20(111) bimetallic surfaces [149] . The enhancement in the selectivity to C=O hydrogenation was attributed to alloy formation in the case of crotonaldehyde.
Recently Murillo et al. have performed combined DFT and experimental studies of the hydrogenation of acrolein, CH2=CHCH=O, on the subsurface PtNiPt(111) and surface NiPt(111) structures [150] .
Fig. 44 shows the DFT results of acrolein binding energies of different adsorption configurations with co-adsorbed H on PtNiPt(111), NiPt(111), and Pt(111) surfaces. The bonding configurations include di- σ CC, di- σ CO and η 4
(C, C, C, O)
[150] . Similar to the trends observed for alkenes, the binding energies of acrolein are in the order of PtNiPt(111) < Pt(111) < NiPt(111). In addition, on all three surfaces the di- σ bonding through the CC bond of acrolein is stronger than through the CO bond. In fact, on the H/Pt(111) and H/NiPt(111) surfaces, the binding through the di- σ CO configuration is so weak that it converts to the flat η 4 (C, C, C, O) configuration during the course of DFT calculations. Based on the previous discussion for the hydrogenation of alkenes, the presence of weakly bonded acrolein and atomic hydrogen on PtNiPt(111) should enhance the hydrogenation activity of acrolein as compared to either NiPt(111) or Pt(111). Furthermore, as pointed by Delbecq and Sautet in their DFT study of the hydrogenation of acrolein on Pt(111) [151] , the hydrogenation selectivity is most likely related to whether acrolein is bonded to the surface via the C=C or C=O bond, which favors the hydrogenation of C=C and C=O, respectively. Because the binding energies of the di- σ CC and CO configurations are comparable on the H/PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure, one would expect that the hydrogenation of both the C=C and C=O bonds of acrolein should occur on this surface. In contrast, the adsorption of acrolein on H/Pt(111) and H/NiPt(111) surfaces does not occur through the di- σ CO configuration, hence making it difficult to hydrogenate the C=O bond.Download: Download high-res image (154KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 44. DFT calculations of binding energies of acrolein in several bonding configurations. The calculations were performed on surfaces with preadsorbed atomic hydrogen (from [150] ).These DFT predictions are confirmed experimentally using TPD and HREELS measurements.Fig. 45 shows the TPD results of the hydrogenation products, 2-propenol (CH2=CHCH2OH) from the hydrogenation of the C=O bond and propanal (CH3CH2CH=O) from the hydrogenation of the C=C bond [143] . In agreement with the DFT predictions, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is active toward the hydrogenation of both the C=O and C=C bonds, while the C=O hydrogenation does not occur on either Pt(111) or NiPt(111). Also as predicted, the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure is significantly more active in the overall hydrogenation activity based on the comparison of the TPD peak areas in Fig. 45 [143] . Overall, the combined DFT and experimental results in Fig. 44 , Fig. 45 suggest that the d-band center can be used to potentially predict bimetallic surfaces with not only enhanced hydrogenation activity, but also improved selectivity for hydrocarbons containing multiple unsaturated functional groups.Download: Download high-res image (217KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 45.

5.2. Adsorption and reforming reaction of oxygenates
5.2.1. Methanol
In Section
5.1
we used the examples of hydrogenation, a hydrogen-consuming reaction, to illustrate the relationship between the d-band center, binding energy, and chemical activities. In the current section we will use the reforming of oxygenates, a hydrogen-production reaction, to further explore the correlation of the electronic and chemical properties of MBS structures. The reactions of methanol on various catalytic surfaces are important for processes such as methanol synthesis from syngas, production of formaldehyde from methanol, operation of direct methanol fuel cells, and methanol reforming to produce hydrogen. In addition to its possible utilization as a reactant, methanol may also serve as a model compound for reforming reactions of larger oxygenates such as glycerol, sorbitol and glucose to probe the reactivity of various bimetallic surfaces [152] .
Skoplyak et al. performed DFT calculations of the binding energies of methanol and methoxy on the subsurface and surface Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) bimetallic systems [153] . As shown in Fig. 46 , the binding energies of methanol and methoxy follow the same trends as the atomic and molecular adsorbates discussed earlier, with the binding energy becoming weaker as the d-band center moves away from the Fermi level. Similar type of linear correlations with the surface d-band center have also been reported for the binding energies of methoxy species on the monometallic surfaces of group VIII metals [154] .

Based on the DFT results, the surface monolayer 3d-Pt(111) structures should be more active toward the decomposition of methanol than Pt(111) and subsurface monolayer Pt-3d-Pt(111). Such trend is confirmed experimentally by Skoplyak et al. using TPD and HREELS to follow the reforming reaction of methanol on the various Ni /Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) surfaces [153] .
Fig. 47 shows the TPD results of H2 and CO from the reforming of methanol on PtNiPt(111), NiPt(111), Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film. Based on the TPD peak areas of the H2 and CO, the surface monolayer NiPt(111) structure has the highest reforming activity, with the reforming yield being 0.108 and 0.018 methanol per surface metal atoms on the NiPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) surfaces, respectively [153] .
Download: Download high-res image (277KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 47. TPD results of H2 and CO from the decomposition of methanol on different surfaces (from [153] ).
The corresponding HREELS measurements further confirm the difference in the reforming activity on the subsurface PtNiPt(111) and surface NiPt(111) structures [153] . As compared in the HREELS results in Fig. 48 , upon heating to 300 K most of the adsorbed methanol desorb reversibly from PtNiPt(111), leaving a surface with little hydrocarbon fragments except adsorbed CO (2060 cm1) that is from the residual UHV system. In contrast, upon heating to 300 K methanol undergoes significant decomposition on the NiPt(111) surface, producing a formaldehyde-like surface intermediate that further decomposes at higher temperatures. Overall, the DFT and experimental results in Fig. 46 , Fig. 47 , Fig. 48 indicate that, for the Ni /Pt bimetallic system, the surface NiPt(111) structure is preferred for the reforming of methanol due to its stronger bonding to methanol and to the reforming intermediates and products. The combined theory and experiments also suggest the possibility of using the surface d-band center as a possible parameter to identify active bimetallic surfaces for the reforming reactions.

Similar to the volcano type of relationship mentioned for the hydrogenation activity as a function of d-band center, one should also expect similar type of volcano behavior for the reforming yield. This is because as the d-band center moves closer to the Fermi level, the surface can bond to methanol and/or the CO product too strongly, leading to the complete decomposition to produce atomic carbon and oxygen. This behavior is confirmed in the comparison of the reforming yield of methanol on the monolayer surfaces of NiPt(111) and CoPt(111) [153] . The CoPt(111) surface is much more active than NiPt(111) for the decomposition of methanol, with the activity being 0.369 and 0.108 methanol per surface metal atoms on the two surfaces, respectively. The higher activity of CoPt(111) than NiPt(111) is consistent with the DFT calculations of the binding energies on the two surfaces. However, among the methanol molecules that undergo decomposition, the selectivity to reforming is much lower on CoPt(111) (13%) than on NiPt(111) (100%) [153] , confirming that the CoPt(111) surface is too active for the selective reforming of methanol to produce H2 and CO. More systematic DFT and surface science studies are needed to establish the volcano relationship for the reforming yield as a function of surface d-band center of bimetallic surfaces.
5.2.2. Ethanol and ethylene glycol
The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces. Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/ γ - Al2O3 at similar conditions [155] . Skoplyak et al.
[156] have compared the reforming activity and selectivity of ethanol and ethylene glycol on Pt(111) and Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.
Fig. 49 shows the production of H2 and CO from the reforming of ethanol on PtNiPt(111), NiPt(111), Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film. Based on the TPD peak areas of the H2 and CO, the surface monolayer NiPt(111) structure has the highest reforming activity. Similar trend is also observed for the reforming of ethylene glycol on the corresponding surfaces [156] .

Fig. 50 shows the correlation of experimentally measured reforming activity with the surface d-center of the Ni /Pt(111) surfaces [156] . The reforming activities of both ethanol and ethylene glycol follow a linear relationship with the d-band center, although with different slopes. These results again suggest the possibility of identification promising MBS structures based on the d-band center. More systematic studies on other bimetallic surfaces are needed to identify the general trend in reforming activity, and to determine the volcano relationship in the reforming selectivity of these two molecules.

Overall, the results discussed in Section
5.2
show that the trends in the reactivity of various oxygenates, such as methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol, are similar on Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. This suggests that these smaller probe molecules might be useful to help understand the chemistry of larger oxygenates, such as glycerol and glucose, which are important biomass-derived reactants for either H2 or biofuels production.
6. Conclusions, challenges and research opportunities
6.1. Conclusions
The examples in the current review demonstrate that the formation of MBS structures modifies the electronic properties of the parent metals. One useful parameter to represent the electronic properties is the position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level. In most cases the surface d-band center of MBS is significantly different from that of either parent metal. For example, in the case of 3d/Pt MBS systems, the formation of the Pt-3d-Pt subsurface MBS structures shifts the d-band center further away from the Fermi level as compared to either parent metal, while the formation of the 3d-Pt surface MBS structure shifts the d-band center closer to the Fermi level.
The shifts in the surface d-band center affect the binding energy of both atomic and molecular adsorbates on MBS. For example, in the case of 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, the binding energy on the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structure is generally weaker than that on either parent metal, while the binding energy on the surface 3d-Pt(111) structure is stronger than that on either parent metal. In addition, for each adsorbate, there is a nearly linear correlation between the binding energies and the values of the surface d-band center, although for molecular adsorbates different slopes are observed for MBS structures terminated by 3d, 4d and 5d metals.
The modification on the d-band center, and correspondingly on the binding energies of adsorbates, provides the possibility to control the activity of MBS structures. The general correlation of the modification of the d-band center and the reactivity of bimetallic surfaces are qualitatively illustrated in Fig. 51 . For example, for the hydrogenation of alkenes, the preferred surfaces are those that bond weakly to atomic hydrogen and alkenes, which are MBS structures with the surface d-band center further away from the Fermi level. In contrast, the reforming reaction requires MBS structures with stronger adsorption energies, i.e. with the d-band center closer to the Fermi level as compared to the parent metals. The different trends in the two types of reactions can be rationalized based on the adsorption energies of the reactants and products. In the hydrogenation reaction, it is preferred to keep the carboncarbon and carbonhydrogen bonds intact, with the desirable bimetallic surfaces being more weakly bonded to reactants than the parent metals. On the other hand, the reforming reaction requires the cleavage of carboncarbon, carbonhydrogen, and oxygenhydrogen bonds to produce H2 and CO. Therefore, the desirable bimetallic surfaces should bond more strongly to the oxygenate reactants, as well as to the reaction products of H and CO, than the parent metals. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene and the reforming selectivity of methanol, a volcano-type relationship often exists between the activity/selectivity and the binding energies of the adsorbates and/or products.

Qualitative summary of the modification of the d-band center by the formation of subsurface Pt-3d-Pt and surface 3d-Pt structures. The effect on the binding energies (BDE) of adsorbates and several types of reactions are also qualitatively illustrated.
Similar approaches can be used for the rational design of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts for other types of reactions. After identifying whether the particular reaction requires weakly or strongly bonded adsorbates, we should be able to quickly identify potential bimetallic combinations and surface structures (surface vs. subsurface monolayer) that are potentially better than the parent metals, based on the extensive database of values of HBE, OBE, and the direction and magnitude of d-band center shift of the MBS structures with respect to those of the parent metals. After the identification of the directions of d-band center shifts, more systematic experimental studies should follow to identify the possible volcano relationship between activities and the magnitude of the d-band center shift.
6.2. Challenges and research opportunities
We will conclude this review by pointing out several challenges and research opportunities to further understand and utilize the novel properties of MBS structures:(1) Most of the current DFT correlations are based on the changes in the surface d-band center, which is clearly an oversimplification of the electronic properties. Although this parameter seems to provide a general correlation of binding energies of many adsorbates on various MBS structures, a molecular level understanding of the reaction mechanism would clearly require more detailed description of the electronic properties, such as the position and DOS of individual d-orbitals.
(2) DFT calculations of activation barriers are required to predict the activity and selectivity of reactions on various MBS structures. However, such calculations are computationally expensive, especially for bimetallic surfaces that often require a 3x3 unit cell of four-layer slab, with the top two layers relaxed and with spin polarization. A compromise will be to develop a more quantitative correlation between the binding energies of the adsorbates and products, which are much easier to calculate, with the activation barriers for different types of surface reactions.
(3) At present most of the surface and subsurface monolayer structures are produced on the single crystal substrates. In order to bridge the materials gap, systematic studies of the formation and chemical properties of equivalent MBS structures on polycrystalline substrates and in bimetallic nanoparticles are needed.
(4) The stability of the surface and subsurface MBS structures needs to be investigated under reaction conditions to bridge the pressure gap. The UHV studies have clearly demonstrated that the surface-termination of the MBS structures depends on the environment, such as in vacuum, and in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen. However, detailed studies are needed to determine whether and how the segregation and diffusion occur under non-UHV conditions, such as in the environment and hydrogenation or reforming reactions.
