[1] "An integrated catalytic approach for the production of hydrogen by glycerol reforming coupled with water-gas shift"
[2] "Researchers are currently developing ways to utilize renewable resources as feedstocks for energy generation and chemical production, with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions as well as the dependency on fossil fuels."
[3] "Hydrogen is also gaining widespread applications with the advent of fuel cell technologies."
[4] "Additionally, many catalytic bio-fuels production processes, including several developed by our group, require a feed stream of renewable hydrogen."
[5] "This flexibility allows the implementation of renewable feeds in applications that require relatively pure H2 as well as applications requiring various grades of synthesis gas (H2:CO = 2), such as FischerTropsch synthesis and methanol synthesis."
[6] "Lastly we demonstrate that concentrated glycerol solutions (3080 wt.%) can be processed at low temperatures (e.g., at 573 K) in a two bed-single reactor system (PtRe/C and Pt/CeZrOx) to obtain 100% conversion of the carbon in glycerol to gas phase products, with a hydrogen yield equal to 80%."

1.The selective oxygenate reforming process, as demonstrated in the study, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a renewable feedstock. This process reduces dependency on fossil fuels and CO2 emissions. The key advantages include the ability to produce hydrogen, which is gaining popularity in fuel cell technologies, and synthesis gas with variable H2:CO ratios suitable for different chemical synthesis applications, such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and methanol synthesis. The process is energy-efficient, achieving 100% conversion of glycerol to gas phase products at low temperatures, with a hydrogen yield of 80% of the theoretical maximum.
