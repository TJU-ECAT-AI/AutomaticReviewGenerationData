[1] "An integrated catalytic approach for the production of hydrogen by glycerol reforming coupled with water-gas shift"
[2] "Researchers are currently developing ways to utilize renewable resources as feedstocks for energy generation and chemical production, with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions as well as the dependency on fossil fuels."
[3] "Hydrogen is also gaining widespread applications with the advent of fuel cell technologies."
[4] "Additionally, many catalytic bio-fuels production processes, including several developed by our group, require a feed stream of renewable hydrogen."
[5] "This flexibility allows the implementation of renewable feeds in applications that require relatively pure H2 as well as applications requiring various grades of synthesis gas (H2:CO = 2), such as FischerTropsch synthesis and methanol synthesis."
[6] "Lastly we demonstrate that concentrated glycerol solutions (3080 wt.%) can be processed at low temperatures (e.g., at 573 K) in a two bed-single reactor system (PtRe/C and Pt/CeZrOx) to obtain 100% conversion of the carbon in glycerol to gas phase products, with a hydrogen yield equal to 80%."
