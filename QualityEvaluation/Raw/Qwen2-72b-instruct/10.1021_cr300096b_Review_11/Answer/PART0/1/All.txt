This process offers several key advantages over traditional methods: it can produce hydrogen with lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization; it operates at lower temperatures, which can reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency; and it can produce hydrogen with low CO concentrations, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. The use of aqueous phase reforming, which operates in the liquid phase, eliminates the need to vaporize water and reactants, and allows the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed, making it a practical and efficient process for hydrogen production. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing renewable biomass-derived feedstocks, which can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization. Its key advantages include the production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells, which is an endothermic process requiring an external heat source, operating at temperatures of 500-900 C. Typical catalysts used in steam reforming include Ni, Rh, Ru, and Pt. The high operating temperature favors CO production, and a second water-gas shift reactor operating at lower temperature is needed to reduce the CO concentration in the exit stream. Methanol steam reforming is carried out differently compared to other oxygenates, as the lack of a CC bond allows operation with good reforming selectivity at much lower temperatures, approximately 300-500 C, utilizing Cu or Pd-based catalysts with ZnO or CeO2 promoters. Autothermal reforming combines the decomposition of oxygenates to produce H2 with the exothermic partial oxidation of some of the feed to drive the endothermic reforming. It has been demonstrated to work with both volatile and non-volatile feeds, utilizing short contact time reactors with Pt, Rh, RhCe, and RhLa catalysts at temperatures between 700-1100 C. Aqueous phase reforming operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed. The process operates at 200-250 C, much lower than either steam reforming or autothermal reforming, producing H2 with low CO concentrations in a single reactor. Typical pressures vary between 15-50 bar, and H2 and CO2 can be separated from the exit stream using current pressure swing adsorption or Pd membrane technologies. Literature studies show that Pt and Ni catalysts exhibit high reforming activity, while reforming selectivity is highest on Pt and Pd, with decreased selectivity on Ni due to methane production.

This process offers several key advantages over traditional methods: it can produce hydrogen with lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization; it operates at lower temperatures, which can reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency; and it can produce hydrogen with low CO concentrations, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. The use of aqueous phase reforming, which operates in the liquid phase, eliminates the need to vaporize water and reactants, and allows the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed, making it a practical and efficient process for hydrogen production. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing renewable biomass-derived feedstocks, which can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization. Its key advantages include the production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells, which is an endothermic process requiring an external heat source, operating at temperatures of 500-900 C. Typical catalysts used in steam reforming include Ni, Rh, Ru, and Pt. The high operating temperature favors CO production, and a second water-gas shift reactor operating at lower temperature is needed to reduce the CO concentration in the exit stream. Methanol steam reforming is carried out differently compared to other oxygenates, as the lack of a CC bond allows operation with good reforming selectivity at much lower temperatures, approximately 300-500 C, utilizing Cu or Pd-based catalysts with ZnO or CeO2 promoters. Autothermal reforming combines the decomposition of oxygenates to produce H2 with the exothermic partial oxidation of some of the feed to drive the endothermic reforming. It has been demonstrated to work with both volatile and non-volatile feeds, utilizing short contact time reactors with Pt, Rh, RhCe, and RhLa catalysts at temperatures between 700-1100 C. Aqueous phase reforming operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed. The process operates at 200-250 C, much lower than either steam reforming or autothermal reforming, producing H2 with low CO concentrations in a single reactor. Typical pressures vary between 15-50 bar, and H2 and CO2 can be separated from the exit stream using current pressure swing adsorption or Pd membrane technologies.

This process offers several key advantages over traditional methods: it can produce hydrogen with lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization; it operates at lower temperatures, which can reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency; and it can produce hydrogen with low CO concentrations, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. The use of aqueous phase reforming, which operates in the liquid phase, eliminates the need to vaporize water and reactants, and allows the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed, making it a practical and efficient process for hydrogen production. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing renewable biomass-derived feedstocks, which can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization. Its key advantages include the production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells, which is an endothermic process requiring an external heat source, operating at temperatures of 500-900 C. Typical catalysts used in steam reforming include Ni, Rh, Ru, and Pt. The high operating temperature favors CO production, and a second water-gas shift reactor operating at lower temperature is needed to reduce the CO concentration in the exit stream. Methanol steam reforming is carried out differently compared to other oxygenates, as the lack of a CC bond allows operation with good reforming selectivity at much lower temperatures, approximately 300-500 C, utilizing Cu or Pd-based catalysts with ZnO or CeO2 promoters. Autothermal reforming combines the decomposition of oxygenates to produce H2 with the exothermic partial oxidation of some of the feed to drive the endothermic reforming. It has been demonstrated to work with both volatile and non-volatile feeds, utilizing short contact time reactors with Pt, Rh, RhCe, and RhLa catalysts at temperatures between 700-1100 C. Aqueous phase reforming operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed. The process operates at 200-250 C, much lower than either steam reforming or autothermal reforming, producing H2 with low CO concentrations in a single reactor. Typical pressures vary between 15-50 bar, and H2 and CO2 can be separated from the exit stream using current pressure swing adsorption or Pd membrane technologies.

However, it can be inferred that the use of glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a feedstock for hydrogen production contributes to sustainable energy by utilizing a renewable resource and reducing waste. The catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) process, which is a key part of the selective oxygenate reforming, has advantages over traditional steam reforming methods, including reduced energy requirements, a gas product rich in hydrogen and poor in carbon monoxide, and minimized decomposition reactions at high temperatures. The use of H2 could help achieve the target established by the European Union for the use of biofuels in the European Union Green Paper, which envisioned that 20% of the petrol and diesel used for road transport will be replaced with biofuels by 2020. Additionally, the literature highlights that the use of H2 could help achieve the target established by the European Union for the use of biofuels in the European Union Green Paper. Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised.", "Chinese": "文献中描述的选择性氧酸重整过程虽然没有直接涉及可持续能源和化学品生产,也没有将其优势与传统方法在产品产量、环境影响和实际应用方面进行比较,但可以推断,使用甘油(生物柴油生产的一种副产品)作为氢气生产的原料,通过利用可再生资源和减少废物,对可持续能源做出了贡献。催化水相重整(APR)过程是选择性氧酸重整的关键部分,与传统的蒸汽重整方法相比,它具有降低能源需求、气体产品富含氢气和贫含一氧化碳、高温下分解反应最小化等优点。氢的使用可以帮助实现欧盟绿色文件为欧盟生物燃料使用设定的目标,该目标设想到2020年,用于公路运输的汽油和柴油将有20%被生物燃料取代。此外,文献强调,氢的使用可以帮助实现欧盟绿色文件为欧盟生物燃料使用设定的目标。在催化重整过程中,杜梅西克等人开发的催化水相重整(APR)与催化蒸汽重整相比具有重要优势。这些优势包括:由于无需汽化进料,因此能耗降低;产生的气体富含H2,CO含量低(在APR过程中使用的温度和压力下,水煤气变换反应(WGS)受到青睐);在高温下发生的分解反应被最小化。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcatb.2011.05.009"},
