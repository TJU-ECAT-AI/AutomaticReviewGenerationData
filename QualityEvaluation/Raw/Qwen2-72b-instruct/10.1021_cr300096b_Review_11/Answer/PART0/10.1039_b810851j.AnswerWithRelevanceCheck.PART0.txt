          [1] "A novel approach to produce hydrogen from bio-oil was obtained with high carbon conversion (>90%) and hydrogen yield (>90%) at T < 500 C by using the electrochemical catalytic reforming of oxygenated-organic compounds over 18%NiO/Al2O3 reforming catalyst; thermal electrons play important promoting roles in the decomposition and reforming of the oxygenated-organic compounds in the bio-oil."
          [2] "Hydrogen is an important raw material for the chemical industry and it is a potential clean fuel which could have an important role in reducing environmental emissions for the future."
          [3] "By contrast, production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, an environmentally friendly and rich feedstock, would open a new prospect for the utilization of the renewable biomass sources."
          [4] "The route of the steam reforming of bio-oil involves fast pyrolysis of biomass to generate bio-oil and reforming of it to produce a gaseous rich-hydrogen mixture."
          [5] "Production of hydrogen from bio-oil reforming is probably one of the most promising options because it can achieve high hydrogen yield and high content of hydrogen."
          [6] "The carbon conversion significantly increased from 14.7 to 72.7% at 400 C with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A, and reached 96.5% at 500 C and 3.8 A."
          [7] "The yield of hydrogen also remarkably increased from 35.6 to 95.8% with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A at 500 C."
          [8] "The thermal electrons in ECR significantly promoted the dissociation and the reforming reactions of the oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oil."
          [9] "The present approach would be a promising option for production of hydrogen from bio-oil with higher energy efficiency and lower cost."

          The process of selective oxygenate reforming, specifically the electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of oxygenated-organic compounds in bio-oil, offers a novel and efficient method for hydrogen production. This method achieves high carbon conversion and hydrogen yield at relatively low temperatures, thanks to the promoting role of thermal electrons in the decomposition and reforming of oxygenated-organic compounds. Hydrogen is a crucial raw material for the chemical industry and a potential clean fuel that can significantly reduce environmental emissions. Traditional hydrogen production from fossil fuels leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions and local pollution. In contrast, hydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass, such as bio-oil, is environmentally friendly and utilizes a renewable resource. The ECR process, using a conventional Ni-based reforming catalyst, is a low-temperature reforming approach that can achieve high hydrogen yields and content. This method is one of the most promising options for hydrogen production from bio-oil due to its high efficiency and lower cost compared to traditional methods.

          选择性氧酸重整过程,特别是生物油中氧有机化合物的电化学催化重整(ECR),为氢气生产提供了一种新颖有效的途径。该方法在相对较低的温度下实现了高碳转化率和高氢气产量,这得益于热电子在氧有机化合物分解和重整中的促进作用。氢气是化工行业的重要原料,也是潜在的清洁能源,可以显著减少未来的环境排放。从化石燃料生产氢气会导致二氧化碳排放量增加和局部污染。相比之下,从木质纤维素生物质(如生物油)生产氢气是环保的,并利用了可再生资源。ECR过程,使用传统的基于Ni的重整催化剂,是一种低温重整方法,可以实现高氢气产量和含量。由于其高效率和与传统方法相比的较低成本,该方法是生物油氢气生产中最有前景的选项之一。
