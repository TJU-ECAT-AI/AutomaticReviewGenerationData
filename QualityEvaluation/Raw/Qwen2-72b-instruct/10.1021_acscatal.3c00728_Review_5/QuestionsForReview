How does the systematic study of B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), including the multi-dimensional design of active sites and analysis of surface and gas-phase reaction mechanisms, enhance our understanding of catalytic processes, and what are its implications for developing more efficient ODHP catalysts in the future?
