The systematic study of B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), including the multi-dimensional design of active sites and analysis of surface and gas-phase reaction mechanisms, has deepened our understanding of catalytic processes. This understanding provides effective guidance for the development of more efficient ODHP catalysts in the future.
