The comprehensive analysis of B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reveals a multi-dimensional approach to enhancing catalytic performance. Central to this analysis is the design of active sites, which involves the strategic incorporation of boron to create unique electronic and geometric environments that favor the desired reaction pathways. The reaction mechanisms of ODHP on B-based catalysts have been elucidated through a combination of experimental and computational studies, highlighting the role of boron in stabilizing key intermediates and lowering activation barriers. This understanding not only underscores the importance of boron in catalysis but also opens avenues for the rational design of more efficient catalysts. Future catalyst development is expected to build upon these insights, focusing on the optimization of B-based materials for improved selectivity, stability, and activity, potentially leading to significant advancements in the field of hydrocarbon conversion processes.
