1.The literature does not provide specific details on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that metal molybdates are attractive catalysts for propane oxydehydrogenation due to their high activity at relatively low temperatures. The study focuses on single and binary molybdates, as well as some ternary molybdates, for the conversion of propane to propylene. The catalytic activity and useful product yields are influenced by the choice of metal in the molybdate and the surface area of the catalyst. The optimum activity for NiMoO4/SiO2 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2 catalysts is achieved at specific molybdenum contents. The addition of redox elements such as V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of NiCo molybdates, with Cr addition showing the most promise for retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions. The NiCo molybdate system is suggested as an alternative to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins and holds promise for the direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor.

1.文献没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)、各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、提出的反应机制或位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用的具体细节。但是,它确实提到金属钼酸盐是丙烷氧脱氢的有吸引力的催化剂,因为它们在相对较低的温度下具有高活性。研究集中在单一和二元钼酸盐,以及一些三元钼酸盐,用于将丙烷转化为丙烯。催化活性和有用产品的产量受到钼酸盐中金属的选择和催化剂表面积的影响。NiMoO4/SiO2和Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2催化剂的最佳活性在特定的钼含量下实现。添加氧化还原元素如V、Fe、Ce和Cr增强了NiCo钼酸盐的活性,其中Cr添加显示出在增强转化率下保持高选择性的最大希望。NiCo钼酸盐系统被建议作为V基催化剂的替代品,用于轻质石蜡的活化,并有望在单个反应器中直接将丙烷转化为丙烯酸或丙烯腈。
