1.The literature does not provide specific details on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that metal molybdates are attractive catalysts for propane oxydehydrogenation due to their high activity at relatively low temperatures. The study focuses on single and binary molybdates, as well as some ternary molybdates, for the catalytic oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalytic activity and useful product yields are greatly influenced by the choice of the A metal in the molybdate and the surface area of the catalyst. The optimum activity of NiMoO4/SiO2 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2 catalysts is highlighted, with the highest propane conversion and propylene yields obtained at 560C and atmospheric pressure. The addition of redox elements such as V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of NiCo molybdates, with Cr addition showing the most promise for retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions. The NiCo molybdate system is suggested as an alternative to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins and holds promise for the direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor.

1.文献没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)的具体细节，各种催化剂之间的相互作用，实现高选择性和转化率的挑战，提出的反应机制，或位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用。但是，它确实提到金属钼酸盐是丙烷氧脱氢的有吸引力的催化剂，因为它们在相对较低的温度下具有高活性。研究集中于单金属和双金属钼酸盐，以及一些三金属钼酸盐，用于催化丙烷到丙烯的氧脱氢。催化活性和有用产品产量在很大程度上受到钼酸盐中A金属的选择和催化剂表面积的影响。NiMoO4/SiO2和Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2催化剂的最优活性被突出，560C和大气压下获得最高的丙烷转化率和丙烯产量。添加氧化还原元素如V，Fe，Ce和Cr增强了NiCo钼酸盐的活性，Cr的添加显示出保留高选择性在增强转化率方面的最大希望。NiCo钼酸盐系统被建议作为V基催化剂的替代品，用于轻质石蜡的活化，并且在单个反应器中直接将丙烷转化为丙烯酸或丙烯腈方面具有前景。
