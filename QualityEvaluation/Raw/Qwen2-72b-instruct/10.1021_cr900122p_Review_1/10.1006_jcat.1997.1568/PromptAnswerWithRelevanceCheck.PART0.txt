Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?

1.The literature does not provide specific details on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, or the proposed reaction mechanisms. However, it does mention that metal molybdates, particularly NiMoO4 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4, show promise for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The molybdenum content significantly influences catalytic activity and product yields. Binary NiCo molybdates offer a stable catalytic system for further optimization. The addition of redox elements like V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances activity, with Cr showing potential for retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions. The NiCo molybdate system is an alternative to V-based catalysts for light paraffin activation and holds promise for direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor.

1.文献没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)、各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战或提出的反应机制的具体细节。但是,它确实提到金属钼酸盐,特别是NiMoO4和Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4,在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯方面显示出前景。钼含量对催化活性和产品产量有重大影响。二元NiCo钼酸盐提供了一个稳定的催化系统,可以进一步优化。添加像V、Fe、Ce和Cr这样的氧化还原元素可以增强活性,其中Cr显示出在增强转化率时保持高选择性的潜力。NiCo钼酸盐系统是V基催化剂的替代品,用于轻质石蜡的激活,并为在单个反应器中直接将丙烷转化为丙烯酸或丙烯腈提供了前景。

1.The literature does not provide specific details on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that metal molybdates are attractive catalysts for propane oxydehydrogenation due to their high activity at relatively low temperatures. The study focuses on single and binary molybdates, as well as some ternary molybdates, for the conversion of propane to propylene. The catalytic activity and useful product yields are influenced by the choice of metal in the molybdate and the surface area of the catalyst. The optimum activity for NiMoO4/SiO2 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2 catalysts is achieved at specific molybdenum contents. The addition of redox elements such as V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of NiCo molybdates, with Cr addition showing the most promise for retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions. The NiCo molybdate system is suggested as an alternative to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins and holds promise for the direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor.
