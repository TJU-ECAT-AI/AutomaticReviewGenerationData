The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a critical process for the conversion of alkanes to alkenes, with significant implications for the chemical industry. This process is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, which play a pivotal role in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates. Vanadium oxide catalysts, in particular, exhibit enhanced activity with optimal VOx domain size, balancing accessibility and activity [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, correlating with a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is attributed to adsorbed oxygen species, and the reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with higher surface reduction boosting selectivity to propylene [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. The support significantly impacts vanadium oxide reactivity, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 are crucial for high ethylene selectivity in ethane ODH [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Alkali additives influence MoOx domain structure and catalytic properties, affecting CH bond activation and selectivity to propylene [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]].

ODH of alkanes faces the challenge of faster alkene oxidation than alkane conversion, necessitating low conversions for high selectivity [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Bulk metal oxides like V2O5 yield low results, whereas supported systems offer higher activity and selectivity, with MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO showing high selectivities [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. CH bond activation is the rate-determining step, leading to proposed Malkyl intermediates that decompose to 1-alkenes via β-H abstraction [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Site isolation is crucial for selectivity between dehydrogenation and oxygenated product formation [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]].

In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts follow a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, involving irreversible CH bond activation by lattice oxygens, leading to propene desorption [\[10.1021/jp002100x\]]. Reduced Mo centers reoxidize via O2 chemisorption, optimizing the process. Site isolation is crucial for process optimization, addressing selectivity and conversion challenges [\[10.1021/jp002100x\]].

NiMoO4 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4 metal molybdates are effective for propane oxydehydrogenation to propylene, with molybdenum content influencing catalytic activity [\[10.1006/jcat.1997.1568\]].
