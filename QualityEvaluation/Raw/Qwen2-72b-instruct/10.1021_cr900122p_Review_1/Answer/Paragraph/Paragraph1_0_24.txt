The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a critical process for the conversion of alkanes to alkenes, with significant implications for the petrochemical industry \[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]. This process is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, with the latter offering higher activity and selectivity \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. Among supported systems, MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO have shown high selectivities \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. The challenge in ODH lies in achieving high selectivity and conversion, as alkene oxidation often proceeds faster than alkane conversion, necessitating low conversions for high selectivity \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. The rate-determining step in ODH is the activation of the C-H bond, leading to the formation of M-alkyl intermediates that decompose to 1-alkenes through β-H abstraction \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by stabilizing active species intermediates \[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\].
