The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a critical process for the conversion of alkanes to alkenes, with significant implications for the chemical industry. This process is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, which play a pivotal role in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. Among these catalysts, vanadium oxide-based systems, such as V2O5, are widely studied due to their high activity and selectivity in propane ODH [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. The performance of vanadium oxide catalysts is optimized with intermediate-sized VOx domains, balancing activity and accessibility [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, correlating with a monolayer structure [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. COx formation in ethane ODH is attributed to adsorbed oxygen species [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species more extensively reduced, leading to higher selectivity to propylene with greater surface reduction [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. The support significantly impacts vanadium oxide reactivity, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 are vital for high ethylene selectivity in ethane ODH [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Ethane CH bond activation forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Alkali additives modify MoOx domains' structure, influencing electronic and catalytic properties [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]].

ODH of alkanes faces the challenge of faster alkene oxidation than alkane conversion, necessitating low conversions for high selectivity [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Bulk metal oxides like V2O5 offer low yields, whereas supported systems provide higher activity and selectivity [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Among various systems, MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO show high selectivities [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. CH bond activation is the rate-determining step, leading to proposed Malkyl intermediates that decompose to 1-alkenes via Î²-H abstraction [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is also proposed [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Site isolation is crucial for selectivity between dehydrogenation and oxygenated product formation [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]].

ODH of alkanes, notably ethane to ethene and propane to propylene, is promising for alkene production [\[10.1021/cr9800208\]]. Mo16V4Nb2 catalysts excel over other mixed-metal oxides in activity and selectivity for ethane conversion [\[10.1021/cr9800208\]]. Propane's ODH to propylene, facilitated by niobium oxide, shows high selectivity but low conversion, improved by adding V, Cr, and Mo without affecting selectivity [\[10.1021/cr9800208\]]. In VNbO catalysts, niobium enhances selectivity by stabilizing vanadium sites against facile reduction, a common cause of low selectivity [\[10.1021/cr9800208\]].

The mechanism involves methyl radical formation through hydrogen abstraction by [Li'O-] centers, followed by ethane coupling and further oxidation to ethylene [\[10.1021/ja00304a008\]]. Increasing temperature up to a certain point enhances C2 product selectivity and methane conversion [\[10.1021/ja00304a008\]]. Lower surface areas favor high C2 selectivities by limiting CO and CO2 formation [\[10.1021/ja00304a008\]].

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes employs catalysts like bulk metal oxides and supported systems, facing challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]].
