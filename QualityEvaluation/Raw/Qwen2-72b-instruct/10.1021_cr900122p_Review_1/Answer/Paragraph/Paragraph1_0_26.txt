This process is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, with the latter offering higher activity and selectivity \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. Among these, vanadium oxide catalysts, particularly those with intermediate-sized VOx domains, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity to olefins \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. The challenge in achieving high selectivity and conversion is exacerbated by the faster oxidation of alkenes compared to alkanes, necessitating low conversions for high selectivity \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. The reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, play a pivotal role in the process efficiency \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\].

Active sites, often molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms, significantly impact selectivity and conversion rates \[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\].
