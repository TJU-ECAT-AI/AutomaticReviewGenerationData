Selectivity in ethylene correlates with copper(II) sites, while for propane, surface Cu 2+ ions drive activity, and substitutional Cu 2+ ions enhance propene selectivity \[10.1007/bf02070119\]. Site isolation optimizes selectivity by managing active site distribution \[10.1007/bf02070119\].

                    ODH of alkanes, employing metal oxides for C-H bond activation, faces challenges in achieving high conversion and selectivity \[10.1002/anie.199509701\]. Methane's best catalysts reach 20% conversion with 80% ethane/ethylene selectivity, while ethane production is mainly via CH3 radical coupling \[10.1002/anie.199509701\]. C2H4 and C2H6 yields are limited by secondary reactions \[10.1002/anie.199509701\]. Ethane OXD over Li/MgO with chlorides achieved 77% C2H4 selectivity at 75% C2H6 conversion \[10.1002/anie.199509701\]. Weaker C-H bonds in C2H6 than in CH4 lead to faster reaction rates \[10.1002/anie.199509701\]. Site isolation enhances selectivity and process efficiency \[10.1002/anie.199509701\].

                    In ODH of alkanes, high-valence d0 transition metal oxides are pivotal, where MO bond strength dictates reactivity and process efficiency \[10.1021/jp709651n\]. Optimizing electronic properties, especially MO bond strength, enhances performance \[10.1021/jp709651n\]. Site isolation prevents secondary reactions, boosting selectivity \[10.1021/jp709651n\]. The energy gap between valence and conductive bands influences electron transfer, impacting catalyst efficiency \[10.1021/jp709651n\].

                    The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts follows a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism \[10.1021/jp002100x\]. Irreversible CH bond activation by lattice oxygens leads to propene \[10.1021/jp002100x\]. Reduced Mo centers reoxidize through O2 chemisorption, highlighting the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity for process optimization \[10.1021/jp002100x\].

                    In ODH of alkanes, Cr(III)silica models activate C-H bonds, transfer H, and regenerate sites, with mechanisms sensitive to chromium's local structure \[10.1002/poc.842\]. Site isolation is pivotal for selectivity, impacting process efficiency \[10.1002/poc.842\]. The reaction involves C-H activation, ethene loss, and chromium site regeneration with H2
