The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a critical process for the conversion of alkanes to valuable olefins, with significant economic implications [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. This process is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, which play a pivotal role in achieving high selectivity and conversion [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Among these catalysts, vanadium oxide-based systems, such as V2O5, are widely used, but supported systems often offer higher activity and selectivity [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. The effectiveness of these catalysts is determined by factors such as agglomeration, acid-base characteristics, metal cation valence, and electronic properties [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. The performance of vanadium oxide catalysts in propane ODH is optimized with intermediate-sized VOx domains, balancing activity and accessibility [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, correlating with a monolayer structure [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. COx formation in ethane ODH is attributed to adsorbed oxygen species [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is less than stoichiometric [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species more extensively reduced, leading to higher selectivity to propylene with greater surface reduction [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. The support significantly impacts vanadium oxide reactivity, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 are crucial for high ethylene selectivity in ethane ODH [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Ethane CH bond activation forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Alkali additives modify MoOx domains' structure, influencing electronic and catalytic properties [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]].

The ODH of alkanes faces the challenge of faster alkene oxidation than alkane conversion, necessitating low conversions for high selectivity [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Among various systems, MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO show high selectivities [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. CH bond activation is the rate-determining step, leading to proposed Malkyl intermediates that decompose to 1-alkenes via β-H abstraction [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is also proposed [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]].

Increasing temperature up to a certain point enhances C2 product selectivity and methane conversion [\[10.1021/ja00304a008\]]. Lower surface areas favor high C2 selectivities by limiting CO and CO2 formation [\[10.1021/ja00304a008\]].

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes employs catalysts like bulk metal oxides and supported systems, facing challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. Active sites, often molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms, significantly impact catalytic properties, with size impacting selectivity and conversion [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. Monomeric species like MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic features, favoring total oxidation, whereas low-size polymeric species offer better selectivity for partial oxidation reactions [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. Site isolation stabilizes specific active sites, enhancing selectivity by minimizing side reactions [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. Oxidation reactions are structure-sensitive, depending on the local and surface structure of oxide catalysts [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. The Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, involving lattice oxygen ions with electrophilic or nucleophilic character, is crucial [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. The dynamic nature of oxidation catalysts under reaction conditions, influenced by the mobility of the oxide lattice, is essential for understanding their functioning [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. Active sites' size and electronic properties are monitored by reactants and preparation procedures, leading to optimal performance [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]].

Selective propane oxidation to propylene requires BrSnsted acid sites, as studies on MoMgO catalysts demonstrate [\[10.1016/0926-860x(96)00138-x\]]. Reaction pathways are sensitive to catalyst acid-base properties, with homolytic C-H bond breaking yielding propyl radicals [\[10.1016/0926-860x(96)00138-x\]].

Propene production from alkoxy species decomposition also demands BrSnsted acid sites, correlating with propylene formation in MoMgO catalysts [\[10.1016/0926-860x(96)00138-x\]]. These factors collectively impact process efficiency, highlighting the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues [\[10.1016/0926-860x(96)00138-x\]].

Varying Cu/Th ratios in CuTh oxide catalysts influence the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, enhancing catalytic activity with increased copper concentration in thoria [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]]. Selectivity for ethylene and propene peaks at specific ratios before declining [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]]. Higher copper content boosts ethane conversion, potentially due to CuO crystallites that may inhibit ethylene formation [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]]. Ethylene selectivity correlates with copper(II) sites, while propane activity is linked to Cu 2+ ions on the surface [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]]. Propene selectivity is attributed to Cu 2+ ions in substitutional sites [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]]. Site isolation optimizes selectivity by managing active site distribution [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]].

ODH of alkanes, involving primary and secondary reactions, is catalyzed by MoOx and VOx through reduction-oxidation cycles [\[10.1039/b805251d\]]. Reaction rates are limited by the activation of the weakest CH bond on oxide domains [\[10.1039/b805251d\]]. Larger oxide domains, with lower LUMO states and higher electron affinity, enhance electron density acceptance, stabilizing transition states for CH bond activation [\[10.1039/b805251d\]]. Propane ODH rates increase with higher surface density and lower edge energy, correlating with the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons [\[10.1039/b805251d\]]. Quantum confinement effects, due to domain size and electronic isolation, can tailor materials' electronic properties and catalytic functions beyond chemical composition [\[10.1039/b805251d\]].

In ODH of alkanes, VOx/ZrO2, MoOx/ZrO2, and WOx/ZrO2 exhibit increasing activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion, correlating with decreasing reaction rates [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. Lewis acidity affects CH bond energy differences and adsorption enthalpies, impacting propane ODH and propene combustion rates [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. Higher Lewis acidity (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+) raises the activation energy difference between propane ODH and propene combustion [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. Selective ODH requires intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility, as observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]].
