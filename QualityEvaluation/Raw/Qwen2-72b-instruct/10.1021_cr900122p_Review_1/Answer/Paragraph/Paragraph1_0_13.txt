The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a pivotal process for the conversion of alkanes into valuable olefins, with catalysts playing a central role in achieving high selectivity and conversion [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. Supported metal oxides, particularly those with isolated metal cations, have been shown to enhance ODH performance [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. The support significantly affects reactivity, with additives modifying acid-base and redox properties, crucial for high selectivity [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Site isolation is key in designing efficient catalysts, as in VCoAPO-18, where both acid and redox sites contribute to high ethylene selectivity [\[10.1016/0926-860x(96)00138-x\]]. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are less active than vanadia-based ones, and alkali additives influence MoOx domains' electronic and catalytic properties, affecting selectivity [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]].

ODH of alkanes faces the challenge of faster alkene oxidation than alkane conversion, requiring low conversions for high selectivity [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Bulk metal oxides like V2O5 are used, but supported systems offer higher activity and selectivity [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO show high selectivities [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. CH bond activation is the rate-determining step, leading to Malkyl intermediates that decompose to 1-alkenes through Î²-H abstraction [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is proposed [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Site isolation is crucial for selectivity between dehydrogenation and oxygenated product formation [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]].

The mechanism involves methyl radical formation through hydrogen abstraction by [Li'O-] centers, followed by ethane coupling and further oxidation to ethylene [\[10.1021/ja00304a008\]]. Increasing temperature up to a certain point enhances C2 product selectivity and methane conversion [\[10.1021/ja00304a008\]]. Lower surface areas favor high C2 selectivities by limiting CO and CO2 formation [\[10.1021/ja00304a008\]].

CuTh oxide catalysts with varying Cu/Th ratios significantly influence the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]]. Increased copper concentration in thoria boosts catalytic activity and selectivity for ethylene and propene, peaking at specific ratios before declining [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]]. Higher copper content enhances ethane conversion but may inhibit ethylene formation due to CuO crystallites [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]]. Selectivity in ethylene correlates with copper(II) sites, and for propane, activity is linked to Cu 2+ ions on the surface, with selectivity in propene attributed to substitutional Cu 2+ ions [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]].

In ODH of alkanes, top catalysts yield 20% methane conversion with 80% ethane/ethylene selectivity [\[10.1002/anie.199509701\]]. C2H4 production from OXD is double that from methane oxidative coupling [\[10.1002/anie.199509701\]]. Li/MgO with chloride ions achieves 77% C2H4 selectivity at 75% C2H6 conversion [\[10.1002/anie.199509701\]]. C2H6's weaker C-H bond accelerates reaction rates, underlining C-H bond strength's role in ODH efficiency [\[10.1002/anie.199509701\]].

The review also delves into the nature of active and selective sites, kinetic studies, and reaction mechanisms, concluding with insights on future trends [\[10.1081/cr-120001461\]].

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) presents a significant challenge in heterogeneous catalysis due to the complexity of simultaneous reaction pathways [\[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\]]. Efficient catalysts, notably VPO and VSbO-based systems, offer unique mechanisms for hydrocarbon activation, overcoming the activation step [\[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\]]. Achieving high selectivity and conversion is hindered by the multitude of possible pathways [\[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\]]. Various mechanisms have been proposed for alkane activation, emphasizing the role of C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction [\[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\]]. The goal is to propose a common activation site for efficient catalysts, focusing on site isolation to address selectivity issues by stabilizing active species intermediates [\[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\]]. The search for catalysts for the partial oxidation of light alkanes is a difficult but promising challenge, as highlighted by industrial and academic researchers [\[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\]]. A complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate encompassing the dynamics of the surface and the adsorbed species, as well as the role of oxidizing species and the nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reactions [\[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\]].

ODH of alkanes, catalyzed by MoOx and VOx through reduction-oxidation cycles affecting lattice oxygen atoms, is rate-limited by the activation of the weakest CH bond on oxide surfaces [\[10.1039/b805251d\]]. Larger oxide domains, with lower LUMO states and higher electron affinity, enhance electron density acceptance, stabilizing transition states for CH bond activation [\[10.1039/b805251d\]]. Propane ODH rates increase with higher surface density and lower edge energy, correlating with the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons [\[10.1039/b805251d\]]. Quantum confinement effects, due to domain size and electronic isolation, can tailor materials' electronic properties and catalytic functions beyond chemical composition, optimizing ODH processes [\[10.1039/b805251d\]].

In ODH of alkanes, cation identity (V5+, Mo6+, W6+) significantly impacts pathways, with activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion following the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, inversely affecting reaction rates [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. Increased Lewis acidity from V5+ to W6+ enhances the observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. Selective ODH is hindered by shared sites required for CH bond activation in both ODH and alkene combustion [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. Propene's greater reactivity is due to its weaker allylic CH bond [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. The ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2 mirrors that of MoOx/ZrO2 [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. Propene combustion has a lower activation energy than propene dehydrogenation, affecting k3/k1 ratios [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. The sequence of catalytic activities (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2) is attributed to metal center reducibility and active lattice oxygen basicity [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. Selective ODH requires intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]].

Methane's partial oxidation to valuable chemicals faces low yield challenges, often requiring N2O as an oxidant [\[10.1038/314721b0\]].
