The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a critical process for the conversion of alkanes to alkenes, with significant implications for the chemical industry. This process is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, which play pivotal roles in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates \[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]. Among these catalysts, vanadium oxide-based systems, such as V2O5, are widely studied due to their high activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, supported systems often offer higher activity and selectivity than bulk metal oxides, as evidenced by the performance of MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\].

The reaction mechanisms in ODH are complex and involve critical steps such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. These mechanisms are influenced by the nature of the catalyst and the reaction conditions. For instance, vanadium oxide catalysts' activity increases with higher V2O5 loading, peaking at intermediate-sized VOx domains, which correlates with selectivity to olefins \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. The formation of COx in ethane ODH is attributed to adsorbed oxygen species, and vanadium reduction during ODH is substoichiometric \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Both isolated and polymerized vanadium species are active, with higher surface reduction boosting propylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. The support significantly impacts vanadium oxide reactivity, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

Site isolation is a crucial factor in addressing selectivity issues in ODH processes. It stabilizes specific active sites that favor desired reactions over side reactions \[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]. This is particularly evident in VCoAPO-18, where acid and redox sites contribute to high ethylene selectivity in ethane ODH \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are less active than vanadia-based ones, and alkali additives modify MoOx domains' structure, influencing electronic and catalytic properties \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

The challenges in ODH include the faster oxidation of alkenes than alkanes, necessitating low conversions for high selectivity \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. Bulk metal oxides like V2O5 offer low yields, whereas supported systems provide higher activity and selectivity \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. CH bond activation is the rate-determining step, leading to proposed Malkyl intermediates that decompose to 1-alkenes through β-H abstraction \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is also proposed \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. Site isolation is crucial for selectivity between dehydrogenation and oxygenated product formation \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\].

Efficient catalysts, such as Mo16V4Nb2, excel in ethane conversion to ethene at low temperatures, outperforming other mixed-metal oxides \[10.1021/cr9800208\]. Propane's ODH to propylene, facilitated by niobium oxide, shows high selectivity but low conversion, improved by adding V, Cr, Mo \[10.1021/cr9800208\]. In VNbO catalysts, niobium enhances selectivity by stabilizing vanadium sites against facile reduction \[10.1021/cr9800208\].

Lithium-promoted magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) catalyzes methane's partial oxidation to ethane and ethylene with high selectivity and conversion \[10.1021/ja00304a008\]. The mechanism involves methyl radical formation through hydrogen abstraction by [Li'O-] centers, followed by ethane coupling and further oxidation to ethylene \[10.1021/ja00304a008\]. Increasing temperature up to a certain point enhances C2 product selectivity and methane conversion \[10.1021/ja00304a008\]. Lower surface areas favor high C2 selectivities by limiting CO and CO2 formation \[10.1021/ja00304a008\].

In ODH, CuTh oxide catalysts' activity and selectivity are influenced by Cu/Th ratios. Activity rises with copper in thoria, peaking for ethylene and propene selectivity at specific ratios \[10.1007/bf02070119\]. Higher copper content boosts ethane conversion but may inhibit ethylene formation \[10.1007/bf02070119\]. Ethylene selectivity correlates with copper(II) sites, while for propene, it's due to Cu 2+ ions in substitutional sites \[10.1007/bf02070119\].

In ODH of alkanes, top catalysts achieve significant methane conversion with high ethane/ethylene selectivity, leveraging C-H bond activation and radical chemistry \[10.1002/anie.199509701\]. Ethane production from CH3 radicals yields twice as much C2H4 compared to methane coupling, due to differing pathways \[10.1002/anie.199509701\]. A Li/MgO catalyst with chloride ions exemplifies process optimization, achieving 77% C2H4 selectivity at 75% C2H6 conversion \[10.1002/anie.199509701\]. The lower C-H bond strength in C2H6 accelerates reaction rates over CH4, illustrating the role of catalysts and site isolation in addressing selectivity issues \[10.1002/anie.199509701\].

In ODH of alkanes, high-valence d0 transition metal oxides are pivotal, with OH bond strength and energy gap between valence and conductive bands affecting reactivity \[10.1021/jp709651n\]. Optimizing MO bond strength enhances selective oxidation \[10.1021/jp709651n\]. Site isolation prevents secondary reactions, boosting selectivity \[10.1021/jp709651n\].

In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts, a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is proposed, involving irreversible CH bond activation by lattice oxygens, leading to propene desorption \[10.1021/jp002100x\]. Reduced Mo centers reoxidize via O2 dissociative chemisorption, with reversible OH recombination steps forming water, aiding the redox cycle \[10.1021/jp002100x\]. Site isolation prevents undesired reactions, enhancing selectivity and process efficiency \[10.1021/jp002100x\].

In the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, Cr(III)silica models activate C-H bonds, facilitate H transfer, and regenerate sites, with mechanisms sensitive to chromium site structure \[10.1002/poc.842\]. Site isolation boosts selectivity, tackling high conversion and selectivity challenges \[10.1002/poc.842\]. Catalyst structure and reaction mechanisms interplay, emphasizing site isolation's role in process optimization \[10.1002/poc.842\].

NiMoO4 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4 are effective for propane oxydehydrogenation to propylene, with molybdenum content impacting catalytic activity \[10.1006/jcat.1997.1568\]. Binary NiCo molybdates provide a stable system for optimization, with redox elements like Cr enhancing selectivity and conversion \[10.1006/jcat.1997.1568\]. NiCo molybdates are a competitive alternative to V-based catalysts for converting propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile \[10.1006/jcat.1997.1568\].

In ODH of alkanes, surface radicals influence reaction pathways and selectivity \[10.1016/s0360-0564(08)60093-0\]. Supported catalyst systems and site isolation control radical formation, enhancing selectivity by limiting side reactions and affecting active site distribution \[10.1016/s0360-0564(08)60093-0\]. Site isolation prevents radical interactions, improving selectivity, and supported systems manage reactive site availability for intermediates, optimizing the process \[10.1016/s0360-0564(08)60093-0\].

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes mechanism, involving CH activation by oxidative addition over Cr(III)silica surface sites, leads to an unstable ethylhydridochromium(V) complex \[10.1002/poc.990\]. The high activation energy suggests this pathway is unlikely for dehydrogenation \[10.1002/poc.990\]. Site isolation on varying Cr(III)silica surface sites is crucial for addressing selectivity issues \[10.1002/poc.990\].

Vanadium-based catalysts are pivotal in propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), with high surface areas and homogeneity boosting performance \[10.1016/s0021-9517(02)00106-9\]. Site isolation, achieved via techniques like TMP, controls catalytic site structures, enhancing selectivity \[10.1016/s0021-9517(02)00106-9\].

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) presents a significant challenge in heterogeneous catalysis due to the complexity of simultaneous reaction pathways \[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\]. Efficient catalysts, notably VPO and VSbO-based systems, offer unique mechanisms for hydrocarbon activation, overcoming the activation step \[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\]. Achieving high selectivity and conversion is hindered by the multitude of possible pathways \[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\]. Various mechanisms have been proposed for alkane activation, emphasizing the role of C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction \[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\]. The goal is to propose a common activation site for efficient catalysts, focusing on site isolation to address selectivity issues by stabilizing active species intermediates \[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\].

A complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate encompassing the dynamics of the surface and the adsorbed species, as well as the role of oxidizing species and the nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reactions \[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\].

ODH of alkanes, influenced by metal oxide supports, affects vanadium dispersion and species \[10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00029-x\]. Surface vanadium oxide species' reducibility, structure, and coordination number, along with acid/base sites, are critical for catalytic properties \[10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00029-x\]. Supported vanadium oxides offer advantages but their behavior is modified by the support and vanadium loading \[10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00029-x\]. Mixing or supporting vanadium oxide enhances bulk V2O5 selectivity in short chain alkanes' ODH, increasing olefin formation \[10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00029-x\]. Vanadium-magnesium and V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides show high olefin selectivity \[10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00029-x\]. V-containing molecular sieves are selective for oxydehydrogenation products in ethane and propane oxidation \[10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00029-x\].
