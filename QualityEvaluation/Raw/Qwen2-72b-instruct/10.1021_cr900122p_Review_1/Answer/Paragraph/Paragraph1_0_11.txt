The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a critical process for the conversion of alkanes to more valuable olefins, with significant economic implications [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. This process is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, with the latter offering higher activity and selectivity [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Among these, vanadium oxide catalysts, particularly those with intermediate-sized VOx domains, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity to olefins [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. The challenge in ODH lies in achieving high selectivity and conversion, as alkene oxidation often proceeds faster than alkane conversion, necessitating low conversions for high selectivity [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. 

Efficient catalysts, such as VPO and VSbO-based systems, have been pivotal in overcoming the activation barrier of alkanes [\[10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y\]]. However, the complexity of selectivity arises from the multitude of possible reaction pathways [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Various mechanisms have been proposed, including C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\], \[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]].

Adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, reflecting cation Lewis acidity, affect relative ODH and combustion rates [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. CH bond activation in alkane ODH requires the same sites as in alkene combustion, impacting selective strategies [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. Propene's greater reactivity is attributed to its weaker allylic CH bond [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]].
