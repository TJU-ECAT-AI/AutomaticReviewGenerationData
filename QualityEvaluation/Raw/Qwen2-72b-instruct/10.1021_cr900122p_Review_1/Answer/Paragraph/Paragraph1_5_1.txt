The right size of active sites is monitored by reactants in catalytic conditions, leading to the optimal ratio of oxidation states \[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]. Selective oxidation of propane to propylene, a key process in oxidative dehydrogenation, is enhanced by BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by MoMgO catalysts. Reaction pathways are sensitive to acid-base properties, with homolytic C-H bond breaking producing propyl radicals. High temperatures favor alkyl desorption, whereas low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions. A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is proposed. Propene production from alkoxy species decomposition requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and such sites in MoMgO catalysts. These factors collectively optimize the process efficiency \[10.1016/0926-860x(96)00138-x\]. In ODH, CuTh oxide catalysts' activity and
