In ODH of alkanes, VOx, MoOx, and WOx on ZrO2 exhibit rising activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion, correlating with decreasing reaction rates [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. Lewis acidity impacts CH bond energy differences and adsorption enthalpies, affecting propane ODH and propene combustion rates [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. Higher Lewis acidity (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+) increases the activation energy difference between propane ODH and propene combustion [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]]. Selective ODH requires intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility, as observed in VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts [\[10.1021/jp9933875\]].

Historically, methane's partial oxidation to methanol, ethylene, and benzene has faced low yields, with N2O favored over O2 [\[10.1038/314721b0\]].
