The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a critical process for the conversion of alkanes to more valuable olefins, with significant implications for the petrochemical industry \[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]. This process is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, with the latter offering higher activity and selectivity \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. Among supported systems, vanadium oxide catalysts are pivotal, with their performance in propane ODH optimized at intermediate-sized VOx domains \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, correlating with a monolayer structure \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. COx formation in ethane ODH is attributed to adsorbed oxygen species \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is less than stoichiometric \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species more extensively reduced, leading to higher selectivity to propylene with greater surface reduction \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. The support significantly impacts vanadium oxide reactivity, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 are vital for high ethylene selectivity in ethane ODH \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Ethane CH bond activation forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Alkali additives modify MoOx domains' structure, influencing electronic and catalytic properties \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

ODH of alkanes faces the challenge of faster alkene oxidation than alkane conversion, necessitating low conversions for high selectivity \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. Bulk metal oxides like V2O5 offer low yields, whereas supported systems provide higher activity and selectivity \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. Among various systems, MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO show high selectivities \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. CH bond activation is the rate-determining step, leading to proposed Malkyl intermediates that decompose to 1-alkenes via β-H abstraction \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is also proposed \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. Site isolation is crucial for selectivity between dehydrogenation and oxygenated product formation \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\].
