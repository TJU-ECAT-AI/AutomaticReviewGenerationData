This process is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, with vanadium oxide catalysts playing a pivotal role \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. The performance of vanadium oxide catalysts in propane ODH is optimized with intermediate-sized VOx domains, balancing activity and accessibility \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, correlating with a monolayer structure \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. COx formation in ethane ODH is attributed to adsorbed oxygen species \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species more extensively reduced, leading to higher selectivity to propylene with greater surface reduction \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. The support significantly impacts vanadium oxide reactivity, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 are crucial for high ethylene selectivity in ethane ODH \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Alkali additives modify MoOx domain structure and catalytic properties, affecting CH bond activation and selectivity to propylene \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

ODH of alkanes faces the challenge of faster alkene oxidation than alkane conversion, necessitating low conversions for high selectivity \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. Bulk metal oxides like V2O5 offer low yields, whereas supported systems provide higher activity and selectivity \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. Among various systems, MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO show high selectivities \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. CH bond activation is the rate-determining step, leading to proposed Malkyl intermediates that decompose to 1-alkenes via β-H abstraction \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is also proposed \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\].

ODH of alkanes, involving primary and secondary reactions, is catalyzed by MoOx and VOx via reduction-oxidation cycles \[10.1039/b805251d\]. Reaction rates are limited by the activation of the weakest CH bond \[10.1039/b805251d\]. Larger oxide domains, with lower LUMO energies, enhance electron density acceptance, stabilizing transition states for CH bond activation \[10.1039/b805251d\]. Propane ODH rates increase with higher surface density and lower edge energy, correlating with the ability to accept electrons \[10.1039/b805251d\].

In ODH of alkanes, VOx/ZrO2, MoOx/ZrO2, and WOx/ZrO2 exhibit increasing activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion, correlating with decreasing reaction rates \[10.1021/jp9933875\]. Lewis acidity affects CH bond energy differences and adsorption enthalpies, impacting propane ODH and propene combustion rates \[10.1021/jp9933875\]. Higher Lewis acidity (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+) raises the activation energy difference between propane ODH and propene combustion \[10.1021/jp9933875\]. Selective ODH requires intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility, as observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts \[10.1021/jp9933875\]. CH bond activation in ODH and alkene combustion shares sites, limiting selective poisoning strategies \[10.1021/jp9933875\].
