The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a critical process for the conversion of alkanes to valuable olefins, with significant economic implications due to the vast reserves of alkanes [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00053-x\]]. The efficiency of ODH is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, with the nature of the alkane dictating catalyst choice [\[10.1080/01614940600631413\]]. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through understanding reaction mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. Active sites, often molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms, significantly impact ODH selectivity and conversion rates [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. Site isolation stabilizes specific sites that favor desired reactions over side reactions [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]]. Monomeric species like MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic features leading to total oxidation, whereas low-size polymeric species show better selectivity for partial oxidation reactions [\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00103-4\]].

Vanadium oxide catalysts' performance in propane ODH is optimized with intermediate-sized VOx domains, balancing activity and accessibility [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, correlating with a monolayer structure [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. COx formation in ethane ODH is attributed to adsorbed oxygen species [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species more extensively reduced, leading to higher selectivity to propylene with greater surface reduction [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. The support significantly impacts vanadium oxide reactivity, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 are crucial for high ethylene selectivity in ethane ODH [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Alkali additives influence MoOx domain structure and catalytic properties, affecting CH bond activation and selectivity to propylene [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]].

ODH of alkanes faces the challenge of faster alkene oxidation than alkane conversion, necessitating low conversions for high selectivity [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Bulk metal oxides like V2O5 offer low yields, whereas supported systems provide higher activity and selectivity [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Among various systems, MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO show high selectivities [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. CH bond activation is the rate-determining step, leading to proposed Malkyl intermediates that decompose to 1-alkenes via β-H abstraction [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is also proposed [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]]. Site isolation is crucial for selectivity between dehydrogenation and oxygenated product formation [\[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]].

ODH of alkanes, notably ethane to ethene and propane to propylene, is promising [\[10.1021/cr9800208\]]. Mo16V4Nb2 catalysts excel over other mixed-metal oxides in activity and selectivity [\[10.1021/cr9800208\]]. Niobium oxide has high selectivity for propane conversion, albeit with low conversion rates [\[10.1021/cr9800208\]]. Adding V, Cr, and Mo boosts activity without harming selectivity [\[10.1021/cr9800208\]]. In VNbO catalysts, niobium's resistance to reduction enhances vanadium sites' selectivity [\[10.1021/cr9800208\]].

Lithium-promoted magnesium oxide catalyzes methane's partial oxidation to ethane and ethylene with high selectivity and conversion [\[10.1021/ja00304a008\]]. The mechanism involves methyl radical formation through hydrogen abstraction by [Li'O-] centers, followed by ethane coupling and further oxidation to ethylene [\[10.1021/ja00304a008\]]. Increasing temperature up to a certain point enhances C2 product selectivity and methane conversion [\[10.1021/ja00304a008\]]. Lower surface areas favor high C2 selectivities by limiting CO and CO2 formation [\[10.1021/ja00304a008\]].

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes mechanism, involving CH activation by oxidative addition over Cr(III)silica surface sites, leads to an unstable ethylhydridochromium(V) complex [\[10.1002/poc.990\]]. The high activation energy suggests this pathway is unlikely for dehydrogenation [\[10.1002/poc.990\]]. Site isolation on varying Cr(III)silica surface sites is crucial for addressing selectivity issues [\[10.1002/poc.990\]].

In ODH of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts, a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is proposed, involving irreversible CH bond activation by lattice oxygens, leading to propene desorption [\[10.1021/jp002100x\]]. Reduced Mo centers reoxidize via O2 dissociative chemisorption, with reversible OH recombination steps forming water, aiding the redox cycle [\[10.1021/jp002100x\]]. Site isolation prevents undesired reactions, enhancing selectivity and process efficiency [\[10.1021/jp002100x\]].

CuTh oxide catalysts with varying Cu/Th ratios significantly influence the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]]. Increased copper concentration in thoria boosts catalytic activity and selectivity for ethylene and propene, peaking at specific ratios before declining [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]]. Higher copper content enhances ethane conversion but may inhibit ethylene formation due to CuO crystallites [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]]. Selectivity in ethylene correlates with copper(II) sites, and for propane, activity is linked to Cu 2+ ions on the surface, with selectivity in propene attributed to substitutional Cu 2+ ions [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]]. Site isolation optimizes selectivity by controlling active site distribution [\[10.1007/bf02070119\]].

In ODH of alkanes, top catalysts yield 20% methane conversion with 80% ethane/ethylene selectivity [\[10.1002/anie.199509701\]]. Ethane production from OXD is double that from methane oxidative coupling [\[10.1002/anie.199509701\]]. A Li/MgO catalyst with chloride ions achieves 77% C2H4 selectivity at 75% C2H6 conversion [\[10.1002/anie.199509701\]]. C2H6's weaker C-H bond accelerates reaction rates, underlining C-H bond strength's role in ODH efficiency [\[10.1002/anie.199509701\]].

In ODH of alkanes, high-valence d0 transition metal oxides are critical, with MO bond strength optimization enhancing efficiency [\[10.1021/jp709651n\]]. Site isolation, preventing secondary reactions, boosts selectivity by avoiding unwanted products [\[10.1021/jp709651n\]].

In ODH of alkanes, surface radicals influence reaction pathways and selectivity [\[10.1016/s0360-0564(08)60093-0\]]. Supported catalyst systems and site isolation control radical formation, enhancing selectivity by limiting side reactions and affecting active site distribution [\[10.1016/s0360-0564(08)60093-0\]]. Site isolation prevents radical interactions, improving selectivity, and supported systems manage reactive site availability for intermediates, optimizing the process [\[10.1016/s0360-0564(08)60093-0\]].
