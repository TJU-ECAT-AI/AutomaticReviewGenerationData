The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to the catalysts used. Supported metal oxide catalysts, for instance, are affected by the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. Selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, and secondary surface metal oxide additives can enhance propane activation to propylene. Incorporating high vanadium contents in hosting structures can sometimes lead to structural instability. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 is crucial for high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, with propane ODH rates increasing with Mo surface density up to a certain point. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo-O strength, with stronger bonds showing lower ODH activity. The activation of ethane CH bonds forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates. Alkali additives affect the structure of MoOx domains, influencing their electronic and catalytic properties, and can inhibit the reduction of MoOx, affecting the CH bond activation step and leading to higher selectivity to propylene.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a significant reaction, but it faces the challenge that the oxidation of the alkene product is often faster than the starting alkane, necessitating low conversions to achieve high selectivities. ODH can be performed on various bulk metal oxides, such as V2O5, but these yield low results per pass. Supported systems, on the other hand, offer higher activity and selectivity. Among the investigated systems, MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO show relatively high selectivities. The CH bond activation is identified as the rate-determining step in all cases. ODH, especially of ethane, requires high temperatures, where homogeneous gas phase reactions can dominate. CH bond activation is proposed to lead to Malkyl intermediates, which decompose to 1-alkenes through β-H abstraction. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is also proposed. The selectivity between dehydrogenation and the formation of oxygenated products is correlated with the distance between sites, highlighting the importance of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an attractive process for producing alkenes, especially for converting ethane to ethene at low temperatures. A metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active and selective than other mixed-metal oxides. The ODH of propane to propylene is also of interest, and niobium oxide shows high selectivity, although conversion is low. Adding elements like V, Cr, and Mo to niobium oxide can improve its activity without affecting selectivity. The selectivity of vanadium sites in VNbO catalysts is enhanced by niobium neighbors, as niobium is harder to reduce than vanadium, which improves selectivity by preventing facile reduction that can lead to low selectivity.

The document discusses the use of lithium-promoted magnesium oxide as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen. The catalyst was effective in producing ethane and ethylene with high selectivity at relatively high conversions. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of methyl radicals through the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from methane by [Li'O-] centers on the catalyst surface. The coupling of two methyl radicals leads to the formation of ethane, which can be further oxidized to ethylene. The selectivity for C2 products and the conversion of methane both increased with increasing reaction temperature up to about 700°C. Low surface areas favored high C2 selectivities due to the dominant pathway of reacting CH3. with surface O2- ions leading to undesirable products of CO and CO2. The Li/MgO system is a new type of oxidation catalyst that does not contain metal ions with variable oxidation states.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are related to the complex nature of the reaction mechanisms, which include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by allowing for the stabilization of specific active sites that favor desired reactions over undesired side reactions. The size of the active sites, as well as their electronic and geometric properties, significantly impact the selectivity and conversion rates in ODH reactions.

The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts. The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical. High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions. A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed. Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts. These factors collectively influence the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The CuTh oxide catalysts, with different Cu/Th atomic ratios, have been studied extensively using EPR technique, revealing the presence of copper(II) ion pairs and substitutional surface sites. The catalytic activity for ODH increases with the copper concentration in thoria, while the selectivity in ethylene and propene changes with the copper content, peaking at specific ratios before decreasing. The conversion of ethane is more significant at higher copper contents, suggesting the role of CuO crystallites, which may inhibit the formation of ethylene. The selectivity in ethylene is correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by specific signals. For propane, the catalytic activity is attributed to Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface, while the selectivity in propene is due to Cu 2+ ions in substitutional sites. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, with site isolation playing a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the distribution and nature of active sites.

The document discusses the oxidative coupling of methane, which involves similar concepts to ODH. The best catalysts for oxidative coupling provide 20% methane conversion with 80% combined ethane and ethylene selectivity in a single pass through the reactor. The mechanism involves the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface and free-radical chemistry in the gas phase. Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of surface-generated CH3 radicals in the gas phase. The yield of C2H4 and C2H6 is limited by secondary reactions of CH3 radicals with the surface and further oxidation of C2H4, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. Several of the better oxidative coupling catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane, and in each case, the catalyst has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The initial activation step for both CH4 and C2H6 is believed to be the same - the formation of alkyl radicals. The C2H5 radicals have been identified with the MIESR system. The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of O2, reaction (11) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2. For CH3 radicals, there is no analogous route to the formation of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C2H4 from the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from oxidative coupling of CH4. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions, a C2H4 selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C2H6 conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%. Moreover, because the C-H bond strength in C2H6 (422 kJ mol-1) is less than that in CH4 (439 kJ mol-1), the rates of reaction are substantially greater with C2H6.

The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, or the proposed reaction mechanisms. However, it does discuss the role of high-valence d0 transition metal oxides in the selective oxidation of lower alkanes, emphasizing the importance of the OH bond strength in determining the reactivity of a metal oxide. The study reveals that the reactivity of metal oxides is influenced by the energy gap between their valence and conductive bands, which is related to their ability to transfer electrons from the lattice oxygens to the metal centers. This finding suggests that the efficiency of the ODH process can be improved by optimizing the electronic properties of the catalysts, particularly the strength of the MO bond, which must be of intermediate strength to carry out selective oxidation catalysis. Site isolation may play a role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts is discussed, identifying the elementary steps and their reversibility. Propene is the most abundant primary product, and CO and CO2 are formed via either secondary combustion of propene or direct combustion of propane. Steps involving CH bond activation are irreversible, and normal kinetic isotopic effects were measured for propane dehydrogenation, propane combustion, and propene combustion. OH recombination steps are reversible and quasi-equilibrated. The proposed reaction mechanism is consistent with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, where two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of CH bonds in propane. The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene, and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers. The reduced Mo centers finally reoxidize by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2.

The literature discusses the dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica models, exploring the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. The study focuses on a reaction mechanism consisting of three main steps: (1) C-H activation of ethane according to σ-bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. The influence of the local structure of the chromium surface sites on the reaction mechanism is also explored. The literature suggests that the mechanism of dehydrogenation is sensitive to the local structure about chromium, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

Metal molybdates, particularly NiMoO4 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4, show promise for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The molybdenum content significantly influences catalytic activity and product yields. Binary NiCo molybdates offer a stable catalytic system for further optimization. The addition of redox elements like V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances activity, with Cr showing potential for retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions. The NiCo molybdate system is an alternative to V-based catalysts for light paraffin activation and holds promise for direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor.

The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the role of surface-generated gas-phase radicals in catalytic reactions, which may be relevant to ODH processes. The presence of these radicals can influence reaction pathways and product selectivity. Catalyst design, including the use of supported systems and site isolation, can help control radical formation and improve selectivity by limiting unwanted side reactions. Site isolation may help in controlling radical-radical interactions, potentially improving selectivity. Catalyst design, including the use of supported systems, can affect the distribution of active sites and thus impact selectivity. Site isolation can help to prevent undesired side reactions by limiting the availability of reactive sites for certain intermediates.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the mechanism of CH activation by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation over Cr(III)silica surface sites. The mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III) and the doublet spin potential energy surface of Cr(V). The ethylhydridochromium(V) complex formed is unstable with respect to the back-reaction, and β-hydrogen transfer must take place in the extension of the CH activation step to complete the catalytic cycle. The computed activation energy for this mechanism is high, around 220 kJ mol-1, making CH activation by oxidative addition an unlikely mechanism for dehydrogenation in this system. Site isolation is not explicitly discussed, but the literature does compare the reactivity of different Cr(III)silica surface sites, including those with two and three oxygen bridges to the silica surface.

The literature does not provide detailed analysis on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that vanadium-based catalysts generally outperform other metal-containing catalysts for propane ODH. The literature also highlights the importance of high surface areas and homogeneities in catalysts for improved performance in heterogeneous processes. Site isolation is suggested to play a role in controlling the structures of catalytic sites, which can influence selectivity. The use of the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method can produce catalysts with high surface areas and homogeneities, which can improve the performance of propane ODH catalysts. Site isolation is also mentioned as an important factor in catalysis, and the TMP method can provide control over the structures of isolated catalytic sites. Site isolation is mentioned as a strategy to introduce isolated catalytic centers onto the surface of an oxide support, which can lead to improved control over the structure of the catalytic site and the generation of site-isolated catalysts. Site isolation is also mentioned as a key factor in the reactivities of some materials, such as bimetallic oxides and catalyst support interfaces, where the spatial arrangement of metal atoms on a catalyst surface is crucial for defining reactivity. The support materials Al2O3, ZrO2, and MgO have been examined. Site isolation is mentioned as a key factor in the reactivities of well-defined iron sites for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons.

The review discusses the catalytic conversion of n-butane by oxidative dehydrogenation as an alternative to direct dehydrogenation, focusing on catalytic systems, kinetic studies, and proposed reaction mechanisms. Special attention is given to the hydrocarbon activation process and factors governing catalytic efficiency. The review covers unsupported catalysts, supported catalysts, and promoters. Catalyst composition, operating conditions, reducibility, oxygen reactivity and availability, nature of oxygen species, electrical conductivity, surface basicity, and other factors are discussed. The nature of active and selective sites is also explored. Kinetic studies and reaction mechanisms are analyzed in detail. Conclusions and future trends are summarized.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that poses significant challenges to both industrial and academic researchers in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Efficient catalysts, such as VPO or VSbO-based systems, have been developed to overcome the activation step of alkanes, which is crucial for the process. However, achieving high selectivity and conversion remains difficult due to the multitude of possible reaction pathways and steps that occur simultaneously on the adsorbed phase without desorption. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes, but no single mechanism stands out as universally applicable. The goal is to propose a common activation site for several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation. The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule corresponds to an oxidative dehydrogenation. Different mechanisms have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties like strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species. The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, and their presence in oxidation catalysts should be related to structure defects. The dynamic nature of a catalytic oxide surface suggests that the concept of localized active sites should be taken with caution. A complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate encompassing the dynamics of the surface and the adsorbed species, as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid. Electrical conductivity measurements can provide information on the existence of oxidizing species and the nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reactions, characterizing the structure defects and helping to identify the active oxygen species. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by stabilizing active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, which can be measured by observing the effects of residence time on the formation rates of alkenes and COx. The catalytic turnovers for ODH of MoOx and VOx proceed through reduction-oxidation cycles, involving the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms. Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which activates the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms. The catalytic sequence requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation. The ability of oxide domains to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO, leads to significant catalytic consequences. Larger domains have lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity, which increases their ability to accept electrons. This is consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates increase with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy. The reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become more able to accept electron density and stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps. Higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, decreasing turnover rates. Similar trends have been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, ethane, and oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains, and on more reducible RuOx domains. Stoichiometric reduction rates increase with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities, consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates. The UV-visible absorption edge energy decreases as the energy level of the LUMO decreases and as the electron affinity of the cluster increases. Quantum confinement effects, imposed by the size and electronic isolation of oxide domains, can be used to design materials with electronic properties and catalytic functions controlled by properties other than chemical composition.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves the examination of the effect of cation identity on ODH pathways using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the reaction rates decrease in this sequence. The relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend on CH bond energy differences and the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+). Other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acidbase properties of active oxides and supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions requires the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. The greater reactivity of propene arises because the weakest CH bond in propane is stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene. The limited kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides suggests a similar reaction mechanism. The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species. The apparent activation energy for propene combustion is lower than for propene dehydrogenation, leading to a decrease in the k3/k1 ratio and an increase in propene yields as temperature increases. The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios. The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations. The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2). Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility are essential requirements for selective ODH, consistent with the trends in ODH rates and k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts.

The partial oxidation of methane to produce more useful chemicals like methanol, ethylene, and benzene has been widely studied, but the yields of these products have been low. In some processes, N2O is used as the oxidant instead of O2. Recent research in our lab has shown that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has a high capacity for hydrogen abstraction from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals. This indicates that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are generated by the coupling of two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst. We have achieved high yields of C2 compounds from CH4 conversion under conventional catalytic conditions.

The activation of alkanes is more difficult than that of the corresponding unsaturated hydrocarbons, but their large reserves highlight the economic interest in their conversion. The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate paraffins, thus limiting selectivity. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of water in the reaction feed decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen-containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The choice of catalyst is influenced by the nature of the alkane, with different catalysts being more effective for different alkanes. The reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and conversion of the process. Site isolation can help address selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products. The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the specific features of each alkane. Acid-base properties, type of oxygen, and the presence of promoters can also impact the performance of the ODH reaction.

The surface chemistry of supported chromium (Cr) on amorphous surfaces or molecular sieves is quite similar. Supported Cr ions are highly reactive and mobile, interacting with various molecules like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water. The redox behavior of supported Cr ions is influenced by the type and composition of the support, with Cr ions being easier to reduce on chemically softer supports. The oxide support acts as a ligand, controlling the redox properties of the supported Cr ions. Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ can be present, with their coordination and polymerization degrees depending on the support type and composition. Higher Cr loadings and lower surface areas tend to favor the formation of polychromates. After calcination, chromium oxides are anchored onto the surface through reactions with hydroxyl groups, and their molecular structure is determined by the support composition, Cr loading, and treatment conditions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is influenced by the acid-base character of the metal oxide support, which affects the dispersion of vanadium on the surface and the nature of the vanadium species. The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species, as well as the acid-base character of catalysts, are crucial for the catalytic properties in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. Tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. The coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites, play a significant role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. These factors are essential for developing selective catalysts in ODH reactions. Supported metal oxides offer advantages such as higher mechanical strength, better thermal stability, and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is influenced by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. Mixing or supporting vanadium oxide on other metal oxides can enhance the selectivity of bulk V2O5 in the ODH of short chain alkanes, increasing the formation rate of desired olefins. Vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO) and V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides have shown high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane, propane, and ethane. V-containing molecular sieves have also shown high selectivity for oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidation of ethane and propane. Despite the study of various catalytic systems, the nature of the active and selective sites in the ODH of short chain alkanes is still under discussion. The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species, which can affect its redox properties. Monolayer systems have been studied to optimize the dispersion of active sites and understand the influence of the support. The nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. However, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under investigation. The aim of the paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts and understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to the catalysts used. Supported metal oxide catalysts, for instance, are affected by the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. Selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, and secondary surface metal oxide additives can enhance propane activation to propylene. Incorporating high vanadium contents in hosting structures can sometimes lead to structural instability. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 is crucial for high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, with propane ODH rates increasing with Mo surface density up to a certain point. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo-O strength, with stronger bonds showing lower ODH activity. The activation of ethane CH bonds forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates. Alkali additives affect the structure of MoOx domains, influencing their electronic and catalytic properties, and can inhibit the reduction of MoOx, affecting the CH bond activation step and leading to higher selectivity to propylene.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a significant reaction, but it faces the challenge that the oxidation of the alkene product is often faster than the starting alkane, necessitating low conversions to achieve high selectivities. ODH can be performed on various bulk metal oxides, such as V2O5, but these yield low results per pass. Supported systems, on the other hand, offer higher activity and selectivity. Among the investigated systems, MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO show relatively high selectivities. The CH bond activation is identified as the rate-determining step in all cases. ODH, especially of ethane, requires high temperatures, where homogeneous gas phase reactions can dominate. CH bond activation is proposed to lead to Malkyl intermediates, which decompose to 1-alkenes through β-H abstraction. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is also proposed. The selectivity between dehydrogenation and the formation of oxygenated products is correlated with the distance between sites, highlighting the importance of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an attractive process for producing alkenes, especially for converting ethane to ethene at low temperatures. A metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active and selective than other mixed-metal oxides. The ODH of propane to propylene is also of interest, and niobium oxide shows high selectivity, although conversion is low. Adding elements like V, Cr, and Mo to niobium oxide can improve its activity without affecting selectivity. The selectivity of vanadium sites in VNbO catalysts is enhanced by niobium neighbors, as niobium is harder to reduce than vanadium, which improves selectivity by preventing facile reduction that can lead to low selectivity.

The document discusses the use of lithium-promoted magnesium oxide as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen. The catalyst was effective in producing ethane and ethylene with high selectivity at relatively high conversions. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of methyl radicals through the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from methane by [Li'O-] centers on the catalyst surface. The coupling of two methyl radicals leads to the formation of ethane, which can be further oxidized to ethylene. The selectivity for C2 products and the conversion of methane both increased with increasing reaction temperature up to about 700°C. Low surface areas favored high C2 selectivities due to the dominant pathway of reacting CH3. with surface O2- ions leading to undesirable products of CO and CO2. The Li/MgO system is a new type of oxidation catalyst that does not contain metal ions with variable oxidation states.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are related to the complex nature of the reaction mechanisms, which include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by allowing for the stabilization of specific active sites that favor desired reactions over undesired side reactions. The size of the active sites, as well as their electronic and geometric properties, significantly impact the selectivity and conversion rates in ODH reactions.

The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts. The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical. High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions. A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed. Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts. These factors collectively influence the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The CuTh oxide catalysts, with different Cu/Th atomic ratios, have been studied extensively using EPR technique, revealing the presence of copper(II) ion pairs and substitutional surface sites. The catalytic activity for ODH increases with the copper concentration in thoria, while the selectivity in ethylene and propene changes with the copper content, peaking at specific ratios before decreasing. The conversion of ethane is more significant at higher copper contents, suggesting the role of CuO crystallites, which may inhibit the formation of ethylene. The selectivity in ethylene is correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by specific signals. For propane, the catalytic activity is attributed to Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface, while the selectivity in propene is due to Cu 2+ ions in substitutional sites. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, with site isolation playing a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the distribution and nature of active sites.

The document discusses the oxidative coupling of methane, which involves similar concepts to ODH. The best catalysts for oxidative coupling provide 20% methane conversion with 80% combined ethane and ethylene selectivity in a single pass through the reactor. The mechanism involves the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface and free-radical chemistry in the gas phase. Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of surface-generated CH3 radicals in the gas phase. The yield of C2H4 and C2H6 is limited by secondary reactions of CH3 radicals with the surface and further oxidation of C2H4, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. Several of the better oxidative coupling catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane, and in each case, the catalyst has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The initial activation step for both CH4 and C2H6 is believed to be the same - the formation of alkyl radicals. The C2H5 radicals have been identified with the MIESR system. The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of O2, reaction (11) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2. For CH3 radicals, there is no analogous route to the formation of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C2H4 from the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from oxidative coupling of CH4. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions, a C2H4 selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C2H6 conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%. Moreover, because the C-H bond strength in C2H6 (422 kJ mol-1) is less than that in CH4 (439 kJ mol-1), the rates of reaction are substantially greater with C2H6.

The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, or the proposed reaction mechanisms. However, it does discuss the role of high-valence d0 transition metal oxides in the selective oxidation of lower alkanes, emphasizing the importance of the OH bond strength in determining the reactivity of a metal oxide. The study reveals that the reactivity of metal oxides is influenced by the energy gap between their valence and conductive bands, which is related to their ability to transfer electrons from the lattice oxygens to the metal centers. This finding suggests that the efficiency of the ODH process can be improved by optimizing the electronic properties of the catalysts, particularly the strength of the MO bond, which must be of intermediate strength to carry out selective oxidation catalysis. Site isolation may play a role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts is discussed, identifying the elementary steps and their reversibility. Propene is the most abundant primary product, and CO and CO2 are formed via either secondary combustion of propene or direct combustion of propane. Steps involving CH bond activation are irreversible, and normal kinetic isotopic effects were measured for propane dehydrogenation, propane combustion, and propene combustion. OH recombination steps are reversible and quasi-equilibrated. The proposed reaction mechanism is consistent with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, where two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of CH bonds in propane. The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene, and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers. The reduced Mo centers finally reoxidize by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2.

The literature discusses the dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica models, exploring the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. The study focuses on a reaction mechanism consisting of three main steps: (1) C-H activation of ethane according to σ-bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. The influence of the local structure of the chromium surface sites on the reaction mechanism is also explored. The literature suggests that the mechanism of dehydrogenation is sensitive to the local structure about chromium, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

Metal molybdates, particularly NiMoO4 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4, show promise for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The molybdenum content significantly influences catalytic activity and product yields. Binary NiCo molybdates offer a stable catalytic system for further optimization. The addition of redox elements like V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances activity, with Cr showing potential for retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions. The NiCo molybdate system is an alternative to V-based catalysts for light paraffin activation and holds promise for direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor.

The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the role of surface-generated gas-phase radicals in catalytic reactions, which may be relevant to ODH processes. The presence of these radicals can influence reaction pathways and product selectivity. Catalyst design, including the use of supported systems and site isolation, can help control radical formation and improve selectivity by limiting unwanted side reactions. Site isolation may help in controlling radical-radical interactions, potentially improving selectivity. Catalyst design, including the use of supported systems, can affect the distribution of active sites and thus impact selectivity. Site isolation can help to prevent undesired side reactions by limiting the availability of reactive sites for certain intermediates.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the mechanism of CH activation by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation over Cr(III)silica surface sites. The mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III) and the doublet spin potential energy surface of Cr(V). The ethylhydridochromium(V) complex formed is unstable with respect to the back-reaction, and β-hydrogen transfer must take place in the extension of the CH activation step to complete the catalytic cycle. The computed activation energy for this mechanism is high, around 220 kJ mol-1, making CH activation by oxidative addition an unlikely mechanism for dehydrogenation in this system. Site isolation is not explicitly discussed, but the literature does compare the reactivity of different Cr(III)silica surface sites, including those with two and three oxygen bridges to the silica surface.

The literature does not provide detailed analysis on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that vanadium-based catalysts generally outperform other metal-containing catalysts for propane ODH. The literature also highlights the importance of high surface areas and homogeneities in catalysts for improved performance in heterogeneous processes. Site isolation is suggested to play a role in controlling the structures of catalytic sites, which can influence selectivity. The use of the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method can produce catalysts with high surface areas and homogeneities, which can improve the performance of propane ODH catalysts. Site isolation is also mentioned as an important factor in catalysis, and the TMP method can provide control over the structures of isolated catalytic sites. Site isolation is mentioned as a strategy to introduce isolated catalytic centers onto the surface of an oxide support, which can lead to improved control over the structure of the catalytic site and the generation of site-isolated catalysts. Site isolation is also mentioned as a key factor in the reactivities of some materials, such as bimetallic oxides and catalyst support interfaces, where the spatial arrangement of metal atoms on a catalyst surface is crucial for defining reactivity. The support materials Al2O3, ZrO2, and MgO have been examined. Site isolation is mentioned as a key factor in the reactivities of well-defined iron sites for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons.

The review discusses the catalytic conversion of n-butane by oxidative dehydrogenation as an alternative to direct dehydrogenation, focusing on catalytic systems, kinetic studies, and proposed reaction mechanisms. Special attention is given to the hydrocarbon activation process and factors governing catalytic efficiency. The review covers unsupported catalysts, supported catalysts, and promoters. Catalyst composition, operating conditions, reducibility, oxygen reactivity and availability, nature of oxygen species, electrical conductivity, surface basicity, and other factors are discussed. The nature of active and selective sites is also explored. Kinetic studies and reaction mechanisms are analyzed in detail. Conclusions and future trends are summarized.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that poses significant challenges to both industrial and academic researchers in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Efficient catalysts, such as VPO or VSbO-based systems, have been developed to overcome the activation step of alkanes, which is crucial for the process. However, achieving high selectivity and conversion remains difficult due to the multitude of possible reaction pathways and steps that occur simultaneously on the adsorbed phase without desorption. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes, but no single mechanism stands out as universally applicable. The goal is to propose a common activation site for several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation. The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule corresponds to an oxidative dehydrogenation. Different mechanisms have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties like strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species. The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, and their presence in oxidation catalysts should be related to structure defects. The dynamic nature of a catalytic oxide surface suggests that the concept of localized active sites should be taken with caution. A complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate encompassing the dynamics of the surface and the adsorbed species, as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid. Electrical conductivity measurements can provide information on the existence of oxidizing species and the nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reactions, characterizing the structure defects and helping to identify the active oxygen species. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by stabilizing active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, which can be measured by observing the effects of residence time on the formation rates of alkenes and COx. The catalytic turnovers for ODH of MoOx and VOx proceed through reduction-oxidation cycles, involving the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms. Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which activates the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms. The catalytic sequence requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation. The ability of oxide domains to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO, leads to significant catalytic consequences. Larger domains have lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity, which increases their ability to accept electrons. This is consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates increase with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy. The reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become more able to accept electron density and stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps. Higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, decreasing turnover rates. Similar trends have been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, ethane, and oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains, and on more reducible RuOx domains. Stoichiometric reduction rates increase with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities, consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates. The UV-visible absorption edge energy decreases as the energy level of the LUMO decreases and as the electron affinity of the cluster increases. Quantum confinement effects, imposed by the size and electronic isolation of oxide domains, can be used to design materials with electronic properties and catalytic functions controlled by properties other than chemical composition.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves the examination of the effect of cation identity on ODH pathways using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the reaction rates decrease in this sequence. The relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend on CH bond energy differences and the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+). Other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acidbase properties of active oxides and supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions requires the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. The greater reactivity of propene arises because the weakest CH bond in propane is stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene. The limited kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides suggests a similar reaction mechanism. The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species. The apparent activation energy for propene combustion is lower than for propene dehydrogenation, leading to a decrease in the k3/k1 ratio and an increase in propene yields as temperature increases. The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios. The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations. The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2). Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility are essential requirements for selective ODH, consistent with the trends in ODH rates and k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts.

The partial oxidation of methane to produce more useful chemicals like methanol, ethylene, and benzene has been widely studied, but the yields of these products have been low. In some processes, N2O is used as the oxidant instead of O2. Recent research in our lab has shown that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has a high capacity for hydrogen abstraction from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals. This indicates that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are generated by the coupling of two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst. We have achieved high yields of C2 compounds from CH4 conversion under conventional catalytic conditions.

The activation of alkanes is more difficult than that of the corresponding unsaturated hydrocarbons, but their large reserves highlight the economic interest in their conversion. The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate paraffins, thus limiting selectivity. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of water in the reaction feed decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen-containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The choice of catalyst is influenced by the nature of the alkane, with different catalysts being more effective for different alkanes. The reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and conversion of the process. Site isolation can help address selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products. The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the specific features of each alkane. Acid-base properties, type of oxygen, and the presence of promoters can also impact the performance of the ODH reaction.

The surface chemistry of supported chromium (Cr) on amorphous surfaces or molecular sieves is quite similar. Supported Cr ions are highly reactive and mobile, interacting with various molecules like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water. The redox behavior of supported Cr ions is influenced by the type and composition of the support, with Cr ions being easier to reduce on chemically softer supports. The oxide support acts as a ligand, controlling the redox properties of the supported Cr ions. Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ can be present, with their coordination and polymerization degrees depending on the support type and composition. Higher Cr loadings and lower surface areas tend to favor the formation of polychromates. After calcination, chromium oxides are anchored onto the surface through reactions with hydroxyl groups, and their molecular structure is determined by the support composition, Cr loading, and treatment conditions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is influenced by the acid-base character of the metal oxide support, which affects the dispersion of vanadium on the surface and the nature of the vanadium species. The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species, as well as the acid-base character of catalysts, are crucial for the catalytic properties in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. Tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. The coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites, play a significant role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. These factors are essential for developing selective catalysts in ODH reactions. Supported metal oxides offer advantages such as higher mechanical strength, better thermal stability, and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is influenced by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. Mixing or supporting vanadium oxide on other metal oxides can enhance the selectivity of bulk V2O5 in the ODH of short chain alkanes, increasing the formation rate of desired olefins. Vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO) and V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides have shown high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane, propane, and ethane. V-containing molecular sieves have also shown high selectivity for oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidation of ethane and propane. Despite the study of various catalytic systems, the nature of the active and selective sites in the ODH of short chain alkanes is still under discussion. The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species, which can affect its redox properties. Monolayer systems have been studied to optimize the dispersion of active sites and understand the influence of the support. The nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. However, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under investigation. The aim of the paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts and understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to the catalysts used. Supported metal oxide catalysts, for instance, are affected by the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. Selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, and secondary surface metal oxide additives can enhance propane activation to propylene. Incorporating high vanadium contents in hosting structures can sometimes lead to structural instability. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 is crucial for high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, with propane ODH rates increasing with Mo surface density up to a certain point. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo-O strength, with stronger bonds showing lower ODH activity. The activation of ethane CH bonds forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates. Alkali additives affect the structure of MoOx domains, influencing their electronic and catalytic properties, and can inhibit the reduction of MoOx, affecting the CH bond activation step and leading to higher selectivity to propylene.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a significant reaction, but it faces the challenge that the oxidation of the alkene product is often faster than the starting alkane, necessitating low conversions to achieve high selectivities. ODH can be performed on various bulk metal oxides, such as V2O5, but these yield low results per pass. Supported systems, on the other hand, offer higher activity and selectivity. Among the investigated systems, MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO show relatively high selectivities. The CH bond activation is identified as the rate-determining step in all cases. ODH, especially of ethane, requires high temperatures, where homogeneous gas phase reactions can dominate. CH bond activation is proposed to lead to Malkyl intermediates, which decompose to 1-alkenes through β-H abstraction. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is also proposed. The selectivity between dehydrogenation and the formation of oxygenated products is correlated with the distance between sites, highlighting the importance of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an attractive process for producing alkenes, especially for converting ethane to ethene at low temperatures. A metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active and selective than other mixed-metal oxides. The ODH of propane to propylene is also of interest, and niobium oxide shows high selectivity, although conversion is low. Adding elements like V, Cr, and Mo to niobium oxide can improve its activity without affecting selectivity. The selectivity of vanadium sites in VNbO catalysts is enhanced by niobium neighbors, as niobium is harder to reduce than vanadium, which improves selectivity by preventing facile reduction that can lead to low selectivity.

The document discusses the use of lithium-promoted magnesium oxide as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen. The catalyst was effective in producing ethane and ethylene with high selectivity at relatively high conversions. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of methyl radicals through the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from methane by [Li'O-] centers on the catalyst surface. The coupling of two methyl radicals leads to the formation of ethane, which can be further oxidized to ethylene. The selectivity for C2 products and the conversion of methane both increased with increasing reaction temperature up to about 700°C. Low surface areas favored high C2 selectivities due to the dominant pathway of reacting CH3. with surface O2- ions leading to undesirable products of CO and CO2. The Li/MgO system is a new type of oxidation catalyst that does not contain metal ions with variable oxidation states.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are related to the complex nature of the reaction mechanisms, which include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by allowing for the stabilization of specific active sites that favor desired reactions over undesired side reactions. The size of the active sites, as well as their electronic and geometric properties, significantly impact the selectivity and conversion rates in ODH reactions.

The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts. The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical. High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions. A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed. Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts. These factors collectively influence the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The CuTh oxide catalysts, with different Cu/Th atomic ratios, have been studied extensively using EPR technique, revealing the presence of copper(II) ion pairs and substitutional surface sites. The catalytic activity for ODH increases with the copper concentration in thoria, while the selectivity in ethylene and propene changes with the copper content, peaking at specific ratios before decreasing. The conversion of ethane is more significant at higher copper contents, suggesting the role of CuO crystallites, which may inhibit the formation of ethylene. The selectivity in ethylene is correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by specific signals. For propane, the catalytic activity is attributed to Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface, while the selectivity in propene is due to Cu 2+ ions in substitutional sites. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, with site isolation playing a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the distribution and nature of active sites.

The document discusses the oxidative coupling of methane, which involves similar concepts to ODH. The best catalysts for oxidative coupling provide 20% methane conversion with 80% combined ethane and ethylene selectivity in a single pass through the reactor. The mechanism involves the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface and free-radical chemistry in the gas phase. Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of surface-generated CH3 radicals in the gas phase. The yield of C2H4 and C2H6 is limited by secondary reactions of CH3 radicals with the surface and further oxidation of C2H4, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. Several of the better oxidative coupling catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane, and in each case, the catalyst has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The initial activation step for both CH4 and C2H6 is believed to be the same - the formation of alkyl radicals. The C2H5 radicals have been identified with the MIESR system. The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of O2, reaction (11) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2. For CH3 radicals, there is no analogous route to the formation of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C2H4 from the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from oxidative coupling of CH4. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions, a C2H4 selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C2H6 conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%. Moreover, because the C-H bond strength in C2H6 (422 kJ mol-1) is less than that in CH4 (439 kJ mol-1), the rates of reaction are substantially greater with C2H6.

The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, or the proposed reaction mechanisms. However, it does discuss the role of high-valence d0 transition metal oxides in the selective oxidation of lower alkanes, emphasizing the importance of the OH bond strength in determining the reactivity of a metal oxide. The study reveals that the reactivity of metal oxides is influenced by the energy gap between their valence and conductive bands, which is related to their ability to transfer electrons from the lattice oxygens to the metal centers. This finding suggests that the efficiency of the ODH process can be improved by optimizing the electronic properties of the catalysts, particularly the strength of the MO bond, which must be of intermediate strength to carry out selective oxidation catalysis. Site isolation may play a role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts is discussed, identifying the elementary steps and their reversibility. Propene is the most abundant primary product, and CO and CO2 are formed via either secondary combustion of propene or direct combustion of propane. Steps involving CH bond activation are irreversible, and normal kinetic isotopic effects were measured for propane dehydrogenation, propane combustion, and propene combustion. OH recombination steps are reversible and quasi-equilibrated. The proposed reaction mechanism is consistent with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, where two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of CH bonds in propane. The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene, and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers. The reduced Mo centers finally reoxidize by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2.

The literature discusses the dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica models, exploring the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. The study focuses on a reaction mechanism consisting of three main steps: (1) C-H activation of ethane according to σ-bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. The influence of the local structure of the chromium surface sites on the reaction mechanism is also explored. The literature suggests that the mechanism of dehydrogenation is sensitive to the local structure about chromium, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

Metal molybdates, particularly NiMoO4 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4, show promise for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The molybdenum content significantly influences catalytic activity and product yields. Binary NiCo molybdates offer a stable catalytic system for further optimization. The addition of redox elements like V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances activity, with Cr showing potential for retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions. The NiCo molybdate system is an alternative to V-based catalysts for light paraffin activation and holds promise for direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor.

The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the role of surface-generated gas-phase radicals in catalytic reactions, which may be relevant to ODH processes. The presence of these radicals can influence reaction pathways and product selectivity. Catalyst design, including the use of supported systems and site isolation, can help control radical formation and improve selectivity by limiting unwanted side reactions. Site isolation may help in controlling radical-radical interactions, potentially improving selectivity. Catalyst design, including the use of supported systems, can affect the distribution of active sites and thus impact selectivity. Site isolation can help to prevent undesired side reactions by limiting the availability of reactive sites for certain intermediates.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the mechanism of CH activation by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation over Cr(III)silica surface sites. The mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III) and the doublet spin potential energy surface of Cr(V). The ethylhydridochromium(V) complex formed is unstable with respect to the back-reaction, and β-hydrogen transfer must take place in the extension of the CH activation step to complete the catalytic cycle. The computed activation energy for this mechanism is high, around 220 kJ mol-1, making CH activation by oxidative addition an unlikely mechanism for dehydrogenation in this system. Site isolation is not explicitly discussed, but the literature does compare the reactivity of different Cr(III)silica surface sites, including those with two and three oxygen bridges to the silica surface.

The literature does not provide detailed analysis on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that vanadium-based catalysts generally outperform other metal-containing catalysts for propane ODH. The literature also highlights the importance of high surface areas and homogeneities in catalysts for improved performance in heterogeneous processes. Site isolation is suggested to play a role in controlling the structures of catalytic sites, which can influence selectivity. The use of the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method can produce catalysts with high surface areas and homogeneities, which can improve the performance of propane ODH catalysts. Site isolation is also mentioned as an important factor in catalysis, and the TMP method can provide control over the structures of isolated catalytic sites. Site isolation is mentioned as a strategy to introduce isolated catalytic centers onto the surface of an oxide support, which can lead to improved control over the structure of the catalytic site and the generation of site-isolated catalysts. Site isolation is also mentioned as a key factor in the reactivities of some materials, such as bimetallic oxides and catalyst support interfaces, where the spatial arrangement of metal atoms on a catalyst surface is crucial for defining reactivity. The support materials Al2O3, ZrO2, and MgO have been examined. Site isolation is mentioned as a key factor in the reactivities of well-defined iron sites for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons.

The review discusses the catalytic conversion of n-butane by oxidative dehydrogenation as an alternative to direct dehydrogenation, focusing on catalytic systems, kinetic studies, and proposed reaction mechanisms. Special attention is given to the hydrocarbon activation process and factors governing catalytic efficiency. The review covers unsupported catalysts, supported catalysts, and promoters. Catalyst composition, operating conditions, reducibility, oxygen reactivity and availability, nature of oxygen species, electrical conductivity, surface basicity, and other factors are discussed. The nature of active and selective sites is also explored. Kinetic studies and reaction mechanisms are analyzed in detail. Conclusions and future trends are summarized.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that poses significant challenges to both industrial and academic researchers in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Efficient catalysts, such as VPO or VSbO-based systems, have been developed to overcome the activation step of alkanes, which is crucial for the process. However, achieving high selectivity and conversion remains difficult due to the multitude of possible reaction pathways and steps that occur simultaneously on the adsorbed phase without desorption. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes, but no single mechanism stands out as universally applicable. The goal is to propose a common activation site for several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation. The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule corresponds to an oxidative dehydrogenation. Different mechanisms have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties like strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species. The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, and their presence in oxidation catalysts should be related to structure defects. The dynamic nature of a catalytic oxide surface suggests that the concept of localized active sites should be taken with caution. A complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate encompassing the dynamics of the surface and the adsorbed species, as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid. Electrical conductivity measurements can provide information on the existence of oxidizing species and the nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reactions, characterizing the structure defects and helping to identify the active oxygen species. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by stabilizing active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, which can be measured by observing the effects of residence time on the formation rates of alkenes and COx. The catalytic turnovers for ODH of MoOx and VOx proceed through reduction-oxidation cycles, involving the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms. Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which activates the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms. The catalytic sequence requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation. The ability of oxide domains to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO, leads to significant catalytic consequences. Larger domains have lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity, which increases their ability to accept electrons. This is consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates increase with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy. The reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become more able to accept electron density and stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps. Higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, decreasing turnover rates. Similar trends have been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, ethane, and oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains, and on more reducible RuOx domains. Stoichiometric reduction rates increase with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities, consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates. The UV-visible absorption edge energy decreases as the energy level of the LUMO decreases and as the electron affinity of the cluster increases. Quantum confinement effects, imposed by the size and electronic isolation of oxide domains, can be used to design materials with electronic properties and catalytic functions controlled by properties other than chemical composition.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves the examination of the effect of cation identity on ODH pathways using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the reaction rates decrease in this sequence. The relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend on CH bond energy differences and the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+). Other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acidbase properties of active oxides and supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions requires the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. The greater reactivity of propene arises because the weakest CH bond in propane is stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene. The limited kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides suggests a similar reaction mechanism. The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species. The apparent activation energy for propene combustion is lower than for propene dehydrogenation, leading to a decrease in the k3/k1 ratio and an increase in propene yields as temperature increases. The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios. The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations. The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2). Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility are essential requirements for selective ODH, consistent with the trends in ODH rates and k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts.

The partial oxidation of methane to produce more useful chemicals like methanol, ethylene, and benzene has been widely studied, but the yields of these products have been low. In some processes, N2O is used as the oxidant instead of O2. Recent research in our lab has shown that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has a high capacity for hydrogen abstraction from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals. This indicates that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are generated by the coupling of two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst. We have achieved high yields of C2 compounds from CH4 conversion under conventional catalytic conditions.

The activation of alkanes is more difficult than that of the corresponding unsaturated hydrocarbons, but their large reserves highlight the economic interest in their conversion. The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate paraffins, thus limiting selectivity. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of water in the reaction feed decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen-containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The choice of catalyst is influenced by the nature of the alkane, with different catalysts being more effective for different alkanes. The reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and conversion of the process. Site isolation can help address selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products. The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the specific features of each alkane. Acid-base properties, type of oxygen, and the presence of promoters can also impact the performance of the ODH reaction.

The surface chemistry of supported chromium (Cr) on amorphous surfaces or molecular sieves is quite similar. Supported Cr ions are highly reactive and mobile, interacting with various molecules like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water. The redox behavior of supported Cr ions is influenced by the type and composition of the support, with Cr ions being easier to reduce on chemically softer supports. The oxide support acts as a ligand, controlling the redox properties of the supported Cr ions. Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ can be present, with their coordination and polymerization degrees depending on the support type and composition. Higher Cr loadings and lower surface areas tend to favor the formation of polychromates. After calcination, chromium oxides are anchored onto the surface through reactions with hydroxyl groups, and their molecular structure is determined by the support composition, Cr loading, and treatment conditions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is influenced by the acid-base character of the metal oxide support, which affects the dispersion of vanadium on the surface and the nature of the vanadium species. The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species, as well as the acid-base character of catalysts, are crucial for the catalytic properties in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. Tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. The coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites, play a significant role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. These factors are essential for developing selective catalysts in ODH reactions. Supported metal oxides offer advantages such as higher mechanical strength, better thermal stability, and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is influenced by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. Mixing or supporting vanadium oxide on other metal oxides can enhance the selectivity of bulk V2O5 in the ODH of short chain alkanes, increasing the formation rate of desired olefins. Vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO) and V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides have shown high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane, propane, and ethane. V-containing molecular sieves have also shown high selectivity for oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidation of ethane and propane. Despite the study of various catalytic systems, the nature of the active and selective sites in the ODH of short chain alkanes is still under discussion. The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species, which can affect its redox properties. Monolayer systems have been studied to optimize the dispersion of active sites and understand the influence of the support. The nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. However, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under investigation. The aim of the paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts and understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to the catalysts used. Supported metal oxide catalysts, for instance, are affected by the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. Selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, and secondary surface metal oxide additives can enhance propane activation to propylene. Incorporating high vanadium contents in hosting structures can sometimes lead to structural instability. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 is crucial for high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, with propane ODH rates increasing with Mo surface density up to a certain point. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo-O strength, with stronger bonds showing lower ODH activity. The activation of ethane CH bonds forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates. Alkali additives affect the structure of MoOx domains, influencing their electronic and catalytic properties, and can inhibit the reduction of MoOx, affecting the CH bond activation step and leading to higher selectivity to propylene.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a significant reaction, but it faces the challenge that the oxidation of the alkene product is often faster than the starting alkane, necessitating low conversions to achieve high selectivities. ODH can be performed on various bulk metal oxides, such as V2O5, but these yield low results per pass. Supported systems, on the other hand, offer higher activity and selectivity. Among the investigated systems, MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO show relatively high selectivities. The CH bond activation is identified as the rate-determining step in all cases. ODH, especially of ethane, requires high temperatures, where homogeneous gas phase reactions can dominate. CH bond activation is proposed to lead to Malkyl intermediates, which decompose to 1-alkenes through β-H abstraction. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is also proposed. The selectivity between dehydrogenation and the formation of oxygenated products is correlated with the distance between sites, highlighting the importance of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an attractive process for producing alkenes, especially for converting ethane to ethene at low temperatures. A metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active and selective than other mixed-metal oxides. The ODH of propane to propylene is also of interest, and niobium oxide shows high selectivity, although conversion is low. Adding elements like V, Cr, and Mo to niobium oxide can improve its activity without affecting selectivity. The selectivity of vanadium sites in VNbO catalysts is enhanced by niobium neighbors, as niobium is harder to reduce than vanadium, which improves selectivity by preventing facile reduction that can lead to low selectivity.

The document discusses the use of lithium-promoted magnesium oxide as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen. The catalyst was effective in producing ethane and ethylene with high selectivity at relatively high conversions. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of methyl radicals through the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from methane by [Li'O-] centers on the catalyst surface. The coupling of two methyl radicals leads to the formation of ethane, which can be further oxidized to ethylene. The selectivity for C2 products and the conversion of methane both increased with increasing reaction temperature up to about 700°C. Low surface areas favored high C2 selectivities due to the dominant pathway of reacting CH3. with surface O2- ions leading to undesirable products of CO and CO2. The Li/MgO system is a new type of oxidation catalyst that does not contain metal ions with variable oxidation states.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are related to the complex nature of the reaction mechanisms, which include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by allowing for the stabilization of specific active sites that favor desired reactions over undesired side reactions. The size of the active sites, as well as their electronic and geometric properties, significantly impact the selectivity and conversion rates in ODH reactions.

The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts. The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical. High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions. A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed. Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts. These factors collectively influence the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The CuTh oxide catalysts, with different Cu/Th atomic ratios, have been studied extensively using EPR technique, revealing the presence of copper(II) ion pairs and substitutional surface sites. The catalytic activity for ODH increases with the copper concentration in thoria, while the selectivity in ethylene and propene changes with the copper content, peaking at specific ratios before decreasing. The conversion of ethane is more significant at higher copper contents, suggesting the role of CuO crystallites, which may inhibit the formation of ethylene. The selectivity in ethylene is correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by specific signals. For propane, the catalytic activity is attributed to Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface, while the selectivity in propene is due to Cu 2+ ions in substitutional sites. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, with site isolation playing a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the distribution and nature of active sites.

The document discusses the oxidative coupling of methane, which involves similar concepts to ODH. The best catalysts for oxidative coupling provide 20% methane conversion with 80% combined ethane and ethylene selectivity in a single pass through the reactor. The mechanism involves the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface and free-radical chemistry in the gas phase. Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of surface-generated CH3 radicals in the gas phase. The yield of C2H4 and C2H6 is limited by secondary reactions of CH3 radicals with the surface and further oxidation of C2H4, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. Several of the better oxidative coupling catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane, and in each case, the catalyst has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The initial activation step for both CH4 and C2H6 is believed to be the same - the formation of alkyl radicals. The C2H5 radicals have been identified with the MIESR system. The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of O2, reaction (11) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2. For CH3 radicals, there is no analogous route to the formation of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C2H4 from the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from oxidative coupling of CH4. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions, a C2H4 selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C2H6 conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%. Moreover, because the C-H bond strength in C2H6 (422 kJ mol-1) is less than that in CH4 (439 kJ mol-1), the rates of reaction are substantially greater with C2H6.

The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, or the proposed reaction mechanisms. However, it does discuss the role of high-valence d0 transition metal oxides in the selective oxidation of lower alkanes, emphasizing the importance of the OH bond strength in determining the reactivity of a metal oxide. The study reveals that the reactivity of metal oxides is influenced by the energy gap between their valence and conductive bands, which is related to their ability to transfer electrons from the lattice oxygens to the metal centers. This finding suggests that the efficiency of the ODH process can be improved by optimizing the electronic properties of the catalysts, particularly the strength of the MO bond, which must be of intermediate strength to carry out selective oxidation catalysis. Site isolation may play a role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts is discussed, identifying the elementary steps and their reversibility. Propene is the most abundant primary product, and CO and CO2 are formed via either secondary combustion of propene or direct combustion of propane. Steps involving CH bond activation are irreversible, and normal kinetic isotopic effects were measured for propane dehydrogenation, propane combustion, and propene combustion. OH recombination steps are reversible and quasi-equilibrated. The proposed reaction mechanism is consistent with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, where two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of CH bonds in propane. The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene, and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers. The reduced Mo centers finally reoxidize by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2.

The literature discusses the dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica models, exploring the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. The study focuses on a reaction mechanism consisting of three main steps: (1) C-H activation of ethane according to σ-bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. The influence of the local structure of the chromium surface sites on the reaction mechanism is also explored. The literature suggests that the mechanism of dehydrogenation is sensitive to the local structure about chromium, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

Metal molybdates, particularly NiMoO4 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4, show promise for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The molybdenum content significantly influences catalytic activity and product yields. Binary NiCo molybdates offer a stable catalytic system for further optimization. The addition of redox elements like V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances activity, with Cr showing potential for retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions. The NiCo molybdate system is an alternative to V-based catalysts for light paraffin activation and holds promise for direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor.

The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the role of surface-generated gas-phase radicals in catalytic reactions, which may be relevant to ODH processes. The presence of these radicals can influence reaction pathways and product selectivity. Catalyst design, including the use of supported systems and site isolation, can help control radical formation and improve selectivity by limiting unwanted side reactions. Site isolation may help in controlling radical-radical interactions, potentially improving selectivity. Catalyst design, including the use of supported systems, can affect the distribution of active sites and thus impact selectivity. Site isolation can help to prevent undesired side reactions by limiting the availability of reactive sites for certain intermediates.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the mechanism of CH activation by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation over Cr(III)silica surface sites. The mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III) and the doublet spin potential energy surface of Cr(V). The ethylhydridochromium(V) complex formed is unstable with respect to the back-reaction, and β-hydrogen transfer must take place in the extension of the CH activation step to complete the catalytic cycle. The computed activation energy for this mechanism is high, around 220 kJ mol-1, making CH activation by oxidative addition an unlikely mechanism for dehydrogenation in this system. Site isolation is not explicitly discussed, but the literature does compare the reactivity of different Cr(III)silica surface sites, including those with two and three oxygen bridges to the silica surface.

The literature does not provide detailed analysis on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that vanadium-based catalysts generally outperform other metal-containing catalysts for propane ODH. The literature also highlights the importance of high surface areas and homogeneities in catalysts for improved performance in heterogeneous processes. Site isolation is suggested to play a role in controlling the structures of catalytic sites, which can influence selectivity. The use of the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method can produce catalysts with high surface areas and homogeneities, which can improve the performance of propane ODH catalysts. Site isolation is also mentioned as an important factor in catalysis, and the TMP method can provide control over the structures of isolated catalytic sites. Site isolation is mentioned as a strategy to introduce isolated catalytic centers onto the surface of an oxide support, which can lead to improved control over the structure of the catalytic site and the generation of site-isolated catalysts. Site isolation is also mentioned as a key factor in the reactivities of some materials, such as bimetallic oxides and catalyst support interfaces, where the spatial arrangement of metal atoms on a catalyst surface is crucial for defining reactivity. The support materials Al2O3, ZrO2, and MgO have been examined. Site isolation is mentioned as a key factor in the reactivities of well-defined iron sites for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons.

The review discusses the catalytic conversion of n-butane by oxidative dehydrogenation as an alternative to direct dehydrogenation, focusing on catalytic systems, kinetic studies, and proposed reaction mechanisms. Special attention is given to the hydrocarbon activation process and factors governing catalytic efficiency. The review covers unsupported catalysts, supported catalysts, and promoters. Catalyst composition, operating conditions, reducibility, oxygen reactivity and availability, nature of oxygen species, electrical conductivity, surface basicity, and other factors are discussed. The nature of active and selective sites is also explored. Kinetic studies and reaction mechanisms are analyzed in detail. Conclusions and future trends are summarized.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that poses significant challenges to both industrial and academic researchers in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Efficient catalysts, such as VPO or VSbO-based systems, have been developed to overcome the activation step of alkanes, which is crucial for the process. However, achieving high selectivity and conversion remains difficult due to the multitude of possible reaction pathways and steps that occur simultaneously on the adsorbed phase without desorption. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes, but no single mechanism stands out as universally applicable. The goal is to propose a common activation site for several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation. The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule corresponds to an oxidative dehydrogenation. Different mechanisms have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties like strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species. The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, and their presence in oxidation catalysts should be related to structure defects. The dynamic nature of a catalytic oxide surface suggests that the concept of localized active sites should be taken with caution. A complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate encompassing the dynamics of the surface and the adsorbed species, as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid. Electrical conductivity measurements can provide information on the existence of oxidizing species and the nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reactions, characterizing the structure defects and helping to identify the active oxygen species. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by stabilizing active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, which can be measured by observing the effects of residence time on the formation rates of alkenes and COx. The catalytic turnovers for ODH of MoOx and VOx proceed through reduction-oxidation cycles, involving the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms. Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which activates the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms. The catalytic sequence requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation. The ability of oxide domains to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO, leads to significant catalytic consequences. Larger domains have lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity, which increases their ability to accept electrons. This is consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates increase with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy. The reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become more able to accept electron density and stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps. Higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, decreasing turnover rates. Similar trends have been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, ethane, and oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains, and on more reducible RuOx domains. Stoichiometric reduction rates increase with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities, consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates. The UV-visible absorption edge energy decreases as the energy level of the LUMO decreases and as the electron affinity of the cluster increases. Quantum confinement effects, imposed by the size and electronic isolation of oxide domains, can be used to design materials with electronic properties and catalytic functions controlled by properties other than chemical composition.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves the examination of the effect of cation identity on ODH pathways using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the reaction rates decrease in this sequence. The relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend on CH bond energy differences and the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+). Other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acidbase properties of active oxides and supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions requires the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. The greater reactivity of propene arises because the weakest CH bond in propane is stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene. The limited kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides suggests a similar reaction mechanism. The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species. The apparent activation energy for propene combustion is lower than for propene dehydrogenation, leading to a decrease in the k3/k1 ratio and an increase in propene yields as temperature increases. The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios. The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations. The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2). Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility are essential requirements for selective ODH, consistent with the trends in ODH rates and k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts.

The partial oxidation of methane to produce more useful chemicals like methanol, ethylene, and benzene has been widely studied, but the yields of these products have been low. In some processes, N2O is used as the oxidant instead of O2. Recent research in our lab has shown that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has a high capacity for hydrogen abstraction from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals. This indicates that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are generated by the coupling of two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst. We have achieved high yields of C2 compounds from CH4 conversion under conventional catalytic conditions.

The activation of alkanes is more difficult than that of the corresponding unsaturated hydrocarbons, but their large reserves highlight the economic interest in their conversion. The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate paraffins, thus limiting selectivity. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of water in the reaction feed decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen-containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The choice of catalyst is influenced by the nature of the alkane, with different catalysts being more effective for different alkanes. The reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and conversion of the process. Site isolation can help address selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products. The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the specific features of each alkane. Acid-base properties, type of oxygen, and the presence of promoters can also impact the performance of the ODH reaction.

The surface chemistry of supported chromium (Cr) on amorphous surfaces or molecular sieves is quite similar. Supported Cr ions are highly reactive and mobile, interacting with various molecules like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water. The redox behavior of supported Cr ions is influenced by the type and composition of the support, with Cr ions being easier to reduce on chemically softer supports. The oxide support acts as a ligand, controlling the redox properties of the supported Cr ions. Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ can be present, with their coordination and polymerization degrees depending on the support type and composition. Higher Cr loadings and lower surface areas tend to favor the formation of polychromates. After calcination, chromium oxides are anchored onto the surface through reactions with hydroxyl groups, and their molecular structure is determined by the support composition, Cr loading, and treatment conditions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is influenced by the acid-base character of the metal oxide support, which affects the dispersion of vanadium on the surface and the nature of the vanadium species. The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species, as well as the acid-base character of catalysts, are crucial for the catalytic properties in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. Tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. The coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites, play a significant role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. These factors are essential for developing selective catalysts in ODH reactions. Supported metal oxides offer advantages such as higher mechanical strength, better thermal stability, and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is influenced by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. Mixing or supporting vanadium oxide on other metal oxides can enhance the selectivity of bulk V2O5 in the ODH of short chain alkanes, increasing the formation rate of desired olefins. Vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO) and V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides have shown high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane, propane, and ethane. V-containing molecular sieves have also shown high selectivity for oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidation of ethane and propane. Despite the study of various catalytic systems, the nature of the active and selective sites in the ODH of short chain alkanes is still under discussion. The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species, which can affect its redox properties. Monolayer systems have been studied to optimize the dispersion of active sites and understand the influence of the support. The nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. However, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under investigation. The aim of the paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts and understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to the catalysts used. Supported metal oxide catalysts, for instance, are affected by the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. Selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, and secondary surface metal oxide additives can enhance propane activation to propylene. Incorporating high vanadium contents in hosting structures can sometimes lead to structural instability. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 is crucial for high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, with propane ODH rates increasing with Mo surface density up to a certain point. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo-O strength, with stronger bonds showing lower ODH activity. The activation of ethane CH bonds forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates. Alkali additives affect the structure of MoOx domains, influencing their electronic and catalytic properties, and can inhibit the reduction of MoOx, affecting the CH bond activation step and leading to higher selectivity to propylene.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a significant reaction, but it faces the challenge that the oxidation of the alkene product is often faster than the starting alkane, necessitating low conversions to achieve high selectivities. ODH can be performed on various bulk metal oxides, such as V2O5, but these yield low results per pass. Supported systems, on the other hand, offer higher activity and selectivity. Among the investigated systems, MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO show relatively high selectivities. The CH bond activation is identified as the rate-determining step in all cases. ODH, especially of ethane, requires high temperatures, where homogeneous gas phase reactions can dominate. CH bond activation is proposed to lead to Malkyl intermediates, which decompose to 1-alkenes through β-H abstraction. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is also proposed. The selectivity between dehydrogenation and the formation of oxygenated products is correlated with the distance between sites, highlighting the importance of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an attractive process for producing alkenes, especially for converting ethane to ethene at low temperatures. A metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active and selective than other mixed-metal oxides. The ODH of propane to propylene is also of interest, and niobium oxide shows high selectivity, although conversion is low. Adding elements like V, Cr, and Mo to niobium oxide can improve its activity without affecting selectivity. The selectivity of vanadium sites in VNbO catalysts is enhanced by niobium neighbors, as niobium is harder to reduce than vanadium, which improves selectivity by preventing facile reduction that can lead to low selectivity.

The document discusses the use of lithium-promoted magnesium oxide as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen. The catalyst was effective in producing ethane and ethylene with high selectivity at relatively high conversions. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of methyl radicals through the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from methane by [Li'O-] centers on the catalyst surface. The coupling of two methyl radicals leads to the formation of ethane, which can be further oxidized to ethylene. The selectivity for C2 products and the conversion of methane both increased with increasing reaction temperature up to about 700°C. Low surface areas favored high C2 selectivities due to the dominant pathway of reacting CH3. with surface O2- ions leading to undesirable products of CO and CO2. The Li/MgO system is a new type of oxidation catalyst that does not contain metal ions with variable oxidation states.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are related to the complex nature of the reaction mechanisms, which include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by allowing for the stabilization of specific active sites that favor desired reactions over undesired side reactions. The size of the active sites, as well as their electronic and geometric properties, significantly impact the selectivity and conversion rates in ODH reactions.

The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts. The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical. High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions. A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed. Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts. These factors collectively influence the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The CuTh oxide catalysts, with different Cu/Th atomic ratios, have been studied extensively using EPR technique, revealing the presence of copper(II) ion pairs and substitutional surface sites. The catalytic activity for ODH increases with the copper concentration in thoria, while the selectivity in ethylene and propene changes with the copper content, peaking at specific ratios before decreasing. The conversion of ethane is more significant at higher copper contents, suggesting the role of CuO crystallites, which may inhibit the formation of ethylene. The selectivity in ethylene is correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by specific signals. For propane, the catalytic activity is attributed to Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface, while the selectivity in propene is due to Cu 2+ ions in substitutional sites. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, with site isolation playing a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the distribution and nature of active sites.

The document discusses the oxidative coupling of methane, which involves similar concepts to ODH. The best catalysts for oxidative coupling provide 20% methane conversion with 80% combined ethane and ethylene selectivity in a single pass through the reactor. The mechanism involves the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface and free-radical chemistry in the gas phase. Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of surface-generated CH3 radicals in the gas phase. The yield of C2H4 and C2H6 is limited by secondary reactions of CH3 radicals with the surface and further oxidation of C2H4, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. Several of the better oxidative coupling catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane, and in each case, the catalyst has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The initial activation step for both CH4 and C2H6 is believed to be the same - the formation of alkyl radicals. The C2H5 radicals have been identified with the MIESR system. The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of O2, reaction (11) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2. For CH3 radicals, there is no analogous route to the formation of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C2H4 from the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from oxidative coupling of CH4. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions, a C2H4 selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C2H6 conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%. Moreover, because the C-H bond strength in C2H6 (422 kJ mol-1) is less than that in CH4 (439 kJ mol-1), the rates of reaction are substantially greater with C2H6.

The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, or the proposed reaction mechanisms. However, it does discuss the role of high-valence d0 transition metal oxides in the selective oxidation of lower alkanes, emphasizing the importance of the OH bond strength in determining the reactivity of a metal oxide. The study reveals that the reactivity of metal oxides is influenced by the energy gap between their valence and conductive bands, which is related to their ability to transfer electrons from the lattice oxygens to the metal centers. This finding suggests that the efficiency of the ODH process can be improved by optimizing the electronic properties of the catalysts, particularly the strength of the MO bond, which must be of intermediate strength to carry out selective oxidation catalysis. Site isolation may play a role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts is discussed, identifying the elementary steps and their reversibility. Propene is the most abundant primary product, and CO and CO2 are formed via either secondary combustion of propene or direct combustion of propane. Steps involving CH bond activation are irreversible, and normal kinetic isotopic effects were measured for propane dehydrogenation, propane combustion, and propene combustion. OH recombination steps are reversible and quasi-equilibrated. The proposed reaction mechanism is consistent with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, where two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of CH bonds in propane. The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene, and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers. The reduced Mo centers finally reoxidize by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2.

The literature discusses the dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica models, exploring the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. The study focuses on a reaction mechanism consisting of three main steps: (1) C-H activation of ethane according to σ-bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. The influence of the local structure of the chromium surface sites on the reaction mechanism is also explored. The literature suggests that the mechanism of dehydrogenation is sensitive to the local structure about chromium, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

Metal molybdates, particularly NiMoO4 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4, show promise for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The molybdenum content significantly influences catalytic activity and product yields. Binary NiCo molybdates offer a stable catalytic system for further optimization. The addition of redox elements like V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances activity, with Cr showing potential for retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions. The NiCo molybdate system is an alternative to V-based catalysts for light paraffin activation and holds promise for direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor.

The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the role of surface-generated gas-phase radicals in catalytic reactions, which may be relevant to ODH processes. The presence of these radicals can influence reaction pathways and product selectivity. Catalyst design, including the use of supported systems and site isolation, can help control radical formation and improve selectivity by limiting unwanted side reactions. Site isolation may help in controlling radical-radical interactions, potentially improving selectivity. Catalyst design, including the use of supported systems, can affect the distribution of active sites and thus impact selectivity. Site isolation can help to prevent undesired side reactions by limiting the availability of reactive sites for certain intermediates.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the mechanism of CH activation by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation over Cr(III)silica surface sites. The mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III) and the doublet spin potential energy surface of Cr(V). The ethylhydridochromium(V) complex formed is unstable with respect to the back-reaction, and β-hydrogen transfer must take place in the extension of the CH activation step to complete the catalytic cycle. The computed activation energy for this mechanism is high, around 220 kJ mol-1, making CH activation by oxidative addition an unlikely mechanism for dehydrogenation in this system. Site isolation is not explicitly discussed, but the literature does compare the reactivity of different Cr(III)silica surface sites, including those with two and three oxygen bridges to the silica surface.

The literature does not provide detailed analysis on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that vanadium-based catalysts generally outperform other metal-containing catalysts for propane ODH. The literature also highlights the importance of high surface areas and homogeneities in catalysts for improved performance in heterogeneous processes. Site isolation is suggested to play a role in controlling the structures of catalytic sites, which can influence selectivity. The use of the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method can produce catalysts with high surface areas and homogeneities, which can improve the performance of propane ODH catalysts. Site isolation is also mentioned as an important factor in catalysis, and the TMP method can provide control over the structures of isolated catalytic sites. Site isolation is mentioned as a strategy to introduce isolated catalytic centers onto the surface of an oxide support, which can lead to improved control over the structure of the catalytic site and the generation of site-isolated catalysts. Site isolation is also mentioned as a key factor in the reactivities of some materials, such as bimetallic oxides and catalyst support interfaces, where the spatial arrangement of metal atoms on a catalyst surface is crucial for defining reactivity. The support materials Al2O3, ZrO2, and MgO have been examined. Site isolation is mentioned as a key factor in the reactivities of well-defined iron sites for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons.

The review discusses the catalytic conversion of n-butane by oxidative dehydrogenation as an alternative to direct dehydrogenation, focusing on catalytic systems, kinetic studies, and proposed reaction mechanisms. Special attention is given to the hydrocarbon activation process and factors governing catalytic efficiency. The review covers unsupported catalysts, supported catalysts, and promoters. Catalyst composition, operating conditions, reducibility, oxygen reactivity and availability, nature of oxygen species, electrical conductivity, surface basicity, and other factors are discussed. The nature of active and selective sites is also explored. Kinetic studies and reaction mechanisms are analyzed in detail. Conclusions and future trends are summarized.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that poses significant challenges to both industrial and academic researchers in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Efficient catalysts, such as VPO or VSbO-based systems, have been developed to overcome the activation step of alkanes, which is crucial for the process. However, achieving high selectivity and conversion remains difficult due to the multitude of possible reaction pathways and steps that occur simultaneously on the adsorbed phase without desorption. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes, but no single mechanism stands out as universally applicable. The goal is to propose a common activation site for several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation. The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule corresponds to an oxidative dehydrogenation. Different mechanisms have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties like strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species. The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, and their presence in oxidation catalysts should be related to structure defects. The dynamic nature of a catalytic oxide surface suggests that the concept of localized active sites should be taken with caution. A complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate encompassing the dynamics of the surface and the adsorbed species, as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid. Electrical conductivity measurements can provide information on the existence of oxidizing species and the nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reactions, characterizing the structure defects and helping to identify the active oxygen species. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by stabilizing active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, which can be measured by observing the effects of residence time on the formation rates of alkenes and COx. The catalytic turnovers for ODH of MoOx and VOx proceed through reduction-oxidation cycles, involving the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms. Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which activates the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms. The catalytic sequence requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation. The ability of oxide domains to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO, leads to significant catalytic consequences. Larger domains have lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity, which increases their ability to accept electrons. This is consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates increase with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy. The reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become more able to accept electron density and stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps. Higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, decreasing turnover rates. Similar trends have been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, ethane, and oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains, and on more reducible RuOx domains. Stoichiometric reduction rates increase with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities, consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates. The UV-visible absorption edge energy decreases as the energy level of the LUMO decreases and as the electron affinity of the cluster increases. Quantum confinement effects, imposed by the size and electronic isolation of oxide domains, can be used to design materials with electronic properties and catalytic functions controlled by properties other than chemical composition.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves the examination of the effect of cation identity on ODH pathways using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the reaction rates decrease in this sequence. The relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend on CH bond energy differences and the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+). Other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acidbase properties of active oxides and supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions requires the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. The greater reactivity of propene arises because the weakest CH bond in propane is stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene. The limited kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides suggests a similar reaction mechanism. The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species. The apparent activation energy for propene combustion is lower than for propene dehydrogenation, leading to a decrease in the k3/k1 ratio and an increase in propene yields as temperature increases. The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios. The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations. The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2). Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility are essential requirements for selective ODH, consistent with the trends in ODH rates and k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts.

The partial oxidation of methane to produce more useful chemicals like methanol, ethylene, and benzene has been widely studied, but the yields of these products have been low. In some processes, N2O is used as the oxidant instead of O2. Recent research in our lab has shown that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has a high capacity for hydrogen abstraction from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals. This indicates that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are generated by the coupling of two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst. We have achieved high yields of C2 compounds from CH4 conversion under conventional catalytic conditions.

The activation of alkanes is more difficult than that of the corresponding unsaturated hydrocarbons, but their large reserves highlight the economic interest in their conversion. The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate paraffins, thus limiting selectivity. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of water in the reaction feed decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen-containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The choice of catalyst is influenced by the nature of the alkane, with different catalysts being more effective for different alkanes. The reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and conversion of the process. Site isolation can help address selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products. The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the specific features of each alkane. Acid-base properties, type of oxygen, and the presence of promoters can also impact the performance of the ODH reaction.

The surface chemistry of supported chromium (Cr) on amorphous surfaces or molecular sieves is quite similar. Supported Cr ions are highly reactive and mobile, interacting with various molecules like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water. The redox behavior of supported Cr ions is influenced by the type and composition of the support, with Cr ions being easier to reduce on chemically softer supports. The oxide support acts as a ligand, controlling the redox properties of the supported Cr ions. Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ can be present, with their coordination and polymerization degrees depending on the support type and composition. Higher Cr loadings and lower surface areas tend to favor the formation of polychromates. After calcination, chromium oxides are anchored onto the surface through reactions with hydroxyl groups, and their molecular structure is determined by the support composition, Cr loading, and treatment conditions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is influenced by the acid-base character of the metal oxide support, which affects the dispersion of vanadium on the surface and the nature of the vanadium species. The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species, as well as the acid-base character of catalysts, are crucial for the catalytic properties in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. Tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. The coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites, play a significant role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. These factors are essential for developing selective catalysts in ODH reactions. Supported metal oxides offer advantages such as higher mechanical strength, better thermal stability, and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is influenced by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. Mixing or supporting vanadium oxide on other metal oxides can enhance the selectivity of bulk V2O5 in the ODH of short chain alkanes, increasing the formation rate of desired olefins. Vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO) and V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides have shown high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane, propane, and ethane. V-containing molecular sieves have also shown high selectivity for oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidation of ethane and propane. Despite the study of various catalytic systems, the nature of the active and selective sites in the ODH of short chain alkanes is still under discussion. The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species, which can affect its redox properties. Monolayer systems have been studied to optimize the dispersion of active sites and understand the influence of the support. The nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. However, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under investigation. The aim of the paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts and understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to the catalysts used. Supported metal oxide catalysts, for instance, are affected by the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. Selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, and secondary surface metal oxide additives can enhance propane activation to propylene. Incorporating high vanadium contents in hosting structures can sometimes lead to structural instability. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 is crucial for high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, with propane ODH rates increasing with Mo surface density up to a certain point. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo-O strength, with stronger bonds showing lower ODH activity. The activation of ethane CH bonds forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates. Alkali additives affect the structure of MoOx domains, influencing their electronic and catalytic properties, and can inhibit the reduction of MoOx, affecting the CH bond activation step and leading to higher selectivity to propylene.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a significant reaction, but it faces the challenge that the oxidation of the alkene product is often faster than the starting alkane, necessitating low conversions to achieve high selectivities. ODH can be performed on various bulk metal oxides, such as V2O5, but these yield low results per pass. Supported systems, on the other hand, offer higher activity and selectivity. Among the investigated systems, MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO show relatively high selectivities. The CH bond activation is identified as the rate-determining step in all cases. ODH, especially of ethane, requires high temperatures, where homogeneous gas phase reactions can dominate. CH bond activation is proposed to lead to Malkyl intermediates, which decompose to 1-alkenes through β-H abstraction. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is also proposed. The selectivity between dehydrogenation and the formation of oxygenated products is correlated with the distance between sites, highlighting the importance of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an attractive process for producing alkenes, especially for converting ethane to ethene at low temperatures. A metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active and selective than other mixed-metal oxides. The ODH of propane to propylene is also of interest, and niobium oxide shows high selectivity, although conversion is low. Adding elements like V, Cr, and Mo to niobium oxide can improve its activity without affecting selectivity. The selectivity of vanadium sites in VNbO catalysts is enhanced by niobium neighbors, as niobium is harder to reduce than vanadium, which improves selectivity by preventing facile reduction that can lead to low selectivity.

The document discusses the use of lithium-promoted magnesium oxide as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen. The catalyst was effective in producing ethane and ethylene with high selectivity at relatively high conversions. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of methyl radicals through the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from methane by [Li'O-] centers on the catalyst surface. The coupling of two methyl radicals leads to the formation of ethane, which can be further oxidized to ethylene. The selectivity for C2 products and the conversion of methane both increased with increasing reaction temperature up to about 700°C. Low surface areas favored high C2 selectivities due to the dominant pathway of reacting CH3. with surface O2- ions leading to undesirable products of CO and CO2. The Li/MgO system is a new type of oxidation catalyst that does not contain metal ions with variable oxidation states.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are related to the complex nature of the reaction mechanisms, which include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by allowing for the stabilization of specific active sites that favor desired reactions over undesired side reactions. The size of the active sites, as well as their electronic and geometric properties, significantly impact the selectivity and conversion rates in ODH reactions.

The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts. The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical. High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions. A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed. Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts. These factors collectively influence the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The CuTh oxide catalysts, with different Cu/Th atomic ratios, have been studied extensively using EPR technique, revealing the presence of copper(II) ion pairs and substitutional surface sites. The catalytic activity for ODH increases with the copper concentration in thoria, while the selectivity in ethylene and propene changes with the copper content, peaking at specific ratios before decreasing. The conversion of ethane is more significant at higher copper contents, suggesting the role of CuO crystallites, which may inhibit the formation of ethylene. The selectivity in ethylene is correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by specific signals. For propane, the catalytic activity is attributed to Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface, while the selectivity in propene is due to Cu 2+ ions in substitutional sites. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, with site isolation playing a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the distribution and nature of active sites.

The document discusses the oxidative coupling of methane, which involves similar concepts to ODH. The best catalysts for oxidative coupling provide 20% methane conversion with 80% combined ethane and ethylene selectivity in a single pass through the reactor. The mechanism involves the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface and free-radical chemistry in the gas phase. Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of surface-generated CH3 radicals in the gas phase. The yield of C2H4 and C2H6 is limited by secondary reactions of CH3 radicals with the surface and further oxidation of C2H4, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. Several of the better oxidative coupling catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane, and in each case, the catalyst has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The initial activation step for both CH4 and C2H6 is believed to be the same - the formation of alkyl radicals. The C2H5 radicals have been identified with the MIESR system. The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of O2, reaction (11) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2. For CH3 radicals, there is no analogous route to the formation of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C2H4 from the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from oxidative coupling of CH4. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions, a C2H4 selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C2H6 conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%. Moreover, because the C-H bond strength in C2H6 (422 kJ mol-1) is less than that in CH4 (439 kJ mol-1), the rates of reaction are substantially greater with C2H6.

The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, or the proposed reaction mechanisms. However, it does discuss the role of high-valence d0 transition metal oxides in the selective oxidation of lower alkanes, emphasizing the importance of the OH bond strength in determining the reactivity of a metal oxide. The study reveals that the reactivity of metal oxides is influenced by the energy gap between their valence and conductive bands, which is related to their ability to transfer electrons from the lattice oxygens to the metal centers. This finding suggests that the efficiency of the ODH process can be improved by optimizing the electronic properties of the catalysts, particularly the strength of the MO bond, which must be of intermediate strength to carry out selective oxidation catalysis. Site isolation may play a role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts is discussed, identifying the elementary steps and their reversibility. Propene is the most abundant primary product, and CO and CO2 are formed via either secondary combustion of propene or direct combustion of propane. Steps involving CH bond activation are irreversible, and normal kinetic isotopic effects were measured for propane dehydrogenation, propane combustion, and propene combustion. OH recombination steps are reversible and quasi-equilibrated. The proposed reaction mechanism is consistent with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, where two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of CH bonds in propane. The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene, and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers. The reduced Mo centers finally reoxidize by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2.

The literature discusses the dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica models, exploring the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. The study focuses on a reaction mechanism consisting of three main steps: (1) C-H activation of ethane according to σ-bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. The influence of the local structure of the chromium surface sites on the reaction mechanism is also explored. The literature suggests that the mechanism of dehydrogenation is sensitive to the local structure about chromium, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

Metal molybdates, particularly NiMoO4 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4, show promise for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The molybdenum content significantly influences catalytic activity and product yields. Binary NiCo molybdates offer a stable catalytic system for further optimization. The addition of redox elements like V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances activity, with Cr showing potential for retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions. The NiCo molybdate system is an alternative to V-based catalysts for light paraffin activation and holds promise for direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor.

The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the role of surface-generated gas-phase radicals in catalytic reactions, which may be relevant to ODH processes. The presence of these radicals can influence reaction pathways and product selectivity. Catalyst design, including the use of supported systems and site isolation, can help control radical formation and improve selectivity by limiting unwanted side reactions. Site isolation may help in controlling radical-radical interactions, potentially improving selectivity. Catalyst design, including the use of supported systems, can affect the distribution of active sites and thus impact selectivity. Site isolation can help to prevent undesired side reactions by limiting the availability of reactive sites for certain intermediates.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the mechanism of CH activation by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation over Cr(III)silica surface sites. The mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III) and the doublet spin potential energy surface of Cr(V). The ethylhydridochromium(V) complex formed is unstable with respect to the back-reaction, and β-hydrogen transfer must take place in the extension of the CH activation step to complete the catalytic cycle. The computed activation energy for this mechanism is high, around 220 kJ mol-1, making CH activation by oxidative addition an unlikely mechanism for dehydrogenation in this system. Site isolation is not explicitly discussed, but the literature does compare the reactivity of different Cr(III)silica surface sites, including those with two and three oxygen bridges to the silica surface.

The literature does not provide detailed analysis on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that vanadium-based catalysts generally outperform other metal-containing catalysts for propane ODH. The literature also highlights the importance of high surface areas and homogeneities in catalysts for improved performance in heterogeneous processes. Site isolation is suggested to play a role in controlling the structures of catalytic sites, which can influence selectivity. The use of the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method can produce catalysts with high surface areas and homogeneities, which can improve the performance of propane ODH catalysts. Site isolation is also mentioned as an important factor in catalysis, and the TMP method can provide control over the structures of isolated catalytic sites. Site isolation is mentioned as a strategy to introduce isolated catalytic centers onto the surface of an oxide support, which can lead to improved control over the structure of the catalytic site and the generation of site-isolated catalysts. Site isolation is also mentioned as a key factor in the reactivities of some materials, such as bimetallic oxides and catalyst support interfaces, where the spatial arrangement of metal atoms on a catalyst surface is crucial for defining reactivity. The support materials Al2O3, ZrO2, and MgO have been examined. Site isolation is mentioned as a key factor in the reactivities of well-defined iron sites for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons.

The review discusses the catalytic conversion of n-butane by oxidative dehydrogenation as an alternative to direct dehydrogenation, focusing on catalytic systems, kinetic studies, and proposed reaction mechanisms. Special attention is given to the hydrocarbon activation process and factors governing catalytic efficiency. The review covers unsupported catalysts, supported catalysts, and promoters. Catalyst composition, operating conditions, reducibility, oxygen reactivity and availability, nature of oxygen species, electrical conductivity, surface basicity, and other factors are discussed. The nature of active and selective sites is also explored. Kinetic studies and reaction mechanisms are analyzed in detail. Conclusions and future trends are summarized.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that poses significant challenges to both industrial and academic researchers in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Efficient catalysts, such as VPO or VSbO-based systems, have been developed to overcome the activation step of alkanes, which is crucial for the process. However, achieving high selectivity and conversion remains difficult due to the multitude of possible reaction pathways and steps that occur simultaneously on the adsorbed phase without desorption. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes, but no single mechanism stands out as universally applicable. The goal is to propose a common activation site for several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation. The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule corresponds to an oxidative dehydrogenation. Different mechanisms have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties like strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species. The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, and their presence in oxidation catalysts should be related to structure defects. The dynamic nature of a catalytic oxide surface suggests that the concept of localized active sites should be taken with caution. A complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate encompassing the dynamics of the surface and the adsorbed species, as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid. Electrical conductivity measurements can provide information on the existence of oxidizing species and the nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reactions, characterizing the structure defects and helping to identify the active oxygen species. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by stabilizing active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, which can be measured by observing the effects of residence time on the formation rates of alkenes and COx. The catalytic turnovers for ODH of MoOx and VOx proceed through reduction-oxidation cycles, involving the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms. Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which activates the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms. The catalytic sequence requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation. The ability of oxide domains to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO, leads to significant catalytic consequences. Larger domains have lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity, which increases their ability to accept electrons. This is consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates increase with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy. The reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become more able to accept electron density and stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps. Higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, decreasing turnover rates. Similar trends have been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, ethane, and oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains, and on more reducible RuOx domains. Stoichiometric reduction rates increase with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities, consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates. The UV-visible absorption edge energy decreases as the energy level of the LUMO decreases and as the electron affinity of the cluster increases. Quantum confinement effects, imposed by the size and electronic isolation of oxide domains, can be used to design materials with electronic properties and catalytic functions controlled by properties other than chemical composition.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves the examination of the effect of cation identity on ODH pathways using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the reaction rates decrease in this sequence. The relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend on CH bond energy differences and the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+). Other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acidbase properties of active oxides and supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions requires the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. The greater reactivity of propene arises because the weakest CH bond in propane is stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene. The limited kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides suggests a similar reaction mechanism. The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species. The apparent activation energy for propene combustion is lower than for propene dehydrogenation, leading to a decrease in the k3/k1 ratio and an increase in propene yields as temperature increases. The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios. The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations. The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2). Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility are essential requirements for selective ODH, consistent with the trends in ODH rates and k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts.

The partial oxidation of methane to produce more useful chemicals like methanol, ethylene, and benzene has been widely studied, but the yields of these products have been low. In some processes, N2O is used as the oxidant instead of O2. Recent research in our lab has shown that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has a high capacity for hydrogen abstraction from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals. This indicates that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are generated by the coupling of two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst. We have achieved high yields of C2 compounds from CH4 conversion under conventional catalytic conditions.

The activation of alkanes is more difficult than that of the corresponding unsaturated hydrocarbons, but their large reserves highlight the economic interest in their conversion. The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate paraffins, thus limiting selectivity. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of water in the reaction feed decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen-containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The choice of catalyst is influenced by the nature of the alkane, with different catalysts being more effective for different alkanes. The reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and conversion of the process. Site isolation can help address selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products. The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the specific features of each alkane. Acid-base properties, type of oxygen, and the presence of promoters can also impact the performance of the ODH reaction.

The surface chemistry of supported chromium (Cr) on amorphous surfaces or molecular sieves is quite similar. Supported Cr ions are highly reactive and mobile, interacting with various molecules like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water. The redox behavior of supported Cr ions is influenced by the type and composition of the support, with Cr ions being easier to reduce on chemically softer supports. The oxide support acts as a ligand, controlling the redox properties of the supported Cr ions. Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ can be present, with their coordination and polymerization degrees depending on the support type and composition. Higher Cr loadings and lower surface areas tend to favor the formation of polychromates. After calcination, chromium oxides are anchored onto the surface through reactions with hydroxyl groups, and their molecular structure is determined by the support composition, Cr loading, and treatment conditions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is influenced by the acid-base character of the metal oxide support, which affects the dispersion of vanadium on the surface and the nature of the vanadium species. The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species, as well as the acid-base character of catalysts, are crucial for the catalytic properties in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. Tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. The coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites, play a significant role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. These factors are essential for developing selective catalysts in ODH reactions. Supported metal oxides offer advantages such as higher mechanical strength, better thermal stability, and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is influenced by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. Mixing or supporting vanadium oxide on other metal oxides can enhance the selectivity of bulk V2O5 in the ODH of short chain alkanes, increasing the formation rate of desired olefins. Vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO) and V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides have shown high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane, propane, and ethane. V-containing molecular sieves have also shown high selectivity for oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidation of ethane and propane. Despite the study of various catalytic systems, the nature of the active and selective sites in the ODH of short chain alkanes is still under discussion. The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species, which can affect its redox properties. Monolayer systems have been studied to optimize the dispersion of active sites and understand the influence of the support. The nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. However, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under investigation. The aim of the paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts and understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts.
