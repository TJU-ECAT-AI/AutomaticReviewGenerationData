[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
          [2] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
          [3] "The contribution to COx formation, conversely, mainly derives from adsorbed O species, at least in ethane ODH."
          [4] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
          [5] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
          [6] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V,modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
          [7] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
          [8] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
          [9] "In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used."
          [10] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."
          [11] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction."
          [2] "One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane."
          [3] "This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities."
          [4] "ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass."
          [5] "In fact, the corresponding supported systems give usually much higher activity and selectivity; they are discussed in more detail in section (vide infra)."
          [6] "Of several other systems that have been investigated, MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), (99, 100) VMgOx, (98, 101, 102) VSiZrOx, (103, 104) and CrSiMO (M = Al or Zr) (105) show relatively high selectivities."
          [7] "In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."
          [8] "Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant."
          [9] "It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6)."
          [10] "An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Scheme 5b)."
          [11] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers an energetically attractive route to the production of alkenes (i.e., RCH2CH3 + O2  RCHCH2 + H2O). Since ethane is the second most major component of natural gas and is also a main product in many methane-coupling reactions, its transformation to ethene at low temperature is of considerable interest. The metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active (10% of conversion at 559 K) and selective (100%) than other mixed-metal oxides (MoV, MoMn, MoTi, etc.)."
          [2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane may provide an attractive route to the production of propylene and could be a good alternative to conventional dehydrogenation and cracking processes. Various Nb-containing catalysts were studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Smits et al. 143 found that niobium oxide shows a very high selectivity in this reaction although the conversion was very low (Figure 9). The activity of the niobia was improved without diminishing its selectivity by adding other suitable elements (V, Cr, Mo)."
          [3] "The influence of various preparation methods on the performance of the VNbO catalysts also was investigated by Smits et al. 144,145 They found that the activity and selectivity of a given vanadium site depends on the nature of its neighboring atoms. Vanadium neighbors promote the activity, while niobium neighbors promote the selectivity. Niobium is much more difficult to reduce than vanadium and this feature improves the selectivity, since facile reduction often causes low selectivity in these reactions."



The concepts of oxidation began with Lavoisier's disproving of the phlogiston theory in 1773. One usually defines two groups of reactions namely homolytic and heterolytic. The first type involves radicals formed by homolytic * Corresponding author. cleavage of interatomic bonds. The second type involves an active oxygen compound or a metal ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two electrons transfer reaction. The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step.
The mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction.
An adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer.
It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reac- tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned.
The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one elec- tron to the metal.
Depending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties.
Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring.
Case (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins.
Case (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking).
Such a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present.
For instance in the work by Volta et al.,it was shown that single crystal type samples of MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and (101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to acrolein and CO x [4].
The originality of the work was to synthesize crystals of various shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite.
A more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5].
It is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al- Table 1 Structure sensitivity of the different faces of MoO 3 crystals in olefin oxidation at 380C ([4]) Reactant olefin products Relative selectivity per faces Reactant olefin Products Basal (010) Side (100) Apical (101), (1) Propene Acrolein 0.06 2.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 But- 1 -ene Butadiene 3 9.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 Isobutene Methacrolein 0 0.6 Acetone 0.06 0 CO, CO 2 0 1 0.7 0 2 0 0.1 0.06 0 6
Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds. For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons. It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].
The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.
One very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.
In some cases the chemical effect of the support will be determining for catalytic proper- ties. For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide supports (SiO 2, TiO 2, A1203) were shown by Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.
An important parameter for the impregnation method is the pH of the molybdate solution. As a matter of fact the following equilibrium has been well established: MovO64 + 4HzO , 7MoO 2- + 8H +
The monomeric tetrahedral MoO4 z- species is favored at higher pH and vice versa for the polymeric heptamolybdate anion.
Moreover one defines the so-called isoelectric point of the support (ieps) or zero point charge (zpc) of a support by the pH value for which the surface charge turns from anionic to cationic, i.e. will allow cations or anions from the liquid phase to be adsorbed, respectively.
One has values of 2 for silica, 5-6 for titania, 8 for alumina, etc.
This clearly shows that the size of the adsorbed anion (monomeric or polymeric) adsorbed on a support will depend on the ieps (zpc) value, i.e. on the support itself.
Above the ieps value, the surface of a particular oxide is negatively charged and vice versa below.
The anion will thus be adsorbed for a pH value below the ieps value and as said above a lower pH value will favor polymolybdate anionic species.
The former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.
The formation of the former species was described by the reaction in Scheme 2.
Catalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation.
The first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.
One gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air.
The experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings.
This indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7).
The second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8).
Weak activity was observed for low Mo loading.
At higher Mo loading propanal was the major product while acrolein was also observed.
At very high Mo loadings and for MoO 3 one gets almost exclu- 2,0 1,5 Propana ' 1,0 0 o,5 Acrolein " 0,0 ,,,,,0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Mo loading (wt %) Fig. 8. Propene oxidation to acrolein (nucleophilic attack) and propanal (electrophilic attack) at 400C on MoO 3/SiO 2 catalysts versus Mo loading (from [23]).
Propanal is known to stem from propene by an electrophilic attack while acrolein corresponds rather to a nucleophilic attack.
These results indicate that monomeric MoO 2- species does not oxidize propene in our condi- tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- ing rather electrophilic.
Molybdenum oxide ex- hibits redox properties with 0 2- species being rather nucleophilic.
One can thus realise how the size of the active site is important in oxida- tion catalysis.
This is typical of structure sensi- tive reaction.
Such a catalyst is well known for several reactions, such as o-xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia.
The anatase form of TiO 2 appears to be better than the rutile form.
Such catalysts with 1 and 8 wt% V2Os/anatase was prepared by RhSne-Poulenc (S  10 m 2 g-1) for an exercise of characterization by 25 different European laboratories.
All results are assembled in a special issue of Catalysis Today published in May 1994, Vol. 20, no. 1.
Surface vanadium species were observed to exist in three different forms: monomeric VO43- species,polymeric vanadate species and V205 crystal-
The following conclusions could be drawn considering that a polyvanadate species occu- pies a ca circular zone of a diameter of 0.38 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.165 nm 2) and an isolated monovanadate species 0.66 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.43 nm2):
(i) Monomeric VO 3- species exhibit acidic character with OH groups (BriSnsted acidity) and result in propene formation for isopropanol conversion and in total oxidation for o-xylene oxidation.
Maximum coverage equals 0.43 wt% V205.
(ii) Polyvanadate surface species exhibit re- dox properties, namely give rise to acetone for isopropanol conversion and phthalic anhydride for o-xylene oxidation.
(iii) V205 crystallites exhibit low activity for o-xylene conversion and high selectivity in total oxidation.
The size of the polyvanadate species in solu- tion corresponds to V3093-, V402 with tetrahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 7 and 4.5 respec- tively and V10068 - or V10028H 5- with octahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 2.5.
Deposition of such polyvanadates of different sizes was per- formed carefully on "y-A1203 support and their initial structures depicted above were shown to remain stable even after calcination in flowing air at 500C and to be only partly modified after catalytic reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the 350 to 450C range.
Moreover in such cases, the selectivity towards propene was observed to be the same at the same con- version level, indicating that in this size domain of polyvanadate species the catalytic selectivity was not changed, only the activity was observed to increase with vanadium loading [27].
In a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations ex- changed or impregnated on the surface of zirco- nium hydrogenophosphates and compared to vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phos- phate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 500C were observed when the material present either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 6 octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 4 re- spectively or chains of limited size [28].
By comparison with bulk oxides exhibiting similar environment, it was suggested as for supported VO and CrO x species on zirconium hy- drogenophosphates that the catalytic perfor- mances were related to the stronger basic char- acter of PO 3- anions with respect to 0 2- an- ions.
Some general conclusions may be drawn from this general presentation:(i) Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heteroge- neous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice 12

oxygen ions.
Such ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring.
(ii) Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts.
A pecu- liar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst.
Parameters such as reducibility and reoxidability features of the oxides are very important for catalytic reac- tions.
(iii) Active sites for oxidation reactions ap- pear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influ- ences the catalytic properties.
In some examples the number of atoms constituting the active sites could be established.
For instance double trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra are particularly active and selective for oxidative dehydrogena- tion of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates; ensembles of four dimers of VO 6 octahedra are suggested to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhy- dride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts.
Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties.
At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many par- tial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide.
It is thus clear that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is important depending on the reaction considered and the support used.
The characteri- zation of such 'clusters' lying on the surface is rather difficult and the above statements for supported oxide catalysts are only qualitative.
To better characterize such clusters, techniques as XANES (sensitive to local symmetry type), EXAFS (sensitive to the coordination number and nearby element distances) and radial elec- tron distribution (RED) of X-ray diffraction peaks (sensitive to the nearby element dis- tances) have to be used.
Already data have been obtained for MoO 3 and V205 deposited on SiO 2, A1203 or TiO 2 support.
This holds true only if one has one type of cluster species to analyse.
The reader interested may read a chapter de- voted to XANES and EXAFS techniques by Moraweck in the book by Imelik and Vdrine (1988 and 1994) ([29,30]).
(iv) Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions.
This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice.
This latter phenomenon results from the wetting effect particularly for multicomponent and supported oxide catalysts.
It follows that for many catalysts a certain time on stream is nec- essary before the catalyst reaches its steady state.
It is frequent that in an industrial plant a steady state is reached only after one or two hundreds hours, the catalysts lasting several years before having to be replaced.
For simple catalysts as doped vanadyl pyrophosphates used for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the right size of the active sites (e.g. tetramers of vanadyl dimers) is monitored by the reactants in catalytic reaction conditions leading to the right VS+/V 4+ ratio, by the preparation procedure to change the material morphology (the (100) face of (VO)2P20 7 being developed), and by the adequate addition of additive elements which regulate the site size and VS+/V 4+ ion ratio.
The view of an oxidation catalyst as dynamical under catalytic reaction conditions is essential for our understanding of its functioning.

[1] "The selective oxidation to propylene probably also needs BrSnsted acid sites as shown recently by Moro-oka and Ueda [155] for the MoMgO catalysts."
          [2] "The different steps of the routes to propylene and COx, respectively, are probably differently sensitive to the acid-base nature and strength of the used catalyst."
          [3] "In the mean time, the C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic and the propyl species thus produced should be a propyl radical [35,158,159]."
          [4] "High temperature favors the alkyl desorption route [158,159] whereas low reaction temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reaction routes [148,159,163]."
          [5] "So, propane oxidation over V containing catalysts is considered to be initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
          [6] "It must be mentioned that heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond was also proposed in the ODHR of propane."
          [7] "The former process should be expected to occur on acidic catalysts whereas the latter supposes rather basic catalysts."
          [8] "In fact, it should be considered that redox equilibria coexist at the catalyst surface whatever the initial mode (homolytic or heterolytic) of activation as shown below:"
          [9] "A concerted mechanism (Scheme 6A) should be thus considered: the transition state in this case is probably of lower energy since it involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds."
          [10] "In this mechanism the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst play a role as a whole in only one step."
          [11] "Another mode of activation of propane should be its adsorption as alkoxy species, that is, the occurrence of the direct insertion of a lattice oxygen atom into a C-H bond (see also Scheme 6B):"
          [12] "The alkoxy species then decomposes to propylene."
          [13] "This decomposition needs the presence of BrSnsted acid sites as can be deduced from the finding of Moro-oka and Ueda [155] of the correlation between the propylene formation from propane and the number of the BriSnsted acid sites in the case of the MoMgO catalysts."
          [14] "The alkoxy route here proposed is also supported by the in-situ FT-IR studies of Finnochio et al. [169] showing the formation of propyloxy surface species as intermediate to propylene during the oxidation of propane over CrMoO catalysts."
          [15] "The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts."
          [16] "The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical."
          [17] "High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions."
          [18] "A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed."
          [19] "Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts."

"CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]."
          "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2)."
          "On the other side, the selectivity in ethylene increases with the copper content and decreases for Cu/Th > 0.25."
          "The conversion of propane is closely correlated to the copper concentration ThO 2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains constant for larger atomic ratios."
          "the selectivity in propene increases rapidly with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and finally decreases for higher atomic ratios."
          "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of Cue may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."
          "Consequently,the selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by MI, M 2 and D signals."
          "In the case of propane, the catalytic activity may be due to the presence of Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface (MI, M 2 and D) since the formation of CuO crystallites particularly at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the conversion."
          "Therefore, the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites (A 1 and A 2) rather than other sites."

[1] "The search of catalysts for the partial oxidation of light alkanes appears to both industrial and academic researchers as a difficult but promising challenge in heterogeneous catalysis."
          [2] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydro- carbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."
          [3] "The complexity of selective alkane oxidation reac- tions arises from the number of possible simultaneous reaction pathways, each of them with several reaction steps occurring on the adsorbed phase without desorb- ing."
          [4] "Different pathways have been proposed, but no single mechanism stands out [35]."
          [5] "The goal of this paper is to attempt to propose a common activation site to several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation."
          [6] "The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule cor- responds to an oxidative dehydrogenation."
          [7] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed [3]."
          [8] "The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation like long-range electron delocalization and high electron mobility."
          [9] "It appears that such an approach should be restricted to alkane activation sites and a complete mod- eling of the reaction process would necessitate to encompass the dynamic of the surface and the adsorbed species [3,10] as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid [11,12]."
          [10] "The electrical conductivity can be expressed as:r  elhp  elen 1 where e denotes the charge of electron, l the electrons (e) or holes (h) mobility and n and p the electron and hole concentration."
          [11] "The conduction mechanism can be identified by perturbing the charge carrier concentration using O2 as a probe."
          [12] "p-type semi-conductors are characterized by an excess of lattice O2) anions, Mx+O(x/2) 2) i.e., cationic vacancies in closed- packed oxide structures."
          [13] "n-type semiconductors are characterized by a deficit in lattice O2) anions Mx+O(x/2) 2) accounted for by the existence of anionic vacancies VO2."
          [14] "The structure, as it appears in this plane, consists of pairs of edge sharing VO6 octahedra linked to each other by P2O7 pyrophosphate groups."
          [15] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."
          [16] "It has been shown that n-butane could be activated in the absence of gas phase oxygen and that lattice oxygen was involved [27]; this proposal was confirmed by TAP experiments indicating that nearly all the oxygen incorporated into the oxygenated products came from the lattice [28]."
          [17] "Several mechanisms involving different sites have been proposed for the first step of the reaction (figure 1)."
          [18] "It has been demonstrated that the (VO)2P2O7 phase was a p-type semi-conductor [33]."
          [19] "The existence of vanadium sites with a vanadium vacancy (h in figure 2b) is improbable although the presence of protons would fit with Bro nsted sites titration with K + experiments showing surface protons concentration twice that expected from idealized models of (1,0,0) plane [34] and the presence of vanadium vacancies would fit with the observation by XPS of a surface P/V ratio greater than one."
          [20] "The more probable catalytic site should be that of figure 2(a) already pos- tulated [31] and the reaction on this site could involve two hydrogens abstraction with the formation of two hydroxyls groups and the transfer of one electron from the hydrocarbon to a vanadium cation as following:"

          [25] "It was proposed that the activation of the first CH bond of an alkane involved very reactive oxygen that was weakly bound and pro- posed that weakly adsorbed O) could play that role."
          [26] "However it has been often stressed that very weakly bound surface O) promoted the formation of CC cleavage and were responsible for total oxidation."
          [27] "The same observation was made in the case study of titanium pyrophosphate presented later."
          [28] "Dopants have been shown to influence strongly the catalytic properties of the VPO catalysts [40,41]."
          [29] "It has been shown that Co favored a higher V5+/V4+ ratio under fuel rich condition and maintained a higher surface distribution of the V, P and O atoms [44]."
          [30] "The two most efficient catalysts ZrP2O7 and TiP2O7 appeared to be p-type semiconductors under air with positive holes as the main charge carriers like (VO)2P2O7."
          [31] "They became n-type when contacted with n- butane [47] (figure 7)."
          [32] "These results explained the difference in catalytic reaction mechanism encountered on the two solids."
          [33] "The alkane activation can be related in both cases to the p-type semi-con- ducting properties of the solids, likely through hydrogen abstraction by a surface O) species."
          [34] "However on ZrP2O7, Zr cannot change its valence state easily and the catalytic site will only abstract one hydrogen forming a C4H9 radical."
          [35] "In the case of TiP2O7, the same type of mechanism takes place below 450 C when Ti cannot be reduced."
          [36] "However above this temperature, it has been shown that Ti can be reduced and another mechanism is occurring that has not yet been completely elucidated."
          [37] "The two mechanisms have different activation ener- gies and more importantly the butene-1/butene-2 ratio is different."
          [38] "On ZrP2O7 and on TiP2O7 at low temperature,the ratio is close to 1.5 whereas it is close to 0.5 on TiP2O7 at high temperature."
          [39] "In the first case, after the first methylene H abstraction, the probability for the second H abstraction is independant of the first abstraction and the probability of abstraction of a methyl or methylene H is only a function of the relative abundance of the different species (6/4)."
          [40] "In the second case, the mechanism would involve an adsorbed intermediate and the stabil- ization of 1 or 2-butene is governed by thermodynamics (1/2)."
          [41] "The VSbO catalysts can contain several phases besides VSbO4 such as Sb2O4, V2O5 or amorphous V and Sb oxides but it is accepted that the active phase is the VSbO4 phase [52]."
          [42] "Its structure is derived from TiO2 rutile-type, with two Ti4+ cations formally substituted by one V and Sb cation with a cation deficiency related to the presence of V4+."
          [43] "The redox properties of the VSbO4 phase have been studied by electrical conductivity measurements [58]."
          [44] "This phase is an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the main charge carriers."
          [45] "The study of the changes in the electrical conductivity during alternative exposures to propane, oxygen and mixtures of propane and oxygen at the catalytic reaction temperature showed that it became a p-type semiconductor after reduction under propane (figure 8)."
          [46] "The existence of such irreversible change is supported by the fact that after the first reduction, the solid undergoes redox cycles that are not reversible and remain charac- teristic of a p-type semiconductor."
          [47] "The first increase in electrical conductivity under propane is related to that of the free electron concentration originating from ion- ized anionic vacancies formation according to the reaction:xC3H8  V40:64V30:28Sb50:92(0:16O4 ! V40:642xV30:282xSb50:92(0:16O4x  xC3H6  xH2O."
          [48] "The solid containing both cationic and anionic vacancies is not stable and a phase transformation should occur leading to a vanadium antimonate, richer in vanadium and supporting an antimony oxide, partially coating the surface."
          [49] "However, all the data obtained show that the active catalytic site at the surface of the vanadium antimonate could corre- spond to isolated vanadium species neighboring a cat- ionic vacancy [59,60]."
          [50] "Such arrangement should induce the stabilization of O) species allowing the activation of the alkane molecule."
          [51] "The structure of the active M1 phase has been solved and its detailed composition determined [66]."
          [52] "It corresponds to a network of MO6 octaedra (M = Mo, V and Nb) sharing corners or edges (figure 9a)."
          [53] "The heptagonal channels are empty and the hexagonal channels are occupied by tellurium or antimony cations and oxides forming chains in the direction of the chan- nels."
          [54] "It has been proposed that the activation of the alkane molecule occurred on the vanadium sites located in M7 position in the structure and that the activity of this site was explained by the resonance form in which vanadium underwent a charge transfer leading to a surface O)."
          [55] "This O) would be able to perform H abstraction from the propane molecule at the methylene position to produce a secondary propyl radical."
          [56] "A second step would correspond to a methyl abstraction to the oxygen on a neighboring tellurium cation [69]."
          [57] "The charge transfer is localized at the vanadium site on the surface and the M1 phase is, and remains in the conditions of catalytic test, n-type semi- conductor [70]."
          [58] "The direct charge transfer proposed in Eq. (13) may be not the only way to generate active O) sites at the surface of the M1 phase."
          [59] "A recent study of the phase Mo3Nb2O14, which presents a Mo5O14 type phase structure with pentagonal channels similar to those of the M1 phase, has shown that although only Mo6+ were expected to be present to balance the charge in the structure, Mo5+ were identified by EPR [71]."
          [60] "This feature was explained by the existence of a substitution disorder between Nb and Mo cations and the instability of the configuration in which l3 oxygen (O l3 in fig- ure 9b) were bonded to three Mo6+ atoms leading to the reduction of one of the Mo6+ atoms with the formation of a hole in the valence band."
          [61] "Taking into account Eq. (2), this could be expressed by the following equation: Mo6 Nb  O2 ! Mo5 Nb  O."
          [62] "However this later pathway should likely be a minor pathway as compared to the former."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, the rates of which can be measured from the effects of residence time on formation rates of alkenes and COx (CO and CO2)."
          [2] "Catalytic turnovers for oxidative dehydrogenation of MoOx and VOx proceed via reduction-oxidation cycles."
          [3] "These cycles involve the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms via pathways first proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."
          [4] "Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which involves the activation of the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms at the surface of reducible oxide domains."
          [5] "The catalytic sequence, depicted in Scheme 4, requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation."
          [6] "Thus, the ability to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO (DE2; Scheme 3) is likely to lead to significant catalytic consequences."
          [7] "The concurrent changes observed in absorption edge energies and in the stabilization of the transition state for CH bond cleavage and OH and CO bond formation reflect the increased ability of larger domains to accept electrons, consistent with their lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity."
          [8] "These trends are also consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis."
          [9] "For a given reactant (DE1, XH bond dissociation energy and H ionization energy,endothermic) and cluster (with protonation enthalpy DE3,exothermic), a lower lying LUMO (DE2) leads to a more exothermic H abstraction reaction (DHCH,abstr = DE1 + DE2 + DE3) and activation barrier (Eact,CH,abst) assuming an Evans-Polyani correlation of Eact,CH,abst and DHCH,abstr according to Eact,CH,abst = E0 + aDHCH,abstr,where E0 and a are constants."
          [10] "Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates (per Mo-atom) increased with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy, as the latter approaches values typical of saturated polymolybdate monolayers."
          [11] "These trends indicate that the reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become increasingly able to accept electron density and to stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps relative to smaller domains with higher-lying LUMO states."
          [12] "Ultimately, higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, which renders the use of the total number of Mo atoms inappropriate as a measure of the number of active sites."
          [13] "As a result, turnover rates reported on the basis of Mo atoms inevitably and ultimately decrease with increasing MoOx surface densities (Fig. 12) as a result of the prevalence of inaccessible Mo-oxo species."
          [14] "These catalytic trends resemble those reported previously for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane on VOx domains and for reactions of propane on MoOx domains dispersed on other supports."
          [15] "Similar trends have also been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains and on more reducible RuOx domains."
          [16] "The observed effects of domain size on catalysis parallel similar effects on the dynamics of their incipient stoichiometric reduction in H2, a process that leads to the formation of isolated vacancies and which resembles the elementary steps involved in the reduction part of catalytic dehydrogenation cycles."
          [17] "Stoichiometric reduction rates increased with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities,consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies."
          [18] "The mechanistic connections between oxidative dehydrogenation rates and the LMCT absorption edge in the electronic spectra of dispersed oxides are evident from the data shown in Fig. 13."
          [19] "Catalytic turnover rates on VOx, MoOx, WOx, and NbOx domains dispersed predominantly as monomers or two-dimensional oligomers on various supports (Al2O3, ZrO2, MgO) are shown as a function of their corresponding LMCT energies."
          [20] "For all active oxides, ODH turnover rates (per active metal atom) increased monotonically as LMCT energies decreased."
          [21] "These results indicate that the stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends sensitively on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates."
          [22] "The UV-visible absorption edge energy decreases as the energy level of the LUMO decreases and as the electron affinity of the cluster (Scheme 3, DE2) increases."
          [23] "These effects influence, in turn, the energies of intermediates and transition states that require electron transfer to the cluster."
          [24] "They lead to the exponential dependence of propane ODH turnover rates on LMCT absorption edge energies evident from Fig. 13."
          [25] "The identity of the metal has the strongest impact on both LMCT absorption edge energy and propane ODH turnover rates."
          [26] "More reducible supports and higher surface densities lead to higher propane ODH turnover rates for a given element and to lower edge energies and lower-lying LUMO states, which stabilize both the products and the transition state in CH bond activation steps."
          [27] "MoOx and VOx domains can be made similar in reactivity,in spite of their different chemical identities, by dispersing the latter as smaller domains or onto less reducible supports than the former."
          [28] "Thus, we conclude that quantum confinement effects, imposed by the size and electronic isolation of oxide domains, can be used to design materials with electronic properties and catalytic functions controlled by properties other than chemical composition."

[1] "The effect of cation identity on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways was examined using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2."
          [2] "The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2; the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence, suggesting that turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, which are in turn influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides."
          [3] "These results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces."
          [4] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
          [5] "The differences observed among VOx, MoOx, WOx and other oxides suggest that other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and therefore the acidbase properties of active oxides and of supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields."
          [6] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, 25,26 making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."
          [7] "The greater reactivity of propene arises in part because the weakest CH bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene."
          [8] "The limited available kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides leads us to expect that the reaction also occurs by the steps leading to eq 1."
          [9] "The similar site requirements for reactions 1 and 3 (suggested by the effects of VOx structure on selectivity)25,26 and the markedly different values of ΔS3 and ΔS1 measured (Table 2) indicate that propane ODH (reaction 1) and propene combustion (reaction 3) pathways involve transition states with different structures."
          [10] "The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy in step I and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species in step II (eq 7)."
          [11] "The apparent activation energy for propene combustion (ΔE3) is lower than for propene dehydrogenation (ΔE1) on all three catalysts (Table 2)."
          [12] "The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios (eq 12)."
          [13] "The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values (Table 2) indeed increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations."
          [14] "The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species seem to account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2; Figure 5)."
          [15] "Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts."

[1] "The partial oxidation of methane into more useful chemicals such as methanol, ethylene and benzene has been investigated extensively, although yields for these products have been poor14."
          [2] "Moreover, in several of these processes the required oxidant is N2O rather than O2."
          [3] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."
          [4] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."
          [5] "We report here our success in converting CH4 to C2 compounds in high yields in conventional catalytic conditions."

[1] "The activation of alkanes is more difcult than that of the corresponding olens,but their large reserves underline the economic inter- est in their conversion."

          [6] "The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity."
          [7] "The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their clea- vage should be the rst step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons."
          [8] "The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons (Table 1), CH bonds on secondary and tertiary car- bons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites."
          [9] "The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an afnity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst."
          [10] "The afnity between the hydrocarbon and the sur- face promotes the activation of the molecules. Selec- tivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species."
          [11] "The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance,because it determines how fast the surface intermedi- ates react."
          [12] "The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation."

          [20] "The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support."
          [21] "The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility."

[1] "The accent is put on the mechanisms and the kinetic models used for the description of this reaction.

          [8] "The chemistry of Cr at the surface is determined by the isoelectric point, the surface area of the support, and the Cr loading."
          [9] "The chemistry of Cr on amorphous surfaces or on the surfaces of molecular sieves is quite similar."

[1] "The acid-base character of metal oxide support influences the dispersion of vanadium on the surface of the support, as well as the nature of the vanadium species."
          [2] "The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species and the acid-base character of catalysts, in addition to their catalytic properties in the ODH of Cz-C4 alkanes, strongly depend on the metal oxide used as support and the vanadium loading."
          [3] "In this way, it appears that tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2C4 alkanes."
          [4] "The effect of the coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites on the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts are discussed."
          [5] "It is concluded that these are important factors that must be considered to develop selective catalysts in ODH reactions."
          [6] "The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength,better thermal stability and larger surface area."
          [7] "However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading."
          [8] "In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."
          [9] "This is the case of vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO), that show a high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane [25,27,28], propane [26,29-31] and ethylben- zene [32]; or V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides which are selective catalysts in the ODH of ethane [33,34]."
          [10] "More recently, it has also been shown that V-containing molecular sieves are highly selective for the oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidation of ethane [35,36] and propane [37-39]."
          [11] "However, although several catalytic system have been studied [17-21], the nature of the active and selective sites is not well known yet."
          [12] "The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are usually related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species which can modify its redox properties."
          [13] "In order to better establish the influence of the support, a number of papers have been devoted to the study of monolayer systems (monomolecular dispersion in which the oxide is maximally influenced by the support) to optimize the dispersion of the active sites [13-16]."
          [14] "From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support."
          [15] "However, in spite of the variety of catalytic system studied, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under discussion."
          [16] "Since the structure-activity/selectivity correlation could be expected to change with the alkane fed, the aim of the present paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts, as well as the structure and properties of different catalytic systems, in order to understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts."

[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
          [2] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
          [3] "The contribution to COx formation, conversely, mainly derives from adsorbed O species, at least in ethane ODH."
          [4] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
          [5] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
          [6] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V,modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
          [7] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
          [8] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
          [9] "In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used."
          [10] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."
          [11] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction."
          [2] "One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane."
          [3] "This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities."
          [4] "ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass."
          [5] "In fact, the corresponding supported systems give usually much higher activity and selectivity; they are discussed in more detail in section (vide infra)."
          [6] "Of several other systems that have been investigated, MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), (99, 100) VMgOx, (98, 101, 102) VSiZrOx, (103, 104) and CrSiMO (M = Al or Zr) (105) show relatively high selectivities."
          [7] "In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."
          [8] "Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant."
          [9] "It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6)."
          [10] "An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Scheme 5b)."
          [11] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers an energetically attractive route to the production of alkenes (i.e., RCH2CH3 + O2  RCHCH2 + H2O). Since ethane is the second most major component of natural gas and is also a main product in many methane-coupling reactions, its transformation to ethene at low temperature is of considerable interest. The metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active (10% of conversion at 559 K) and selective (100%) than other mixed-metal oxides (MoV, MoMn, MoTi, etc.)."
          [2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane may provide an attractive route to the production of propylene and could be a good alternative to conventional dehydrogenation and cracking processes. Various Nb-containing catalysts were studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Smits et al. 143 found that niobium oxide shows a very high selectivity in this reaction although the conversion was very low (Figure 9). The activity of the niobia was improved without diminishing its selectivity by adding other suitable elements (V, Cr, Mo)."
          [3] "The influence of various preparation methods on the performance of the VNbO catalysts also was investigated by Smits et al. 144,145 They found that the activity and selectivity of a given vanadium site depends on the nature of its neighboring atoms. Vanadium neighbors promote the activity, while niobium neighbors promote the selectivity. Niobium is much more difficult to reduce than vanadium and this feature improves the selectivity, since facile reduction often causes low selectivity in these reactions."



The concepts of oxidation began with Lavoisier's disproving of the phlogiston theory in 1773. One usually defines two groups of reactions namely homolytic and heterolytic. The first type involves radicals formed by homolytic * Corresponding author. cleavage of interatomic bonds. The second type involves an active oxygen compound or a metal ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two electrons transfer reaction. The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step.
The mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction.
An adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer.
It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reac- tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned.
The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one elec- tron to the metal.
Depending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties.
Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring.
Case (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins.
Case (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking).
Such a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present.
For instance in the work by Volta et al.,it was shown that single crystal type samples of MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and (101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to acrolein and CO x [4].
The originality of the work was to synthesize crystals of various shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite.
A more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5].
It is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al- Table 1 Structure sensitivity of the different faces of MoO 3 crystals in olefin oxidation at 380C ([4]) Reactant olefin products Relative selectivity per faces Reactant olefin Products Basal (010) Side (100) Apical (101), (1) Propene Acrolein 0.06 2.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 But- 1 -ene Butadiene 3 9.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 Isobutene Methacrolein 0 0.6 Acetone 0.06 0 CO, CO 2 0 1 0.7 0 2 0 0.1 0.06 0 6
Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds. For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons. It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].
The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.
One very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.
In some cases the chemical effect of the support will be determining for catalytic proper- ties. For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide supports (SiO 2, TiO 2, A1203) were shown by Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.
An important parameter for the impregnation method is the pH of the molybdate solution. As a matter of fact the following equilibrium has been well established: MovO64 + 4HzO , 7MoO 2- + 8H +
The monomeric tetrahedral MoO4 z- species is favored at higher pH and vice versa for the polymeric heptamolybdate anion.
Moreover one defines the so-called isoelectric point of the support (ieps) or zero point charge (zpc) of a support by the pH value for which the surface charge turns from anionic to cationic, i.e. will allow cations or anions from the liquid phase to be adsorbed, respectively.
One has values of 2 for silica, 5-6 for titania, 8 for alumina, etc.
This clearly shows that the size of the adsorbed anion (monomeric or polymeric) adsorbed on a support will depend on the ieps (zpc) value, i.e. on the support itself.
Above the ieps value, the surface of a particular oxide is negatively charged and vice versa below.
The anion will thus be adsorbed for a pH value below the ieps value and as said above a lower pH value will favor polymolybdate anionic species.
The former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.
The formation of the former species was described by the reaction in Scheme 2.
Catalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation.
The first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.
One gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air.
The experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings.
This indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7).
The second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8).
Weak activity was observed for low Mo loading.
At higher Mo loading propanal was the major product while acrolein was also observed.
At very high Mo loadings and for MoO 3 one gets almost exclu- 2,0 1,5 Propana ' 1,0 0 o,5 Acrolein " 0,0 ,,,,,0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Mo loading (wt %) Fig. 8. Propene oxidation to acrolein (nucleophilic attack) and propanal (electrophilic attack) at 400C on MoO 3/SiO 2 catalysts versus Mo loading (from [23]).
Propanal is known to stem from propene by an electrophilic attack while acrolein corresponds rather to a nucleophilic attack.
These results indicate that monomeric MoO 2- species does not oxidize propene in our condi- tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- ing rather electrophilic.
Molybdenum oxide ex- hibits redox properties with 0 2- species being rather nucleophilic.
One can thus realise how the size of the active site is important in oxida- tion catalysis.
This is typical of structure sensi- tive reaction.
Such a catalyst is well known for several reactions, such as o-xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia.
The anatase form of TiO 2 appears to be better than the rutile form.
Such catalysts with 1 and 8 wt% V2Os/anatase was prepared by RhSne-Poulenc (S  10 m 2 g-1) for an exercise of characterization by 25 different European laboratories.
All results are assembled in a special issue of Catalysis Today published in May 1994, Vol. 20, no. 1.
Surface vanadium species were observed to exist in three different forms: monomeric VO43- species,polymeric vanadate species and V205 crystal-
The following conclusions could be drawn considering that a polyvanadate species occu- pies a ca circular zone of a diameter of 0.38 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.165 nm 2) and an isolated monovanadate species 0.66 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.43 nm2):
(i) Monomeric VO 3- species exhibit acidic character with OH groups (BriSnsted acidity) and result in propene formation for isopropanol conversion and in total oxidation for o-xylene oxidation.
Maximum coverage equals 0.43 wt% V205.
(ii) Polyvanadate surface species exhibit re- dox properties, namely give rise to acetone for isopropanol conversion and phthalic anhydride for o-xylene oxidation.
(iii) V205 crystallites exhibit low activity for o-xylene conversion and high selectivity in total oxidation.
The size of the polyvanadate species in solu- tion corresponds to V3093-, V402 with tetrahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 7 and 4.5 respec- tively and V10068 - or V10028H 5- with octahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 2.5.
Deposition of such polyvanadates of different sizes was per- formed carefully on "y-A1203 support and their initial structures depicted above were shown to remain stable even after calcination in flowing air at 500C and to be only partly modified after catalytic reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the 350 to 450C range.
Moreover in such cases, the selectivity towards propene was observed to be the same at the same con- version level, indicating that in this size domain of polyvanadate species the catalytic selectivity was not changed, only the activity was observed to increase with vanadium loading [27].
In a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations ex- changed or impregnated on the surface of zirco- nium hydrogenophosphates and compared to vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phos- phate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 500C were observed when the material present either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 6 octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 4 re- spectively or chains of limited size [28].
By comparison with bulk oxides exhibiting similar environment, it was suggested as for supported VO and CrO x species on zirconium hy- drogenophosphates that the catalytic perfor- mances were related to the stronger basic char- acter of PO 3- anions with respect to 0 2- an- ions.
Some general conclusions may be drawn from this general presentation:(i) Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heteroge- neous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice 12

oxygen ions.
Such ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring.
(ii) Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts.
A pecu- liar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst.
Parameters such as reducibility and reoxidability features of the oxides are very important for catalytic reac- tions.
(iii) Active sites for oxidation reactions ap- pear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influ- ences the catalytic properties.
In some examples the number of atoms constituting the active sites could be established.
For instance double trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra are particularly active and selective for oxidative dehydrogena- tion of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates; ensembles of four dimers of VO 6 octahedra are suggested to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhy- dride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts.
Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties.
At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many par- tial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide.
It is thus clear that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is important depending on the reaction considered and the support used.
The characteri- zation of such 'clusters' lying on the surface is rather difficult and the above statements for supported oxide catalysts are only qualitative.
To better characterize such clusters, techniques as XANES (sensitive to local symmetry type), EXAFS (sensitive to the coordination number and nearby element distances) and radial elec- tron distribution (RED) of X-ray diffraction peaks (sensitive to the nearby element dis- tances) have to be used.
Already data have been obtained for MoO 3 and V205 deposited on SiO 2, A1203 or TiO 2 support.
This holds true only if one has one type of cluster species to analyse.
The reader interested may read a chapter de- voted to XANES and EXAFS techniques by Moraweck in the book by Imelik and Vdrine (1988 and 1994) ([29,30]).
(iv) Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions.
This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice.
This latter phenomenon results from the wetting effect particularly for multicomponent and supported oxide catalysts.
It follows that for many catalysts a certain time on stream is nec- essary before the catalyst reaches its steady state.
It is frequent that in an industrial plant a steady state is reached only after one or two hundreds hours, the catalysts lasting several years before having to be replaced.
For simple catalysts as doped vanadyl pyrophosphates used for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the right size of the active sites (e.g. tetramers of vanadyl dimers) is monitored by the reactants in catalytic reaction conditions leading to the right VS+/V 4+ ratio, by the preparation procedure to change the material morphology (the (100) face of (VO)2P20 7 being developed), and by the adequate addition of additive elements which regulate the site size and VS+/V 4+ ion ratio.
The view of an oxidation catalyst as dynamical under catalytic reaction conditions is essential for our understanding of its functioning.

[1] "The selective oxidation to propylene probably also needs BrSnsted acid sites as shown recently by Moro-oka and Ueda [155] for the MoMgO catalysts."
          [2] "The different steps of the routes to propylene and COx, respectively, are probably differently sensitive to the acid-base nature and strength of the used catalyst."
          [3] "In the mean time, the C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic and the propyl species thus produced should be a propyl radical [35,158,159]."
          [4] "High temperature favors the alkyl desorption route [158,159] whereas low reaction temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reaction routes [148,159,163]."
          [5] "So, propane oxidation over V containing catalysts is considered to be initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
          [6] "It must be mentioned that heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond was also proposed in the ODHR of propane."
          [7] "The former process should be expected to occur on acidic catalysts whereas the latter supposes rather basic catalysts."
          [8] "In fact, it should be considered that redox equilibria coexist at the catalyst surface whatever the initial mode (homolytic or heterolytic) of activation as shown below:"
          [9] "A concerted mechanism (Scheme 6A) should be thus considered: the transition state in this case is probably of lower energy since it involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds."
          [10] "In this mechanism the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst play a role as a whole in only one step."
          [11] "Another mode of activation of propane should be its adsorption as alkoxy species, that is, the occurrence of the direct insertion of a lattice oxygen atom into a C-H bond (see also Scheme 6B):"
          [12] "The alkoxy species then decomposes to propylene."
          [13] "This decomposition needs the presence of BrSnsted acid sites as can be deduced from the finding of Moro-oka and Ueda [155] of the correlation between the propylene formation from propane and the number of the BriSnsted acid sites in the case of the MoMgO catalysts."
          [14] "The alkoxy route here proposed is also supported by the in-situ FT-IR studies of Finnochio et al. [169] showing the formation of propyloxy surface species as intermediate to propylene during the oxidation of propane over CrMoO catalysts."
          [15] "The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts."
          [16] "The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical."
          [17] "High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions."
          [18] "A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed."
          [19] "Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts."

"CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]."
          "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2)."
          "On the other side, the selectivity in ethylene increases with the copper content and decreases for Cu/Th > 0.25."
          "The conversion of propane is closely correlated to the copper concentration ThO 2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains constant for larger atomic ratios."
          "the selectivity in propene increases rapidly with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and finally decreases for higher atomic ratios."
          "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of Cue may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."
          "Consequently,the selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by MI, M 2 and D signals."
          "In the case of propane, the catalytic activity may be due to the presence of Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface (MI, M 2 and D) since the formation of CuO crystallites particularly at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the conversion."
          "Therefore, the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites (A 1 and A 2) rather than other sites."

          [6] "The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule cor- responds to an oxidative dehydrogenation."
          [7] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed [3]."
          [8] "The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation like long-range electron delocalization and high electron mobility."
          [9] "It appears that such an approach should be restricted to alkane activation sites and a complete mod- eling of the reaction process would necessitate to encompass the dynamic of the surface and the adsorbed species [3,10] as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid [11,12]."
          [10] "The electrical conductivity can be expressed as:r  elhp  elen 1 where e denotes the charge of electron, l the electrons (e) or holes (h) mobility and n and p the electron and hole concentration."
          [11] "The conduction mechanism can be identified by perturbing the charge carrier concentration using O2 as a probe."
          [12] "p-type semi-conductors are characterized by an excess of lattice O2) anions, Mx+O(x/2) 2) i.e., cationic vacancies in closed- packed oxide structures."
          [13] "n-type semiconductors are characterized by a deficit in lattice O2) anions Mx+O(x/2) 2) accounted for by the existence of anionic vacancies VO2."
          [14] "The structure, as it appears in this plane, consists of pairs of edge sharing VO6 octahedra linked to each other by P2O7 pyrophosphate groups."
          [15] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."
          [16] "It has been shown that n-butane could be activated in the absence of gas phase oxygen and that lattice oxygen was involved [27]; this proposal was confirmed by TAP experiments indicating that nearly all the oxygen incorporated into the oxygenated products came from the lattice [28]."
          [17] "Several mechanisms involving different sites have been proposed for the first step of the reaction (figure 1)."
          [18] "It has been demonstrated that the (VO)2P2O7 phase was a p-type semi-conductor [33]."
          [19] "The existence of vanadium sites with a vanadium vacancy (h in figure 2b) is improbable although the presence of protons would fit with Bro nsted sites titration with K + experiments showing surface protons concentration twice that expected from idealized models of (1,0,0) plane [34] and the presence of vanadium vacancies would fit with the observation by XPS of a surface P/V ratio greater than one."
          [20] "The more probable catalytic site should be that of figure 2(a) already pos- tulated [31] and the reaction on this site could involve two hydrogens abstraction with the formation of two hydroxyls groups and the transfer of one electron from the hydrocarbon to a vanadium cation as following:"
          [21] "The two neighboring close sites would allow two methylene H abstraction explaining the discrimination between methylene and methyl CH bond observed [25,26]."
          [22] "The role of a superoxide or peroxo species had already been proposed in the case of other light alkanes activation although they should not be stable in the presence of the alkane as shown for su- peroxo species by EPR."
          [23] "It is important to note that the O) species proposed to be involved in the activation of n-butane in this paper,although they present electrophilic properties, should be more strongly bound and have a much lower mobility."
          [24] "The involvement of O) species for light alkanes activation has already been suggested from thermody- namic considerations [39]."
          [25] "It was proposed that the activation of the first CH bond of an alkane involved very reactive oxygen that was weakly bound and pro- posed that weakly adsorbed O) could play that role."
          [26] "However it has been often stressed that very weakly bound surface O) promoted the formation of CC cleavage and were responsible for total oxidation."
          [27] "The same observation was made in the case study of titanium pyrophosphate presented later."
          [28] "Dopants have been shown to influence strongly the catalytic properties of the VPO catalysts [40,41]."
          [29] "It has been shown that Co favored a higher V5+/V4+ ratio under fuel rich condition and maintained a higher surface distribution of the V, P and O atoms [44]."
          [30] "The two most efficient catalysts ZrP2O7 and TiP2O7 appeared to be p-type semiconductors under air with positive holes as the main charge carriers like (VO)2P2O7."
          [31] "They became n-type when contacted with n- butane [47] (figure 7)."
          [32] "These results explained the difference in catalytic reaction mechanism encountered on the two solids."
          [33] "The alkane activation can be related in both cases to the p-type semi-con- ducting properties of the solids, likely through hydrogen abstraction by a surface O) species."
          [34] "However on ZrP2O7, Zr cannot change its valence state easily and the catalytic site will only abstract one hydrogen forming a C4H9 radical."
          [35] "In the case of TiP2O7, the same type of mechanism takes place below 450 C when Ti cannot be reduced."
          [36] "However above this temperature, it has been shown that Ti can be reduced and another mechanism is occurring that has not yet been completely elucidated."
          [37] "The two mechanisms have different activation ener- gies and more importantly the butene-1/butene-2 ratio is different."
          [38] "On ZrP2O7 and on TiP2O7 at low temperature,the ratio is close to 1.5 whereas it is close to 0.5 on TiP2O7 at high temperature."
          [39] "In the first case, after the first methylene H abstraction, the probability for the second H abstraction is independant of the first abstraction and the probability of abstraction of a methyl or methylene H is only a function of the relative abundance of the different species (6/4)."
          [40] "In the second case, the mechanism would involve an adsorbed intermediate and the stabil- ization of 1 or 2-butene is governed by thermodynamics (1/2)."
          [41] "The VSbO catalysts can contain several phases besides VSbO4 such as Sb2O4, V2O5 or amorphous V and Sb oxides but it is accepted that the active phase is the VSbO4 phase [52]."
          [42] "Its structure is derived from TiO2 rutile-type, with two Ti4+ cations formally substituted by one V and Sb cation with a cation deficiency related to the presence of V4+."
          [43] "The redox properties of the VSbO4 phase have been studied by electrical conductivity measurements [58]."
          [44] "This phase is an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the main charge carriers."
          [45] "The study of the changes in the electrical conductivity during alternative exposures to propane, oxygen and mixtures of propane and oxygen at the catalytic reaction temperature showed that it became a p-type semiconductor after reduction under propane (figure 8)."
          [46] "The existence of such irreversible change is supported by the fact that after the first reduction, the solid undergoes redox cycles that are not reversible and remain charac- teristic of a p-type semiconductor."
          [47] "The first increase in electrical conductivity under propane is related to that of the free electron concentration originating from ion- ized anionic vacancies formation according to the reaction:xC3H8  V40:64V30:28Sb50:92(0:16O4 ! V40:642xV30:282xSb50:92(0:16O4x  xC3H6  xH2O."
          [48] "The solid containing both cationic and anionic vacancies is not stable and a phase transformation should occur leading to a vanadium antimonate, richer in vanadium and supporting an antimony oxide, partially coating the surface."
          [49] "However, all the data obtained show that the active catalytic site at the surface of the vanadium antimonate could corre- spond to isolated vanadium species neighboring a cat- ionic vacancy [59,60]."
          [50] "Such arrangement should induce the stabilization of O) species allowing the activation of the alkane molecule."
          [51] "The structure of the active M1 phase has been solved and its detailed composition determined [66]."
          [52] "It corresponds to a network of MO6 octaedra (M = Mo, V and Nb) sharing corners or edges (figure 9a)."
          [53] "The heptagonal channels are empty and the hexagonal channels are occupied by tellurium or antimony cations and oxides forming chains in the direction of the chan- nels."
          [54] "It has been proposed that the activation of the alkane molecule occurred on the vanadium sites located in M7 position in the structure and that the activity of this site was explained by the resonance form in which vanadium underwent a charge transfer leading to a surface O)."
          [55] "This O) would be able to perform H abstraction from the propane molecule at the methylene position to produce a secondary propyl radical."
          [56] "A second step would correspond to a methyl abstraction to the oxygen on a neighboring tellurium cation [69]."
          [57] "The charge transfer is localized at the vanadium site on the surface and the M1 phase is, and remains in the conditions of catalytic test, n-type semi- conductor [70]."
          [58] "The direct charge transfer proposed in Eq. (13) may be not the only way to generate active O) sites at the surface of the M1 phase."
          [59] "A recent study of the phase Mo3Nb2O14, which presents a Mo5O14 type phase structure with pentagonal channels similar to those of the M1 phase, has shown that although only Mo6+ were expected to be present to balance the charge in the structure, Mo5+ were identified by EPR [71]."
          [60] "This feature was explained by the existence of a substitution disorder between Nb and Mo cations and the instability of the configuration in which l3 oxygen (O l3 in fig- ure 9b) were bonded to three Mo6+ atoms leading to the reduction of one of the Mo6+ atoms with the formation of a hole in the valence band."
          [61] "Taking into account Eq. (2), this could be expressed by the following equation: Mo6 Nb  O2 ! Mo5 Nb  O."
          [62] "However this later pathway should likely be a minor pathway as compared to the former."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, the rates of which can be measured from the effects of residence time on formation rates of alkenes and COx (CO and CO2)."
          [2] "Catalytic turnovers for oxidative dehydrogenation of MoOx and VOx proceed via reduction-oxidation cycles."
          [3] "These cycles involve the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms via pathways first proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."
          [4] "Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which involves the activation of the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms at the surface of reducible oxide domains."
          [5] "The catalytic sequence, depicted in Scheme 4, requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation."
          [6] "Thus, the ability to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO (DE2; Scheme 3) is likely to lead to significant catalytic consequences."
          [7] "The concurrent changes observed in absorption edge energies and in the stabilization of the transition state for CH bond cleavage and OH and CO bond formation reflect the increased ability of larger domains to accept electrons, consistent with their lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity."
          [8] "These trends are also consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis."
          [9] "For a given reactant (DE1, XH bond dissociation energy and H ionization energy,endothermic) and cluster (with protonation enthalpy DE3,exothermic), a lower lying LUMO (DE2) leads to a more exothermic H abstraction reaction (DHCH,abstr = DE1 + DE2 + DE3) and activation barrier (Eact,CH,abst) assuming an Evans-Polyani correlation of Eact,CH,abst and DHCH,abstr according to Eact,CH,abst = E0 + aDHCH,abstr,where E0 and a are constants."
          [10] "Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates (per Mo-atom) increased with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy, as the latter approaches values typical of saturated polymolybdate monolayers."
          [11] "These trends indicate that the reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become increasingly able to accept electron density and to stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps relative to smaller domains with higher-lying LUMO states."
          [12] "Ultimately, higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, which renders the use of the total number of Mo atoms inappropriate as a measure of the number of active sites."
          [13] "As a result, turnover rates reported on the basis of Mo atoms inevitably and ultimately decrease with increasing MoOx surface densities (Fig. 12) as a result of the prevalence of inaccessible Mo-oxo species."
          [14] "These catalytic trends resemble those reported previously for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane on VOx domains and for reactions of propane on MoOx domains dispersed on other supports."
          [15] "Similar trends have also been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains and on more reducible RuOx domains."
          [16] "The observed effects of domain size on catalysis parallel similar effects on the dynamics of their incipient stoichiometric reduction in H2, a process that leads to the formation of isolated vacancies and which resembles the elementary steps involved in the reduction part of catalytic dehydrogenation cycles."
          [17] "Stoichiometric reduction rates increased with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities,consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies."
          [18] "The mechanistic connections between oxidative dehydrogenation rates and the LMCT absorption edge in the electronic spectra of dispersed oxides are evident from the data shown in Fig. 13."
          [19] "Catalytic turnover rates on VOx, MoOx, WOx, and NbOx domains dispersed predominantly as monomers or two-dimensional oligomers on various supports (Al2O3, ZrO2, MgO) are shown as a function of their corresponding LMCT energies."
          [20] "For all active oxides, ODH turnover rates (per active metal atom) increased monotonically as LMCT energies decreased."
          [21] "These results indicate that the stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends sensitively on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates."
          [22] "The UV-visible absorption edge energy decreases as the energy level of the LUMO decreases and as the electron affinity of the cluster (Scheme 3, DE2) increases."
          [23] "These effects influence, in turn, the energies of intermediates and transition states that require electron transfer to the cluster."
          [24] "They lead to the exponential dependence of propane ODH turnover rates on LMCT absorption edge energies evident from Fig. 13."
          [25] "The identity of the metal has the strongest impact on both LMCT absorption edge energy and propane ODH turnover rates."
          [26] "More reducible supports and higher surface densities lead to higher propane ODH turnover rates for a given element and to lower edge energies and lower-lying LUMO states, which stabilize both the products and the transition state in CH bond activation steps."
          [27] "MoOx and VOx domains can be made similar in reactivity,in spite of their different chemical identities, by dispersing the latter as smaller domains or onto less reducible supports than the former."
          [28] "Thus, we conclude that quantum confinement effects, imposed by the size and electronic isolation of oxide domains, can be used to design materials with electronic properties and catalytic functions controlled by properties other than chemical composition."

[1] "The effect of cation identity on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways was examined using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2."
          [2] "The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2; the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence, suggesting that turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, which are in turn influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides."
          [3] "These results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces."
          [4] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
          [5] "The differences observed among VOx, MoOx, WOx and other oxides suggest that other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and therefore the acidbase properties of active oxides and of supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields."
          [6] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, 25,26 making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."
          [7] "The greater reactivity of propene arises in part because the weakest CH bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene."
          [8] "The limited available kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides leads us to expect that the reaction also occurs by the steps leading to eq 1."
          [9] "The similar site requirements for reactions 1 and 3 (suggested by the effects of VOx structure on selectivity)25,26 and the markedly different values of ΔS3 and ΔS1 measured (Table 2) indicate that propane ODH (reaction 1) and propene combustion (reaction 3) pathways involve transition states with different structures."
          [10] "The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy in step I and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species in step II (eq 7)."
          [11] "The apparent activation energy for propene combustion (ΔE3) is lower than for propene dehydrogenation (ΔE1) on all three catalysts (Table 2)."
          [12] "The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios (eq 12)."
          [13] "The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values (Table 2) indeed increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations."
          [14] "The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species seem to account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2; Figure 5)."
          [15] "Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts."

[1] "The partial oxidation of methane into more useful chemicals such as methanol, ethylene and benzene has been investigated extensively, although yields for these products have been poor14."
          [2] "Moreover, in several of these processes the required oxidant is N2O rather than O2."
          [3] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."
          [4] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."

          [6] "The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity."
          [7] "The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their clea- vage should be the rst step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons."
          [8] "The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons (Table 1), CH bonds on secondary and tertiary car- bons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites."
          [9] "The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an afnity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst."
          [10] "The afnity between the hydrocarbon and the sur- face promotes the activation of the molecules. Selec- tivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species."

[1] "The accent is put on the mechanisms and the kinetic models used for the description of this reaction. The main catalysts for ODH of light alkanes and the specific features of each type of alkane are discussed. Influence of the type of supports, promoters, acid base properties, type of oxygen on the performance of ODH reaction is also discussed."
          [2] "The procedures of establishing the mechanism of a chemical reaction are mainly based on a comparison of experimental kinetic dependencies with theoretical equations, established on the basis of some model mechanisms and assumed to be valid under corresponding conditions."
          [3] "The determination of a molecular mechanism is a difficult task and requires use of advanced experimental and computational techniques."
          [4] "The scope of this article is to review fundamental kinetic models used in analysis of the experimental data and the proposed mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes."
          [5] "The nature of alkane influences not only reactivity, but also the choice of catalyst."
          [6] "Catalysts based on reducible transition metal oxides."
          [7] "Other catalysts such as B/P oxides, Ga/zeolite, LaF3/SmO, and Sn/P."
          [8] "The systems studied so far for ODH of light alkanes such as ethane, propane, n-butane, etc., can be approximately classified into three groups."
          [9] "The best catalytic systems in ODHE are often very poor in the ODH of higher alkanes and vice versa."
          [10] "Other factors influencing selectivity and activity of the catalytic systems are the reaction conditions (feed mixture, temperature, and contact time)."
          [11] "Therefore, catalyst selection has to be linked to the type of alkane and the reaction conditions."
          [12] "The main effect of the chlorine ions is to generate ethyl radical species, and this effect is critical for achieving a high ethene yield (above 30%)."
          [13] "The ethoxide ions may either decompose to ethene or be further oxidized to CO and CO2."
          [14] "The coordination number of the active center also affects the path of the ODH reaction."
          [15] "The environment of the active center on which the dissociation of alkane proceeds may vary between several configurations."
          [16] "As has been shown, for the vanadium-based catalysts different types of vanadium species could be correlated with different behaviors of the catalysts."
          [17] "Strength and reducibility of the bridging V-O-support oxygen ions play an important role, and the formation of the acid and/or basic centers depends on the nature of the support and, in the case of the doped catalysts, on the basicity of the additive."
          [18] "As a result, the rate of formation of the olefinic intermediate and the olefin desorption seem to depend on the acid-base character of the catalysts."

[1] "The chemistry of Cr on amorphous surfaces or on the surfaces of molecular sieves is quite similar."
          [2] "Supported Cr ions are mobile and possess a high reactivity toward various molecules, like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water."
          [3] "In general, the redox behavior is support type- and composition-dependent and supported Cr ions are easier to reduce on chemically softer supports."
          [4] "The oxide support acts as a ligand that controls the redox properties of the supported Cr ions."
          [5] "Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ are present, each under different coordination and polymerization degrees, depending on the support type and composition."
          [6] "A tendency toward the formation of polychromates is observed for higher loadings and lower surface areas."
          [7] "After calcination, chromium oxides are anchored onto the surface by reactions with the hydroxyl groups and their molecular structure is determined by the composition and type of the support, the Cr loading, and the treatment."
          [8] "The chemistry of Cr at the surface is determined by the isoelectric point, the surface area of the support, and the Cr loading."
          [9] "The chemistry of Cr on amorphous surfaces or on the surfaces of molecular sieves is quite similar."

[1] "The acid-base character of metal oxide support influences the dispersion of vanadium on the surface of the support, as well as the nature of the vanadium species."
          [2] "The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species and the acid-base character of catalysts, in addition to their catalytic properties in the ODH of Cz-C4 alkanes, strongly depend on the metal oxide used as support and the vanadium loading."
          [3] "In this way, it appears that tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2C4 alkanes."
          [4] "The effect of the coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites on the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts are discussed."
          [5] "It is concluded that these are important factors that must be considered to develop selective catalysts in ODH reactions."
          [6] "The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength,better thermal stability and larger surface area."
          [7] "However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading."
          [8] "In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."
          [9] "This is the case of vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO), that show a high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane [25,27,28], propane [26,29-31] and ethylben- zene [32]; or V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides which are selective catalysts in the ODH of ethane [33,34]."
          [10] "More recently, it has also been shown that V-containing molecular sieves are highly selective for the oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidation of ethane [35,36] and propane [37-39]."
          [11] "However, although several catalytic system have been studied [17-21], the nature of the active and selective sites is not well known yet."
          [12] "The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are usually related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species which can modify its redox properties."
          [13] "In order to better establish the influence of the support, a number of papers have been devoted to the study of monolayer systems (monomolecular dispersion in which the oxide is maximally influenced by the support) to optimize the dispersion of the active sites [13-16]."
          [14] "From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support."
          [15] "However, in spite of the variety of catalytic system studied, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under discussion."
          [16] "Since the structure-activity/selectivity correlation could be expected to change with the alkane fed, the aim of the present paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts, as well as the structure and properties of different catalytic systems, in order to understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts."

[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
          [2] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
          [3] "The contribution to COx formation, conversely, mainly derives from adsorbed O species, at least in ethane ODH."
          [4] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
          [5] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
          [6] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V,modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
          [7] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
          [8] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
          [9] "In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used."
          [10] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."
          [11] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction."
          [2] "One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane."
          [3] "This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities."
          [4] "ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass."
          [5] "In fact, the corresponding supported systems give usually much higher activity and selectivity; they are discussed in more detail in section (vide infra)."
          [6] "Of several other systems that have been investigated, MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), (99, 100) VMgOx, (98, 101, 102) VSiZrOx, (103, 104) and CrSiMO (M = Al or Zr) (105) show relatively high selectivities."
          [7] "In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."
          [8] "Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant."
          [9] "It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6)."
          [10] "An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Scheme 5b)."
          [11] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers an energetically attractive route to the production of alkenes (i.e., RCH2CH3 + O2  RCHCH2 + H2O). Since ethane is the second most major component of natural gas and is also a main product in many methane-coupling reactions, its transformation to ethene at low temperature is of considerable interest. The metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active (10% of conversion at 559 K) and selective (100%) than other mixed-metal oxides (MoV, MoMn, MoTi, etc.)."
          [2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane may provide an attractive route to the production of propylene and could be a good alternative to conventional dehydrogenation and cracking processes. Various Nb-containing catalysts were studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Smits et al. 143 found that niobium oxide shows a very high selectivity in this reaction although the conversion was very low (Figure 9). The activity of the niobia was improved without diminishing its selectivity by adding other suitable elements (V, Cr, Mo)."
          [3] "The influence of various preparation methods on the performance of the VNbO catalysts also was investigated by Smits et al. 144,145 They found that the activity and selectivity of a given vanadium site depends on the nature of its neighboring atoms. Vanadium neighbors promote the activity, while niobium neighbors promote the selectivity. Niobium is much more difficult to reduce than vanadium and this feature improves the selectivity, since facile reduction often causes low selectivity in these reactions."



The concepts of oxidation began with Lavoisier's disproving of the phlogiston theory in 1773. One usually defines two groups of reactions namely homolytic and heterolytic. The first type involves radicals formed by homolytic * Corresponding author. cleavage of interatomic bonds. The second type involves an active oxygen compound or a metal ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two electrons transfer reaction. The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step.
The mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction.
An adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer.
It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reac- tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned.
The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one elec- tron to the metal.
Depending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties.
Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring.
Case (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins.
Case (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking).
Such a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present.
For instance in the work by Volta et al.,it was shown that single crystal type samples of MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and (101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to acrolein and CO x [4].
The originality of the work was to synthesize crystals of various shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite.
A more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5].
It is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al- Table 1 Structure sensitivity of the different faces of MoO 3 crystals in olefin oxidation at 380C ([4]) Reactant olefin products Relative selectivity per faces Reactant olefin Products Basal (010) Side (100) Apical (101), (1) Propene Acrolein 0.06 2.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 But- 1 -ene Butadiene 3 9.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 Isobutene Methacrolein 0 0.6 Acetone 0.06 0 CO, CO 2 0 1 0.7 0 2 0 0.1 0.06 0 6
Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds. For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons. It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].
The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.
One very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.
In some cases the chemical effect of the support will be determining for catalytic proper- ties. For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide supports (SiO 2, TiO 2, A1203) were shown by Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.
An important parameter for the impregnation method is the pH of the molybdate solution. As a matter of fact the following equilibrium has been well established: MovO64 + 4HzO , 7MoO 2- + 8H +
The monomeric tetrahedral MoO4 z- species is favored at higher pH and vice versa for the polymeric heptamolybdate anion.
Moreover one defines the so-called isoelectric point of the support (ieps) or zero point charge (zpc) of a support by the pH value for which the surface charge turns from anionic to cationic, i.e. will allow cations or anions from the liquid phase to be adsorbed, respectively.
One has values of 2 for silica, 5-6 for titania, 8 for alumina, etc.
This clearly shows that the size of the adsorbed anion (monomeric or polymeric) adsorbed on a support will depend on the ieps (zpc) value, i.e. on the support itself.
Above the ieps value, the surface of a particular oxide is negatively charged and vice versa below.
The anion will thus be adsorbed for a pH value below the ieps value and as said above a lower pH value will favor polymolybdate anionic species.
The former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.
The formation of the former species was described by the reaction in Scheme 2.
Catalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation.
The first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.
One gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air.
The experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings.
This indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7).
The second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8).
Weak activity was observed for low Mo loading.
At higher Mo loading propanal was the major product while acrolein was also observed.
At very high Mo loadings and for MoO 3 one gets almost exclu- 2,0 1,5 Propana ' 1,0 0 o,5 Acrolein " 0,0 ,,,,,0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Mo loading (wt %) Fig. 8. Propene oxidation to acrolein (nucleophilic attack) and propanal (electrophilic attack) at 400C on MoO 3/SiO 2 catalysts versus Mo loading (from [23]).
Propanal is known to stem from propene by an electrophilic attack while acrolein corresponds rather to a nucleophilic attack.
These results indicate that monomeric MoO 2- species does not oxidize propene in our condi- tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- ing rather electrophilic.
Molybdenum oxide ex- hibits redox properties with 0 2- species being rather nucleophilic.
One can thus realise how the size of the active site is important in oxida- tion catalysis.
This is typical of structure sensi- tive reaction.
Such a catalyst is well known for several reactions, such as o-xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia.
The anatase form of TiO 2 appears to be better than the rutile form.
Such catalysts with 1 and 8 wt% V2Os/anatase was prepared by RhSne-Poulenc (S  10 m 2 g-1) for an exercise of characterization by 25 different European laboratories.
All results are assembled in a special issue of Catalysis Today published in May 1994, Vol. 20, no. 1.
Surface vanadium species were observed to exist in three different forms: monomeric VO43- species,polymeric vanadate species and V205 crystal-
The following conclusions could be drawn considering that a polyvanadate species occu- pies a ca circular zone of a diameter of 0.38 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.165 nm 2) and an isolated monovanadate species 0.66 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.43 nm2):
(i) Monomeric VO 3- species exhibit acidic character with OH groups (BriSnsted acidity) and result in propene formation for isopropanol conversion and in total oxidation for o-xylene oxidation.
Maximum coverage equals 0.43 wt% V205.
(ii) Polyvanadate surface species exhibit re- dox properties, namely give rise to acetone for isopropanol conversion and phthalic anhydride for o-xylene oxidation.
(iii) V205 crystallites exhibit low activity for o-xylene conversion and high selectivity in total oxidation.
The size of the polyvanadate species in solu- tion corresponds to V3093-, V402 with tetrahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 7 and 4.5 respec- tively and V10068 - or V10028H 5- with octahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 2.5.
Deposition of such polyvanadates of different sizes was per- formed carefully on "y-A1203 support and their initial structures depicted above were shown to remain stable even after calcination in flowing air at 500C and to be only partly modified after catalytic reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the 350 to 450C range.
Moreover in such cases, the selectivity towards propene was observed to be the same at the same con- version level, indicating that in this size domain of polyvanadate species the catalytic selectivity was not changed, only the activity was observed to increase with vanadium loading [27].
In a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations ex- changed or impregnated on the surface of zirco- nium hydrogenophosphates and compared to vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phos- phate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 500C were observed when the material present either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 6 octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 4 re- spectively or chains of limited size [28].
By comparison with bulk oxides exhibiting similar environment, it was suggested as for supported VO and CrO x species on zirconium hy- drogenophosphates that the catalytic perfor- mances were related to the stronger basic char- acter of PO 3- anions with respect to 0 2- an- ions.
Some general conclusions may be drawn from this general presentation:(i) Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heteroge- neous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice 12
J.C. Vedrine et al. / Catalysis Today 33 (1997) 3-13
oxygen ions.
Such ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring.
(ii) Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts.
A pecu- liar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst.
Parameters such as reducibility and reoxidability features of the oxides are very important for catalytic reac- tions.
(iii) Active sites for oxidation reactions ap- pear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influ- ences the catalytic properties.
In some examples the number of atoms constituting the active sites could be established.
For instance double trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra are particularly active and selective for oxidative dehydrogena- tion of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates; ensembles of four dimers of VO 6 octahedra are suggested to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhy- dride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts.
Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties.
At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many par- tial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide.
It is thus clear that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is important depending on the reaction considered and the support used.
The characteri- zation of such 'clusters' lying on the surface is rather difficult and the above statements for supported oxide catalysts are only qualitative.
To better characterize such clusters, techniques as XANES (sensitive to local symmetry type), EXAFS (sensitive to the coordination number and nearby element distances) and radial elec- tron distribution (RED) of X-ray diffraction peaks (sensitive to the nearby element dis- tances) have to be used.
Already data have been obtained for MoO 3 and V205 deposited on SiO 2, A1203 or TiO 2 support.
This holds true only if one has one type of cluster species to analyse.
The reader interested may read a chapter de- voted to XANES and EXAFS techniques by Moraweck in the book by Imelik and Vdrine (1988 and 1994) ([29,30]).
(iv) Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions.
This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice.
This latter phenomenon results from the wetting effect particularly for multicomponent and supported oxide catalysts.
It follows that for many catalysts a certain time on stream is nec- essary before the catalyst reaches its steady state.
It is frequent that in an industrial plant a steady state is reached only after one or two hundreds hours, the catalysts lasting several years before having to be replaced.
For simple catalysts as doped vanadyl pyrophosphates used for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the right size of the active sites (e.g. tetramers of vanadyl dimers) is monitored by the reactants in catalytic reaction conditions leading to the right VS+/V 4+ ratio, by the preparation procedure to change the material morphology (the (100) face of (VO)2P20 7 being developed), and by the adequate addition of additive elements which regulate the site size and VS+/V 4+ ion ratio.
The view of an oxidation catalyst as dynamical under catalytic reaction conditions is essential for our understanding of its functioning.

[1] "The selective oxidation to propylene probably also needs BrSnsted acid sites as shown recently by Moro-oka and Ueda [155] for the MoMgO catalysts."
          [2] "The different steps of the routes to propylene and COx, respectively, are probably differently sensitive to the acid-base nature and strength of the used catalyst."
          [3] "In the mean time, the C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic and the propyl species thus produced should be a propyl radical [35,158,159]."
          [4] "High temperature favors the alkyl desorption route [158,159] whereas low reaction temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reaction routes [148,159,163]."
          [5] "So, propane oxidation over V containing catalysts is considered to be initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
          [6] "It must be mentioned that heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond was also proposed in the ODHR of propane."
          [7] "The former process should be expected to occur on acidic catalysts whereas the latter supposes rather basic catalysts."
          [8] "In fact, it should be considered that redox equilibria coexist at the catalyst surface whatever the initial mode (homolytic or heterolytic) of activation as shown below:"
          [9] "A concerted mechanism (Scheme 6A) should be thus considered: the transition state in this case is probably of lower energy since it involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds."
          [10] "In this mechanism the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst play a role as a whole in only one step."
          [11] "Another mode of activation of propane should be its adsorption as alkoxy species, that is, the occurrence of the direct insertion of a lattice oxygen atom into a C-H bond (see also Scheme 6B):"
          [12] "The alkoxy species then decomposes to propylene."
          [13] "This decomposition needs the presence of BrSnsted acid sites as can be deduced from the finding of Moro-oka and Ueda [155] of the correlation between the propylene formation from propane and the number of the BriSnsted acid sites in the case of the MoMgO catalysts."
          [14] "The alkoxy route here proposed is also supported by the in-situ FT-IR studies of Finnochio et al. [169] showing the formation of propyloxy surface species as intermediate to propylene during the oxidation of propane over CrMoO catalysts."
          [15] "The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts."
          [16] "The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical."
          [17] "High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions."
          [18] "A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed."
          [19] "Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts."

"CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]."
          "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2)."
          "On the other side, the selectivity in ethylene increases with the copper content and decreases for Cu/Th > 0.25."
          "The conversion of propane is closely correlated to the copper concentration ThO 2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains constant for larger atomic ratios."
          "the selectivity in propene increases rapidly with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and finally decreases for higher atomic ratios."
          "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of Cue may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."
          "Consequently,the selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by MI, M 2 and D signals."
          "In the case of propane, the catalytic activity may be due to the presence of Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface (MI, M 2 and D) since the formation of CuO crystallites particularly at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the conversion."
          "Therefore, the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites (A 1 and A 2) rather than other sites."

[1] "The search of catalysts for the partial oxidation of light alkanes appears to both industrial and academic researchers as a difficult but promising challenge in heterogeneous catalysis."
          [2] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydro- carbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."
          [3] "The complexity of selective alkane oxidation reac- tions arises from the number of possible simultaneous reaction pathways, each of them with several reaction steps occurring on the adsorbed phase without desorb- ing."
          [4] "Different pathways have been proposed, but no single mechanism stands out [35]."
          [5] "The goal of this paper is to attempt to propose a common activation site to several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation."
          [6] "The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule cor- responds to an oxidative dehydrogenation."
          [7] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed [3]."
          [8] "The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation like long-range electron delocalization and high electron mobility."
          [9] "It appears that such an approach should be restricted to alkane activation sites and a complete mod- eling of the reaction process would necessitate to encompass the dynamic of the surface and the adsorbed species [3,10] as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid [11,12]."
          [10] "The electrical conductivity can be expressed as:r  elhp  elen 1 where e denotes the charge of electron, l the electrons (e) or holes (h) mobility and n and p the electron and hole concentration."
          [11] "The conduction mechanism can be identified by perturbing the charge carrier concentration using O2 as a probe."
          [12] "p-type semi-conductors are characterized by an excess of lattice O2) anions, Mx+O(x/2) 2) i.e., cationic vacancies in closed- packed oxide structures."
          [13] "n-type semiconductors are characterized by a deficit in lattice O2) anions Mx+O(x/2) 2) accounted for by the existence of anionic vacancies VO2."
          [14] "The structure, as it appears in this plane, consists of pairs of edge sharing VO6 octahedra linked to each other by P2O7 pyrophosphate groups."
          [15] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."
          [16] "It has been shown that n-butane could be activated in the absence of gas phase oxygen and that lattice oxygen was involved [27]; this proposal was confirmed by TAP experiments indicating that nearly all the oxygen incorporated into the oxygenated products came from the lattice [28]."
          [17] "Several mechanisms involving different sites have been proposed for the first step of the reaction (figure 1)."
          [18] "It has been demonstrated that the (VO)2P2O7 phase was a p-type semi-conductor [33]."
          [19] "The existence of vanadium sites with a vanadium vacancy (h in figure 2b) is improbable although the presence of protons would fit with Bro nsted sites titration with K + experiments showing surface protons concentration twice that expected from idealized models of (1,0,0) plane [34] and the presence of vanadium vacancies would fit with the observation by XPS of a surface P/V ratio greater than one."
          [20] "The more probable catalytic site should be that of figure 2(a) already pos- tulated [31] and the reaction on this site could involve two hydrogens abstraction with the formation of two hydroxyls groups and the transfer of one electron from the hydrocarbon to a vanadium cation as following:"
          [21] "The two neighboring close sites would allow two methylene H abstraction explaining the discrimination between methylene and methyl CH bond observed [25,26]."
          [22] "The role of a superoxide or peroxo species had already been proposed in the case of other light alkanes activation although they should not be stable in the presence of the alkane as shown for su- peroxo species by EPR."
          [23] "It is important to note that the O) species proposed to be involved in the activation of n-butane in this paper,although they present electrophilic properties, should be more strongly bound and have a much lower mobility."
          [24] "The involvement of O) species for light alkanes activation has already been suggested from thermody- namic considerations [39]."
          [25] "It was proposed that the activation of the first CH bond of an alkane involved very reactive oxygen that was weakly bound and pro- posed that weakly adsorbed O) could play that role."
          [26] "However it has been often stressed that very weakly bound surface O) promoted the formation of CC cleavage and were responsible for total oxidation."
          [27] "The same observation was made in the case study of titanium pyrophosphate presented later."
          [28] "Dopants have been shown to influence strongly the catalytic properties of the VPO catalysts [40,41]."
          [29] "It has been shown that Co favored a higher V5+/V4+ ratio under fuel rich condition and maintained a higher surface distribution of the V, P and O atoms [44]."
          [30] "The two most efficient catalysts ZrP2O7 and TiP2O7 appeared to be p-type semiconductors under air with positive holes as the main charge carriers like (VO)2P2O7."
          [31] "They became n-type when contacted with n- butane [47] (figure 7)."
          [32] "These results explained the difference in catalytic reaction mechanism encountered on the two solids."
          [33] "The alkane activation can be related in both cases to the p-type semi-con- ducting properties of the solids, likely through hydrogen abstraction by a surface O) species."
          [34] "However on ZrP2O7, Zr cannot change its valence state easily and the catalytic site will only abstract one hydrogen forming a C4H9 radical."
          [35] "In the case of TiP2O7, the same type of mechanism takes place below 450 C when Ti cannot be reduced."
          [36] "However above this temperature, it has been shown that Ti can be reduced and another mechanism is occurring that has not yet been completely elucidated."
          [37] "The two mechanisms have different activation ener- gies and more importantly the butene-1/butene-2 ratio is different."
          [38] "On ZrP2O7 and on TiP2O7 at low temperature,the ratio is close to 1.5 whereas it is close to 0.5 on TiP2O7 at high temperature."
          [39] "In the first case, after the first methylene H abstraction, the probability for the second H abstraction is independant of the first abstraction and the probability of abstraction of a methyl or methylene H is only a function of the relative abundance of the different species (6/4)."
          [40] "In the second case, the mechanism would involve an adsorbed intermediate and the stabil- ization of 1 or 2-butene is governed by thermodynamics (1/2)."
          [41] "The VSbO catalysts can contain several phases besides VSbO4 such as Sb2O4, V2O5 or amorphous V and Sb oxides but it is accepted that the active phase is the VSbO4 phase [52]."
          [42] "Its structure is derived from TiO2 rutile-type, with two Ti4+ cations formally substituted by one V and Sb cation with a cation deficiency related to the presence of V4+."
          [43] "The redox properties of the VSbO4 phase have been studied by electrical conductivity measurements [58]."
          [44] "This phase is an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the main charge carriers."
          [45] "The study of the changes in the electrical conductivity during alternative exposures to propane, oxygen and mixtures of propane and oxygen at the catalytic reaction temperature showed that it became a p-type semiconductor after reduction under propane (figure 8)."
          [46] "The existence of such irreversible change is supported by the fact that after the first reduction, the solid undergoes redox cycles that are not reversible and remain charac- teristic of a p-type semiconductor."
          [47] "The first increase in electrical conductivity under propane is related to that of the free electron concentration originating from ion- ized anionic vacancies formation according to the reaction:xC3H8  V40:64V30:28Sb50:92(0:16O4 ! V40:642xV30:282xSb50:92(0:16O4x  xC3H6  xH2O."
          [48] "The solid containing both cationic and anionic vacancies is not stable and a phase transformation should occur leading to a vanadium antimonate, richer in vanadium and supporting an antimony oxide, partially coating the surface."
          [49] "However, all the data obtained show that the active catalytic site at the surface of the vanadium antimonate could corre- spond to isolated vanadium species neighboring a cat- ionic vacancy [59,60]."
          [50] "Such arrangement should induce the stabilization of O) species allowing the activation of the alkane molecule."
          [51] "The structure of the active M1 phase has been solved and its detailed composition determined [66]."
          [52] "It corresponds to a network of MO6 octaedra (M = Mo, V and Nb) sharing corners or edges (figure 9a)."
          [53] "The heptagonal channels are empty and the hexagonal channels are occupied by tellurium or antimony cations and oxides forming chains in the direction of the chan- nels."
          [54] "It has been proposed that the activation of the alkane molecule occurred on the vanadium sites located in M7 position in the structure and that the activity of this site was explained by the resonance form in which vanadium underwent a charge transfer leading to a surface O)."
          [55] "This O) would be able to perform H abstraction from the propane molecule at the methylene position to produce a secondary propyl radical."
          [56] "A second step would correspond to a methyl abstraction to the oxygen on a neighboring tellurium cation [69]."
          [57] "The charge transfer is localized at the vanadium site on the surface and the M1 phase is, and remains in the conditions of catalytic test, n-type semi- conductor [70]."
          [58] "The direct charge transfer proposed in Eq. (13) may be not the only way to generate active O) sites at the surface of the M1 phase."
          [59] "A recent study of the phase Mo3Nb2O14, which presents a Mo5O14 type phase structure with pentagonal channels similar to those of the M1 phase, has shown that although only Mo6+ were expected to be present to balance the charge in the structure, Mo5+ were identified by EPR [71]."
          [60] "This feature was explained by the existence of a substitution disorder between Nb and Mo cations and the instability of the configuration in which l3 oxygen (O l3 in fig- ure 9b) were bonded to three Mo6+ atoms leading to the reduction of one of the Mo6+ atoms with the formation of a hole in the valence band."
          [61] "Taking into account Eq. (2), this could be expressed by the following equation: Mo6 Nb  O2 ! Mo5 Nb  O."
          [62] "However this later pathway should likely be a minor pathway as compared to the former."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, the rates of which can be measured from the effects of residence time on formation rates of alkenes and COx (CO and CO2)."
          [2] "Catalytic turnovers for oxidative dehydrogenation of MoOx and VOx proceed via reduction-oxidation cycles."
          [3] "These cycles involve the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms via pathways first proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."
          [4] "Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which involves the activation of the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms at the surface of reducible oxide domains."
          [5] "The catalytic sequence, depicted in Scheme 4, requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation."
          [6] "Thus, the ability to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO (DE2; Scheme 3) is likely to lead to significant catalytic consequences."
          [7] "The concurrent changes observed in absorption edge energies and in the stabilization of the transition state for CH bond cleavage and OH and CO bond formation reflect the increased ability of larger domains to accept electrons, consistent with their lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity."
          [8] "These trends are also consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis."
          [9] "For a given reactant (DE1, XH bond dissociation energy and H ionization energy,endothermic) and cluster (with protonation enthalpy DE3,exothermic), a lower lying LUMO (DE2) leads to a more exothermic H abstraction reaction (DHCH,abstr = DE1 + DE2 + DE3) and activation barrier (Eact,CH,abst) assuming an Evans-Polyani correlation of Eact,CH,abst and DHCH,abstr according to Eact,CH,abst = E0 + aDHCH,abstr,where E0 and a are constants."
          [10] "Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates (per Mo-atom) increased with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy, as the latter approaches values typical of saturated polymolybdate monolayers."
          [11] "These trends indicate that the reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become increasingly able to accept electron density and to stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps relative to smaller domains with higher-lying LUMO states."
          [12] "Ultimately, higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, which renders the use of the total number of Mo atoms inappropriate as a measure of the number of active sites."
          [13] "As a result, turnover rates reported on the basis of Mo atoms inevitably and ultimately decrease with increasing MoOx surface densities (Fig. 12) as a result of the prevalence of inaccessible Mo-oxo species."
          [14] "These catalytic trends resemble those reported previously for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane on VOx domains and for reactions of propane on MoOx domains dispersed on other supports."
          [15] "Similar trends have also been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains and on more reducible RuOx domains."
          [16] "The observed effects of domain size on catalysis parallel similar effects on the dynamics of their incipient stoichiometric reduction in H2, a process that leads to the formation of isolated vacancies and which resembles the elementary steps involved in the reduction part of catalytic dehydrogenation cycles."
          [17] "Stoichiometric reduction rates increased with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities,consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies."
          [18] "The mechanistic connections between oxidative dehydrogenation rates and the LMCT absorption edge in the electronic spectra of dispersed oxides are evident from the data shown in Fig. 13."
          [19] "Catalytic turnover rates on VOx, MoOx, WOx, and NbOx domains dispersed predominantly as monomers or two-dimensional oligomers on various supports (Al2O3, ZrO2, MgO) are shown as a function of their corresponding LMCT energies."
          [20] "For all active oxides, ODH turnover rates (per active metal atom) increased monotonically as LMCT energies decreased."
          [21] "These results indicate that the stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends sensitively on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates."
          [22] "The UV-visible absorption edge energy decreases as the energy level of the LUMO decreases and as the electron affinity of the cluster (Scheme 3, DE2) increases."
          [23] "These effects influence, in turn, the energies of intermediates and transition states that require electron transfer to the cluster."
          [24] "They lead to the exponential dependence of propane ODH turnover rates on LMCT absorption edge energies evident from Fig. 13."
          [25] "The identity of the metal has the strongest impact on both LMCT absorption edge energy and propane ODH turnover rates."
          [26] "More reducible supports and higher surface densities lead to higher propane ODH turnover rates for a given element and to lower edge energies and lower-lying LUMO states, which stabilize both the products and the transition state in CH bond activation steps."
          [27] "MoOx and VOx domains can be made similar in reactivity,in spite of their different chemical identities, by dispersing the latter as smaller domains or onto less reducible supports than the former."
          [28] "Thus, we conclude that quantum confinement effects, imposed by the size and electronic isolation of oxide domains, can be used to design materials with electronic properties and catalytic functions controlled by properties other than chemical composition."

[1] "The effect of cation identity on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways was examined using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2."
          [2] "The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2; the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence, suggesting that turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, which are in turn influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides."
          [3] "These results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces."
          [4] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
          [5] "The differences observed among VOx, MoOx, WOx and other oxides suggest that other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and therefore the acidbase properties of active oxides and of supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields."
          [6] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, 25,26 making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."
          [7] "The greater reactivity of propene arises in part because the weakest CH bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene."
          [8] "The limited available kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides leads us to expect that the reaction also occurs by the steps leading to eq 1."
          [9] "The similar site requirements for reactions 1 and 3 (suggested by the effects of VOx structure on selectivity)25,26 and the markedly different values of ΔS3 and ΔS1 measured (Table 2) indicate that propane ODH (reaction 1) and propene combustion (reaction 3) pathways involve transition states with different structures."
          [10] "The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy in step I and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species in step II (eq 7)."
          [11] "The apparent activation energy for propene combustion (ΔE3) is lower than for propene dehydrogenation (ΔE1) on all three catalysts (Table 2)."
          [12] "The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios (eq 12)."
          [13] "The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values (Table 2) indeed increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations."
          [14] "The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species seem to account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2; Figure 5)."
          [15] "Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts."

[1] "The partial oxidation of methane into more useful chemicals such as methanol, ethylene and benzene has been investigated extensively, although yields for these products have been poor14."
          [2] "Moreover, in several of these processes the required oxidant is N2O rather than O2."
          [3] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."
          [4] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."
          [5] "We report here our success in converting CH4 to C2 compounds in high yields in conventional catalytic conditions."

[1] "The activation of alkanes is more difcult than that of the corresponding olens,but their large reserves underline the economic inter- est in their conversion."
          [2] "The selective conversion of parafns to aromatics, to olens or to organic molecules con- taining oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products."
          [3] "The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial pro- cesses."
          [4] "The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydro- carbons would provide an attractive alternative."
          [5] "The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implica- tions in catalytic performance are discussed, under- lining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies."
          [6] "The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity."
          [7] "The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their clea- vage should be the rst step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons."
          [8] "The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons (Table 1), CH bonds on secondary and tertiary car- bons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites."
          [9] "The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an afnity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst."
          [10] "The afnity between the hydrocarbon and the sur- face promotes the activation of the molecules. Selec- tivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species."
          [11] "The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance,because it determines how fast the surface intermedi- ates react."
          [12] "The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation."
          [13] "The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduc- tion with hydrogen or hydrocarbon."
          [14] "The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2- oxygenates."
          [15] "The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions."
          [16] "The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen spe- cies is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation."
          [17] "The presence of water in the reaction feed, decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen containing species."
          [18] "The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity."
          [19] "The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation."
          [20] "The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support."
          [21] "The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility."
          [22] "The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vana- dium oxide catalysts has been explored."
          [23] "Both, acidbase and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane."
          [24] "The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modies the redox properties and increases the acidic proper- ties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene."
          [25] "The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxida- tion state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te."
          [26] "It has been proposed that the high afnity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene."
          [27] "The addition of acidic niobia has no effect on the structure of supported vanadium oxide species."
          [28] "The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modies the redox properties and increases the acidic proper- ties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene."
          [29] "The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxida- tion state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te."

          [17] "Strength and reducibility of the bridging V-O-support oxygen ions play an important role, and the formation of the acid and/or basic centers depends on the nature of the support and, in the case of the doped catalysts, on the basicity of the additive."

          [2] "The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species and the acid-base character of catalysts, in addition to their catalytic properties in the ODH of Cz-C4 alkanes, strongly depend on the metal oxide used as support and the vanadium loading."

          [6] "The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength,better thermal stability and larger surface area."
          [7] "However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading."
          [8] "In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."
          [9] "This is the case of vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO), that show a high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane [25,27,28], propane [26,29-31] and ethylben- zene [32]; or V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides which are selective catalysts in the ODH of ethane [33,34]."
          [10] "More recently, it has also been shown that V-containing molecular sieves are highly selective for the oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidation of ethane [35,36] and propane [37-39]."

          [12] "The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are usually related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species which can modify its redox properties."
          [13] "In order to better establish the influence of the support, a number of papers have been devoted to the study of monolayer systems (monomolecular dispersion in which the oxide is maximally influenced by the support) to optimize the dispersion of the active sites [13-16]."
          [14] "From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support."
          [15] "However, in spite of the variety of catalytic system studied, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under discussion."
          [16] "Since the structure-activity/selectivity correlation could be expected to change with the alkane fed, the aim of the present paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts, as well as the structure and properties of different catalytic systems, in order to understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts."

[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
          [2] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
          [3] "The contribution to COx formation, conversely, mainly derives from adsorbed O species, at least in ethane ODH."
          [4] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
          [5] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
          [6] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V,modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
          [7] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
          [8] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
          [9] "In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used."
          [10] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."
          [11] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction."
          [2] "One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane."
          [3] "This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities."
          [4] "ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass."
          [5] "In fact, the corresponding supported systems give usually much higher activity and selectivity; they are discussed in more detail in section (vide infra)."
          [6] "Of several other systems that have been investigated, MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), (99, 100) VMgOx, (98, 101, 102) VSiZrOx, (103, 104) and CrSiMO (M = Al or Zr) (105) show relatively high selectivities."
          [7] "In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."
          [8] "Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant."
          [9] "It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6)."
          [10] "An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Scheme 5b)."
          [11] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers an energetically attractive route to the production of alkenes (i.e., RCH2CH3 + O2  RCHCH2 + H2O). Since ethane is the second most major component of natural gas and is also a main product in many methane-coupling reactions, its transformation to ethene at low temperature is of considerable interest. The metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active (10% of conversion at 559 K) and selective (100%) than other mixed-metal oxides (MoV, MoMn, MoTi, etc.)."
          [2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane may provide an attractive route to the production of propylene and could be a good alternative to conventional dehydrogenation and cracking processes. Various Nb-containing catalysts were studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Smits et al. 143 found that niobium oxide shows a very high selectivity in this reaction although the conversion was very low (Figure 9). The activity of the niobia was improved without diminishing its selectivity by adding other suitable elements (V, Cr, Mo)."
          [3] "The influence of various preparation methods on the performance of the VNbO catalysts also was investigated by Smits et al. 144,145 They found that the activity and selectivity of a given vanadium site depends on the nature of its neighboring atoms. Vanadium neighbors promote the activity, while niobium neighbors promote the selectivity. Niobium is much more difficult to reduce than vanadium and this feature improves the selectivity, since facile reduction often causes low selectivity in these reactions."



The concepts of oxidation began with Lavoisier's disproving of the phlogiston theory in 1773. One usually defines two groups of reactions namely homolytic and heterolytic. The first type involves radicals formed by homolytic * Corresponding author. cleavage of interatomic bonds. The second type involves an active oxygen compound or a metal ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two electrons transfer reaction. The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step.
The mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction.
An adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer.
It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reac- tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned.
The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one elec- tron to the metal.
Depending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties.
Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring.
Case (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins.
Case (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking).
Such a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present.
For instance in the work by Volta et al.,it was shown that single crystal type samples of MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and (101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to acrolein and CO x [4].
The originality of the work was to synthesize crystals of various shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite.
A more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5].
It is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al- Table 1 Structure sensitivity of the different faces of MoO 3 crystals in olefin oxidation at 380C ([4]) Reactant olefin products Relative selectivity per faces Reactant olefin Products Basal (010) Side (100) Apical (101), (1) Propene Acrolein 0.06 2.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 But- 1 -ene Butadiene 3 9.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 Isobutene Methacrolein 0 0.6 Acetone 0.06 0 CO, CO 2 0 1 0.7 0 2 0 0.1 0.06 0 6
Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds. For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons. It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].
The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.
One very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.
In some cases the chemical effect of the support will be determining for catalytic proper- ties. For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide supports (SiO 2, TiO 2, A1203) were shown by Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.
An important parameter for the impregnation method is the pH of the molybdate solution. As a matter of fact the following equilibrium has been well established: MovO64 + 4HzO , 7MoO 2- + 8H +
The monomeric tetrahedral MoO4 z- species is favored at higher pH and vice versa for the polymeric heptamolybdate anion.
Moreover one defines the so-called isoelectric point of the support (ieps) or zero point charge (zpc) of a support by the pH value for which the surface charge turns from anionic to cationic, i.e. will allow cations or anions from the liquid phase to be adsorbed, respectively.
One has values of 2 for silica, 5-6 for titania, 8 for alumina, etc.
This clearly shows that the size of the adsorbed anion (monomeric or polymeric) adsorbed on a support will depend on the ieps (zpc) value, i.e. on the support itself.
Above the ieps value, the surface of a particular oxide is negatively charged and vice versa below.
The anion will thus be adsorbed for a pH value below the ieps value and as said above a lower pH value will favor polymolybdate anionic species.
The former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.
The formation of the former species was described by the reaction in Scheme 2.
Catalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation.
The first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.
One gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air.
The experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings.
This indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7).
The second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8).
Weak activity was observed for low Mo loading.
At higher Mo loading propanal was the major product while acrolein was also observed.
At very high Mo loadings and for MoO 3 one gets almost exclu- 2,0 1,5 Propana ' 1,0 0 o,5 Acrolein " 0,0 ,,,,,0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Mo loading (wt %) Fig. 8. Propene oxidation to acrolein (nucleophilic attack) and propanal (electrophilic attack) at 400C on MoO 3/SiO 2 catalysts versus Mo loading (from [23]).
Propanal is known to stem from propene by an electrophilic attack while acrolein corresponds rather to a nucleophilic attack.
These results indicate that monomeric MoO 2- species does not oxidize propene in our condi- tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- ing rather electrophilic.
Molybdenum oxide ex- hibits redox properties with 0 2- species being rather nucleophilic.
One can thus realise how the size of the active site is important in oxida- tion catalysis.
This is typical of structure sensi- tive reaction.
Such a catalyst is well known for several reactions, such as o-xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia.
The anatase form of TiO 2 appears to be better than the rutile form.
Such catalysts with 1 and 8 wt% V2Os/anatase was prepared by RhSne-Poulenc (S  10 m 2 g-1) for an exercise of characterization by 25 different European laboratories.
All results are assembled in a special issue of Catalysis Today published in May 1994, Vol. 20, no. 1.
Surface vanadium species were observed to exist in three different forms: monomeric VO43- species,polymeric vanadate species and V205 crystal-
The following conclusions could be drawn considering that a polyvanadate species occu- pies a ca circular zone of a diameter of 0.38 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.165 nm 2) and an isolated monovanadate species 0.66 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.43 nm2):
(i) Monomeric VO 3- species exhibit acidic character with OH groups (BriSnsted acidity) and result in propene formation for isopropanol conversion and in total oxidation for o-xylene oxidation.
Maximum coverage equals 0.43 wt% V205.
(ii) Polyvanadate surface species exhibit re- dox properties, namely give rise to acetone for isopropanol conversion and phthalic anhydride for o-xylene oxidation.
(iii) V205 crystallites exhibit low activity for o-xylene conversion and high selectivity in total oxidation.
The size of the polyvanadate species in solu- tion corresponds to V3093-, V402 with tetrahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 7 and 4.5 respec- tively and V10068 - or V10028H 5- with octahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 2.5.
Deposition of such polyvanadates of different sizes was per- formed carefully on "y-A1203 support and their initial structures depicted above were shown to remain stable even after calcination in flowing air at 500C and to be only partly modified after catalytic reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the 350 to 450C range.
Moreover in such cases, the selectivity towards propene was observed to be the same at the same con- version level, indicating that in this size domain of polyvanadate species the catalytic selectivity was not changed, only the activity was observed to increase with vanadium loading [27].
In a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations ex- changed or impregnated on the surface of zirco- nium hydrogenophosphates and compared to vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phos- phate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 500C were observed when the material present either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 6 octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 4 re- spectively or chains of limited size [28].
By comparison with bulk oxides exhibiting similar environment, it was suggested as for supported VO and CrO x species on zirconium hy- drogenophosphates that the catalytic perfor- mances were related to the stronger basic char- acter of PO 3- anions with respect to 0 2- an- ions.
Some general conclusions may be drawn from this general presentation:(i) Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heteroge- neous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice 12

oxygen ions.
Such ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring.
(ii) Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts.
A pecu- liar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst.
Parameters such as reducibility and reoxidability features of the oxides are very important for catalytic reac- tions.
(iii) Active sites for oxidation reactions ap- pear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influ- ences the catalytic properties.
In some examples the number of atoms constituting the active sites could be established.
For instance double trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra are particularly active and selective for oxidative dehydrogena- tion of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates; ensembles of four dimers of VO 6 octahedra are suggested to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhy- dride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts.
Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties.
At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many par- tial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide.
It is thus clear that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is important depending on the reaction considered and the support used.
The characteri- zation of such 'clusters' lying on the surface is rather difficult and the above statements for supported oxide catalysts are only qualitative.
To better characterize such clusters, techniques as XANES (sensitive to local symmetry type), EXAFS (sensitive to the coordination number and nearby element distances) and radial elec- tron distribution (RED) of X-ray diffraction peaks (sensitive to the nearby element dis- tances) have to be used.
Already data have been obtained for MoO 3 and V205 deposited on SiO 2, A1203 or TiO 2 support.
This holds true only if one has one type of cluster species to analyse.
The reader interested may read a chapter de- voted to XANES and EXAFS techniques by Moraweck in the book by Imelik and Vdrine (1988 and 1994) ([29,30]).
(iv) Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions.
This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice.
This latter phenomenon results from the wetting effect particularly for multicomponent and supported oxide catalysts.
It follows that for many catalysts a certain time on stream is nec- essary before the catalyst reaches its steady state.
It is frequent that in an industrial plant a steady state is reached only after one or two hundreds hours, the catalysts lasting several years before having to be replaced.
For simple catalysts as doped vanadyl pyrophosphates used for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the right size of the active sites (e.g. tetramers of vanadyl dimers) is monitored by the reactants in catalytic reaction conditions leading to the right VS+/V 4+ ratio, by the preparation procedure to change the material morphology (the (100) face of (VO)2P20 7 being developed), and by the adequate addition of additive elements which regulate the site size and VS+/V 4+ ion ratio.
The view of an oxidation catalyst as dynamical under catalytic reaction conditions is essential for our understanding of its functioning.

[1] "The selective oxidation to propylene probably also needs BrSnsted acid sites as shown recently by Moro-oka and Ueda [155] for the MoMgO catalysts."
          [2] "The different steps of the routes to propylene and COx, respectively, are probably differently sensitive to the acid-base nature and strength of the used catalyst."
          [3] "In the mean time, the C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic and the propyl species thus produced should be a propyl radical [35,158,159]."
          [4] "High temperature favors the alkyl desorption route [158,159] whereas low reaction temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reaction routes [148,159,163]."
          [5] "So, propane oxidation over V containing catalysts is considered to be initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
          [6] "It must be mentioned that heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond was also proposed in the ODHR of propane."
          [7] "The former process should be expected to occur on acidic catalysts whereas the latter supposes rather basic catalysts."
          [8] "In fact, it should be considered that redox equilibria coexist at the catalyst surface whatever the initial mode (homolytic or heterolytic) of activation as shown below:"
          [9] "A concerted mechanism (Scheme 6A) should be thus considered: the transition state in this case is probably of lower energy since it involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds."
          [10] "In this mechanism the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst play a role as a whole in only one step."
          [11] "Another mode of activation of propane should be its adsorption as alkoxy species, that is, the occurrence of the direct insertion of a lattice oxygen atom into a C-H bond (see also Scheme 6B):"
          [12] "The alkoxy species then decomposes to propylene."
          [13] "This decomposition needs the presence of BrSnsted acid sites as can be deduced from the finding of Moro-oka and Ueda [155] of the correlation between the propylene formation from propane and the number of the BriSnsted acid sites in the case of the MoMgO catalysts."
          [14] "The alkoxy route here proposed is also supported by the in-situ FT-IR studies of Finnochio et al. [169] showing the formation of propyloxy surface species as intermediate to propylene during the oxidation of propane over CrMoO catalysts."
          [15] "The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts."
          [16] "The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical."
          [17] "High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions."
          [18] "A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed."
          [19] "Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts."

"CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]."
          "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2)."
          "On the other side, the selectivity in ethylene increases with the copper content and decreases for Cu/Th > 0.25."
          "The conversion of propane is closely correlated to the copper concentration ThO 2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains constant for larger atomic ratios."
          "the selectivity in propene increases rapidly with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and finally decreases for higher atomic ratios."
          "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of Cue may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."
          "Consequently,the selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by MI, M 2 and D signals."
          "In the case of propane, the catalytic activity may be due to the presence of Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface (MI, M 2 and D) since the formation of CuO crystallites particularly at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the conversion."
          "Therefore, the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites (A 1 and A 2) rather than other sites."

[1] "The search of catalysts for the partial oxidation of light alkanes appears to both industrial and academic researchers as a difficult but promising challenge in heterogeneous catalysis."
          [2] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydro- carbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."
          [3] "The complexity of selective alkane oxidation reac- tions arises from the number of possible simultaneous reaction pathways, each of them with several reaction steps occurring on the adsorbed phase without desorb- ing."
          [4] "Different pathways have been proposed, but no single mechanism stands out [35]."
          [5] "The goal of this paper is to attempt to propose a common activation site to several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation."
          [6] "The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule cor- responds to an oxidative dehydrogenation."
          [7] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed [3]."
          [8] "The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation like long-range electron delocalization and high electron mobility."
          [9] "It appears that such an approach should be restricted to alkane activation sites and a complete mod- eling of the reaction process would necessitate to encompass the dynamic of the surface and the adsorbed species [3,10] as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid [11,12]."
          [10] "The electrical conductivity can be expressed as:r  elhp  elen 1 where e denotes the charge of electron, l the electrons (e) or holes (h) mobility and n and p the electron and hole concentration."
          [11] "The conduction mechanism can be identified by perturbing the charge carrier concentration using O2 as a probe."
          [12] "p-type semi-conductors are characterized by an excess of lattice O2) anions, Mx+O(x/2) 2) i.e., cationic vacancies in closed- packed oxide structures."
          [13] "n-type semiconductors are characterized by a deficit in lattice O2) anions Mx+O(x/2) 2) accounted for by the existence of anionic vacancies VO2."
          [14] "The structure, as it appears in this plane, consists of pairs of edge sharing VO6 octahedra linked to each other by P2O7 pyrophosphate groups."
          [15] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."
          [16] "It has been shown that n-butane could be activated in the absence of gas phase oxygen and that lattice oxygen was involved [27]; this proposal was confirmed by TAP experiments indicating that nearly all the oxygen incorporated into the oxygenated products came from the lattice [28]."
          [17] "Several mechanisms involving different sites have been proposed for the first step of the reaction (figure 1)."
          [18] "It has been demonstrated that the (VO)2P2O7 phase was a p-type semi-conductor [33]."
          [19] "The existence of vanadium sites with a vanadium vacancy (h in figure 2b) is improbable although the presence of protons would fit with Bro nsted sites titration with K + experiments showing surface protons concentration twice that expected from idealized models of (1,0,0) plane [34] and the presence of vanadium vacancies would fit with the observation by XPS of a surface P/V ratio greater than one."
          [20] "The more probable catalytic site should be that of figure 2(a) already pos- tulated [31] and the reaction on this site could involve two hydrogens abstraction with the formation of two hydroxyls groups and the transfer of one electron from the hydrocarbon to a vanadium cation as following:"
          [21] "The two neighboring close sites would allow two methylene H abstraction explaining the discrimination between methylene and methyl CH bond observed [25,26]."
          [22] "The role of a superoxide or peroxo species had already been proposed in the case of other light alkanes activation although they should not be stable in the presence of the alkane as shown for su- peroxo species by EPR."
          [23] "It is important to note that the O) species proposed to be involved in the activation of n-butane in this paper,although they present electrophilic properties, should be more strongly bound and have a much lower mobility."
          [24] "The involvement of O) species for light alkanes activation has already been suggested from thermody- namic considerations [39]."
          [25] "It was proposed that the activation of the first CH bond of an alkane involved very reactive oxygen that was weakly bound and pro- posed that weakly adsorbed O) could play that role."
          [26] "However it has been often stressed that very weakly bound surface O) promoted the formation of CC cleavage and were responsible for total oxidation."
          [27] "The same observation was made in the case study of titanium pyrophosphate presented later."
          [28] "Dopants have been shown to influence strongly the catalytic properties of the VPO catalysts [40,41]."
          [29] "It has been shown that Co favored a higher V5+/V4+ ratio under fuel rich condition and maintained a higher surface distribution of the V, P and O atoms [44]."
          [30] "The two most efficient catalysts ZrP2O7 and TiP2O7 appeared to be p-type semiconductors under air with positive holes as the main charge carriers like (VO)2P2O7."
          [31] "They became n-type when contacted with n- butane [47] (figure 7)."
          [32] "These results explained the difference in catalytic reaction mechanism encountered on the two solids."
          [33] "The alkane activation can be related in both cases to the p-type semi-con- ducting properties of the solids, likely through hydrogen abstraction by a surface O) species."
          [34] "However on ZrP2O7, Zr cannot change its valence state easily and the catalytic site will only abstract one hydrogen forming a C4H9 radical."
          [35] "In the case of TiP2O7, the same type of mechanism takes place below 450 C when Ti cannot be reduced."
          [36] "However above this temperature, it has been shown that Ti can be reduced and another mechanism is occurring that has not yet been completely elucidated."
          [37] "The two mechanisms have different activation ener- gies and more importantly the butene-1/butene-2 ratio is different."
          [38] "On ZrP2O7 and on TiP2O7 at low temperature,the ratio is close to 1.5 whereas it is close to 0.5 on TiP2O7 at high temperature."
          [39] "In the first case, after the first methylene H abstraction, the probability for the second H abstraction is independant of the first abstraction and the probability of abstraction of a methyl or methylene H is only a function of the relative abundance of the different species (6/4)."
          [40] "In the second case, the mechanism would involve an adsorbed intermediate and the stabil- ization of 1 or 2-butene is governed by thermodynamics (1/2)."
          [41] "The VSbO catalysts can contain several phases besides VSbO4 such as Sb2O4, V2O5 or amorphous V and Sb oxides but it is accepted that the active phase is the VSbO4 phase [52]."
          [42] "Its structure is derived from TiO2 rutile-type, with two Ti4+ cations formally substituted by one V and Sb cation with a cation deficiency related to the presence of V4+."
          [43] "The redox properties of the VSbO4 phase have been studied by electrical conductivity measurements [58]."
          [44] "This phase is an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the main charge carriers."
          [45] "The study of the changes in the electrical conductivity during alternative exposures to propane, oxygen and mixtures of propane and oxygen at the catalytic reaction temperature showed that it became a p-type semiconductor after reduction under propane (figure 8)."
          [46] "The existence of such irreversible change is supported by the fact that after the first reduction, the solid undergoes redox cycles that are not reversible and remain charac- teristic of a p-type semiconductor."
          [47] "The first increase in electrical conductivity under propane is related to that of the free electron concentration originating from ion- ized anionic vacancies formation according to the reaction:xC3H8  V40:64V30:28Sb50:92(0:16O4 ! V40:642xV30:282xSb50:92(0:16O4x  xC3H6  xH2O."
          [48] "The solid containing both cationic and anionic vacancies is not stable and a phase transformation should occur leading to a vanadium antimonate, richer in vanadium and supporting an antimony oxide, partially coating the surface."
          [49] "However, all the data obtained show that the active catalytic site at the surface of the vanadium antimonate could corre- spond to isolated vanadium species neighboring a cat- ionic vacancy [59,60]."
          [50] "Such arrangement should induce the stabilization of O) species allowing the activation of the alkane molecule."
          [51] "The structure of the active M1 phase has been solved and its detailed composition determined [66]."
          [52] "It corresponds to a network of MO6 octaedra (M = Mo, V and Nb) sharing corners or edges (figure 9a)."
          [53] "The heptagonal channels are empty and the hexagonal channels are occupied by tellurium or antimony cations and oxides forming chains in the direction of the chan- nels."
          [54] "It has been proposed that the activation of the alkane molecule occurred on the vanadium sites located in M7 position in the structure and that the activity of this site was explained by the resonance form in which vanadium underwent a charge transfer leading to a surface O)."
          [55] "This O) would be able to perform H abstraction from the propane molecule at the methylene position to produce a secondary propyl radical."
          [56] "A second step would correspond to a methyl abstraction to the oxygen on a neighboring tellurium cation [69]."
          [57] "The charge transfer is localized at the vanadium site on the surface and the M1 phase is, and remains in the conditions of catalytic test, n-type semi- conductor [70]."
          [58] "The direct charge transfer proposed in Eq. (13) may be not the only way to generate active O) sites at the surface of the M1 phase."
          [59] "A recent study of the phase Mo3Nb2O14, which presents a Mo5O14 type phase structure with pentagonal channels similar to those of the M1 phase, has shown that although only Mo6+ were expected to be present to balance the charge in the structure, Mo5+ were identified by EPR [71]."
          [60] "This feature was explained by the existence of a substitution disorder between Nb and Mo cations and the instability of the configuration in which l3 oxygen (O l3 in fig- ure 9b) were bonded to three Mo6+ atoms leading to the reduction of one of the Mo6+ atoms with the formation of a hole in the valence band."
          [61] "Taking into account Eq. (2), this could be expressed by the following equation: Mo6 Nb  O2 ! Mo5 Nb  O."
          [62] "However this later pathway should likely be a minor pathway as compared to the former."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, the rates of which can be measured from the effects of residence time on formation rates of alkenes and COx (CO and CO2)."
          [2] "Catalytic turnovers for oxidative dehydrogenation of MoOx and VOx proceed via reduction-oxidation cycles."
          [3] "These cycles involve the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms via pathways first proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."
          [4] "Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which involves the activation of the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms at the surface of reducible oxide domains."
          [5] "The catalytic sequence, depicted in Scheme 4, requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation."
          [6] "Thus, the ability to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO (DE2; Scheme 3) is likely to lead to significant catalytic consequences."
          [7] "The concurrent changes observed in absorption edge energies and in the stabilization of the transition state for CH bond cleavage and OH and CO bond formation reflect the increased ability of larger domains to accept electrons, consistent with their lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity."
          [8] "These trends are also consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis."
          [9] "For a given reactant (DE1, XH bond dissociation energy and H ionization energy,endothermic) and cluster (with protonation enthalpy DE3,exothermic), a lower lying LUMO (DE2) leads to a more exothermic H abstraction reaction (DHCH,abstr = DE1 + DE2 + DE3) and activation barrier (Eact,CH,abst) assuming an Evans-Polyani correlation of Eact,CH,abst and DHCH,abstr according to Eact,CH,abst = E0 + aDHCH,abstr,where E0 and a are constants."
          [10] "Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates (per Mo-atom) increased with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy, as the latter approaches values typical of saturated polymolybdate monolayers."
          [11] "These trends indicate that the reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become increasingly able to accept electron density and to stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps relative to smaller domains with higher-lying LUMO states."
          [12] "Ultimately, higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, which renders the use of the total number of Mo atoms inappropriate as a measure of the number of active sites."
          [13] "As a result, turnover rates reported on the basis of Mo atoms inevitably and ultimately decrease with increasing MoOx surface densities (Fig. 12) as a result of the prevalence of inaccessible Mo-oxo species."
          [14] "These catalytic trends resemble those reported previously for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane on VOx domains and for reactions of propane on MoOx domains dispersed on other supports."
          [15] "Similar trends have also been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains and on more reducible RuOx domains."
          [16] "The observed effects of domain size on catalysis parallel similar effects on the dynamics of their incipient stoichiometric reduction in H2, a process that leads to the formation of isolated vacancies and which resembles the elementary steps involved in the reduction part of catalytic dehydrogenation cycles."
          [17] "Stoichiometric reduction rates increased with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities,consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies."
          [18] "The mechanistic connections between oxidative dehydrogenation rates and the LMCT absorption edge in the electronic spectra of dispersed oxides are evident from the data shown in Fig. 13."
          [19] "Catalytic turnover rates on VOx, MoOx, WOx, and NbOx domains dispersed predominantly as monomers or two-dimensional oligomers on various supports (Al2O3, ZrO2, MgO) are shown as a function of their corresponding LMCT energies."
          [20] "For all active oxides, ODH turnover rates (per active metal atom) increased monotonically as LMCT energies decreased."
          [21] "These results indicate that the stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends sensitively on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates."
          [22] "The UV-visible absorption edge energy decreases as the energy level of the LUMO decreases and as the electron affinity of the cluster (Scheme 3, DE2) increases."
          [23] "These effects influence, in turn, the energies of intermediates and transition states that require electron transfer to the cluster."
          [24] "They lead to the exponential dependence of propane ODH turnover rates on LMCT absorption edge energies evident from Fig. 13."
          [25] "The identity of the metal has the strongest impact on both LMCT absorption edge energy and propane ODH turnover rates."
          [26] "More reducible supports and higher surface densities lead to higher propane ODH turnover rates for a given element and to lower edge energies and lower-lying LUMO states, which stabilize both the products and the transition state in CH bond activation steps."
          [27] "MoOx and VOx domains can be made similar in reactivity,in spite of their different chemical identities, by dispersing the latter as smaller domains or onto less reducible supports than the former."
          [28] "Thus, we conclude that quantum confinement effects, imposed by the size and electronic isolation of oxide domains, can be used to design materials with electronic properties and catalytic functions controlled by properties other than chemical composition."

[1] "The effect of cation identity on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways was examined using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2."
          [2] "The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2; the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence, suggesting that turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, which are in turn influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides."
          [3] "These results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces."
          [4] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
          [5] "The differences observed among VOx, MoOx, WOx and other oxides suggest that other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and therefore the acidbase properties of active oxides and of supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields."
          [6] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, 25,26 making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."
          [7] "The greater reactivity of propene arises in part because the weakest CH bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene."
          [8] "The limited available kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides leads us to expect that the reaction also occurs by the steps leading to eq 1."
          [9] "The similar site requirements for reactions 1 and 3 (suggested by the effects of VOx structure on selectivity)25,26 and the markedly different values of ΔS3 and ΔS1 measured (Table 2) indicate that propane ODH (reaction 1) and propene combustion (reaction 3) pathways involve transition states with different structures."
          [10] "The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy in step I and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species in step II (eq 7)."
          [11] "The apparent activation energy for propene combustion (ΔE3) is lower than for propene dehydrogenation (ΔE1) on all three catalysts (Table 2)."
          [12] "The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios (eq 12)."
          [13] "The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values (Table 2) indeed increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations."
          [14] "The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species seem to account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2; Figure 5)."
          [15] "Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts."

[1] "The partial oxidation of methane into more useful chemicals such as methanol, ethylene and benzene has been investigated extensively, although yields for these products have been poor14."
          [2] "Moreover, in several of these processes the required oxidant is N2O rather than O2."
          [3] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."
          [4] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."
          [5] "We report here our success in converting CH4 to C2 compounds in high yields in conventional catalytic conditions."

[1] "The activation of alkanes is more difcult than that of the corresponding olens,but their large reserves underline the economic inter- est in their conversion."
          [2] "The selective conversion of parafns to aromatics, to olens or to organic molecules con- taining oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products."
          [3] "The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial pro- cesses."
          [4] "The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydro- carbons would provide an attractive alternative."
          [5] "The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implica- tions in catalytic performance are discussed, under- lining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies."
          [6] "The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity."
          [7] "The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their clea- vage should be the rst step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons."

          [7] "However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading."
          [8] "In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."
          [9] "This is the case of vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO), that show a high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane [25,27,28], propane [26,29-31] and ethylben- zene [32]; or V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides which are selective catalysts in the ODH of ethane [33,34]."

          [13] "In order to better establish the influence of the support, a number of papers have been devoted to the study of monolayer systems (monomolecular dispersion in which the oxide is maximally influenced by the support) to optimize the dispersion of the active sites [13-16]."
          [14] "From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support."
          [15] "However, in spite of the variety of catalytic system studied, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under discussion."
          [16] "Since the structure-activity/selectivity correlation could be expected to change with the alkane fed, the aim of the present paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts, as well as the structure and properties of different catalytic systems, in order to understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts."

[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
          [2] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."

          [7] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
          [8] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
          [9] "In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used."
          [10] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."
          [11] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction."
          [2] "One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane."
          [3] "This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities."
          [4] "ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass."
          [5] "In fact, the corresponding supported systems give usually much higher activity and selectivity; they are discussed in more detail in section (vide infra)."
          [6] "Of several other systems that have been investigated, MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), (99, 100) VMgOx, (98, 101, 102) VSiZrOx, (103, 104) and CrSiMO (M = Al or Zr) (105) show relatively high selectivities."
          [7] "In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."
          [8] "Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant."
          [9] "It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6)."
          [10] "An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Scheme 5b)."
          [11] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers an energetically attractive route to the production of alkenes (i.e., RCH2CH3 + O2  RCHCH2 + H2O). Since ethane is the second most major component of natural gas and is also a main product in many methane-coupling reactions, its transformation to ethene at low temperature is of considerable interest. The metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active (10% of conversion at 559 K) and selective (100%) than other mixed-metal oxides (MoV, MoMn, MoTi, etc.)."
          [2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane may provide an attractive route to the production of propylene and could be a good alternative to conventional dehydrogenation and cracking processes. Various Nb-containing catalysts were studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Smits et al. 143 found that niobium oxide shows a very high selectivity in this reaction although the conversion was very low (Figure 9). The activity of the niobia was improved without diminishing its selectivity by adding other suitable elements (V, Cr, Mo)."
          [3] "The influence of various preparation methods on the performance of the VNbO catalysts also was investigated by Smits et al. 144,145 They found that the activity and selectivity of a given vanadium site depends on the nature of its neighboring atoms. Vanadium neighbors promote the activity, while niobium neighbors promote the selectivity. Niobium is much more difficult to reduce than vanadium and this feature improves the selectivity, since facile reduction often causes low selectivity in these reactions."



The concepts of oxidation began with Lavoisier's disproving of the phlogiston theory in 1773. One usually defines two groups of reactions namely homolytic and heterolytic. The first type involves radicals formed by homolytic * Corresponding author. cleavage of interatomic bonds. The second type involves an active oxygen compound or a metal ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two electrons transfer reaction. The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step.
The mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction.
An adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer.
It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reac- tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned.
The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one elec- tron to the metal.
Depending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties.
Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring.
Case (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins.
Case (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking).
Such a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present.
For instance in the work by Volta et al.,it was shown that single crystal type samples of MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and (101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to acrolein and CO x [4].
The originality of the work was to synthesize crystals of various shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite.
A more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5].
It is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al- Table 1 Structure sensitivity of the different faces of MoO 3 crystals in olefin oxidation at 380C ([4]) Reactant olefin products Relative selectivity per faces Reactant olefin Products Basal (010) Side (100) Apical (101), (1) Propene Acrolein 0.06 2.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 But- 1 -ene Butadiene 3 9.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 Isobutene Methacrolein 0 0.6 Acetone 0.06 0 CO, CO 2 0 1 0.7 0 2 0 0.1 0.06 0 6
Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds. For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons. It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].
The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.
One very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.
In some cases the chemical effect of the support will be determining for catalytic proper- ties. For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide supports (SiO 2, TiO 2, A1203) were shown by Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.
An important parameter for the impregnation method is the pH of the molybdate solution. As a matter of fact the following equilibrium has been well established: MovO64 + 4HzO , 7MoO 2- + 8H +
The monomeric tetrahedral MoO4 z- species is favored at higher pH and vice versa for the polymeric heptamolybdate anion.
Moreover one defines the so-called isoelectric point of the support (ieps) or zero point charge (zpc) of a support by the pH value for which the surface charge turns from anionic to cationic, i.e. will allow cations or anions from the liquid phase to be adsorbed, respectively.
One has values of 2 for silica, 5-6 for titania, 8 for alumina, etc.
This clearly shows that the size of the adsorbed anion (monomeric or polymeric) adsorbed on a support will depend on the ieps (zpc) value, i.e. on the support itself.
Above the ieps value, the surface of a particular oxide is negatively charged and vice versa below.
The anion will thus be adsorbed for a pH value below the ieps value and as said above a lower pH value will favor polymolybdate anionic species.
The former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.
The formation of the former species was described by the reaction in Scheme 2.
Catalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation.
The first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.
One gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air.
The experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings.
This indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7).
The second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8).
Weak activity was observed for low Mo loading.
At higher Mo loading propanal was the major product while acrolein was also observed.
At very high Mo loadings and for MoO 3 one gets almost exclu- 2,0 1,5 Propana ' 1,0 0 o,5 Acrolein " 0,0 ,,,,,0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Mo loading (wt %) Fig. 8. Propene oxidation to acrolein (nucleophilic attack) and propanal (electrophilic attack) at 400C on MoO 3/SiO 2 catalysts versus Mo loading (from [23]).
Propanal is known to stem from propene by an electrophilic attack while acrolein corresponds rather to a nucleophilic attack.
These results indicate that monomeric MoO 2- species does not oxidize propene in our condi- tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- ing rather electrophilic.
Molybdenum oxide ex- hibits redox properties with 0 2- species being rather nucleophilic.
One can thus realise how the size of the active site is important in oxida- tion catalysis.
This is typical of structure sensi- tive reaction.
Such a catalyst is well known for several reactions, such as o-xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia.
The anatase form of TiO 2 appears to be better than the rutile form.
Such catalysts with 1 and 8 wt% V2Os/anatase was prepared by RhSne-Poulenc (S  10 m 2 g-1) for an exercise of characterization by 25 different European laboratories.
All results are assembled in a special issue of Catalysis Today published in May 1994, Vol. 20, no. 1.
Surface vanadium species were observed to exist in three different forms: monomeric VO43- species,polymeric vanadate species and V205 crystal-
The following conclusions could be drawn considering that a polyvanadate species occu- pies a ca circular zone of a diameter of 0.38 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.165 nm 2) and an isolated monovanadate species 0.66 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.43 nm2):
(i) Monomeric VO 3- species exhibit acidic character with OH groups (BriSnsted acidity) and result in propene formation for isopropanol conversion and in total oxidation for o-xylene oxidation.
Maximum coverage equals 0.43 wt% V205.
(ii) Polyvanadate surface species exhibit re- dox properties, namely give rise to acetone for isopropanol conversion and phthalic anhydride for o-xylene oxidation.
(iii) V205 crystallites exhibit low activity for o-xylene conversion and high selectivity in total oxidation.
The size of the polyvanadate species in solu- tion corresponds to V3093-, V402 with tetrahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 7 and 4.5 respec- tively and V10068 - or V10028H 5- with octahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 2.5.
Deposition of such polyvanadates of different sizes was per- formed carefully on "y-A1203 support and their initial structures depicted above were shown to remain stable even after calcination in flowing air at 500C and to be only partly modified after catalytic reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the 350 to 450C range.
Moreover in such cases, the selectivity towards propene was observed to be the same at the same con- version level, indicating that in this size domain of polyvanadate species the catalytic selectivity was not changed, only the activity was observed to increase with vanadium loading [27].
In a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations ex- changed or impregnated on the surface of zirco- nium hydrogenophosphates and compared to vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phos- phate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 500C were observed when the material present either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 6 octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 4 re- spectively or chains of limited size [28].
By comparison with bulk oxides exhibiting similar environment, it was suggested as for supported VO and CrO x species on zirconium hy- drogenophosphates that the catalytic perfor- mances were related to the stronger basic char- acter of PO 3- anions with respect to 0 2- an- ions.
Some general conclusions may be drawn from this general presentation:(i) Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heteroge- neous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice 12

oxygen ions.
Such ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring.
(ii) Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts.
A pecu- liar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst.
Parameters such as reducibility and reoxidability features of the oxides are very important for catalytic reac- tions.
(iii) Active sites for oxidation reactions ap- pear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influ- ences the catalytic properties.
In some examples the number of atoms constituting the active sites could be established.
For instance double trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra are particularly active and selective for oxidative dehydrogena- tion of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates; ensembles of four dimers of VO 6 octahedra are suggested to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhy- dride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts.
Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties.
At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many par- tial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide.
It is thus clear that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is important depending on the reaction considered and the support used.
The characteri- zation of such 'clusters' lying on the surface is rather difficult and the above statements for supported oxide catalysts are only qualitative.
To better characterize such clusters, techniques as XANES (sensitive to local symmetry type), EXAFS (sensitive to the coordination number and nearby element distances) and radial elec- tron distribution (RED) of X-ray diffraction peaks (sensitive to the nearby element dis- tances) have to be used.
Already data have been obtained for MoO 3 and V205 deposited on SiO 2, A1203 or TiO 2 support.
This holds true only if one has one type of cluster species to analyse.
The reader interested may read a chapter de- voted to XANES and EXAFS techniques by Moraweck in the book by Imelik and Vdrine (1988 and 1994) ([29,30]).
(iv) Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions.
This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice.
This latter phenomenon results from the wetting effect particularly for multicomponent and supported oxide catalysts.
It follows that for many catalysts a certain time on stream is nec- essary before the catalyst reaches its steady state.
It is frequent that in an industrial plant a steady state is reached only after one or two hundreds hours, the catalysts lasting several years before having to be replaced.
For simple catalysts as doped vanadyl pyrophosphates used for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the right size of the active sites (e.g. tetramers of vanadyl dimers) is monitored by the reactants in catalytic reaction conditions leading to the right VS+/V 4+ ratio, by the preparation procedure to change the material morphology (the (100) face of (VO)2P20 7 being developed), and by the adequate addition of additive elements which regulate the site size and VS+/V 4+ ion ratio.
The view of an oxidation catalyst as dynamical under catalytic reaction conditions is essential for our understanding of its functioning.

[1] "The selective oxidation to propylene probably also needs BrSnsted acid sites as shown recently by Moro-oka and Ueda [155] for the MoMgO catalysts."
          [2] "The different steps of the routes to propylene and COx, respectively, are probably differently sensitive to the acid-base nature and strength of the used catalyst."
          [3] "In the mean time, the C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic and the propyl species thus produced should be a propyl radical [35,158,159]."
          [4] "High temperature favors the alkyl desorption route [158,159] whereas low reaction temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reaction routes [148,159,163]."
          [5] "So, propane oxidation over V containing catalysts is considered to be initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
          [6] "It must be mentioned that heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond was also proposed in the ODHR of propane."
          [7] "The former process should be expected to occur on acidic catalysts whereas the latter supposes rather basic catalysts."
          [8] "In fact, it should be considered that redox equilibria coexist at the catalyst surface whatever the initial mode (homolytic or heterolytic) of activation as shown below:"
          [9] "A concerted mechanism (Scheme 6A) should be thus considered: the transition state in this case is probably of lower energy since it involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds."
          [10] "In this mechanism the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst play a role as a whole in only one step."
          [11] "Another mode of activation of propane should be its adsorption as alkoxy species, that is, the occurrence of the direct insertion of a lattice oxygen atom into a C-H bond (see also Scheme 6B):"
          [12] "The alkoxy species then decomposes to propylene."
          [13] "This decomposition needs the presence of BrSnsted acid sites as can be deduced from the finding of Moro-oka and Ueda [155] of the correlation between the propylene formation from propane and the number of the BriSnsted acid sites in the case of the MoMgO catalysts."
          [14] "The alkoxy route here proposed is also supported by the in-situ FT-IR studies of Finnochio et al. [169] showing the formation of propyloxy surface species as intermediate to propylene during the oxidation of propane over CrMoO catalysts."
          [15] "The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts."
          [16] "The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical."
          [17] "High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions."
          [18] "A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed."
          [19] "Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts."

"CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]."
          "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2)."
          "On the other side, the selectivity in ethylene increases with the copper content and decreases for Cu/Th > 0.25."
          "The conversion of propane is closely correlated to the copper concentration ThO 2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains constant for larger atomic ratios."
          "the selectivity in propene increases rapidly with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and finally decreases for higher atomic ratios."
          "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of Cue may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."
          "Consequently,the selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by MI, M 2 and D signals."
          "In the case of propane, the catalytic activity may be due to the presence of Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface (MI, M 2 and D) since the formation of CuO crystallites particularly at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the conversion."
          "Therefore, the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites (A 1 and A 2) rather than other sites."

[1] "The search of catalysts for the partial oxidation of light alkanes appears to both industrial and academic researchers as a difficult but promising challenge in heterogeneous catalysis."
          [2] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydro- carbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."
          [3] "The complexity of selective alkane oxidation reac- tions arises from the number of possible simultaneous reaction pathways, each of them with several reaction steps occurring on the adsorbed phase without desorb- ing."
          [4] "Different pathways have been proposed, but no single mechanism stands out [35]."
          [5] "The goal of this paper is to attempt to propose a common activation site to several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation."
          [6] "The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule cor- responds to an oxidative dehydrogenation."
          [7] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed [3]."
          [8] "The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation like long-range electron delocalization and high electron mobility."
          [9] "It appears that such an approach should be restricted to alkane activation sites and a complete mod- eling of the reaction process would necessitate to encompass the dynamic of the surface and the adsorbed species [3,10] as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid [11,12]."
          [10] "The electrical conductivity can be expressed as:r  elhp  elen 1 where e denotes the charge of electron, l the electrons (e) or holes (h) mobility and n and p the electron and hole concentration."
          [11] "The conduction mechanism can be identified by perturbing the charge carrier concentration using O2 as a probe."
          [12] "p-type semi-conductors are characterized by an excess of lattice O2) anions, Mx+O(x/2) 2) i.e., cationic vacancies in closed- packed oxide structures."
          [13] "n-type semiconductors are characterized by a deficit in lattice O2) anions Mx+O(x/2) 2) accounted for by the existence of anionic vacancies VO2."
          [14] "The structure, as it appears in this plane, consists of pairs of edge sharing VO6 octahedra linked to each other by P2O7 pyrophosphate groups."
          [15] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."
          [16] "It has been shown that n-butane could be activated in the absence of gas phase oxygen and that lattice oxygen was involved [27]; this proposal was confirmed by TAP experiments indicating that nearly all the oxygen incorporated into the oxygenated products came from the lattice [28]."
          [17] "Several mechanisms involving different sites have been proposed for the first step of the reaction (figure 1)."
          [18] "It has been demonstrated that the (VO)2P2O7 phase was a p-type semi-conductor [33]."
          [19] "The existence of vanadium sites with a vanadium vacancy (h in figure 2b) is improbable although the presence of protons would fit with Bro nsted sites titration with K + experiments showing surface protons concentration twice that expected from idealized models of (1,0,0) plane [34] and the presence of vanadium vacancies would fit with the observation by XPS of a surface P/V ratio greater than one."
          [20] "The more probable catalytic site should be that of figure 2(a) already pos- tulated [31] and the reaction on this site could involve two hydrogens abstraction with the formation of two hydroxyls groups and the transfer of one electron from the hydrocarbon to a vanadium cation as following:"
          [21] "The two neighboring close sites would allow two methylene H abstraction explaining the discrimination between methylene and methyl CH bond observed [25,26]."
          [22] "The role of a superoxide or peroxo species had already been proposed in the case of other light alkanes activation although they should not be stable in the presence of the alkane as shown for su- peroxo species by EPR."
          [23] "It is important to note that the O) species proposed to be involved in the activation of n-butane in this paper,although they present electrophilic properties, should be more strongly bound and have a much lower mobility."
          [24] "The involvement of O) species for light alkanes activation has already been suggested from thermody- namic considerations [39]."
          [25] "It was proposed that the activation of the first CH bond of an alkane involved very reactive oxygen that was weakly bound and pro- posed that weakly adsorbed O) could play that role."
          [26] "However it has been often stressed that very weakly bound surface O) promoted the formation of CC cleavage and were responsible for total oxidation."
          [27] "The same observation was made in the case study of titanium pyrophosphate presented later."
          [28] "Dopants have been shown to influence strongly the catalytic properties of the VPO catalysts [40,41]."
          [29] "It has been shown that Co favored a higher V5+/V4+ ratio under fuel rich condition and maintained a higher surface distribution of the V, P and O atoms [44]."
          [30] "The two most efficient catalysts ZrP2O7 and TiP2O7 appeared to be p-type semiconductors under air with positive holes as the main charge carriers like (VO)2P2O7."
          [31] "They became n-type when contacted with n- butane [47] (figure 7)."
          [32] "These results explained the difference in catalytic reaction mechanism encountered on the two solids."
          [33] "The alkane activation can be related in both cases to the p-type semi-con- ducting properties of the solids, likely through hydrogen abstraction by a surface O) species."
          [34] "However on ZrP2O7, Zr cannot change its valence state easily and the catalytic site will only abstract one hydrogen forming a C4H9 radical."
          [35] "In the case of TiP2O7, the same type of mechanism takes place below 450 C when Ti cannot be reduced."
          [36] "However above this temperature, it has been shown that Ti can be reduced and another mechanism is occurring that has not yet been completely elucidated."
          [37] "The two mechanisms have different activation ener- gies and more importantly the butene-1/butene-2 ratio is different."
          [38] "On ZrP2O7 and on TiP2O7 at low temperature,the ratio is close to 1.5 whereas it is close to 0.5 on TiP2O7 at high temperature."
          [39] "In the first case, after the first methylene H abstraction, the probability for the second H abstraction is independant of the first abstraction and the probability of abstraction of a methyl or methylene H is only a function of the relative abundance of the different species (6/4)."
          [40] "In the second case, the mechanism would involve an adsorbed intermediate and the stabil- ization of 1 or 2-butene is governed by thermodynamics (1/2)."
          [41] "The VSbO catalysts can contain several phases besides VSbO4 such as Sb2O4, V2O5 or amorphous V and Sb oxides but it is accepted that the active phase is the VSbO4 phase [52]."
          [42] "Its structure is derived from TiO2 rutile-type, with two Ti4+ cations formally substituted by one V and Sb cation with a cation deficiency related to the presence of V4+."
          [43] "The redox properties of the VSbO4 phase have been studied by electrical conductivity measurements [58]."
          [44] "This phase is an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the main charge carriers."
          [45] "The study of the changes in the electrical conductivity during alternative exposures to propane, oxygen and mixtures of propane and oxygen at the catalytic reaction temperature showed that it became a p-type semiconductor after reduction under propane (figure 8)."
          [46] "The existence of such irreversible change is supported by the fact that after the first reduction, the solid undergoes redox cycles that are not reversible and remain charac- teristic of a p-type semiconductor."
          [47] "The first increase in electrical conductivity under propane is related to that of the free electron concentration originating from ion- ized anionic vacancies formation according to the reaction:xC3H8  V40:64V30:28Sb50:92(0:16O4 ! V40:642xV30:282xSb50:92(0:16O4x  xC3H6  xH2O."
          [48] "The solid containing both cationic and anionic vacancies is not stable and a phase transformation should occur leading to a vanadium antimonate, richer in vanadium and supporting an antimony oxide, partially coating the surface."
          [49] "However, all the data obtained show that the active catalytic site at the surface of the vanadium antimonate could corre- spond to isolated vanadium species neighboring a cat- ionic vacancy [59,60]."
          [50] "Such arrangement should induce the stabilization of O) species allowing the activation of the alkane molecule."
          [51] "The structure of the active M1 phase has been solved and its detailed composition determined [66]."
          [52] "It corresponds to a network of MO6 octaedra (M = Mo, V and Nb) sharing corners or edges (figure 9a)."
          [53] "The heptagonal channels are empty and the hexagonal channels are occupied by tellurium or antimony cations and oxides forming chains in the direction of the chan- nels."
          [54] "It has been proposed that the activation of the alkane molecule occurred on the vanadium sites located in M7 position in the structure and that the activity of this site was explained by the resonance form in which vanadium underwent a charge transfer leading to a surface O)."
          [55] "This O) would be able to perform H abstraction from the propane molecule at the methylene position to produce a secondary propyl radical."
          [56] "A second step would correspond to a methyl abstraction to the oxygen on a neighboring tellurium cation [69]."
          [57] "The charge transfer is localized at the vanadium site on the surface and the M1 phase is, and remains in the conditions of catalytic test, n-type semi- conductor [70]."
          [58] "The direct charge transfer proposed in Eq. (13) may be not the only way to generate active O) sites at the surface of the M1 phase."
          [59] "A recent study of the phase Mo3Nb2O14, which presents a Mo5O14 type phase structure with pentagonal channels similar to those of the M1 phase, has shown that although only Mo6+ were expected to be present to balance the charge in the structure, Mo5+ were identified by EPR [71]."
          [60] "This feature was explained by the existence of a substitution disorder between Nb and Mo cations and the instability of the configuration in which l3 oxygen (O l3 in fig- ure 9b) were bonded to three Mo6+ atoms leading to the reduction of one of the Mo6+ atoms with the formation of a hole in the valence band."
          [61] "Taking into account Eq. (2), this could be expressed by the following equation: Mo6 Nb  O2 ! Mo5 Nb  O."
          [62] "However this later pathway should likely be a minor pathway as compared to the former."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, the rates of which can be measured from the effects of residence time on formation rates of alkenes and COx (CO and CO2)."
          [2] "Catalytic turnovers for oxidative dehydrogenation of MoOx and VOx proceed via reduction-oxidation cycles."
          [3] "These cycles involve the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms via pathways first proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."
          [4] "Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which involves the activation of the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms at the surface of reducible oxide domains."
          [5] "The catalytic sequence, depicted in Scheme 4, requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation."
          [6] "Thus, the ability to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO (DE2; Scheme 3) is likely to lead to significant catalytic consequences."
          [7] "The concurrent changes observed in absorption edge energies and in the stabilization of the transition state for CH bond cleavage and OH and CO bond formation reflect the increased ability of larger domains to accept electrons, consistent with their lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity."
          [8] "These trends are also consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis."
          [9] "For a given reactant (DE1, XH bond dissociation energy and H ionization energy,endothermic) and cluster (with protonation enthalpy DE3,exothermic), a lower lying LUMO (DE2) leads to a more exothermic H abstraction reaction (DHCH,abstr = DE1 + DE2 + DE3) and activation barrier (Eact,CH,abst) assuming an Evans-Polyani correlation of Eact,CH,abst and DHCH,abstr according to Eact,CH,abst = E0 + aDHCH,abstr,where E0 and a are constants."
          [10] "Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates (per Mo-atom) increased with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy, as the latter approaches values typical of saturated polymolybdate monolayers."
          [11] "These trends indicate that the reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become increasingly able to accept electron density and to stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps relative to smaller domains with higher-lying LUMO states."
          [12] "Ultimately, higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, which renders the use of the total number of Mo atoms inappropriate as a measure of the number of active sites."
          [13] "As a result, turnover rates reported on the basis of Mo atoms inevitably and ultimately decrease with increasing MoOx surface densities (Fig. 12) as a result of the prevalence of inaccessible Mo-oxo species."
          [14] "These catalytic trends resemble those reported previously for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane on VOx domains and for reactions of propane on MoOx domains dispersed on other supports."
          [15] "Similar trends have also been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains and on more reducible RuOx domains."
          [16] "The observed effects of domain size on catalysis parallel similar effects on the dynamics of their incipient stoichiometric reduction in H2, a process that leads to the formation of isolated vacancies and which resembles the elementary steps involved in the reduction part of catalytic dehydrogenation cycles."
          [17] "Stoichiometric reduction rates increased with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities,consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies."
          [18] "The mechanistic connections between oxidative dehydrogenation rates and the LMCT absorption edge in the electronic spectra of dispersed oxides are evident from the data shown in Fig. 13."
          [19] "Catalytic turnover rates on VOx, MoOx, WOx, and NbOx domains dispersed predominantly as monomers or two-dimensional oligomers on various supports (Al2O3, ZrO2, MgO) are shown as a function of their corresponding LMCT energies."
          [20] "For all active oxides, ODH turnover rates (per active metal atom) increased monotonically as LMCT energies decreased."
          [21] "These results indicate that the stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends sensitively on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates."
          [22] "The UV-visible absorption edge energy decreases as the energy level of the LUMO decreases and as the electron affinity of the cluster (Scheme 3, DE2) increases."
          [23] "These effects influence, in turn, the energies of intermediates and transition states that require electron transfer to the cluster."
          [24] "They lead to the exponential dependence of propane ODH turnover rates on LMCT absorption edge energies evident from Fig. 13."
          [25] "The identity of the metal has the strongest impact on both LMCT absorption edge energy and propane ODH turnover rates."
          [26] "More reducible supports and higher surface densities lead to higher propane ODH turnover rates for a given element and to lower edge energies and lower-lying LUMO states, which stabilize both the products and the transition state in CH bond activation steps."
          [27] "MoOx and VOx domains can be made similar in reactivity,in spite of their different chemical identities, by dispersing the latter as smaller domains or onto less reducible supports than the former."
          [28] "Thus, we conclude that quantum confinement effects, imposed by the size and electronic isolation of oxide domains, can be used to design materials with electronic properties and catalytic functions controlled by properties other than chemical composition."

[1] "The effect of cation identity on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways was examined using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2."
          [2] "The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2; the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence, suggesting that turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, which are in turn influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides."
          [3] "These results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces."
          [4] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
          [5] "The differences observed among VOx, MoOx, WOx and other oxides suggest that other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and therefore the acidbase properties of active oxides and of supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields."
          [6] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, 25,26 making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."
          [7] "The greater reactivity of propene arises in part because the weakest CH bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene."
          [8] "The limited available kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides leads us to expect that the reaction also occurs by the steps leading to eq 1."
          [9] "The similar site requirements for reactions 1 and 3 (suggested by the effects of VOx structure on selectivity)25,26 and the markedly different values of ΔS3 and ΔS1 measured (Table 2) indicate that propane ODH (reaction 1) and propene combustion (reaction 3) pathways involve transition states with different structures."
          [10] "The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy in step I and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species in step II (eq 7)."
          [11] "The apparent activation energy for propene combustion (ΔE3) is lower than for propene dehydrogenation (ΔE1) on all three catalysts (Table 2)."
          [12] "The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios (eq 12)."
          [13] "The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values (Table 2) indeed increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations."
          [14] "The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species seem to account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2; Figure 5)."
          [15] "Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts."

          [3] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."
          [4] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."

          [7] "The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their clea- vage should be the rst step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons."

[1] "The accent is put on the mechanisms and the kinetic models used for the description of this reaction.

          [2] "The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species and the acid-base character of catalysts, in addition to their catalytic properties in the ODH of Cz-C4 alkanes, strongly depend on the metal oxide used as support and the vanadium loading."

          [7] "However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading."
          [8] "In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."
          [9] "This is the case of vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO), that show a high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane [25,27,28], propane [26,29-31] and ethylben- zene [32]; or V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides which are selective catalysts in the ODH of ethane [33,34]."

          [13] "In order to better establish the influence of the support, a number of papers have been devoted to the study of monolayer systems (monomolecular dispersion in which the oxide is maximally influenced by the support) to optimize the dispersion of the active sites [13-16]."
          [14] "From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support."
          [15] "However, in spite of the variety of catalytic system studied, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under discussion."

[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
          [2] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."

          [7] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
          [8] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
          [9] "In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used."
          [10] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."
          [11] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction."
          [2] "One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane."
          [3] "This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities."
          [4] "ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass."
          [5] "In fact, the corresponding supported systems give usually much higher activity and selectivity; they are discussed in more detail in section (vide infra)."

          [7] "In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."
          [8] "Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant."
          [9] "It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6)."
          [10] "An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Scheme 5b)."
          [11] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers an energetically attractive route to the production of alkenes (i.e., RCH2CH3 + O2  RCHCH2 + H2O). Since ethane is the second most major component of natural gas and is also a main product in many methane-coupling reactions, its transformation to ethene at low temperature is of considerable interest. The metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active (10% of conversion at 559 K) and selective (100%) than other mixed-metal oxides (MoV, MoMn, MoTi, etc.)."
          [2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane may provide an attractive route to the production of propylene and could be a good alternative to conventional dehydrogenation and cracking processes. Various Nb-containing catalysts were studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Smits et al. 143 found that niobium oxide shows a very high selectivity in this reaction although the conversion was very low (Figure 9). The activity of the niobia was improved without diminishing its selectivity by adding other suitable elements (V, Cr, Mo)."
          [3] "The influence of various preparation methods on the performance of the VNbO catalysts also was investigated by Smits et al. 144,145 They found that the activity and selectivity of a given vanadium site depends on the nature of its neighboring atoms. Vanadium neighbors promote the activity, while niobium neighbors promote the selectivity. Niobium is much more difficult to reduce than vanadium and this feature improves the selectivity, since facile reduction often causes low selectivity in these reactions."



The concepts of oxidation began with Lavoisier's disproving of the phlogiston theory in 1773. One usually defines two groups of reactions namely homolytic and heterolytic. The first type involves radicals formed by homolytic * Corresponding author. cleavage of interatomic bonds. The second type involves an active oxygen compound or a metal ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two electrons transfer reaction. The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step.
The mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction.
An adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer.
It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reac- tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned.
The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one elec- tron to the metal.
Depending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties.
Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring.
Case (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins.
Case (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking).
Such a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present.
For instance in the work by Volta et al.,it was shown that single crystal type samples of MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and (101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to acrolein and CO x [4].
The originality of the work was to synthesize crystals of various shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite.
A more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5].
It is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al- Table 1 Structure sensitivity of the different faces of MoO 3 crystals in olefin oxidation at 380C ([4]) Reactant olefin products Relative selectivity per faces Reactant olefin Products Basal (010) Side (100) Apical (101), (1) Propene Acrolein 0.06 2.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 But- 1 -ene Butadiene 3 9.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 Isobutene Methacrolein 0 0.6 Acetone 0.06 0 CO, CO 2 0 1 0.7 0 2 0 0.1 0.06 0 6
Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds. For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons. It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].
The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.
One very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.
In some cases the chemical effect of the support will be determining for catalytic proper- ties. For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide supports (SiO 2, TiO 2, A1203) were shown by Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.
An important parameter for the impregnation method is the pH of the molybdate solution. As a matter of fact the following equilibrium has been well established: MovO64 + 4HzO , 7MoO 2- + 8H +
The monomeric tetrahedral MoO4 z- species is favored at higher pH and vice versa for the polymeric heptamolybdate anion.
Moreover one defines the so-called isoelectric point of the support (ieps) or zero point charge (zpc) of a support by the pH value for which the surface charge turns from anionic to cationic, i.e. will allow cations or anions from the liquid phase to be adsorbed, respectively.
One has values of 2 for silica, 5-6 for titania, 8 for alumina, etc.
This clearly shows that the size of the adsorbed anion (monomeric or polymeric) adsorbed on a support will depend on the ieps (zpc) value, i.e. on the support itself.
Above the ieps value, the surface of a particular oxide is negatively charged and vice versa below.
The anion will thus be adsorbed for a pH value below the ieps value and as said above a lower pH value will favor polymolybdate anionic species.
The former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.
The formation of the former species was described by the reaction in Scheme 2.
Catalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation.
The first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.
One gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air.
The experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings.
This indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7).
The second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8).
Weak activity was observed for low Mo loading.
At higher Mo loading propanal was the major product while acrolein was also observed.
At very high Mo loadings and for MoO 3 one gets almost exclu- 2,0 1,5 Propana ' 1,0 0 o,5 Acrolein " 0,0 ,,,,,0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Mo loading (wt %) Fig. 8. Propene oxidation to acrolein (nucleophilic attack) and propanal (electrophilic attack) at 400C on MoO 3/SiO 2 catalysts versus Mo loading (from [23]).
Propanal is known to stem from propene by an electrophilic attack while acrolein corresponds rather to a nucleophilic attack.
These results indicate that monomeric MoO 2- species does not oxidize propene in our condi- tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- ing rather electrophilic.
Molybdenum oxide ex- hibits redox properties with 0 2- species being rather nucleophilic.
One can thus realise how the size of the active site is important in oxida- tion catalysis.
This is typical of structure sensi- tive reaction.
Such a catalyst is well known for several reactions, such as o-xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia.
The anatase form of TiO 2 appears to be better than the rutile form.
Such catalysts with 1 and 8 wt% V2Os/anatase was prepared by RhSne-Poulenc (S  10 m 2 g-1) for an exercise of characterization by 25 different European laboratories.
All results are assembled in a special issue of Catalysis Today published in May 1994, Vol. 20, no. 1.
Surface vanadium species were observed to exist in three different forms: monomeric VO43- species,polymeric vanadate species and V205 crystal-
The following conclusions could be drawn considering that a polyvanadate species occu- pies a ca circular zone of a diameter of 0.38 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.165 nm 2) and an isolated monovanadate species 0.66 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.43 nm2):
(i) Monomeric VO 3- species exhibit acidic character with OH groups (BriSnsted acidity) and result in propene formation for isopropanol conversion and in total oxidation for o-xylene oxidation.
Maximum coverage equals 0.43 wt% V205.
(ii) Polyvanadate surface species exhibit re- dox properties, namely give rise to acetone for isopropanol conversion and phthalic anhydride for o-xylene oxidation.
(iii) V205 crystallites exhibit low activity for o-xylene conversion and high selectivity in total oxidation.
The size of the polyvanadate species in solu- tion corresponds to V3093-, V402 with tetrahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 7 and 4.5 respec- tively and V10068 - or V10028H 5- with octahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 2.5.
Deposition of such polyvanadates of different sizes was per- formed carefully on "y-A1203 support and their initial structures depicted above were shown to remain stable even after calcination in flowing air at 500C and to be only partly modified after catalytic reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the 350 to 450C range.
Moreover in such cases, the selectivity towards propene was observed to be the same at the same con- version level, indicating that in this size domain of polyvanadate species the catalytic selectivity was not changed, only the activity was observed to increase with vanadium loading [27].
In a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations ex- changed or impregnated on the surface of zirco- nium hydrogenophosphates and compared to vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phos- phate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 500C were observed when the material present either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 6 octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 4 re- spectively or chains of limited size [28].
By comparison with bulk oxides exhibiting similar environment, it was suggested as for supported VO and CrO x species on zirconium hy- drogenophosphates that the catalytic perfor- mances were related to the stronger basic char- acter of PO 3- anions with respect to 0 2- an- ions.
Some general conclusions may be drawn from this general presentation:(i) Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heteroge- neous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice 12

oxygen ions.
Such ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring.
(ii) Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts.
A pecu- liar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst.
Parameters such as reducibility and reoxidability features of the oxides are very important for catalytic reac- tions.
(iii) Active sites for oxidation reactions ap- pear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influ- ences the catalytic properties.
In some examples the number of atoms constituting the active sites could be established.
For instance double trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra are particularly active and selective for oxidative dehydrogena- tion of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates; ensembles of four dimers of VO 6 octahedra are suggested to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhy- dride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts.
Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties.
At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many par- tial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide.
It is thus clear that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is important depending on the reaction considered and the support used.
The characteri- zation of such 'clusters' lying on the surface is rather difficult and the above statements for supported oxide catalysts are only qualitative.
To better characterize such clusters, techniques as XANES (sensitive to local symmetry type), EXAFS (sensitive to the coordination number and nearby element distances) and radial elec- tron distribution (RED) of X-ray diffraction peaks (sensitive to the nearby element dis- tances) have to be used.
Already data have been obtained for MoO 3 and V205 deposited on SiO 2, A1203 or TiO 2 support.
This holds true only if one has one type of cluster species to analyse.
The reader interested may read a chapter de- voted to XANES and EXAFS techniques by Moraweck in the book by Imelik and Vdrine (1988 and 1994) ([29,30]).
(iv) Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions.
This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice.
This latter phenomenon results from the wetting effect particularly for multicomponent and supported oxide catalysts.
It follows that for many catalysts a certain time on stream is nec- essary before the catalyst reaches its steady state.
It is frequent that in an industrial plant a steady state is reached only after one or two hundreds hours, the catalysts lasting several years before having to be replaced.
For simple catalysts as doped vanadyl pyrophosphates used for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the right size of the active sites (e.g. tetramers of vanadyl dimers) is monitored by the reactants in catalytic reaction conditions leading to the right VS+/V 4+ ratio, by the preparation procedure to change the material morphology (the (100) face of (VO)2P20 7 being developed), and by the adequate addition of additive elements which regulate the site size and VS+/V 4+ ion ratio.
The view of an oxidation catalyst as dynamical under catalytic reaction conditions is essential for our understanding of its functioning.

[1] "The selective oxidation to propylene probably also needs BrSnsted acid sites as shown recently by Moro-oka and Ueda [155] for the MoMgO catalysts."
          [2] "The different steps of the routes to propylene and COx, respectively, are probably differently sensitive to the acid-base nature and strength of the used catalyst."
          [3] "In the mean time, the C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic and the propyl species thus produced should be a propyl radical [35,158,159]."
          [4] "High temperature favors the alkyl desorption route [158,159] whereas low reaction temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reaction routes [148,159,163]."
          [5] "So, propane oxidation over V containing catalysts is considered to be initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
          [6] "It must be mentioned that heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond was also proposed in the ODHR of propane."
          [7] "The former process should be expected to occur on acidic catalysts whereas the latter supposes rather basic catalysts."
          [8] "In fact, it should be considered that redox equilibria coexist at the catalyst surface whatever the initial mode (homolytic or heterolytic) of activation as shown below:"
          [9] "A concerted mechanism (Scheme 6A) should be thus considered: the transition state in this case is probably of lower energy since it involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds."
          [10] "In this mechanism the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst play a role as a whole in only one step."
          [11] "Another mode of activation of propane should be its adsorption as alkoxy species, that is, the occurrence of the direct insertion of a lattice oxygen atom into a C-H bond (see also Scheme 6B):"
          [12] "The alkoxy species then decomposes to propylene."
          [13] "This decomposition needs the presence of BrSnsted acid sites as can be deduced from the finding of Moro-oka and Ueda [155] of the correlation between the propylene formation from propane and the number of the BriSnsted acid sites in the case of the MoMgO catalysts."
          [14] "The alkoxy route here proposed is also supported by the in-situ FT-IR studies of Finnochio et al. [169] showing the formation of propyloxy surface species as intermediate to propylene during the oxidation of propane over CrMoO catalysts."
          [15] "The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts."
          [16] "The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical."
          [17] "High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions."
          [18] "A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed."
          [19] "Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts."

"CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]."
          "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2)."
          "On the other side, the selectivity in ethylene increases with the copper content and decreases for Cu/Th > 0.25."
          "The conversion of propane is closely correlated to the copper concentration ThO 2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains constant for larger atomic ratios."
          "the selectivity in propene increases rapidly with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and finally decreases for higher atomic ratios."
          "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of Cue may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."
          "Consequently,the selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by MI, M 2 and D signals."
          "In the case of propane, the catalytic activity may be due to the presence of Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface (MI, M 2 and D) since the formation of CuO crystallites particularly at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the conversion."
          "Therefore, the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites (A 1 and A 2) rather than other sites."

[1] "The search of catalysts for the partial oxidation of light alkanes appears to both industrial and academic researchers as a difficult but promising challenge in heterogeneous catalysis."
          [2] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydro- carbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."
          [3] "The complexity of selective alkane oxidation reac- tions arises from the number of possible simultaneous reaction pathways, each of them with several reaction steps occurring on the adsorbed phase without desorb- ing."
          [4] "Different pathways have been proposed, but no single mechanism stands out [35]."
          [5] "The goal of this paper is to attempt to propose a common activation site to several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation."
          [6] "The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule cor- responds to an oxidative dehydrogenation."
          [7] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed [3]."
          [8] "The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation like long-range electron delocalization and high electron mobility."
          [9] "It appears that such an approach should be restricted to alkane activation sites and a complete mod- eling of the reaction process would necessitate to encompass the dynamic of the surface and the adsorbed species [3,10] as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid [11,12]."
          [10] "The electrical conductivity can be expressed as:r  elhp  elen 1 where e denotes the charge of electron, l the electrons (e) or holes (h) mobility and n and p the electron and hole concentration."
          [11] "The conduction mechanism can be identified by perturbing the charge carrier concentration using O2 as a probe."
          [12] "p-type semi-conductors are characterized by an excess of lattice O2) anions, Mx+O(x/2) 2) i.e., cationic vacancies in closed- packed oxide structures."
          [13] "n-type semiconductors are characterized by a deficit in lattice O2) anions Mx+O(x/2) 2) accounted for by the existence of anionic vacancies VO2."
          [14] "The structure, as it appears in this plane, consists of pairs of edge sharing VO6 octahedra linked to each other by P2O7 pyrophosphate groups."
          [15] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."
          [16] "It has been shown that n-butane could be activated in the absence of gas phase oxygen and that lattice oxygen was involved [27]; this proposal was confirmed by TAP experiments indicating that nearly all the oxygen incorporated into the oxygenated products came from the lattice [28]."
          [17] "Several mechanisms involving different sites have been proposed for the first step of the reaction (figure 1)."
          [18] "It has been demonstrated that the (VO)2P2O7 phase was a p-type semi-conductor [33]."
          [19] "The existence of vanadium sites with a vanadium vacancy (h in figure 2b) is improbable although the presence of protons would fit with Bro nsted sites titration with K + experiments showing surface protons concentration twice that expected from idealized models of (1,0,0) plane [34] and the presence of vanadium vacancies would fit with the observation by XPS of a surface P/V ratio greater than one."
          [20] "The more probable catalytic site should be that of figure 2(a) already pos- tulated [31] and the reaction on this site could involve two hydrogens abstraction with the formation of two hydroxyls groups and the transfer of one electron from the hydrocarbon to a vanadium cation as following:"
          [21] "The two neighboring close sites would allow two methylene H abstraction explaining the discrimination between methylene and methyl CH bond observed [25,26]."
          [22] "The role of a superoxide or peroxo species had already been proposed in the case of other light alkanes activation although they should not be stable in the presence of the alkane as shown for su- peroxo species by EPR."
          [23] "It is important to note that the O) species proposed to be involved in the activation of n-butane in this paper,although they present electrophilic properties, should be more strongly bound and have a much lower mobility."
          [24] "The involvement of O) species for light alkanes activation has already been suggested from thermody- namic considerations [39]."
          [25] "It was proposed that the activation of the first CH bond of an alkane involved very reactive oxygen that was weakly bound and pro- posed that weakly adsorbed O) could play that role."
          [26] "However it has been often stressed that very weakly bound surface O) promoted the formation of CC cleavage and were responsible for total oxidation."
          [27] "The same observation was made in the case study of titanium pyrophosphate presented later."
          [28] "Dopants have been shown to influence strongly the catalytic properties of the VPO catalysts [40,41]."
          [29] "It has been shown that Co favored a higher V5+/V4+ ratio under fuel rich condition and maintained a higher surface distribution of the V, P and O atoms [44]."
          [30] "The two most efficient catalysts ZrP2O7 and TiP2O7 appeared to be p-type semiconductors under air with positive holes as the main charge carriers like (VO)2P2O7."
          [31] "They became n-type when contacted with n- butane [47] (figure 7)."
          [32] "These results explained the difference in catalytic reaction mechanism encountered on the two solids."
          [33] "The alkane activation can be related in both cases to the p-type semi-con- ducting properties of the solids, likely through hydrogen abstraction by a surface O) species."
          [34] "However on ZrP2O7, Zr cannot change its valence state easily and the catalytic site will only abstract one hydrogen forming a C4H9 radical."
          [35] "In the case of TiP2O7, the same type of mechanism takes place below 450 C when Ti cannot be reduced."
          [36] "However above this temperature, it has been shown that Ti can be reduced and another mechanism is occurring that has not yet been completely elucidated."
          [37] "The two mechanisms have different activation ener- gies and more importantly the butene-1/butene-2 ratio is different."
          [38] "On ZrP2O7 and on TiP2O7 at low temperature,the ratio is close to 1.5 whereas it is close to 0.5 on TiP2O7 at high temperature."
          [39] "In the first case, after the first methylene H abstraction, the probability for the second H abstraction is independant of the first abstraction and the probability of abstraction of a methyl or methylene H is only a function of the relative abundance of the different species (6/4)."
          [40] "In the second case, the mechanism would involve an adsorbed intermediate and the stabil- ization of 1 or 2-butene is governed by thermodynamics (1/2)."
          [41] "The VSbO catalysts can contain several phases besides VSbO4 such as Sb2O4, V2O5 or amorphous V and Sb oxides but it is accepted that the active phase is the VSbO4 phase [52]."
          [42] "Its structure is derived from TiO2 rutile-type, with two Ti4+ cations formally substituted by one V and Sb cation with a cation deficiency related to the presence of V4+."
          [43] "The redox properties of the VSbO4 phase have been studied by electrical conductivity measurements [58]."
          [44] "This phase is an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the main charge carriers."
          [45] "The study of the changes in the electrical conductivity during alternative exposures to propane, oxygen and mixtures of propane and oxygen at the catalytic reaction temperature showed that it became a p-type semiconductor after reduction under propane (figure 8)."
          [46] "The existence of such irreversible change is supported by the fact that after the first reduction, the solid undergoes redox cycles that are not reversible and remain charac- teristic of a p-type semiconductor."
          [47] "The first increase in electrical conductivity under propane is related to that of the free electron concentration originating from ion- ized anionic vacancies formation according to the reaction:xC3H8  V40:64V30:28Sb50:92(0:16O4 ! V40:642xV30:282xSb50:92(0:16O4x  xC3H6  xH2O."
          [48] "The solid containing both cationic and anionic vacancies is not stable and a phase transformation should occur leading to a vanadium antimonate, richer in vanadium and supporting an antimony oxide, partially coating the surface."
          [49] "However, all the data obtained show that the active catalytic site at the surface of the vanadium antimonate could corre- spond to isolated vanadium species neighboring a cat- ionic vacancy [59,60]."
          [50] "Such arrangement should induce the stabilization of O) species allowing the activation of the alkane molecule."
          [51] "The structure of the active M1 phase has been solved and its detailed composition determined [66]."
          [52] "It corresponds to a network of MO6 octaedra (M = Mo, V and Nb) sharing corners or edges (figure 9a)."
          [53] "The heptagonal channels are empty and the hexagonal channels are occupied by tellurium or antimony cations and oxides forming chains in the direction of the chan- nels."
          [54] "It has been proposed that the activation of the alkane molecule occurred on the vanadium sites located in M7 position in the structure and that the activity of this site was explained by the resonance form in which vanadium underwent a charge transfer leading to a surface O)."
          [55] "This O) would be able to perform H abstraction from the propane molecule at the methylene position to produce a secondary propyl radical."
          [56] "A second step would correspond to a methyl abstraction to the oxygen on a neighboring tellurium cation [69]."
          [57] "The charge transfer is localized at the vanadium site on the surface and the M1 phase is, and remains in the conditions of catalytic test, n-type semi- conductor [70]."
          [58] "The direct charge transfer proposed in Eq. (13) may be not the only way to generate active O) sites at the surface of the M1 phase."
          [59] "A recent study of the phase Mo3Nb2O14, which presents a Mo5O14 type phase structure with pentagonal channels similar to those of the M1 phase, has shown that although only Mo6+ were expected to be present to balance the charge in the structure, Mo5+ were identified by EPR [71]."
          [60] "This feature was explained by the existence of a substitution disorder between Nb and Mo cations and the instability of the configuration in which l3 oxygen (O l3 in fig- ure 9b) were bonded to three Mo6+ atoms leading to the reduction of one of the Mo6+ atoms with the formation of a hole in the valence band."
          [61] "Taking into account Eq. (2), this could be expressed by the following equation: Mo6 Nb  O2 ! Mo5 Nb  O."
          [62] "However this later pathway should likely be a minor pathway as compared to the former."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, the rates of which can be measured from the effects of residence time on formation rates of alkenes and COx (CO and CO2)."
          [2] "Catalytic turnovers for oxidative dehydrogenation of MoOx and VOx proceed via reduction-oxidation cycles."
          [3] "These cycles involve the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms via pathways first proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."
          [4] "Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which involves the activation of the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms at the surface of reducible oxide domains."
          [5] "The catalytic sequence, depicted in Scheme 4, requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation."
          [6] "Thus, the ability to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO (DE2; Scheme 3) is likely to lead to significant catalytic consequences."
          [7] "The concurrent changes observed in absorption edge energies and in the stabilization of the transition state for CH bond cleavage and OH and CO bond formation reflect the increased ability of larger domains to accept electrons, consistent with their lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity."
          [8] "These trends are also consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis."
          [9] "For a given reactant (DE1, XH bond dissociation energy and H ionization energy,endothermic) and cluster (with protonation enthalpy DE3,exothermic), a lower lying LUMO (DE2) leads to a more exothermic H abstraction reaction (DHCH,abstr = DE1 + DE2 + DE3) and activation barrier (Eact,CH,abst) assuming an Evans-Polyani correlation of Eact,CH,abst and DHCH,abstr according to Eact,CH,abst = E0 + aDHCH,abstr,where E0 and a are constants."
          [10] "Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates (per Mo-atom) increased with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy, as the latter approaches values typical of saturated polymolybdate monolayers."
          [11] "These trends indicate that the reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become increasingly able to accept electron density and to stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps relative to smaller domains with higher-lying LUMO states."
          [12] "Ultimately, higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, which renders the use of the total number of Mo atoms inappropriate as a measure of the number of active sites."
          [13] "As a result, turnover rates reported on the basis of Mo atoms inevitably and ultimately decrease with increasing MoOx surface densities (Fig. 12) as a result of the prevalence of inaccessible Mo-oxo species."
          [14] "These catalytic trends resemble those reported previously for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane on VOx domains and for reactions of propane on MoOx domains dispersed on other supports."
          [15] "Similar trends have also been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains and on more reducible RuOx domains."
          [16] "The observed effects of domain size on catalysis parallel similar effects on the dynamics of their incipient stoichiometric reduction in H2, a process that leads to the formation of isolated vacancies and which resembles the elementary steps involved in the reduction part of catalytic dehydrogenation cycles."
          [17] "Stoichiometric reduction rates increased with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities,consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies."
          [18] "The mechanistic connections between oxidative dehydrogenation rates and the LMCT absorption edge in the electronic spectra of dispersed oxides are evident from the data shown in Fig. 13."
          [19] "Catalytic turnover rates on VOx, MoOx, WOx, and NbOx domains dispersed predominantly as monomers or two-dimensional oligomers on various supports (Al2O3, ZrO2, MgO) are shown as a function of their corresponding LMCT energies."
          [20] "For all active oxides, ODH turnover rates (per active metal atom) increased monotonically as LMCT energies decreased."
          [21] "These results indicate that the stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends sensitively on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates."
          [22] "The UV-visible absorption edge energy decreases as the energy level of the LUMO decreases and as the electron affinity of the cluster (Scheme 3, DE2) increases."
          [23] "These effects influence, in turn, the energies of intermediates and transition states that require electron transfer to the cluster."
          [24] "They lead to the exponential dependence of propane ODH turnover rates on LMCT absorption edge energies evident from Fig. 13."
          [25] "The identity of the metal has the strongest impact on both LMCT absorption edge energy and propane ODH turnover rates."
          [26] "More reducible supports and higher surface densities lead to higher propane ODH turnover rates for a given element and to lower edge energies and lower-lying LUMO states, which stabilize both the products and the transition state in CH bond activation steps."
          [27] "MoOx and VOx domains can be made similar in reactivity,in spite of their different chemical identities, by dispersing the latter as smaller domains or onto less reducible supports than the former."
          [28] "Thus, we conclude that quantum confinement effects, imposed by the size and electronic isolation of oxide domains, can be used to design materials with electronic properties and catalytic functions controlled by properties other than chemical composition."

[1] "The effect of cation identity on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways was examined using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2."
          [2] "The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2; the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence, suggesting that turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, which are in turn influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides."
          [3] "These results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces."
          [4] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
          [5] "The differences observed among VOx, MoOx, WOx and other oxides suggest that other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and therefore the acidbase properties of active oxides and of supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields."
          [6] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, 25,26 making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."
          [7] "The greater reactivity of propene arises in part because the weakest CH bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene."
          [8] "The limited available kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides leads us to expect that the reaction also occurs by the steps leading to eq 1."
          [9] "The similar site requirements for reactions 1 and 3 (suggested by the effects of VOx structure on selectivity)25,26 and the markedly different values of ΔS3 and ΔS1 measured (Table 2) indicate that propane ODH (reaction 1) and propene combustion (reaction 3) pathways involve transition states with different structures."
          [10] "The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy in step I and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species in step II (eq 7)."
          [11] "The apparent activation energy for propene combustion (ΔE3) is lower than for propene dehydrogenation (ΔE1) on all three catalysts (Table 2)."
          [12] "The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios (eq 12)."
          [13] "The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values (Table 2) indeed increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations."
          [14] "The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species seem to account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2; Figure 5)."
          [15] "Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts."

[1] "The partial oxidation of methane into more useful chemicals such as methanol, ethylene and benzene has been investigated extensively, although yields for these products have been poor14."
          [2] "Moreover, in several of these processes the required oxidant is N2O rather than O2."
          [3] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."
          [4] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."
          [5] "We report here our success in converting CH4 to C2 compounds in high yields in conventional catalytic conditions."

[1] "The activation of alkanes is more difcult than that of the corresponding olens,but their large reserves underline the economic inter- est in their conversion."
          [2] "The selective conversion of parafns to aromatics, to olens or to organic molecules con- taining oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products."
          [3] "The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial pro- cesses."
          [4] "The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydro- carbons would provide an attractive alternative."
          [5] "The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implica- tions in catalytic performance are discussed, under- lining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies."
          [6] "The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity."
          [7] "The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their clea- vage should be the rst step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons."
          [8] "The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons (Table 1), CH bonds on secondary and tertiary car- bons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites."
          [9] "The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an afnity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst."
          [10] "The afnity between the hydrocarbon and the sur- face promotes the activation of the molecules. Selec- tivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species."
          [11] "The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance,because it determines how fast the surface intermedi- ates react."
          [12] "The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation."
          [13] "The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduc- tion with hydrogen or hydrocarbon."
          [14] "The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2- oxygenates."
          [15] "The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions."
          [16] "The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen spe- cies is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation."

          [18] "The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity."
          [19] "The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation."
          [20] "The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support."
          [21] "The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility."
          [22] "The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vana- dium oxide catalysts has been explored."
          [23] "Both, acidbase and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane."
          [24] "The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modies the redox properties and increases the acidic proper- ties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene."
          [25] "The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxida- tion state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te."

          [33] "The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide."
          [34] "The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagree- ments found when connecting the activity and redu- cibility of the catalysts."

[1] "The accent is put on the mechanisms and the kinetic models used for the description of this reaction. The main catalysts for ODH of light alkanes and the specific features of each type of alkane are discussed. Influence of the type of supports, promoters, acid base properties, type of oxygen on the performance of ODH reaction is also discussed."
