Supported metal oxide catalysts, for instance, are affected by the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. Selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, and secondary surface metal oxide additives can enhance propane activation to propylene. Incorporating high vanadium contents in hosting structures can sometimes lead to structural instability. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 is crucial for high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, with propane ODH rates increasing with Mo surface density up to a certain point. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo-O strength, with stronger bonds showing lower ODH activity. The activation of ethane CH bonds forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates. Alkali additives affect the structure of MoOx domains, influencing their electronic and catalytic properties, and can inhibit the reduction of MoOx, affecting the CH bond activation step and leading to higher selectivity to propylene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},

The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step.\nThe mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction.\nAn adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer.\nIt clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reac- tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned.\nThe homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state.

It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present.\nFor instance in the work by Volta et al.,it was shown that single crystal type samples of MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and (101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to acrolein and CO x [4].\nThe originality of the work was to synthesize crystals of various shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite.\nA more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5].\nIt is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al- Table 1 Structure sensitivity of the different faces of MoO 3 crystals in olefin oxidation at 380C ([4]) Reactant olefin products Relative selectivity per faces Reactant olefin Products Basal (010) Side (100) Apical (101), (1) Propene Acrolein 0.06 2.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 But- 1 -ene Butadiene 3 9.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 Isobutene Methacrolein 0 0.6 Acetone 0.06 0 CO, CO 2 0 1 0.7 0 2 0 0.1 0.06 0 6\nSuch clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds. For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons. It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].\nThe lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.\nOne very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.\nIn some cases the chemical effect of the support will be determining for catalytic proper- ties. For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide supports (SiO 2, TiO 2, A1203) were shown by Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.\nAn important parameter for the impregnation method is the pH of the molybdate solution. As a matter of fact the following equilibrium has been well established: MovO64 + 4HzO , 7MoO 2- + 8H +\nThe monomeric tetrahedral MoO4 z- species is favored at higher pH and vice versa for the polymeric heptamolybdate anion.\nMoreover one defines the so-called isoelectric point of the support (ieps) or zero point charge (zpc) of a support by the pH value for which the surface charge turns from anionic to cationic, i.e. will allow cations or anions from the liquid phase to be adsorbed, respectively.\nOne has values of 2 for silica, 5-6 for titania, 8 for alumina, etc.\nThis clearly shows that the size of the adsorbed anion (monomeric or polymeric) adsorbed on a support will depend on the ieps (zpc) value, i.e. on the support itself.\nAbove the ieps value, the surface of a particular oxide is negatively charged and vice versa below.\nThe anion will thus be adsorbed for a pH value below the ieps value and as said above a lower pH value will favor polymolybdate anionic species.\nThe former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.\nThe formation of the former species was described by the reaction in Scheme 2.\nCatalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation.\nThe first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.\nOne gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air.\nThe experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings.\nThis indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7).\nThe second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8).\nWeak activity was observed for low Mo loading.\nAt higher Mo loading propanal was the major product while acrolein was also observed.\nAt very high Mo loadings and for MoO 3 one gets almost exclu- 2,0 1,5 Propana ' 1,0 0 o,5 Acrolein \" 0,0 ,,,,,0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Mo loading (wt %) Fig. 8.

The selectivity in ethylene is correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by specific signals. For propane, the catalytic activity is attributed to Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface, while the selectivity in propene is due to Cu 2+ ions in substitutional sites. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, with site isolation playing a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the distribution and nature of active sites.", "Doi": "10.1007/bf02070119"},
{"Quotes": "No quotes provided.", "English": "The document discusses the oxidative coupling of methane, which involves similar concepts to ODH. The best catalysts for oxidative coupling provide 20% methane conversion with 80% combined ethane and ethylene selectivity in a single pass through the reactor. The mechanism involves the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface and free-radical chemistry in the gas phase. Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of surface-generated CH3 radicals in the gas phase. The yield of C2H4 and C2H6 is limited by secondary reactions of CH3 radicals with the surface and further oxidation of C2H4, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. Several of the better oxidative coupling catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane, and in each case, the catalyst has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The initial activation step for both CH4 and C2H6 is believed to be the same - the formation of alkyl radicals. The C2H5 radicals have been identified with the MIESR system. The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of O2, reaction (11) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2. For CH3 radicals, there is no analogous route to the formation of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C2H4 from the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from oxidative coupling of CH4. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions, a C2H4 selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C2H6 conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%. Moreover, because the C-H bond strength in C2H6 (422 kJ mol-1) is less than that in CH4 (439 kJ mol-1), the rates of reaction are substantially greater with C2H6.", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.199509701"},

However, achieving high selectivity and conversion remains difficult due to the multitude of possible reaction pathways and steps that occur simultaneously on the adsorbed phase without desorption. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes, but no single mechanism stands out as universally applicable. The goal is to propose a common activation site for several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation. The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule corresponds to an oxidative dehydrogenation. Different mechanisms have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties like strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species. The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, and their presence in oxidation catalysts should be related to structure defects.

on the formation rates of alkenes and COx. The catalytic turnovers for ODH of MoOx and VOx proceed through reduction-oxidation cycles, involving the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms. Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which activates the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms. The catalytic sequence requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation. The ability of oxide domains to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO, leads to significant catalytic consequences. Larger domains have lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity, which increases their ability to accept electrons. This is consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates increase with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy. The reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become more able to accept electron density and stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps. Higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, decreasing turnover rates. Similar trends have been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, ethane, and oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains, and on more reducible RuOx domains. Stoichiometric reduction rates increase with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities, consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates. The UV-visible absorption edge energy decreases as the energy level of the LUMO decreases and as the electron affinity of the cluster increases. Quantum confinement effects, imposed by the size and electronic isolation of oxide domains, can be used to design materials with electronic properties and catalytic functions controlled by properties other than chemical composition.", "Doi": "10.1039/b805251d"},

The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the reaction rates decrease in this sequence. The relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend on CH bond energy differences and the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+). Other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acidbase properties of active oxides and supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions requires the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. The greater reactivity of propene arises because the weakest CH bond in propane is stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene. The limited kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides suggests a similar reaction mechanism. The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species.

The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate paraffins, thus limiting selectivity. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of water in the reaction feed decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen-containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00053-x"},

Supported metal oxide catalysts, for instance, are affected by the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. Selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, and secondary surface metal oxide additives can enhance propane activation to propylene. Incorporating high vanadium contents in hosting structures can sometimes lead to structural instability. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 is crucial for high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, with propane ODH rates increasing with Mo surface density up to a certain point. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo-O strength, with stronger bonds showing lower ODH activity. The activation of ethane CH bonds forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates. Alkali additives affect the structure of MoOx domains, influencing their electronic and catalytic properties, and can inhibit the reduction of MoOx, affecting the CH bond activation step and leading to higher selectivity to propylene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},

It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].\nThe lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.\nOne very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.\nIn some cases the chemical effect of the support will be determining for catalytic proper- ties.

[22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.\nAn important parameter for the impregnation method is the pH of the molybdate solution.

{"Quotes": "No quotes provided.", "English": "The document discusses the oxidative coupling of methane, which involves similar concepts to ODH. The best catalysts for oxidative coupling provide 20% methane conversion with 80% combined ethane and ethylene selectivity in a single pass through the reactor. The mechanism involves the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface and free-radical chemistry in the gas phase. Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of surface-generated CH3 radicals in the gas phase. The yield of C2H4 and C2H6 is limited by secondary reactions of CH3 radicals with the surface and further oxidation of C2H4, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. Several of the better oxidative coupling catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane, and in each case, the catalyst has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The initial activation step for both CH4 and C2H6 is believed to be the same - the formation of alkyl radicals. The C2H5 radicals have been identified with the MIESR system. The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of O2, reaction (11) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2. For CH3 radicals, there is no analogous route to the formation of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C2H4 from the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from oxidative coupling of CH4. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions, a C2H4 selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C2H6 conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%. Moreover, because the C-H bond strength in C2H6 (422 kJ mol-1) is less than that in CH4 (439 kJ mol-1), the rates of reaction are substantially greater with C2H6.", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.199509701"},

Different mechanisms have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties like strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species. The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, and their presence in oxidation catalysts should be related to structure defects. The dynamic nature of a catalytic oxide surface suggests that the concept of localized active sites should be taken with caution. A complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate encompassing the dynamics of the surface and the adsorbed species, as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid. Electrical conductivity measurements can provide information on the existence of oxidizing species and the nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reactions, characterizing the structure defects and helping to identify the active oxygen species. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by stabilizing active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species.", "Doi": "10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y"},

The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the reaction rates decrease in this sequence. The relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend on CH bond energy differences and the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+). Other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acidbase properties of active oxides and supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions requires the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. The greater reactivity of propene arises because the weakest CH bond in propane is stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene. The limited kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides suggests a similar reaction mechanism. The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species. The apparent activation energy for propene combustion is lower than for propene dehydrogenation, leading to a decrease in the k3/k1 ratio and an increase in propene yields as temperature increases.

The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate paraffins, thus limiting selectivity. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of water in the reaction feed decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen-containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00053-x"},

Supported metal oxide catalysts, for instance, are affected by the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. Selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, and secondary surface metal oxide additives can enhance propane activation to propylene. Incorporating high vanadium contents in hosting structures can sometimes lead to structural instability. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 is crucial for high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, with propane ODH rates increasing with Mo surface density up to a certain point. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo-O strength, with stronger bonds showing lower ODH activity. The activation of ethane CH bonds forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates. Alkali additives affect the structure of MoOx domains, influencing their electronic and catalytic properties, and can inhibit the reduction of MoOx, affecting the CH bond activation step and leading to higher selectivity to propylene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},

Propene oxidation to acrolein (nucleophilic attack) and propanal (electrophilic attack) at 400C on MoO 3/SiO 2 catalysts versus Mo loading (from [23]).\nPropanal is known to stem from propene by an electrophilic attack while acrolein corresponds rather to a nucleophilic attack.\nThese results indicate that monomeric MoO 2- species does not oxidize propene in our condi- tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- ing rather electrophilic.\nMolybdenum oxide ex- hibits redox properties with 0 2- species being rather nucleophilic.\nOne can thus realise how the size of the active site is important in oxida- tion catalysis.\nThis is typical of structure sensi- tive reaction.\nSuch a catalyst is well known for several reactions, such as o-xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia.\nThe anatase form of TiO 2 appears to be better than the rutile form.\nSuch catalysts with 1 and 8 wt% V2Os/anatase was prepared by RhSne-Poulenc (S  10 m 2 g-1) for an exercise of characterization by 25 different European laboratories.\nAll results are assembled in a special issue of Catalysis Today published in May 1994, Vol. 20, no. 1.\nSurface vanadium species were observed to exist in three different forms: monomeric VO43- species,polymeric vanadate species and V205 crystal-\nThe following conclusions could be drawn considering that a polyvanadate species occu- pies a ca circular zone of a diameter of 0.38 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.165 nm 2) and an isolated monovanadate species 0.66 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.43 nm2):\n(i) Monomeric VO 3- species exhibit acidic character with OH groups (BriSnsted acidity) and result in propene formation for isopropanol conversion and in total oxidation for o-xylene oxidation.\nMaximum coverage equals 0.43 wt% V205.\n(ii) Polyvanadate surface species exhibit re- dox properties, namely give rise to acetone for isopropanol conversion and phthalic anhydride for o-xylene oxidation.\n(iii) V205 crystallites exhibit low activity for o-xylene conversion and high selectivity in total oxidation.\nThe size of the polyvanadate species in solu- tion corresponds to V3093-, V402 with tetrahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 7 and 4.5 respec- tively and V10068 - or V10028H 5- with octahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 2.5.\nDeposition of such polyvanadates of different sizes was per- formed carefully on \"y-A1203 support and their initial structures depicted above were shown to remain stable even after calcination in flowing air at 500C and to be only partly modified after catalytic reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the 350 to 450C range.\nMoreover in such cases, the selectivity towards propene was observed to be the same at the same con- version level, indicating that in this size domain of polyvanadate species the catalytic selectivity was not changed, only the activity was observed to increase with vanadium loading [27].\nIn a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations ex- changed or impregnated on the surface of zirco- nium hydrogenophosphates and compared to vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phos- phate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 500C were observed when the material present either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 6 octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 4 re- spectively or chains of limited size [28].\nBy comparison with bulk oxides exhibiting similar environment, it was suggested as for supported VO and CrO x species on zirconium hy- drogenophosphates that the catalytic perfor- mances were related to the stronger basic char- acter of PO 3- anions with respect to 0 2- an- ions.\nSome general conclusions may be drawn from this general presentation:(i) Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heteroge- neous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice 12\nJ.C. Vedrine et al. / Catalysis Today 33 (1997) 3-13\noxygen ions.\nSuch ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring.\n(ii) Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts.\nA pecu- liar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst.\nParameters such as reducibility and reoxidability features of the oxides are very important for catalytic reac- tions.\n(iii) Active sites for oxidation reactions ap- pear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influ- ences the catalytic properties.\nIn some examples the number of atoms constituting the active sites could be established.\nFor instance double trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra are particularly active and selective for oxidative dehydrogena- tion of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates; ensembles of four dimers of VO 6 octahedra are suggested to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhy- dride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts.\nUsually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties.\nAt variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many par- tial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide.\nIt is thus clear that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is important depending on the reaction considered and the support used.\nThe characteri- zation of such 'clusters' lying on the surface is rather difficult and the above statements for supported oxide catalysts are only qualitative.\nTo better characterize such clusters, techniques as XANES (sensitive to local symmetry type), EXAFS (sensitive to the coordination number and nearby element distances) and radial elec- tron distribution (RED) of X-ray diffraction peaks (sensitive to the nearby element dis- tances) have to be used.\nAlready data have been obtained for MoO 3 and V205 deposited on SiO 2, A1203 or TiO 2 support.\nThis holds true only if one has one type of cluster species to analyse.\nThe reader interested may read a chapter de- voted to XANES and EXAFS techniques by Moraweck in the book by Imelik and Vdrine (1988 and 1994) ([29,30]).\n(iv) Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions.\nThis is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice.\nThis latter phenomenon results from the wetting effect particularly for multicomponent and supported oxide catalysts.\nIt follows that for many catalysts a certain time on stream is nec- essary before the catalyst reaches its steady state.\nIt is frequent that in an industrial plant a steady state is reached only after one or two hundreds hours, the catalysts lasting several years before having to be replaced.\nFor simple catalysts as doped vanadyl pyrophosphates used for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the right size of the active sites (e.g. tetramers of vanadyl dimers) is monitored by the reactants in catalytic reaction conditions leading to the right VS+/V 4+ ratio, by the preparation procedure to change the material morphology (the (100) face of (VO)2P20 7 being developed), and by the adequate addition of additive elements which regulate the site size and VS+/V 4+ ion ratio.\nThe view of an oxidation catalyst as dynamical under catalytic reaction conditions is essential for our understanding of its functioning.", "English": "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems.

{"Quotes": "No quotes provided.", "English": "The document discusses the oxidative coupling of methane, which involves similar concepts to ODH. The best catalysts for oxidative coupling provide 20% methane conversion with 80% combined ethane and ethylene selectivity in a single pass through the reactor. The mechanism involves the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface and free-radical chemistry in the gas phase. Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of surface-generated CH3 radicals in the gas phase. The yield of C2H4 and C2H6 is limited by secondary reactions of CH3 radicals with the surface and further oxidation of C2H4, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. Several of the better oxidative coupling catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane, and in each case, the catalyst has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The initial activation step for both CH4 and C2H6 is believed to be the same - the formation of alkyl radicals. The C2H5 radicals have been identified with the MIESR system. The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of O2, reaction (11) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2. For CH3 radicals, there is no analogous route to the formation of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C2H4 from the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from oxidative coupling of CH4. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions, a C2H4 selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C2H6 conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%. Moreover, because the C-H bond strength in C2H6 (422 kJ mol-1) is less than that in CH4 (439 kJ mol-1), the rates of reaction are substantially greater with C2H6.", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.199509701"},

Efficient catalysts, such as VPO or VSbO-based systems, have been developed to overcome the activation step of alkanes, which is crucial for the process. However, achieving high selectivity and conversion remains difficult due to the multitude of possible reaction pathways and steps that occur simultaneously on the adsorbed phase without desorption. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes, but no single mechanism stands out as universally applicable. The goal is to propose a common activation site for several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation. The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule corresponds to an oxidative dehydrogenation. Different mechanisms have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties like strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species. The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, and their presence in oxidation catalysts should be related to structure defects. The dynamic nature of a catalytic oxide surface suggests that the concept of localized active sites should be taken with caution. A complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate encompassing the dynamics of the surface and the adsorbed species, as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid. Electrical conductivity measurements can provide information on the existence of oxidizing species and the nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reactions, characterizing the structure defects and helping to identify the active oxygen species. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by stabilizing active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species.", "Doi": "10.1007/s11244-006-0073-y"},

The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate paraffins, thus limiting selectivity. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of water in the reaction feed decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen-containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00053-x"},

In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania.

A metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active and selective than other mixed-metal oxides. The ODH of propane to propylene is also of interest, and niobium oxide shows high selectivity, although conversion is low. Adding elements like V, Cr, and Mo to niobium oxide can improve its activity without affecting selectivity. The selectivity of vanadium sites in VNbO catalysts is enhanced by niobium neighbors, as niobium is harder to reduce than vanadium, which improves selectivity by preventing facile reduction that can lead to low selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr9800208"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The document discusses the use of lithium-promoted magnesium oxide as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen. The catalyst was effective in producing ethane and ethylene with high selectivity at relatively high conversions. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of methyl radicals through the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from methane by [Li'O-] centers on the catalyst surface. The coupling of two methyl radicals leads to the formation of ethane, which can be further oxidized to ethylene. The selectivity for C2 products and the conversion of methane both increased with increasing reaction temperature up to about 700°C. Low surface areas favored high C2 selectivities due to the dominant pathway of reacting CH3. with surface O2- ions leading to undesirable products of CO and CO2.

The second type involves an active oxygen compound or a metal ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two electrons transfer reaction. The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step.\nThe mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction.\nAn adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer.\nIt clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reac- tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned.\nThe homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one elec- tron to the metal.\nDepending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties.\nCase (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring.\nCase (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins.\nCase (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking).\nSuch a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present.\nFor instance in the work by Volta et al.,it was shown that single crystal type samples of MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and (101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to acrolein and CO x [4].\nThe originality of the work was to synthesize crystals of various shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite.\nA more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5].\nIt is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al- Table 1 Structure sensitivity of the different faces of MoO 3 crystals in olefin oxidation at 380C ([4]) Reactant olefin products Relative selectivity per faces Reactant olefin Products Basal (010) Side (100) Apical (101), (1) Propene Acrolein 0.06 2.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 But- 1 -ene Butadiene 3 9.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 Isobutene Methacrolein 0 0.6 Acetone 0.06 0 CO, CO 2 0 1 0.7 0 2 0 0.1 0.06 0 6\nSuch clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds. For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons. It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].\nThe lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.\nOne very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.\nIn some cases the chemical effect of the support will be determining for catalytic proper- ties. For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide supports (SiO 2, TiO 2, A1203) were shown by Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.\nAn important parameter for the impregnation method is the pH of the molybdate solution. As a matter of fact the following equilibrium has been well established: MovO64 + 4HzO , 7MoO 2- + 8H +\nThe monomeric tetrahedral MoO4 z- species is favored at higher pH and vice versa for the polymeric heptamolybdate anion.\nMoreover one defines the so-called isoelectric point of the support (ieps) or zero point charge (zpc) of a support by the pH value for which the surface charge turns from anionic to cationic, i.e. will allow cations or anions from the liquid phase to be adsorbed, respectively.\nOne has values of 2 for silica, 5-6 for titania, 8 for alumina, etc.\nThis clearly shows that the size of the adsorbed anion (monomeric or polymeric) adsorbed on a support will depend on the ieps (zpc) value, i.e. on the support itself.\nAbove the ieps value, the surface of a particular oxide is negatively charged and vice versa below.\nThe anion will thus be adsorbed for a pH value below the ieps value and as said above a lower pH value will favor polymolybdate anionic species.\nThe former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.\nThe formation of the former species was described by the reaction in Scheme 2.\nCatalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation.\nThe first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.\nOne gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air.\nThe experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings.\nThis indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7).\nThe second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8).\nWeak activity was observed for low Mo loading.\nAt higher Mo loading propanal was the major product while acrolein was also observed.\nAt very high Mo loadings and for MoO 3 one gets almost exclu- 2,0 1,5 Propana ' 1,0 0 o,5 Acrolein \" 0,0 ,,,,,0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Mo loading (wt %) Fig. 8.

The best catalysts for oxidative coupling provide 20% methane conversion with 80% combined ethane and ethylene selectivity in a single pass through the reactor. The mechanism involves the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface and free-radical chemistry in the gas phase. Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of surface-generated CH3 radicals in the gas phase. The yield of C2H4 and C2H6 is limited by secondary reactions of CH3 radicals with the surface and further oxidation of C2H4, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. Several of the better oxidative coupling catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane, and in each case, the catalyst has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The initial activation step for both CH4 and C2H6 is believed to be the same - the formation of alkyl radicals. The C2H5 radicals have been identified with the MIESR system. The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of O2, reaction (11) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2. For CH3 radicals, there is no analogous route to the formation of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C2H4 from the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from oxidative coupling of CH4. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions, a C2H4 selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C2H6 conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%.

Efficient catalysts, such as VPO or VSbO-based systems, have been developed to overcome the activation step of alkanes, which is crucial for the process. However, achieving high selectivity and conversion remains difficult due to the multitude of possible reaction pathways and steps that occur simultaneously on the adsorbed phase without desorption. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes, but no single mechanism stands out as universally applicable. The goal is to propose a common activation site for several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation. The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule corresponds to an oxidative dehydrogenation. Different mechanisms have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties like strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species. The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, and their presence in oxidation catalysts should be related to structure defects. The dynamic nature of a catalytic oxide surface suggests that the concept of localized active sites should be taken with caution. A complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate encompassing the dynamics of the surface and the adsorbed species, as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid. Electrical conductivity measurements can provide information on the existence of oxidizing species and the nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reactions, characterizing the structure defects and helping to identify the active oxygen species. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms.

The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate paraffins, thus limiting selectivity. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of water in the reaction feed decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen-containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00053-x"},

In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains.

It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al.

The best catalysts for oxidative coupling provide 20% methane conversion with 80% combined ethane and ethylene selectivity in a single pass through the reactor. The mechanism involves the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface and free-radical chemistry in the gas phase. Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of surface-generated CH3 radicals in the gas phase. The yield of C2H4 and C2H6 is limited by secondary reactions of CH3 radicals with the surface and further oxidation of C2H4, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. Several of the better oxidative coupling catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane, and in each case, the catalyst has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The initial activation step for both CH4 and C2H6 is believed to be the same - the formation of alkyl radicals. The C2H5 radicals have been identified with the MIESR system. The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of O2, reaction (11) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2. For CH3 radicals, there is no analogous route to the formation of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C2H4 from the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from oxidative coupling of CH4. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions, a C2H4 selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C2H6 conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%.

Efficient catalysts, such as VPO or VSbO-based systems, have been developed to overcome the activation step of alkanes, which is crucial for the process. However, achieving high selectivity and conversion remains difficult due to the multitude of possible reaction pathways and steps that occur simultaneously on the adsorbed phase without desorption. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes, but no single mechanism stands out as universally applicable. The goal is to propose a common activation site for several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation. The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule corresponds to an oxidative dehydrogenation. Different mechanisms have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties like strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species. The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, and their presence in oxidation catalysts should be related to structure defects.

The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the reaction rates decrease in this sequence. The relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend on CH bond energy differences and the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+). Other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acidbase properties of active oxides and supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions requires the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. The greater reactivity of propene arises because the weakest CH bond in propane is stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene. The limited kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides suggests a similar reaction mechanism. The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species. The apparent activation energy for propene combustion is lower than for propene dehydrogenation, leading to a decrease in the k3/k1 ratio and an increase in propene yields as temperature increases. The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios. The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations.

The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate paraffins, thus limiting selectivity. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of water in the reaction feed decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen-containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00053-x"},

Despite the study of various catalytic systems, the nature of the active and selective sites in the ODH of short chain alkanes is still under discussion. The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species, which can affect its redox properties. Monolayer systems have been studied to optimize the dispersion of active sites and understand the influence of the support. The nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. However, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under investigation. The aim of the paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts and understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00029-x"},

Supported metal oxide catalysts, for instance, are affected by the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. Selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, and secondary surface metal oxide additives can enhance propane activation to propylene. Incorporating high vanadium contents in hosting structures can sometimes lead to structural instability. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 is crucial for high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, with propane ODH rates increasing with Mo surface density up to a certain point. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo-O strength, with stronger bonds showing lower ODH activity. The activation of ethane CH bonds forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates. Alkali additives affect the structure of MoOx domains, influencing their electronic and catalytic properties, and can inhibit the reduction of MoOx, affecting the CH bond activation step and leading to higher selectivity to propylene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},

The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step.\nThe mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction.\nAn adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer.\nIt clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reac- tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned.\nThe homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one elec- tron to the metal.\nDepending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties.\nCase (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring.\nCase (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins.\nCase (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking).\nSuch a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present.\nFor instance in the work by Volta et al.,it was shown that single crystal type samples of MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and (101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to acrolein and CO x [4].\nThe originality of the work was to synthesize crystals of various shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite.\nA more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5].\nIt is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al- Table 1 Structure sensitivity of the different faces of MoO 3 crystals in olefin oxidation at 380C ([4]) Reactant olefin products Relative selectivity per faces Reactant olefin Products Basal (010) Side (100) Apical (101), (1) Propene Acrolein 0.06 2.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 But- 1 -ene Butadiene 3 9.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 Isobutene Methacrolein 0 0.6 Acetone 0.06 0 CO, CO 2 0 1 0.7 0 2 0 0.1 0.06 0 6\nSuch clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds. For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons. It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].\nThe lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.\nOne very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.\nIn some cases the chemical effect of the support will be determining for catalytic proper- ties. For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide supports (SiO 2, TiO 2, A1203) were shown by Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.\nAn important parameter for the impregnation method is the pH of the molybdate solution. As a matter of fact the following equilibrium has been well established: MovO64 + 4HzO , 7MoO 2- + 8H +\nThe monomeric tetrahedral MoO4 z- species is favored at higher pH and vice versa for the polymeric heptamolybdate anion.\nMoreover one defines the so-called isoelectric point of the support (ieps) or zero point charge (zpc) of a support by the pH value for which the surface charge turns from anionic to cationic, i.e. will allow cations or anions from the liquid phase to be adsorbed, respectively.\nOne has values of 2 for silica, 5-6 for titania, 8 for alumina, etc.\nThis clearly shows that the size of the adsorbed anion (monomeric or polymeric) adsorbed on a support will depend on the ieps (zpc) value, i.e. on the support itself.\nAbove the ieps value, the surface of a particular oxide is negatively charged and vice versa below.\nThe anion will thus be adsorbed for a pH value below the ieps value and as said above a lower pH value will favor polymolybdate anionic species.\nThe former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.\nThe formation of the former species was described by the reaction in Scheme 2.\nCatalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation.\nThe first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.\nOne gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air.\nThe experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings.\nThis indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7).\nThe second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8).\nWeak activity was observed for low Mo loading.\nAt higher Mo loading propanal was the major product while acrolein was also observed.\nAt very high Mo loadings and for MoO 3 one gets almost exclu- 2,0 1,5 Propana ' 1,0 0 o,5 Acrolein \" 0,0 ,,,,,0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Mo loading (wt %) Fig. 8.

The best catalysts for oxidative coupling provide 20% methane conversion with 80% combined ethane and ethylene selectivity in a single pass through the reactor. The mechanism involves the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface and free-radical chemistry in the gas phase. Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of surface-generated CH3 radicals in the gas phase. The yield of C2H4 and C2H6 is limited by secondary reactions of CH3 radicals with the surface and further oxidation of C2H4, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. Several of the better oxidative coupling catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane, and in each case, the catalyst has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The initial activation step for both CH4 and C2H6 is believed to be the same - the formation of alkyl radicals. The C2H5 radicals have been identified with the MIESR system. The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of O2, reaction (11) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2. For CH3 radicals, there is no analogous route to the formation of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C2H4 from the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from oxidative coupling of CH4. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions, a C2H4 selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C2H6 conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%. Moreover, because the C-H bond strength in C2H6 (422 kJ mol-1) is less than that in CH4 (439 kJ mol-1), the rates of reaction are substantially greater with C2H6.", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.199509701"},

The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule corresponds to an oxidative dehydrogenation. Different mechanisms have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties like strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species. The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, and their presence in oxidation catalysts should be related to structure defects.

on the formation rates of alkenes and COx. The catalytic turnovers for ODH of MoOx and VOx proceed through reduction-oxidation cycles, involving the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms. Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which activates the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms. The catalytic sequence requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation. The ability of oxide domains to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO, leads to significant catalytic consequences. Larger domains have lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity, which increases their ability to accept electrons. This is consistent with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates increase with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy. The reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become more able to accept electron density and stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps. Higher surface densities lead to the formation of crystalline MoOx with inaccessible Mo centers, decreasing turnover rates. Similar trends have been observed for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, ethane, and oxygenates on VOx and MoOx domains, and on more reducible RuOx domains. Stoichiometric reduction rates increase with increasing MoOx and VOx surface densities, consistent with a concurrent decrease in their LUMO energies. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends on the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during reduction events that limit alkane dehydrogenation rates.

The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the reaction rates decrease in this sequence. The relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend on CH bond energy differences and the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+). Other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acidbase properties of active oxides and supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions requires the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. The greater reactivity of propene arises because the weakest CH bond in propane is stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene. The limited kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides suggests a similar reaction mechanism. The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species.

The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate paraffins, thus limiting selectivity. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of water in the reaction feed decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen-containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00053-x"},

The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species, as well as the acid-base character of catalysts, are crucial for the catalytic properties in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. Tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. The coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites, play a significant role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. These factors are essential for developing selective catalysts in ODH reactions. Supported metal oxides offer advantages such as higher mechanical strength, better thermal stability, and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is influenced by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. Mixing or supporting vanadium oxide on other metal oxides can enhance the selectivity of bulk V2O5 in the ODH of short chain alkanes, increasing the formation rate of desired olefins. Vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO) and V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides have shown high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane, propane, and ethane. V-containing molecular sieves have also shown high selectivity for oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidation of ethane and propane. Despite the study of various catalytic systems, the nature of the active and selective sites in the ODH of short chain alkanes is still under discussion. The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species, which can affect its redox properties. Monolayer systems have been studied to optimize the dispersion of active sites and understand the influence of the support. The nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. However, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under investigation. The aim of the paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts and understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00029-x"},
