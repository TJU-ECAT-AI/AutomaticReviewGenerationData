          [1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction."
          [2] "One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane."
          [3] "This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities."
          [4] "ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass."
          [5] "In fact, the corresponding supported systems give usually much higher activity and selectivity; they are discussed in more detail in section (vide infra)."
          [6] "Of several other systems that have been investigated, MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), (99, 100) VMgOx, (98, 101, 102) VSiZrOx, (103, 104) and CrSiMO (M = Al or Zr) (105) show relatively high selectivities."
          [7] "In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."
          [8] "Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant."
          [9] "It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6)."
          [10] "An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Scheme 5b)."
          [11] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a significant reaction, but it faces the challenge that the oxidation of the alkene product is often faster than the starting alkane, necessitating low conversions to achieve high selectivities. ODH can be performed on various bulk metal oxides, such as V2O5, but these yield low results per pass. Supported systems, on the other hand, offer higher activity and selectivity. Among the investigated systems, MOP, VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO show relatively high selectivities. The CH bond activation is identified as the rate-determining step in all cases. ODH, especially of ethane, requires high temperatures, where homogeneous gas phase reactions can dominate. CH bond activation is proposed to lead to Malkyl intermediates, which decompose to 1-alkenes through β-H abstraction. An alternative 2H-abstraction mechanism is also proposed. The selectivity between dehydrogenation and the formation of oxygenated products is correlated with the distance between sites, highlighting the importance of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues.

          氧化脱氢烷烃（ODH）是一个重要的反应，但面临着烷烃氧化产物的氧化往往比原料烷烃更快的挑战，这需要在低转化率下操作以达到高选择性。ODH可以在各种金属氧化物上进行，如V2O5，但每通过的产量很低。相比之下，支撑系统提供了更高的活性和选择性。在研究的系统中，MOP，VMgOx，VSiZrOx和CrSiMO显示出相对较高的选择性。在所有情况下，CH键活化被确定为速率决定步骤。提出CH键活化可能产生Malkyl中间体，这些中间体通过表面氧原子的β-H抽提迅速分解为相应的1-烯烃。还提出了一个替代的2H-抽提机制。脱氢与形成含氧产物的选择性与位点之间的距离相关，这表明了位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的重要性。
