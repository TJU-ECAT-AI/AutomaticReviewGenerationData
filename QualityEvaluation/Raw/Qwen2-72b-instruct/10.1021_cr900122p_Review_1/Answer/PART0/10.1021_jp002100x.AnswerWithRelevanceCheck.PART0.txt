          The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts is discussed, identifying the elementary steps and their reversibility. Propene is the most abundant primary product, and CO and CO2 are formed via either secondary combustion of propene or direct combustion of propane. Steps involving CH bond activation are irreversible, and normal kinetic isotopic effects were measured for propane dehydrogenation, propane combustion, and propene combustion. OH recombination steps are reversible and quasi-equilibrated. The proposed reaction mechanism is consistent with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, where two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of CH bonds in propane. The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene, and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers. The reduced Mo centers finally reoxidize by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2.

          讨论了ZrO2支撑的MoOx催化剂上的丙烷氧化脱氢，确定了基本步骤及其可逆性。丙烯是最丰富的初级产物，CO和CO2是通过丙烯的二次燃烧或丙烷的直接燃烧形成的。涉及CH键活化的步骤是不可逆的，丙烷脱氢、丙烷燃烧和丙烯燃烧的正常动力学同位素效应被测量。OH重组步骤是可逆的和准平衡的。提出的反应机制与Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机制一致，其中两个晶格氧参与丙烷中CH键的不可逆活化。由此产生的烷基物种以丙烯的形式解吸，剩余的OH基团与相邻的OH基团重组形成水和还原的Mo中心。还原的Mo中心最终通过O2的不可逆解离化学吸附重新氧化。
