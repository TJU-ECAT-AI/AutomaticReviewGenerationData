1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that ODH is an attractive route to alkenes, offering an exothermic process that eliminates coke formation, leading to stable catalysts. Several metal oxides have been examined as catalysts for ODH, with vanadium-based materials being among the most active. Molybdenum-based oxides are also promising catalysts for ODH, although with less activity, they show higher propylene selectivity as well as better thermostability. The literature focuses on the mechanisms of initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides, predicting that hydrogen abstraction by terminal MoO is the most feasible reaction pathway. It also discusses the regioselectivity of CH bond activation, finding that activating the methylene CH bond is 4.7 kcal/mol more favorable than activating the methyl CH bond. The calculated activation enthalpy and entropy for hydrogen abstraction are in reasonably good agreement with experimental values.

1.文献没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的全面分析，包括各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、提出的反应机制以及位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用。但是，它确实提到ODH是制备烯烃的一种有吸引力的途径，提供了一个放热过程，消除了焦炭的形成，导致催化剂稳定。已经检查了几种金属氧化物作为ODH的催化剂，其中基于钒的材料是最活跃的。基于钼的氧化物也是ODH的有希望的催化剂，尽管活性较低，但它们显示出更高的丙烯选择性以及更好的热稳定性。文献重点是钼氧化物上丙烷初始活化的机制，预测终端MoO的氢原子抽提是最可行的反应途径。它还讨论了CH键活化的区域选择性，发现活化亚甲基CH键比活化甲基CH键更有利4.7 kcal/mol。氢原子抽提的计算活化焓和熵与实验值相当吻合。
