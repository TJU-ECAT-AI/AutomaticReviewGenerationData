Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?

1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that ODH is an attractive route to alkenes, offering an exothermic process that eliminates coke formation, leading to stable catalysts. Several metal oxides have been examined as catalysts for ODH, with vanadium-based materials being among the most active. Molybdenum-based oxides are also promising catalysts for ODH, showing higher propylene selectivity and better thermostability. The literature focuses on the mechanisms of initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides, predicting that hydrogen abstraction by terminal MoO is the most feasible reaction pathway. It also discusses the regioselectivity of CH bond activation, finding that activating the methylene CH bond is more favorable than activating the methyl CH bond.

1.文献没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的全面分析，包括各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、提出的反应机制，以及位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用。但是，它确实提到ODH是制备烯烃的一种有吸引力的途径，提供了一个放热过程，消除了焦炭的形成，导致催化剂稳定。已经检查了几种金属氧化物作为ODH的催化剂，其中基于钒的材料是最活跃的。基于钼的氧化物也是ODH的有希望的催化剂，显示出更高的丙烯选择性和更好的热稳定性。文献专注于丙烷在钼氧化物上的初始激活机制，预测终端MoO的氢原子抽象是最可行的反应途径。它还讨论了CH键激活的区域选择性，发现激活亚甲基CH键比激活甲基CH键更有利。

The literature focuses on the mechanisms of initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides, predicting that hydrogen abstraction by terminal MoO is the most feasible reaction pathway. It also discusses the regioselectivity of CH bond activation, finding that activating the methylene CH bond is 4.7 kcal/mol more favorable than activating the methyl CH bond. The calculated activation enthalpy and entropy for hydrogen abstraction are in reasonably good agreement with experimental values.

1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, or how these factors collectively influence the process efficiency and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes offers an attractive route to alkenes, and several metal oxides have been examined as catalysts for ODH, with vanadium-based materials being among the most active. Molybdenum-based oxides are also promising catalysts for ODH, although with less activity, some Mo-based catalysts show higher propylene selectivity as well as better thermostability. The literature focuses on the mechanisms of initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides, predicting that hydrogen abstraction by terminal MoO is the most feasible reaction pathway for initial propane activation. The calculated activation energy is 32.3 kcal/mol for the methylene CH bond activations, in reasonably good agreement with the experimental value (28.0 kcal/mol). The 5 + 2 pathway using the methylene CH, although being advocated in the related VOx/ZrO2 systems, leads to a barrier of 49.0 kcal/mol, which is too high, and an incorrect KIE as compared to either the VOx/ZrO2 or MoOx/ZrO2 system. The 2 + 4 pathway, where both methylene and methyl CH bonds are involved simultaneously, gives a good KIE but leads to too high of a barrier (48.3 kcal/mol). On the basis of the comparison between the observed and the calculated KIEs, the literature proposes that a combined effect from both methylene and methyl CH bond cleavages leads to the experimentally observed overall KIEs for the ODH of propane to propylene on the MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts.

1.文献没有全面分析烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)、各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、提出的反应机制,以及这些因素如何集体影响过程效率,以及位点隔离在解决选择性问题中所起的作用。然而,它确实提到氧化脱氢(ODH)为低碳烷烃提供了一条吸引人的路线,几种金属氧化物已被研究作为ODH的催化剂,其中基于钒的材料是最活跃的。基于钼的氧化物也是ODH的有希望的催化剂,尽管活性较低,一些Mo基催化剂显示出更高的丙烯选择性以及更好的热稳定性。文献重点研究了丙烷在钼氧化物上的初始激活机制,预测终端MoO的氢抽象是丙烷初始激活最可行的反应途径。计算的活化能为32.3 kcal/mol,用于甲基CH键的活化,与实验值(28.0 kcal/mol)相当合理。使用甲基CH的5 + 2途径,尽管在相关的VOx/ZrO2系统中被提倡,导致49.0 kcal/mol的屏障,这太高了,并且与VOx/ZrO2或MoOx/ZrO2系统相比,不正确的KIE。2 + 4途径,其中同时涉及甲基和甲基CH键,给出了良好的KIE,但导致过高的屏障(48.3 kcal/mol)。根据观察到的和计算的KIE之间的比较,文献提出甲基和甲基CH键裂解的综合效应导致在MoOx/ZrO2催化剂上丙烷到丙烯的ODH实验观察到的总体KIE。
