1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, or how these factors collectively influence the process efficiency and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes offers an attractive route to alkenes, and several metal oxides have been examined as catalysts for ODH, with vanadium-based materials being among the most active. Molybdenum-based oxides are also promising catalysts for ODH, although with less activity, some Mo-based catalysts show higher propylene selectivity as well as better thermostability. The literature focuses on the mechanisms of initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides, predicting that hydrogen abstraction by terminal MoO is the most feasible reaction pathway for initial propane activation. The calculated activation energy is 32.3 kcal/mol for the methylene CH bond activations, in reasonably good agreement with the experimental value (28.0 kcal/mol). The 5 + 2 pathway using the methylene CH, although being advocated in the related VOx/ZrO2 systems, leads to a barrier of 49.0 kcal/mol, which is too high, and an incorrect KIE as compared to either the VOx/ZrO2 or MoOx/ZrO2 system. The 2 + 4 pathway, where both methylene and methyl CH bonds are involved simultaneously, gives a good KIE but leads to too high of a barrier (48.3 kcal/mol). On the basis of the comparison between the observed and the calculated KIEs, the literature proposes that a combined effect from both methylene and methyl CH bond cleavages leads to the experimentally observed overall KIEs for the ODH of propane to propylene on the MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts.

1.文献没有全面分析烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)、各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、提出的反应机制,以及这些因素如何集体影响过程效率,以及位点隔离在解决选择性问题中所起的作用。然而,它确实提到氧化脱氢(ODH)为低碳烷烃提供了一条吸引人的路线,几种金属氧化物已被研究作为ODH的催化剂,其中基于钒的材料是最活跃的。基于钼的氧化物也是ODH的有希望的催化剂,尽管活性较低,一些Mo基催化剂显示出更高的丙烯选择性以及更好的热稳定性。文献重点研究了丙烷在钼氧化物上的初始激活机制,预测终端MoO的氢抽象是丙烷初始激活最可行的反应途径。计算的活化能为32.3 kcal/mol,用于甲基CH键的活化,与实验值(28.0 kcal/mol)相当合理。使用甲基CH的5 + 2途径,尽管在相关的VOx/ZrO2系统中被提倡,导致49.0 kcal/mol的屏障,这太高了,并且与VOx/ZrO2或MoOx/ZrO2系统相比,不正确的KIE。2 + 4途径,其中同时涉及甲基和甲基CH键,给出了良好的KIE,但导致过高的屏障(48.3 kcal/mol)。根据观察到的和计算的KIE之间的比较,文献提出甲基和甲基CH键裂解的综合效应导致在MoOx/ZrO2催化剂上丙烷到丙烯的ODH实验观察到的总体KIE。
