1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, or how these factors collectively influence the process efficiency. However, it does mention that ODH of lower alkanes offers an attractive route to alkenes, that several metal oxides have been examined as catalysts for ODH, and that vanadium-based materials are among the most active. Molybdenum-based oxides are also promising catalysts for ODH, although with less activity, some Mo-based catalysts show higher propylene selectivity as well as better thermostability. The literature also reports the first detailed density functional theory study on the mechanisms of initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides, and predicts that hydrogen abstraction by terminal MoO is the most feasible reaction pathway.

1.文献没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)的全面分析，各种催化剂之间的相互作用，实现高选择性和转化率的挑战，提出的反应机制，以及这些因素如何共同影响过程效率。但是，它确实提到ODH为较低的烷烃提供了一条吸引人的路线，以生产烯烃，已经检查了几种金属氧化物作为ODH的催化剂，其中基于钒的材料是最活跃的。基于钼的氧化物也是ODH的有希望的催化剂，尽管活性较低，但一些基于Mo的催化剂显示出更高的丙烯选择性以及更好的热稳定性。文献还报告了关于丙烷在钼氧化物上初始激活机制的首次详细的密度泛函理论研究，并预测终端MoO的氢抽象是最可行的反应途径。
