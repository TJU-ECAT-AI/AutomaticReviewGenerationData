ABSTRACT
This review deals with the catalytic conversion of n-butane by oxidative
dehydrogenation as an alternative process to direct dehydrogenation, making
special reference to the catalytic systems used, kinetic studies performed and
reaction mechanisms proposed. Particular attention is also focused on the
hydrocarbon activation process and on the main factors governing catalytic
efﬁciency. Finally, after some general conclusions, future trends are analyzed.

INTRODUCTION
The multi-functional character of a catalytic system is manifested, for
instance, through the wide diversity of products obtained with a given reactant.
Butane is a good example because its oxidation occurs via several possible
reaction pathways including dehydrogenation, isomerization, oxidation with
oxygen insertion, partial oxidation with rupture of carbon–carbon bonds, and total
oxidation. Therefore, an attempt to review the most relevant research results
concerning one of its uses will, inevitably, refer to much information published for
other purposes. Thus, throughout this paper much information will be found
regarding, for example, butane to maleic anhydride oxidation, which is crucial to
an extensive examination of the state-of-the-art on butane oxidative dehydrogena-
tion (ODH).
A.
General Considerations—Economic Aspects
The wide availability and low price of light alkanes (about one half of that of
the corresponding alkenes) and the fact that they are generally environmentally
non-aggressive products, have provided incentives for their use as raw materials in
the chemical industry (1). A notable example of utilization of alkanes is their
conversion to unsaturated hydrocarbons, which are currently produced in steam
crackers (e.g., ethylene, propylene, isobutene, butadiene, etc.), because the
present-day chemical industry depends heavily on the use of oleﬁns as starting

materials. Indeed, the petrochemical industry’s tendency seems to be the direct use
of alkanes as raw materials instead of alkenes, due to the great abundance of
natural gas and liquiﬁed petroleum gas (LPG) (2–5). Consequently, more recent
studies and research, in an effort to meet future needs for chemical products, ﬁbers
and polymers, have focused on functionalization of parafﬁns instead of conversion
of oleﬁns.
In fact, efforts must be directed towards using cheaper raw materials. A
relevant example concerns styrene production via the butane–butadiene process.
Modern styrene production units are built with annual capacities of at least one
billion pounds (6). Since raw materials are responsible for about 80% of the cost of
styrene production, a potentially interesting process would be to start from butane,
available in large amounts and at low prices, which would be selectively oxidized
to butadiene, leading by dimerization to 4-vinylcyclohexene and subsequent
oxidation to styrene (6,7). However, such a process is not yet included in the main
uses of butane.
n-Butane, which can be recovered from LPG by distillation, has at present a
variety of industrial uses (8): steamcracking yields ethylene and propylene,
catalytic dehydrogenation yields butenes and butadiene, acid-catalyzed isomer-
ization provides i-butane, and maleic anhydride or acetic acid are obtained through
catalytic or non-catalytic oxidations, respectively. In the mid-1960s, among other
large-scale catalyzed reactions, dehydrogenations of butane to butenes and/or
butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene became prominent (9). In 1991, among the
147 billion pounds of organic products obtained via catalytic processes by the 50
top chemical industries in the United States, 9.8% were produced by
dehydrogenation (3).
The importance of butadiene synthesis is due to the fact that it is one of the
basic petrochemical products. It is used in the manufacture of butadiene–styrene
rubber (one of the major rubbers for manufacture of tyres), other synthetic rubbers
(e.g., latex, polybutadiene rubber, etc.), plastics with special mechanical
properties (e.g., polystyrene, ABS polymers, etc.), and as raw material in a wide
variety of chemical synthesis (8,10). The worldwide production of butadiene in
1983 amounted to 5:03  106 t (in North America the total was 1:20  106 t) (8)
and the trend has been for this production to increase. For instance, in 1990, US
production was about 1:36  106 t (11) and in 1993 around 1:47  106 t (12). In
1980, almost all the butadiene was produced by steam cracking from naphtha or
LPG, but catalytic dehydrogenation was already an important process (13).
Essentially two processes were used in the United States for butadiene synthesis: a
two-phase process departing from n-butane (Philips process), wherein butenes
were converted into butadiene in the second phase, or a single-stage process using
n-butane and n-butenes (Houdry Catadiene process). Butenes from reﬁning units
or from other sources also could be converted into butadiene through a single-
stage process (13). These processes were applied quickly to synthetic rubber
manufacture in the United States at the beginning of the Second World War when
natural-rubber sources were suddenly cut.

n-Butenes production is also of considerable industrial importance.
Estimated worldwide consumption of n-butenes in 1984 was about 18:1  106 t
(8). More than half of the butenes produced were used as alkylate and polymer
gasoline. Around one-third was used without any conversion as fuel, mainly as
fuel gas or blendstock for gasoline. Only 10% of the n-butenes were converted to
speciﬁc chemicals (8), including butadiene via dehydrogenation or ODH (e.g.,
Petro-Tex and British Petroleum Chemicals processes) (9,13–15). Butenes are
also used in maleic anhydride synthesis with vanadium and/or phosphorous oxides
(as an alternative to benzene oxidation with vanadium catalysts, which have been
used since the 1930s).
B.
Oxidative Dehydrogenation vs. Direct Dehydrogenation
It seems that nowadays, for conversion of light alkanes, ODH is more
promising than direct dehydrogenation. In reality, for light alkanes (C2 to C4), the
thermodynamic of the reaction
CnH2n12 $ CnH2n 1 H2
ð1Þ
is such that the alkane is favored by the equilibrium in the low temperatures and at
atmospheric pressure (1). Reactions are endothermic (e.g., for n-butane DHr is
about 134 kJ/mol) and in order to shift the equilibrium to product formation,
reactions must be carried out at relatively high temperatures (from 500 to 6508C)
(2,13). In addition, the number of molecules is higher on the product side and
consequently operation at high pressures, which is usually preferred in industrial
practice, would shift the equilibrium towards the unfavorable direction.
The use of high temperatures in catalytic dehydrogenation presents several
disadvantages (1,2). The difﬁculty in controlling undesirable reactions that
decrease selectivity (such as cracking of hydrocarbons) and coke formation over
the catalyst, which decreases activity, are the most signiﬁcant. Speciﬁc examples
are chromia–alumina catalysts (used in a commercial process for conversion of
alkanes), which require regeneration after a few minutes of operation (16). The
highly endothermic nature of the reaction is another disadvantage due to the need
to supply heat, which can be partially obtained in practice by burning coke in the
regeneration process.
For all these reasons, reactions of alkanes with oxygen:
CnH2n12 1 1
2 O2 ! CnH2n 1 H2O
ð2Þ
are excellent alternatives in the synthesis of alkenes (1,2). The formation of a very
stable product such as water makes this reaction very thermodynamically
favorable (1,4,16). Thus, in principle, practically complete conversion can be
attained even at low temperatures and high pressures, bringing enormous
advantages from the economic and process engineering points of view. However,
MADEIRA AND PORTELA
250
Downloaded by [Fondren Library, Rice University ] at 02:27 19 October 2012 
in such conditions selectivity also presents limitations, as mentioned below. Due
to the fact that the reaction is practically irreversible and exothermic, and can be
performed at very low temperatures, the formation of coke and cracking products
is insigniﬁcant (2,4). It should be stressed that in ODH processes parafﬁns can be
converted into the corresponding oleﬁns at temperatures about 2008C lower than
those used in dehydrogenation (17). Catalyst deactivation is further reduced by the
possible removal of coke and its precursors by oxygen (16).
Notwithstanding all the above-mentioned advantages over dehydrogenation,
ODH (as well as the majority of other catalytic-oxidation processes) has some
drawbacks (13): due to its exothermic character it may require special care in
reactor operation, some feed composition ranges can be explosive (leading to
limitations in feed compositions or to multiple air inlets), and the desired product
must be sufﬁciently stable in the reaction conditions in order to be removed from
the product stream before it decomposes or undergoes other subsequent reactions.
Indeed, selective oxidation of alkanes is a great challenge due to the nature of
the chemical bonds involved (18). Innumerable side reactions with oxygen are
possible, requiring highly selective catalysts. In many cases such reactions are
much more thermodynamically favorable than the desired ODH reaction, but the
secondary products usually have no economic interest when compared to the high
value of hydrogen, produced as a co-product in the conventional dehydrogenation
process (19). An alternative is to operate at low conversion levels leading to high
selectivities, but requiring product removal from the efﬂuent stream, which is
recycled back (possibly after puriﬁcation) or fed to a second reactor. Thus, ODH
reactions with high yield are a great challenge in catalysis.
Gaseous oxygen is the most widely used oxidant, leading to the formation of
water as a stable byproduct. This fact, from the thermodynamic point of view,
allows the use of lower reaction temperatures than simple dehydrogenation
without O2 (20). It is also opportune to mention that other dehydrogenation agents
could be used instead of oxygen, for instance bromine, sulfur, or iodine
compounds. Examples of such processes presenting high selectivities are propane
ODH in the presence of iodine, developed by Shell and Petro-Tex (4), and butane
ODH with iodine, known as the Idas process, also developed by Shell (8,19).
However, the corrosive nature of the products involved, the environmental
problems concerning their use, and the prohibitive cost of iodine, have hindered
the commercialization of such processes (14,21). In some cases, the use of
nitrogen oxide is also mentioned (1,2). Nevertheless, molecular oxygen is
undoubtedly the most attractive oxidant for industrial application due to its low
price and absence of environmental problems.
C.
Homogeneous Reactions with Oxygen
For n-butane ODH, there is a lack of information about the role and extent of
the homogeneous reactions. Several studies have been performed, mainly before
CATALYTIC ODH OF n-BUTANE
251
Downloaded by [Fondren Library, Rice University ] at 02:27 19 October 2012 
the 1960s, with the purpose of investigating light alkane reactions with oxygen in
gas phase (1). The main results of such work concern the fact that homogeneous
reactions of atoms or radicals with alkenes are much faster than with alkanes,
limiting the maximum yield attainable for the intended alkene. This yield
decreases with increasing difference of the rate constants for the two processes.
Another important issue is that dehydrogenation is the primary reaction in alkane
oxidation, while the majority of the degradation products are formed through
secondary reactions. Thus, high selectivities are occasionally obtained but for low
conversion levels.
More recently, some promising results were obtained with a catalytic bed
containing a V}Mg}O catalyst combined in series with a void volume (post-
catalytic), with beneﬁcial effects regarding the butane conversion level and the
overall selectivity to C2–C4 alkenes (22).
II.
CATALYTIC SYSTEMS USED
StudiesregardingODHofalkanesstartedinthe1960s,whentheimportanceof
the surface nature in catalytic behavior was emphasized. Some of the pioneering
studies concerning butane ODH were performed with cobalt molybdate—which
strongly favored butadiene formation by ODH and not by simple dehydrogenation
(23)—or with an Na and Li phosphomolybdate—which produced 17% of butadiene
and 5% of butenes at 6008C (24). Later on other studies proceeded with the
Co}Mo}O system (25,26). Nevertheless, these materials are not included in the
bestcatalyticsystemstestedsofar(1,2,16,19,27–58),whicharepresentedinTable1.
A.
Unsupported Catalysts
The majority of the systems applied in n-butane ODH are unsupported
catalysts. The number of papers found for V}Mg}O catalysts is particularly
noteworthy (see Table 1), these catalysts being used by several researchers,
including Kung and coworkers. Nickel molybdate catalysts also have been
investigated extensively, by the present authors too (38–47). Concerning the best
performances obtained, both vanadium- and nickel-containing oxides must be
distinguished, as mentioned below.
Other systems that were also used include zeolites (containing transition
metals) (17) and Fe}Zn mixed oxides (59–61).
Some of these systems are also analyzed by Cavani and Triﬁro
`, who
mentioned the following catalyst classes as active and selective for n-butane ODH
(19): Zn and Mn ferrites (used by Petro-Tex), supported vanadium oxide,
vanadates (especially magnesium vanadate), molybdates, and nickel-based oxides.
The authors review the main results obtained with each system, some of them also
discussed below. Magnesium vanadate, pure and promoted, was also used in 1997
at the Mobil research center in the United States (62).

B.
Supported Catalysts
Supported catalytic systems were also used in butane ODH, with either silica
or alumina as supports, usually containing Ni, V, or both metals (see Table 1).
Materials as monolithic ceramic supports (impregnated with noble metals),
operating with millisecond contact times (63,64), are also used. Another potential
catalyst is chromium oxide supported on a lanthanide carbonate (21).
In these systems, besides the nature of the deposited material, the support-
active phase interaction also strongly affects the catalytic results, with the acid–
base character of the support being one of the most important factors.
Another system that has recently aroused interest concerns magnesia (6) or
magnesia–alumina (7) supported magnesium molybdates. Anaerobic butane
oxidation was carried out over these promising catalysts (using active oxygen
available in the solid with subsequent reoxidation in a ﬂuidized bed). High
selectivities to dehydrogenation products were obtained, particularly for
butadiene. This process was used by the Dow Chemical Company with a
Cs2O-doped MgMoO4 catalyst supported over MgAl2O4, the continuous reaction
and catalyst regeneration requiring the use of mobile or ﬂuidized catalytic beds
(19).
More recent is the use of membrane reactors (with an inert ceramic
membrane for controlled oxygen distribution to the bed containing V}Mg}O
catalysts) for butane ODH (65,66). In the majority of the conditions investigated,
these reactors are more efﬁcient than the traditional ﬁxed bed reactors (FBRs).
Indeed, when using inert membrane reactors (IMRs) with different feeds higher

selectivities at high butane conversions were achieved (65). Moreover, the IMRs
proved to be more stable and safer, and allow the use of a wider range of feed
compositions (65,66).
The unexpected activity observed with carbonaceous materials is
noteworthy. It was observed that after forcing coke deposition on a nickel
molybdate catalyst, deactivation was not found during n-butane ODH. On the
contrary, conversion increased (more than 40%), as well as selectivity to
dehydrogenation products, and particularly to butadiene. If activities are compared
on a surface area basis, the effects are much more pronounced (Fig. 1) (40). Such
surprising results led the authors to test some coals as catalysts that exhibited
interesting catalytic activity for n-butane ODH (67).
C.
Promoters
Several kinds of promoters have been used for improving catalytic
performances in n-butane ODH.
Potassium and cesium have been the most widely used promoters for this
reaction: K in Ni/Sn/P/O catalysts—as disclosed in the US patent by Kimble
(51)—and Cs in V2O5 (53) and MgMoO4 (19) materials. The use of Cr2O3 and
TiO2 for doping V}Mg}O catalysts deserves special mention (68).
Several alkali metals were tested (Li, Na, K, and Cs) over nickel molybdate
catalysts (38). The best performances were obtained with Cs doping (38,39,42).
Alkaline-earth promoters were also used, the promoted NiMoO4 catalyst
appearing very promising for butadiene production (43).

REACTION PRODUCTS—CATALYTIC ACTIVITY
AND SELECTIVITIES
Due to the larger number of secondary carbon atoms, butane is more reactive
withgaseousoxygenthansmalleralkanes,andthereforelowerreactiontemperatures
are needed. Besides the corresponding alkenes (1-butene and 2-butenes),
butadiene—a relatively stable product—is also obtained, frequently representing a
considerable fraction of the dehydrogenation products (C4s). Regarding the
formation of secondary products, both carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and oxygen-
containing organic products (acids, ketones or aldehydes) must be considered.
All the reactions involved are exothermic or even strongly exothermic. For
instance, the heats of reaction for formation of C4s from n-butane range between
27.7 (for 1-butene) and 58.7 kcal/molbutane (for butadiene) (at 258C), while for CO2
and CO formation it corresponds to 635.4 and 364.8 kcal/molbutane, respectively
(69). Due to the complexity of the mechanism involved, the isomerization reactions
of butenes as well as their consecutive conversion to butadiene or complete
oxidation also must be taken into account. However, all these reactions are also
exothermic (69), thus contributing to the difﬁculties of temperature control.
Besides economic considerations, the great interest in obtaining high
selectivities is related to both the danger of formation of hot-spots (since formation
of carbon oxides involves highly exothermic reactions) and environmental
problems (because some of the organic byproducts are hazardous, even when
present in small amounts). Modifying the catalyst with a suitable additive and/or
adding to the reaction mixture water vapor or another substance capable of
blocking the catalyst sites that weakly adsorb oxygen, can increase selectivity
towards dehydrogenation (2).
Among the above-mentioned systems, the patented results by the Philips
Petroleum Company with Ni/Sn/P/O/K catalysts deserve special emphasis. They
achievedayieldtobutenesandbutadieneofaround30%,forann-butaneconversion
level (x ) of 38%, at 5668C and with NH3 co-feed to the reactor (51). Another
patented catalytic system was Ni}P}O, where C4 selectivity reached 63.9% for
x ¼ 48:5% (50). Promising values were also obtained with the Ni}V}Sb}O/
Al2O3 system (56), with x close to 40% and with a product distribution where
selectivities to butadiene and butenes were 42.0 and 30.5%, respectively. In the US
patent no. 4,777,319 of Kung and Chaar, C4 yields higher than 20% were obtained
with several metal vanadate catalysts (58). With V}Mg}O catalysts the highest
C4 yields did not usually exceed 20%, with typical selectivities of 80% at low
conversions (20). When conversion reaches 40%, selectivity decreases to around
50% (1,20,27). However, when using a V}Mg}O catalyst with both Cr2O3 and
TiO2 as promoters, a butadiene yield of 35.5 mol% was achieved (68).
Even in the best-tested catalysts, yields for total dehydrogenation products
are limited due to the very high reactivity of alkenes (16,27). Much effort has been
spent to functionalize alkanes selectively, which is a hard task due to their low
reactivity attributable, e.g., to the absence of empty orbitals and to the low polarity
CATALYTIC ODH OF n-BUTANE
255
Downloaded by [Fondren Library, Rice University ] at 02:27 19 October 2012 
of the C}H bonds (4). Low reactivity usually requires severe conditions, thus
decreasing selectivity for the desired products. When decreasing the butane
conversion level the selectivity for ODH is increased because the formation
of degradation products from alkenes is a major pathway in reactions with butane
(70). Indeed, the C}H bonds are stronger for reactants than for inter-
mediary products (e.g., ðC}HÞbutane ¼ 390:8 kJ=mol; whereas ðC}HÞbutene ¼
345:2 kJ=mol; leading to faster oxidation of these intermediaries (71).
Since the factors which determine the upper limits of selectivity that can be
attained in a given catalytic-oxidation reaction are not yet adequately deﬁned,
particularly for ODH of alkanes, Batiot and Hodnett decided to investigate
whether there is any relationship between the structure of reactants and products of
selective oxidation and the ability of a conventional oxide catalyst to achieve a
particular transformation (71). An interesting and quite clear correlation was
observed between limit selectivities (at ﬁxed conversion) and the function:
D8HC}HðreactantÞ 2 D8HC}H or C}CðproductÞ;
where D8H is the dissociation enthalpy of the weaker C}H (or C}C) bond in the
reactant or in the selective oxidation product. The authors showed that if the
difference is smaller than 30 kJ/mol, high selectivities are achievable at any
conversion levels, whereas for differences larger than 70 kJ/mol low selectivities
are always obtained. In butane ODH an intermediate situation is found due to a
45.6 kJ/mol difference, and thus selectivities range between 0 and 100%. In this
case, and with the data found in the literature for different catalytic systems
operating under different conditions, the selectivity vs. conversion picture shows a
highest selectivity limit at 50–60% for conversions higher than 20%. At lower
conversions, selectivity increases very quickly (Fig. 2).

FACTORS AFFECTING BOTH ACTIVITY
AND SELECTIVITY
One of the central problems in catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons is
selectivity control, in which kinetic and thermodynamic factors are involved (72).
By choosing an appropriate catalyst and suitable experimental conditions it is
possible to drive the reaction along a certain pathway, and to obtain the desired
product with the highest selectivity. Such aspects are crucial when scaling-up the
process because enormous advantages in both invested capital and operation costs
can be obtained (73,74). Some of the factors that signiﬁcantly affect the
performance of the catalyst for the reaction under consideration will be described
below.
A.
Catalyst Composition and Operating Conditions
One factor that is crucial to catalytic performance is obviously catalyst
composition, which is also a function of the preparation method. A clear example
is the V}Mg}O system, because different phases are obtained depending on the
vanadium content (1,27,30), the precursor used (1,75), or even the nature of the
support (30), and such phases exhibit different catalytic behaviors in ODH
reactions. It was found that the best catalysts in terms of both activity and
selectivity for n-butane ODH consisted of about 10–60 wt% V2O5 (1,27). Several
analyses showed that they contained only two identiﬁable phases—Mg
orthovanadate (Mg3(VO4)2) and MgO—and it was concluded that the Mg
orthovanadate was the active and selective phase (27). In other studies where
V}Mg}O catalysts were prepared by different methods it was found that both
Mg pyrovanadate (Mg2V2O7) and Mg metavanadate (MgV2O6) were nonselective
for butane ODH, producing large amounts of oxygen-containing products (75).
This behavior was correlated with the structure of the active sites: on Mg3(VO4)2
they correspond to isolated VO4 tetrahedra, which could limit the number of
oxygen ions available for each adsorbed hydrocarbon molecule, while for
Mg2V2O7 the active sites are V2O7 units that can be viewed as pairs of corner-
sharing VO4 tetrahedra (1,75). Another example is when vanadium oxide is
supported over SiO2, since no crystalline V2O5 is formed at low vanadium
contents as opposed to high contents (76). This is important because it is widely
known that lower V2O5 loads will mean higher selectivities in ODH of alkanes
(1,27,76).
The results of several authors, who studied the inﬂuence of both chemical
and phase composition of the CoO}MoO3 system in n-butane ODH, are also
illustrative (25,26). By changing the Co/Mo atomic ratio quite different
selectivities were achieved, with a maximum for production of butenes and
butadiene with cobalt molybdate, particularly the high temperature form b-
CoMoO4. Thus, the component responsible for butadiene formation is the b phase.
Addition of a-CoMoO4 reduces the activity whereas free cobalt and molybdenum

oxides favor combustion reactions. This behavior was attributed to the presence of
tetrahedral coordinated Mo61 ions in b-CoMoO4, while octahedral coordination is
found in the low temperature a phase.
Similar results were also found for the Ni}Mo}O system (34,35,77),
which has several characteristics in common with the cobalt system. When
investigating butane to butadiene and maleic anhydride oxidation, Mazzocchia
et al. found that by changing the contact time, temperature, or butane/oxygen ratio,
signiﬁcantly different results were obtained in distribution of products (36). It was
also interesting that an excess of MoO3 was responsible for higher activity, despite
reducing selectivity to dehydrogenation products and driving the reaction towards
formation of carbon oxides.
Chaar et al. found with V}Mg}O catalysts that selectivity for butenes and
butadiene could be increased by decreasing the oxygen-to-butane ratio or the
temperature, although conversion is reduced (27). The same behavior occurs in
many other systems (19). This temperature inﬂuence has not been observed in all
cases, and sometimes the opposite effect was found (18,28,78). Corma et al. also
detected a selectivity increase for n-butane dehydrogenation products with
temperature (30). However, these authors did not record any relationship in
propane ODH. Recently, a similar dependence was found for selectivity to the
total of ODH products (and also to butadiene alone) with Mo-doped V}Mg}O
catalysts, indicating that the activation energy for oxydehydrogenation reactions is
higher than for the formation of carbon oxides (79).
B.
Catalyst Reducibility
When testing several orthovanadates Kung and coworkers found that the
higher the reduction potential, i.e., the more easily the cation reduces, the lower the
selectivityfordehydrogenationproducts(1,29,31,76).Sincelatticeoxygenremoval
is accompanied by reduction of the neighboring cation in the M}O}V structure,
the ease of oxygen removal should depend on the potential reduction of the cation.
Therefore, if lattice oxygen is the species reacting with the hydrocarbon surface
intermediate to form a C}O bond, high C4 selectivities are obtained if the M}O
bond is strong (because the formation of oxygen-containing products is hindered).
The strength of this bond can be assessed by measuring the reduction potential, the
heat involved in reoxidation of the reduced oxide (1,76), or the temperature of onset
of reduction in temperature programmed reduction (TPR) runs (29).
When using V2O5, Owens and Kung found that modiﬁcation with cesium,
although decreasing activity for butane ODH, increased selectivity for
dehydrogenation (53). Temperature programmed reduction proﬁles showed that
the temperature of onset of reduction was higher for Cs-doped catalysts, which
suggests that the promoter makes hydrogen activation more difﬁcult. They
proposed that the increase in selectivity for the Cs-doped samples was due to the
higher difﬁculty in performing redox cycles.

Temperature programmed reduction tests also give relevant information on
redox properties. This was clearly shown in a work by Patel et al. in which the
redox behavior of several orthovanadates was related to oxygen availability at the
active site, and consequently with catalytic behavior in butane ODH (31). Since an
active and selective catalyst is partially reduced in the stationary state, it is
probable that the role of some selective oxidation catalyst promoters is to change
reduction and reoxidation rates of the oxide, resulting in dissimilar stationary state
and thus in different catalytic behavior.
Some authors relate M}O bond strength with activity instead of with
selectivity. In fact, it is frequently observed that catalytic activity in oxidation
reactions decreases when the strength of the oxygen to surface bond increases
(15). Study of V2O5/MgO catalysts with different vanadium contents showed a
correlation between the low temperature peak area in the TPR proﬁle and catalytic
activity in propane and n-butane ODH (30). Later, Blasco et al. proposed a parallel
between reducibility of surface V51 species and the catalytic activity of several
supported vanadium catalysts in n-butane ODH because the reaction probably
involves redox sites (28). More recently, Dejoz et al. found that the incorporation
of molybdenum in V}Mg}O catalysts decreases both the amount and the
reducibility of the vanadium species (79). Accordingly, the lower activity of Mo-
promoted catalysts can be explained on the basis of the number and the lower
reducibility of their V51-sites.
Similar trends were also found when using cesium-doped nickel molybdates
for catalyzing n-butane ODH (46). When increasing the Cs load (from 0 to 6%—
surface atomic ratio Cs/Mo), the TPR data showed a simultaneous decrease in the
reducibility of the catalysts, evidenced by an increase in the temperature of onset
of reduction. A similar relationship was found in the results of catalytic runs,
unpromoted a-NiMoO4 being much more active for butane conversion than Cs-
doped catalysts (Table 2). This parallel between catalytic activity and reducibility
of the catalyst is evidence of the occurrence of a Mars}van Krevelen mechanism
(44,45).

Oxygen Reactivity and Availability
The idea that reactivity of oxygen at the active site determines the catalyst’s
properties was already established in 1963 by Callahan and Grasselli (80). This
concept was subsequently extended to the V}P}O and V}Mg}O systems in
order to illustrate, with several examples, the importance of: (i) the number of
available oxygen atoms at the active site; (ii) the sizes of the site and surface
intermediate (and respective interactions); and (iii) the reactivity of oxygen
(1,76). Results obtained in propane and butane ODH proved that the interaction
between a surface intermediate and the catalyst is speciﬁc to the molecule and
solid nature (29). In propane and butane oxidation, the way the molecule
interacts with the surface determines how the solid structure affects the catalytic
results.
The above-listed factors, i.e., (i)–(iii), may themselves depend on other
catalyst and surface species properties. For instance, oxygen reactivity may
depend on the metal–oxygen bond strength, as mentioned above, and the number
of available lattice-oxygen atoms for reaction at the active site depends not only on
the atomic arrangement of the site but also on oxygen diffusivity through the
lattice compared with the surface reaction rate (1). Another example, which
further illustrates the dependence of oxygen reactivity on other factors, is provided
by the study of Armendariz et al. for n-butane ODH (59). After promoting iron–
zinc oxides with chromium (i.e., ZnCrxFe22xO4), they found that for x ¼ 0:5–0:6
the electron density of oxygen in Fe}O bonds was enhanced. The maximum
butadiene selectivity for x ¼ 0:5–0:6 enabled them to suggest that chromium
doping increases both butadiene and CO2 selectivities due to enhancement of the
lattice oxygen basicity, which promotes acid–base type dissociation of the C}H
bond during butene activation (59). For supported vanadia catalysts, the critical
oxygen required for a C4 hydrocarbon oxidation reaction (e.g., n-butane oxidation)
is associated with the bridging V}O-support bond and the characteristics of such
a bond can be altered by, for instance, varying the speciﬁc oxide support or oxide
support ligands (81).
D.
Nature of the Oxygen Species Involved
Different adsorbed-oxygen species are formed through a series of equilibria
established with gas phase oxygen:
O2ðgasÞ$O2ðadsÞ$O2
2 ðadsÞ$O22
2 ðadsÞ$2O2ðadsÞ$2O22ðlatticeÞ
ð3Þ
Species are gradually enriched in electrons by interaction with the surface until
the O22 state (lattice oxygen) is achieved. In process (3), the characteristics of
the oxygen species vary from electrophilic ðO2
2 Þ to nucleophilic (O22). In a
partially reduced surface, adsorbed oxygen may induce reoxidation of the cations to
different levels, depending on the extent of charge transfer between the reduced site
MADEIRA AND PORTELA
260

and adsorbed oxygen. If charge transfer is such that an adsorbed-oxygen atom
acquires the same electronic density as surface lattice oxygen ions, the surface is
reoxidized and adsorbed oxygen turns into lattice O22. If charge transfer is not so
extensive and/or the oxygen species occupies a different site, it simply becomes an
adsorbed-oxygen species, atomic or molecular. In general atomic-oxygen species
are more strongly adsorbed than molecular ones, which affects their reactivities
(20).
Bielanski and Haber suggested that selectivity is determined not only by the
place of attack by reactive oxygen to the surface intermediate, but also by the
oxygen’s electron density (74,82). Adsorbed oxygen can be classiﬁed into two
types, electrophilic or nucleophilic, with different reactivities. Electrophilic
oxygen includes species such as O2 (oxide), O2
2
(superoxide), and O22
2
(peroxide), which would be responsible for deep oxidation. These species are
electron deﬁcient and attack the electron-rich regions of hydrocarbon molecules
(for instance CvC double bonds), leading to the rupture of the carbon skeleton
and eventually to the formation of degradation products. Nucleophilic oxygen
corresponds to the O22 ion, also identiﬁed as lattice oxygen, and it is believed to
be involved in partial oxidation. Due to the high electron density of these species,
they react with electron-poor molecule sites.
There is some experimental evidence for such a theory. For example, the idea
that nucleophilic oxygen species are able to perform selective oxidations is
supported by the ﬁndings of constant activity and selectivity even after cutting
gas-phase oxygen feed (3). By contrast, oxides that tend to adsorb ionic-oxygen
species produce essentially carbon oxides (83). Bielanski and Haber’s theory is
generally accepted. Nevertheless, there are several different opinions for many
systems, as described by Oyama (72) and Kung (20). There is, therefore, a need for
a conclusive spectroscopic and kinetic characterization of the existing species in
reaction conditions. The measurement of surface potential could help to clarify the
matter.
E.
Electrical Conductivity of the Catalyst
Another important property is the electrical conductivity of the solid, since
differences in catalytic behavior can be explained on the basis of oxygen
adsorption mechanisms. For p-type semiconductors, electrons transferred from
metallic ions facilitate the formation of adsorbed O2 species. In this way, the
surface tends to saturate with adsorbed oxygen. Such a mechanism is not possible
with n-type semiconductors. In the ﬁrst case oxidation involves adsorbed O2
species, while the oxidation mechanism catalyzed by n-type semiconductors
involves O22 ions from the solid lattice. Since adsorbed O2 species have greater
mobility than O22 ions in the solid matrix, p-type semiconductors are more active
than n-type ones (15).
The importance of knowing electrical properties is evidenced in work
published by Herrmann et al. (84) in which the authors measured, in situ, the
CATALYTIC ODH OF n-BUTANE
261
Downloaded by [Fondren Library, Rice University ] at 02:27 19 October 2012 
electrical conductivity of vanadyl pyrophosphates and of V}P}O catalysts
under different gaseous atmospheres (containing butane and/or oxygen). The
results allowed them to conclude that a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism exists in
butane to maleic anhydride oxidation. p-Type conductivity (with p1 positive holes
as the main charge carriers) was correlated with the V41/V51 redox pair and with
the existence of O2 species responsible for the initial butane activation with
hydrogen abstraction. A reaction mechanism was also proposed on the basis of
these results. Finally, they also found that the highest maleic anhydride selectivity
was obtained with the solid presenting the highest electrical conductivity and,
probably, the highest structural disorder (84).
An interesting relationship between selectivity and electrical conductivity
was also found in nickel molybdate used for n-butane ODH (42). After doping
nickel molybdate catalysts with different cesium loads in the range 0–6% (surface
atomic ratio Cs/Mo), an increase in selectivity to C4s was detected for Cs loads up
to 3% Cs. For the 6% Cs}NiMoO4 catalyst a decrease was noticed. Curiously, a
similar trend was also found for the electrical conductivity of the solids. a-
NiMoO4 is an n-type semiconductor and promotion with cesium signiﬁcantly
increases the overall electrical conductivity of the solid due to the contribution of
additional surface ionic conductivity from mobile Cs1 ions. In fact, 1 or 3%
cesium-doped catalysts are about two orders of magnitude more conducting than
pure NiMoO4. However, for 6% Cs content an overdoping effect was found, i.e., a
direct relationship was found between selectivity for C4s and electrical
conductivity (as well as surface basicity) of the catalysts, with maxima for
surface Cs loads of 3% (Fig. 3).

Surface Basicity
Another factor that signiﬁcantly affects selectivity is surface basicity, since
when it is increased the desorption of alkenes (which are more basic than alkanes)
is promoted and their deeper oxidation to carbon oxides is decreased (27,85).
Butenes and butadiene molecules are considered as basic or nucleophilic due to
their high electron densities at p bonds. Therefore they are weakly adsorbed on
basic oxides, resulting in lower reactivity, and thus become signiﬁcant ﬁnal
products. Surface basicity also explains the absence of oxygenated products other
than carbon oxides in the reaction efﬂuent, as found with the V}Mg}O system
in propane (16) and butane (27,28) ODH. In fact, in this case maleic anhydride
formation was not detected, this product frequently being found in reactions over
vanadium-containing oxides.
Using vanadium-based catalysts with different supports in n-butane ODH,
Blasco et al. found that selectivity towards dehydrogenation products, as well as
distribution of C4-oleﬁns, can be related to the acid–base character of the catalysts
(28). Indeed, 1-butene and butadiene selectivities decrease when the strength and
number of Lewis acid sites are increased (determined by Fourier-transformed
infra-red (FTIR) of adsorbed pyridine), while 2-butenes and carbon oxides show
the opposite trend (28). In a subsequent paper, the high activity and low selectivity
in n-butane ODH at low surface coverages was explained by the high Bronsted
acid character of octahedral V(V) species (86).
Basicity of catalysts can be increased in several ways, one of which is by
using alkaline or alkaline-earth additives. The effects of such promoters depend on
the particular system, but usually they affect activity and selectivity in part due to a
decrease in surface area, with additional selectivity changes due to the nature of
the promoter ion. The nature of the unpromoted metallic oxide, the metal used as
promoter and the concentration of the corresponding ion may affect the behavior
of the ﬁnal catalyst (87,88).
Doping with alkali metals leads to enhancement of catalytic efﬁciency for
many heterogeneous catalysts, not being restricted to a particular type of reaction.
For instance, they can be used in ODH reactions. An example is the Li, K, and Rb
doping of V2O5/TiO2 and MoO3/TiO2, used by Grabowski et al. as catalysts in
propane ODH (89). Although propane conversion decreases in the doped catalysts
according to the sequence: undoped $ Li . K . Rb; propene yields and
selectivities (at equal propane conversion level) increase in the same order. The
authors proposed that alkali promoters decrease the acidity and increase the
basicity of the catalysts, facilitating propene desorption from the surface, and
preventing subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides. The decrease in activity may be
due to blocking of hydrocarbon activation sites, the extent of this effect increasing
with the ionic radius of the alkali cation (89). They also found that the reduction
rate with propene, as well as the reoxidation rate, decreases in the same sequence
as activity, suggesting that addition of alkali promoters decreases the number of
sites for propane activation (90).

Although the nature of the hydrocarbon activation sites is not yet deﬁned, the
possibility that adsorbed O2 species are active in hydrogen abstraction cannot be
excluded. Interesting are thus the results obtained by Grybowska et al. who, based
on surface potential measurements of V2O5/TiO2 and MoO3/TiO2, found that
potassium doping hinders the formation of electrophilic O2 species, only the
presence of O22 being observed (91). The absence of O2 species in potassium-
doped samples enabled them to explain the increase in propane ODH selectivity
(because electrophilic oxygen species are generally associated with total
oxidation) and the activity decrease attributed to suppression of total oxidation
towards carbon oxides (91).
Other examples of the use of these promoters are the K doping of Ni/Sn/P/O
catalysts—found in the US patent by Kimble (51)—and the Cs2O doping of
MgMoO4—a catalytic system patented by the Dow Chemical Company for butane
ODH in which oxygen and butane are fed to the reactor alternately (19).
An alkali promoter can also induce an increase in the activity or selectivity
of the catalyst, or even both. The effect of the promoter is usually associated with
an increase in the number of surface basic sites that participate in the process. As
mentioned by Mamedov (92), the efﬁciency of a catalyst often can be enhanced
signiﬁcantly by small amounts of additive. An excess of dopant usually causes a
drastic deterioration of the properties of the catalyst, the so-called overdoping
effect. An interesting example is found in the results published by Zazhigalov
et al. when doping the V}P}O system with several alkali (Li, Na, K, or Cs) or
alkali-earth (Be, Mg, Ca, or Ba) metals (93). The authors found that the
incorporation of those promoters (which can easily donate electrons to the
matrix) leads to an increase in the effective negative charge of the oxygen atoms
(i.e., of the surface basicity) and, consequently, of the butane oxidation rate.
However, maleic anhydride selectivity showed a maximum when represented vs.
the number of surface acid sites. That is, preparation of catalysts with high
activity and selectivity requires accurate control of the basicity of surface oxygen
atoms to accelerate butane activation (since this is the rate controlling step) and
of surface acidity in order to ensure the appropriate residence time of reaction
intermediates.
The explanations found in the literature for the effects of this kind of
promoter are diverse. For example, the enhancement of selectivity in butane ODH
is for some authors associated with an increase in the resistance to reduction
(27,53,94). It is also frequently observed that alkali ions decrease the vibration
frequency of the VvO bond, which presumably affects the interaction of these
species with butane, resulting in a change in the reaction activation energy (53).
With regard to selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, high selectivity is also
associated with the absence of oxygen species weakly either bound to the oxide
lattice or adsorbed on the surface in the form of electrophilic species like O2
2 or
O2 (82). However, little is known of the effect of alkali promoters on the nature
and properties of oxygen species in oxides. It should nevertheless be noted that due
to the polarizing effect of alkali promoters, the electron density around adjacent
MADEIRA AND PORTELA

oxide anions (basic sites) and metallic cations (Lewis acid sites) increases in
accordance with the sequence of decreasing promoter electronegativity (89).
Other authors suggest that the role of this kind of promoter may be the
poisoning of surface sites responsible for deep oxidation, leading to a reduction in
catalytic activity (95). The same explanation is also used to interpret the high
selectivities for butenes and butadiene when carrying out anaerobic butane
oxidation (6,7).
In general, doping with alkali metals has a positive effect on the performance
of many catalytic systems, and particularly on the ODH of light alkanes. This
motivated a detailed study on butane ODH with doped nickel molybdate catalysts.
In the ﬁrst work, the major effects of Li, Na, K, and Cs doping over both the low (a)
and the high (b) temperature phases of NiMoO4 were investigated (38). It was found
that these promotersusually decrease catalytic activity(correlated withthe decrease
in surface area when increasing the promoter load or its ionic radius), but at the same
time induce higher selectivity for C4s (which increases with the basicity of the
promoter). Thus, cesium-doped samples exhibited the highest selectivity (38), and
more detailed studies with 0, 1, 3, and 6% Cs (surface atomic ratio Cs/Mo) doped
NiMoO4 catalysts were performed later on (39,42). The basicity of the catalysts,
analyzed by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2, showed an
increase with Cs doping, but a curious overdoping effect was found for the 6%
Cs}NiMoO4. The same effect was found for the selectivity for dehydrogenation
products, showing a direct and almost linear relationship between surface basicity
and selectivity for C4s (see Fig. 3B) (39,42). The decrease of activity with Cs load
was attributed to both the decrease in the BET surface area and the enhancement of
surface basicity, because butane–surface interactions are also affected (39).
Alkaline-earth promoted nickel molybdates were also investigated (43).
Again, when using Ca-, Sr-, or Ba-doped a-NiMoO4 catalysts the rate of butane
conversion decreases, due to the decrease in surface area and the increase in
surface basicity. In addition, the dependence of selectivity on surface basicity was
found once again, as well as an overdoping effect for the barium-doped catalysts.
Moreover, alkaline-earth promoted NiMoO4 appeared to be very promising
catalysts for butadiene formation, being almost twice as selective to butadiene as
its undoped counterpart, for the same conversion level. When compared to the
alkali-doped solids, the alkaline earths present lower basicity. This favors further
interaction of reaction intermediates with the catalyst, allowing subsequent
dehydrogenation and thus increasing butadiene formation (43).
G.
Others
The catalytic properties of oxides also depend on the structure of the surface,
changing for instance with the exposed crystal faces, as explained by Haber
(73,74). For transition metal oxides, with pronounced crystallographic
anisotropies, it can be expected that the properties of the active sites are related
CATALYTIC ODH OF n-BUTANE
265
Downloaded by [Fondren Library, Rice University ] at 02:27 19 October 2012 
to the structural differences of the surface crystal faces, leading to structure
sensitivity in oxidation reactions. One of the most spectacular examples is
provided by the behavior of two copper molybdates in 1-butene oxidation (73).
Several other examples are found in the literature, such as oxidations of propylene
to acrolein with MoO3 or butane to maleic anhydride with (VO)2P2O7 (72). A
detailed review on structure–reactivity relationships in oxidation of C4
hydrocarbons on supported vanadia catalysts was recently published by Guliants
(81).
Callahan and Grasselli (80) established the concept of optimal density of
sites as a way to control selectivity in selective oxidation reactions. That is, the
active site should not contain too few or too many active oxygen ions that can
participate in the reaction. Too many sites favor over oxidation, the opposite
situation leading to an inactive catalyst.
The stereo-chemical factors imposed by the substrate may also affect
catalytic behavior because the right site-substrate interactions may need a
particular orientation of the hydrocarbon for activation of the C}H bond. While
analyzing the state of the art regarding ODH of lower alkanes on vanadium oxide-
based catalysts, Mamedov and Corbera
´n (2) found that in contrast to linear
alkanes, no correlation between total conversion and the number of carbon atoms
in the molecule has been observed for the branched hydrocarbons. Moreover,
conversions over (VO)2P2O7 tended to decrease with increasing substitution at
carbon, being minimal for 2,2-dimethylpropane and 2,2-dimethylbutane. Thus, the
steric factors imposed by the substrate appear to affect the overall oxidation
mechanism. Another interesting example, which further illustrates these factors, is
provided by Kung and co-workers (76). They have suggested that in the
dehydrogenation of propane over vanadium-containing catalysts, the bound C3
species (in which the distance between end C atoms is 0.327 nm) can readily bond
with the two V ions in the active site of (VO)2P2O7 (separation 0.319 nm) but can
only do so with difﬁculty with those in Mg2V2O7 (separation 0.339 nm). Thus,
oxidation occurs on the ﬁrst catalyst while dehydrogenation occurs on Mg2V2O7
(76). It can be concluded that the formation of oxygen-containing products is
enhanced if the hydrocarbon intermediate in the selectivity-determining step can
be bonded to the two vanadium ions so that the hydrocarbon species is held close
to the reactive surface lattice oxygen.
Apart from the above aspects, other factors that affect selectivity may also be
mentioned, as pointed out by Oyama (72). These include the oxidation state of the
surface, the mode of adsorbate bonding, the surface structure and the existence of
defects. However, due to the complexity of the oxidation process, opinions differ
in the numerous examples provided. The manner in which hydrocarbon
intermediates (R) are bound to surface metallic sites on oxides seems to
determine selectivity in partial oxidation reactions. When the bonding is through
oxygen atoms (M}O}R), selective oxidation products are favored; when the
hydrocarbon binds directly to the metal (M}R), total oxidation prevails.
Thermodynamic calculations point out that M}R intermediates are more stable
MADEIRA AND PORTELA
266
Downloaded by [Fondren Library, Rice University ] at 02:27 19 October 2012 
than M}O}R intermediates. The longer surface residence time of the M}R
complexes, coupled to lack of fast selective reaction pathways, favors irreversible
oxidation to COx (72,83). Haber also points to the existence of defects in the
catalyst structure as a selectivity determining factor, since they are intimately
related to the different adsorbed-oxygen species on the catalyst surface
(equilibrium 3) (74).
A brief reference should be made to some other aspects that, according to
Kung, also affect the catalytic behavior (20): the existence of vacancies, the ability
of a catalyst to form certain structures that facilitate oxidation–reduction cycles
without the need for signiﬁcant structural changes, and the presence of MvO
bonds. Indeed, in the Mg}V}O system the absence of oxygenated products in
n-butane ODH was attributed to the absence of V51vO bonds (19). In their US
patent, Kung and Chaar (58) found that the metal-vanadate catalysts used are free
of VvO groups. Moreover, they also believe that these catalysts adsorb short-
chain unsaturated hydrocarbons very weakly. Therefore, the resulting surface
residence time of the unsaturated hydrocarbons on the catalyst probably reduces
the chance for further oxidation to oxygenated by-products (aldehydes or acids)
(58). With V}P}O catalysts, these sites were considered to be responsible for
consecutive oxidation of butenes and butadiene intermediates to maleic anhydride.
Finally, the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms is also a selectivity determining
factor (85), because lower mobility can prevent overoxidation of the products,
increasing their stability.
V.
NATURE OF ACTIVE AND SELECTIVE SITES
The nature of the active sites in ODH of alkanes has been studied widely for
vanadium-containing systems. It is usually thought that these species correspond
to tetrahedral vanadium, but opinions concerning the detailed structure of the sites
differ. The various opinions were reviewed in 1995 by Mamedov and Corbera
´n
(2). More recently, Guliants discusses in detail several fundamental issues about
C4 hydrocarbon oxidation on supported vanadia catalysts, particularly the
structure–reactivity relationships for this system (81).
Regarding vanadium oxide catalysts, Dejoz et al. (78) proposed two different
active sites for vanadia supported catalysts: (i) tetrahedral V51-species, active and
selective in n-butane conversion to C4-oleﬁns through a redox mechanism which is
initiated by hydrogen abstraction; (ii) vanadium-free Mg21- and/or Al31-sites of
the support, active in the deep oxidation of butane and butenes through a radical
mechanism (78). The role of molybdenum in Mo-doped V}Mg}O catalysts was
discussed more recently (79). While VO4 tetrahedra would be the selective sites for
n-butane ODH, the presence of molybdenum ions would decrease the number of
non-selective sites on the catalyst surface, related to vanadium-free magnesia, thus
increasing overall selectivity. However, on catalysts with high Mo-contents the
observed Lewis acid sites, related to the presence of amorphous polymolybdates,

could negatively affect selectivity (79). For g-Al2O3 supported vanadium oxide
catalysts, Blasco et al. found that although catalysts with octahedral V51 species
(i.e., VO6 octahedra) exhibit higher activities, higher selectivities were achieved on
catalysts with mainly tetrahedral V51 species (i.e., VO4 tetrahedra) (86). Owens
and Kung (54) studied n-butane ODH on silica-supported vanadia catalysts. They
observed that the isolated vanadia species present at low surface coverage were
responsible for the high total dehydrogenation selectivity, while the presence of the
crystalline V2O5 species at high surface coverage contributed to the formation of
total oxidation products (54).
For vanadium–magnesium oxide catalysts, although electron paramagnetic
studies have led to the conclusion that VO21 is the active species involved in the
formation of butadiene from n-butane via ODH (68), the review by Albonetti et al.
(85) clearly states that the exact identity of the active phase is still under debate. It
seems clear, however, that the presence of just one phase is not enough to explain
the catalytic performance of V/Mg/O catalysts. The Mg3(VO4)2 phase, spread over
MgO, is considered to be the most active and selective composition in n-butane
ODH, due to the presence of isolated VO4 units. The presence of excess MgO
increases catalytic activity due to a synergetic effect between MgO and Mg
orthovanadate (85).
Armendariz et al. used iron–zinc oxides as catalysts for n-butane ODH and
found, by using several characterization techniques, that the presence of a zinc
ferrite (ZnFe2O4) phase with a spinal structure gives high selectivity to butenes
(60). The presence of other phases changes product selectivity. For instance,
Fe2O3 promotes CO2 formation while ZnO favors selectivity towards butadiene.
Most of the studies found in the literature about active and/or selective sites
relate to butane oxidation (to maleic anhydride) or to propane ODH. However,
they serve as a valuable reference for our purpose and some will be mentioned.
For the V}P}O system, and due to the complexity of such catalysts, a
certain contradiction is found in the literature about the nature of the active phase
and in the identiﬁcation of the active sites for butane to maleic anhydride
conversion (96). It is generally accepted that the active component in oxidation of
alkanes is (VO)2P2O7, but VOPO4 is also frequently present. In fact, in a very
recent study devoted to butane ODH it was concluded that the theories that relate
selectivity in n-butane partial oxidation to the (100) face of the (VO)2P2O7 catalyst
are not sound (97). Rodemerck et al. showed that all the oxidation steps during
butane to maleic anhydride conversion can occur at both V51 and V41 sites, but a
contribution by the redox V41/V31 pair cannot be excluded (98).
With regard to molybdenum-containing catalysts, Abello et al. (99)
suggested the involvement of Mo51 species (in MgMoO4}MoO3 catalysts) as
active sites in propane ODH. Both in this system and in CoMoO4}MoO3
catalysts, other authors found that catalyst performance increases in parallel with
the increase of surface weak acid sites, suggesting that these sites are involved in
propane activation (100). An excess of octahedral molybdenum, partially covering
the surface, seems to be responsible for the weak acid sites. In addition, pulsed-

feed experiments have provided evidence that a slightly reduced surface favors
propane partial oxidation, whereas a completely oxidized surface seems to lead
more easily to consecutive oxidation of the primary product—propylene—to
carbon oxides (100). Khan and Somorjai (101) proposed that the active sites in
molybdenum-based catalysts are coupled pairs of MoV and MoVI species, leading
to a redox mechanism. More recently, the importance of the MoV/MoVI redox pair
in propane ODH over molybdenum phosphates was also pointed out (102).
Finally, while investigating butane to butadiene and maleic anhydride
oxidation using Ni}Mo}O catalysts, Mazzocchia et al. found practically the
same yield of butenes when increasing the number of butane pulses, suggesting
that butane dehydrogenation occurs without the intervention of lattice oxygen
(36). Moreover, maleic anhydride formation is related to gaseous oxygen
activation over sites that disappear by deep reduction and that cannot be
regenerated by reoxidation. Such sites probably correspond to Mo (V) sites.
VI.
KINETICS AND MECHANISM
A.
Kinetic Studies
In selective oxidation reactions, detailed and conclusive kinetic studies are
scarce. The kinetic expressions are most usually of the power law type and are
applicable within a limited experimental range (3).
A kinetic study with the Ni}V}Sb}O/Al2O3 system provided the
following rate equation for the butane conversion rate to butenes and butadiene by
ODH:
ri ¼ kiPbutaneP0:5
O2
ð4Þ
(where Pi are the partial pressures of reactants), and the rate equation:
rj ¼ kjPbutanePO2
ð5Þ
for total oxidation to carbon oxides (56). Thus, oxygen concentration in the gas
phase is a parameter affecting selectivity because intrinsic reaction rates present
different dependencies on this factor.
Using several cesium-doped vanadium oxide catalysts (supported over silica
or not), Owen and Kung again found a ﬁrst order dependence on butane and a 0.5
dependence on oxygen (53). Since Cs usually decreases the catalyst’s reducibility,
these results suggested that Cs affected both catalyst reduction and reoxidation
rates to the same extent, following small changes in the global kinetics. In
addition, it should be mentioned that cesium increased the reaction activation
energy, thus decreasing activity, only in the low vanadium content supported
samples (53). A preliminary kinetic study over vanadium and magnesium oxides,
performed by Chaar et al., provided 0.85 (^ 0.15) and zero orders for butane and
oxygen, respectively (16).

A systematic and detailed kinetic study of the selective oxidation (formation
of 1-butene, 2-trans-butene, 2-cis-butene, and butadiene) and degradation
(formation of CO and CO2) of n-butane over unsupported pure and cesium-
doped nickel molybdates was reported, covering a wide range of experimental
conditions (46). The rate data were ﬁtted to power-law rate equations:

by non-linear regression analysis, optimizing a multiple correlation coefﬁcient c
(103,104). The computed reaction orders are shown in Table 3. They give
evidence that Cs doping only affects the partial order with respect to butane, which
increases for dehydrogenation products and decreases for CO and CO2. The partial
order with respect to oxygen is almost unaffected, showing in both cases zero
order dependence for formation of C4s.
It is now well established that many oxidation catalysts react with a
hydrocarbon using lattice oxygen, thus getting reduced. The reduced metallic
oxide then reacts with molecular oxygen from the gas phase to complete the
catalytic cycle. This redox mechanism of metallic oxides was ﬁrstly described in
the literature by Mars–van Krevelen (105). Taking, as usual, the rate of the

Other systematic kinetic and mechanistic studies on butane ODH are
relatively few, but many are found concerning catalytic oxidation of butane to
maleic anhydride, particularly with the V}P}O system (19,96,107–111). This
reaction is of interest due to the formation of butenes and butadiene as reaction
intermediates.
In the work by Escardino et al. (107), it is shown that the equation proposed
by Mars–van Krevelen (105) explains the macroscopic behavior of the
V2O5}P2O5 system over the entire range of butane partial pressures tested and

r ¼

which is formally equivalent to Eq. (9), deduced from the Mars–van Krevelen or
redox model.
Later on, Pepera et al. studied butane oxidation and b-(VO)2P2O7
reoxidation in separate steps using a micro-reactor (109). They found that the
rate of catalyst reduction was ﬁrst order in butane and that the reoxidation rate was
ﬁrst order in oxygen. These two reactions therefore occur in distinct steps, in a
similar way to that exhibited by catalysts that use lattice oxygen in oxidation
reactions. To summarize, the solid catalyses butane oxidation to maleic anhydride
through a redox type reaction on its surface which, from the kinetic point of view,
is consistent with the Mars–van Krevelen model.
The redox model was not always considered. For instance, in the recent
paper by Dejoz et al. the authors found that the initial rates of both C4s and carbon
oxides depend on the n-butane and oxygen partial pressures for vanadium oxide
supported on Al/Mg mixed oxide (78). A Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) model
was suggested, although with differences between ODH and deep oxidation
reactions. In the ﬁrst case the LH model assumes dissociative adsorption of
oxygen while in the second there is nondissociative adsorption (78).
B.
Reaction Mechanism
The involvement of lattice oxygen in the reaction was ﬁrst suggested a long
time ago. In 1968, Boutry et al. proposed a redox surface mechanism for butane
ODH involving lattice oxygen from the g phase of Co}Mo}O catalysts (112).
The results obtained by Andersen and Kung (with V2O5 supported over Al2O3)
showed that even in the absence of gas phase oxygen, butane could be converted to
the alkenes (113). Similar ﬁndings led Mamedov and Corbera
´n to hint at a redox
mechanism for the light alkanes ODH with V2O5-based catalysts (2), as occurs in
several other selective oxidation reactions (3).
In the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism the oxygen involved corresponds to
lattice oxygen. However, the nature of the species involved in the dehydrogenation
process must be clariﬁed. For vanadium-based oxides, the numerous published
results point to the participation of the most electrophilic species ðVvOÞ in the
formation of oxygenated products (2,27,82), since a correlation between the
carbon dioxide formation rate and the amount of VvO species was found in
butane oxidation. Bridged oxygen species (V}O}V or V}O}M) are involved
in the selectivity-determining step which corresponds to the reaction of alkyl
species (as shown below). Oxygen species between two vanadium ions that easily
reduce can easily establish C}O bonds, leading to formation of oxygen-
containing molecules (2). For V}O}M this depends on the M ion reducibility. In
MADEIRA AND PORTELA
272
Downloaded by [Fondren Library, Rice University ] at 02:27 19 October 2012 
fact, a selectivity increase for ODH was observed when the reducibility of the M
cation decreases (29,114).
According to Centi et al. (96,108), the mechanism of n-butane oxidation with
the V}P}O system can be interpreted as follows: (a) when no oxidation sites are
available, due to the high degree of surface reduction, i.e., when using high butane
concentrations and gaseous oxygen is totally consumed, oleﬁns are formed; (b)
when these sites are available, oleﬁns do not desorb and react very rapidly, leading
to formation of maleic anhydride or carbon oxides. The authors suggest that two
redox couples are involved: V(IV)–V(III) in synthesis of oleﬁns from n-butane,
and V(V)–V(IV) in maleic anhydride formation from the oleﬁns formed (108).
Quite recently, Te
´llez et al. (32) also found that when using a VMgO catalyst in
n-butane ODH a certain degree of catalyst reduction is desirable, because it limits
the amount of oxygen available at the surface, thus increasing selectivity to
dehydrogenation products. A redox mechanism was proposed.
In 1997, using (VO)2P2O7 catalysts, German researchers found that the redox
mechanism occurs in all the reaction steps, including furane to maleic anhydride
conversion, when carrying out butane, butadiene, and furane oxidation in transient
experiments in vacuum (using 18O2 as a source of oxygen) (110). Nevertheless,
CO2 formation is accounted for by a mechanism including both redox steps and
steps involving adsorbed-oxygen species (110). Very recently, with the same type
of catalysts, Sakakini et al. suggested that lattice oxygen is the selective oxidant in
partial oxidation of n-butane to butenes and butadiene and that its diffusion to the
surface is the rate-determining step (97).
The reported kinetic studies performed with nickel molybdate catalysts also
supported a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism for butane ODH. Evidence for such a
mechanism includes: (i) the zero-order dependence on PO2 for formation of C4s,
(ii) the relationship between catalytic activity and reducibility (inferred by the
temperature of reduction onset) of several Cs-doped catalysts (46), (iii) the
equivalent apparent activation energies for butane conversion with and without
gas phase oxygen (41), (iv) the fact that no oxygen adsorption was observed by
O2-TPD (44), and (v) catalytic tests without O2 in the feed, which showed that
butane can be converted to C4 products with high selectivity even without gas
phase oxygen (41).
Although there is as yet no clearly deﬁned and accepted reaction mechanism,
the general scheme proposed by Kung for the ODH of alkanes appears to be
frequently adopted (Sch. 1) (1,76). Scheme 1 shows that alkane oxidation, and
particularly for butane, may occur via three different pathways depending on the
reaction temperature. However, the ﬁrst stage is always C}H bond breakage and
thus corresponds to the controlling step. The three pathways are as follows:
1. At very high temperatures an alkane molecule reacts with the catalyst
forming an alkyl radical (as well as a superﬁcial OH group) that desorbs
from the surface to undergo reactions in the gas phase (homogeneous
reactions);
CATALYTIC ODH OF n-BUTANE
273
Downloaded by [Fondren Library, Rice University ] at 02:27 19 October 2012 
2. At lower temperatures, alkyl species remain adsorbed on the surface and
an alkene is produced by b elimination. This alkene molecule can
readsorb and react leading to degradation products;
3. Another alternative pathway for adsorbed alkyl species is the formation
of a surface alkoxide that can be further oxidized to aldehydes and
carboxilates, and possibly to carbon oxides.
Inasmuch as the formation of a C}O bond is probably irreversible, the
formation of oxygen-containing or dehydrogenation products depends on whether
or not surface alkyl species react to form such a bond. Thus, the reaction of alkyl
species can be considered as the selectivity-determining step and the facility for
removing a lattice oxygen to form a C}O bond must be a selectivity-determining
factor of the reaction. Nonetheless, reaction of the adsorbed alkene, formed from
the surface alkyl, can be considered also as a selectivity-determining step.
The existence of a complex reaction mechanism with parallel and
consecutive reactions is commonly accepted and mentioned in several papers.
The effect of contact time in the performance of various catalysts shows that at low
values dehydrogenation and combustion products are formed from alkane through
parallel reactions (2,31,115). When alkane conversion is increased, carbon dioxide
selectivity increases at the cost of alkenes, implying the existence of consecutive
reactions at higher contact times. Carbon monoxide selectivity also shows a
tendency to decrease at high contact times.
As mentioned above, several authors believe that the parallel reactions have
a common surface intermediate formed by alkane activation. Although some
authors suggest the existence of subsequent gas phase reactions, according to
Scheme 1.

Mamedov and Corbera
´n alkane conversion to either alkenes or carbon oxides
seems likely always to occur on the catalyst surface because the catalysts
employed usually contain reducible oxides and operate at relatively low
temperatures (typically ,5258C) (2). This idea is further supported by the linear
relationship usually found between alkane conversion and contact time,
suggesting the absence of contributions from homogeneous phase reactions.
Other authors working with vanadium and magnesium oxides also suggest
the parallel-consecutive mechanism (27,78). It should be noted that, according to
these authors, butadiene formation as a secondary product from desorbed and
readsorbed butenes is not the only way it is formed. In fact, the formation of
butadiene as a primary product is also signiﬁcant.
More recently, Blasco et al. proposed two different mechanisms for butane
ODH depending on the acid–base character of the supported vanadium catalyst
(28). They found that both distribution of C4-oleﬁns and selectivity to
dehydrogenation products depend strongly on the acid–base character of the
catalyst surface. Catalysts with a basic nature favor initial 1-butene formation and
its subsequent conversion to butadiene (Sch. 2a—which is identical to that
proposed with undoped or Cs-doped NiMoO4 catalysts (47)). By contrast, on
catalysts with an acid character, butenes and butadiene are initially formed (with a
high content of 2-butenes), but then carbon oxides are formed mainly by
consecutive reactions (Sch. 2b) (28).
The selectivity-determining steps can, according to these authors, be second
H abstraction and/or desorption of oleﬁnic intermediates (28). For acid catalysts,
the desorption rate of oleﬁnic intermediates must be lower than for basic ones, and
for such catalysts a distribution of C4s closer to the equilibrium (2-butenes/
1-butene molar ratio greater than 1) should be expected. For solids with a basic
nature, high selectivities for 1-butene are expected. The high selectivity for
1-butene obtained by Chaar et al. with V/MgO catalysts (basic character) is linked
to the high rate of the second hydrogen abstraction, yielding a 1-butene/
cis-2-butene/trans-2-butene molar ratio close to the statistical distribution (3/1/1)
instead of to the equilibrium ratio (1/1/1.1) (27). In addition, it should be noted that
isomerization of 1-butene to 2-butenes increases with the acid character of the
catalyst (28). Furthermore, oleﬁns are strongly adsorbed over acid solids, favoring
Scheme 2.

their oxidation to carbon oxides—which are the main products—while with basic
catalysts butadiene is the principal product of consecutive reactions (28).
Other authors (18,116) performed similar studies concerning the inﬂuence of
acidity/basicity in the mechanism of butane ODH. Harding et al. (18) found that by
increasing the molybdenum content in the MgO}V2O5}MoO3 system, the
2-butenes/1-butene ratio and the selectivity to cracking products were increased.
These results are due to the increase in acidity by addition of Mo to the matrix as
acidity favors both cracking and isomerization of butenes. Very recently, in a
paper by Lo
´pez Nieto et al. with vanadium-containing catalysts, the different
performance of acid/basic catalysts was attributed to the isomerization of oleﬁns
on acid sites, a reaction competing with the selective pathway (116).
As mentioned above, it is widely accepted that hydrocarbon activation is the
ﬁrst step in n-butane oxidation. Kung and coworkers published most of the studies
related to the activation process (1,16,70,75,76). The ﬁrst step in butane activation
seems to be the breakage of a secondary C}H bond (rate-controlling step), with
small contributions from primary C}H bonds. Pepera et al. (109) arrived at
similar conclusions in a study with deuterium in different positions along the
carbon chain (by using vanadium and phosphorous oxides instead of vanadium
and magnesium). According to Moro-oka and Ueda (4), the ﬁrst bond to be broken
is a methylene and not a methyl C}H bond because the former is weaker, in good
agreement with the fact that in similar conditions n-butane reacts 1.5 times faster
than propane.
The C}H bond breakage can be heterolytic, with abstraction of a hydride
ion by acidic sites and formation of a carbocation, or homolytic, with formation of
an alkyl radical (2,85). The presence of Mn1O22 acid–base pairs on the catalyst
surface can also promote a heterolytic dissociation producing a carbanion (2).
Due to the strength of the C}H bond, very high temperatures are needed for
activation of alkanes and at such temperatures dehydrogenation species react
quickly with oxygen to form combustion products. With a suitable catalyst this
limitation can in principle be overcome by supplying a controlled amount of
highly reactive oxygen (e.g., O2 or O2
2 Þ that can activate alkane at lower
temperatures at which dehydrogenation products do not react so quickly.
Decreasing the residence time on the catalyst surface can also reduce the reactivity
of these products (27).
Kung concluded that, for thermodynamic reasons, alkane activation would
occur through the homolytic breakage of the C}H bond by highly reactive surface
oxygen species (weakly adsorbed oxygen and/or localized lattice superﬁcial
defects) (117). Nonetheless, activated and weakly adsorbed-oxygen species are
strong electrophilic reactants and their presence is usually associated in the
literature with total oxidation. Pepera et al. concluded that vanadium (IV) species
present on surface of vanadile pyrophosphates are responsible either for chemical
adsorption of oxygen or for homolytic C}H bond breakage in butane activation
(109). Centi et al. suggest other sites for the V}P}O system (96). It therefore
seems urgent to carry out further fundamental research in this ﬁeld in order to
MADEIRA AND PORTELA

clarify what are in fact the active species involved in selective abstraction of
hydrogen from the parafﬁnic C}H bond.
VII.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE TRENDS
The extensive availability and low price of light alkanes are the main reasons
which have led to their use in the synthesis of the corresponding oleﬁns (1), used as
raw materials in several processes of considerable industrial importance (14,118).
In particular, the interest in converting n-butane is due to the importance of butenes
and butadiene in international markets. Butenes have been used in gasoline/fuel
and in maleic anhydride or butadiene synthesis (9,13,15), and butadiene essentially
in synthetic rubbers and plastics production (10). There are two possible ways for
converting the alkane: direct dehydrogenation and ODH. Thermal dehydrogena-
tion processes for oleﬁn production are highly endothermic and require complex
tube furnaces. In addition, excess steam (about 50% by volume) is necessary to
slow coke formation, and the efﬂuent contains other products in addition to the
desired oleﬁns. Catalytic dehydrogenation has several drawbacks. Thus, ODH is
very attractive mainly due to the absence of thermodynamic limitations
(concerning the equilibrium) and need for heat transfer, allowing operation at
much lower reaction temperatures (1,2). From the economic and engineering
process point of view, signiﬁcant advantages can be obtained.
The ODH reaction of n-butane is quite complex and the involvement of
several consecutive-parallel reactions for formation of dehydrogenation (C4s) and
total oxidation (COx) products is generally accepted (2,27,28). However, the
formation of other organic oxygen-containing products is also very common.
Consequently, the maximum yields obtained are still smaller than those achieved
in processes of dehydrogenation of parafﬁns. Nonetheless, a comparison between
the two processes should consider several aspects, all affecting the overall
economics. According to Cavani and Triﬁro
` (19), n-butane (and isobutane) ODH
will compete with dehydrogenation processes for synthesis of oleﬁns with high
purity when certain conditions are reached:
. the possibility of getting high alkane conversions and high yields of
oleﬁns at relatively low temperatures;
. absence of oxygenated products (organic acids, aldehydes) which may
make it necessary to use expensive anticorrosion materials;
. stable catalytic behavior over long periods.
An intense research effort has been directed to look for highly efﬁcient
catalysts. However, the complexity of the reactions, associated with the large
number of factors that determine their behavior, has seriously complicated the
task. Moreover, and despite the large number of studies found in the open
literature, some important aspects, such as the nature of the active sites, the
kinetics and mechanism of the reaction, the hydrocarbon activation process and
the factors that determine selectivity, are not sufﬁciently clear. It nevertheless

seems evident that the acid–base surface properties of mixed oxides are an
important selectivity-determining factor (27,28). This has led to the use of
promoters, especially alkali or alkaline-earth metals (19,89,93), for the purpose of
modifying the surface basicity in strong favor of C4 formation.
In order to reach the high performance levels that will be the key for
deﬁnitive industrial application, different technological approaches also should be
attempted. These include the use of new or recent technologies. For instance, the
use of circulating bed reactors (CBRs)—in which the catalyst is reoxidized by
oxygen in a regeneration zone after passing through the reaction stage where the
hydrocarbon is oxidized—is interesting and even promising. The use of this
conﬁguration arises from the fact that a higher oxygen partial order was found for
total oxidation. So higher C4 yields from butane would be achieved in the absence
of oxygen in the gas phase, i.e., in a redox mode using lattice oxygen with periodic
regeneration. This can be done in practice by using multiple reactors or mobile or
ﬂuidized bed catalytic reactors. One of the best illustrations of this is offered by the
design of some recent industrial reactors in which the circulating catalyst is
considered as an oxidant reactant that is reduced in situ in a butane stream and
reoxided later on in an external regenerator (119,120). Dupont’s circulating
ﬂuidized-bed technology is also promising and has been used for maleic anhydride
production (121). Recently, a ﬂuidized bed reactor was patented for oxidation and
oxydehydrogenation of hydrocarbons (122). Also quite recently, Soler et al. used a
two-zone ﬂuidized-bed reactor for ODH of butane with separate oxygen and
butane feeds (123). Feed separation allows the creation of separated oxidation and
reduction zones in the same reaction vessel, between which the catalyst is
recirculated, thus circumventing the problems associated with the transfer of
catalyst between reactor and regenerator. The two-zone reactor is useful to achieve
safer operation, because the formation of explosive mixtures is avoided, and
outperformed a conventional ﬂuidized-bed reactor in terms of the yield of the
desired products, especially butadiene, for which yield increased 200% (123).
Another extremely interesting technology, which has been studied
intensively and developed during the last decade, is that of membrane reactors.
A large part of the research on membrane reactors has focused on equilibrium shift
by selective removal of one particular product and was applied, for instance, in
dehydrogenation reactions (124). The other main ﬁeld for its application uses the
membrane to feed a reactant in a controlled way to the reaction zone, where
several reactions may occur. A typical example is the selective oxidation of
hydrocarbons. For butane ODH an inert ceramic membrane reactor with
V}Mg}O catalysts has been used, allowing ﬁne control of oxygen distribution
along the bed (65). A subsequent theoretical study, with simulation runs, explained
the differences observed experimentally in the conversion-selectivity behavior of
ﬁxed beds and IMRs (66). These reactors present several advantages over
conventional FBRs. In particular, higher selectivities are obtained (because
oxygen partial pressure can be maintained sufﬁciently low in the entire reactor).
The heat produced is also more evenly distributed along the bed, considerably

decreasing formation of hot-spots and therefore leading to more stable and safe
operation. Thus, the life of a catalyst charge can be increased too.
Another interesting reactor conﬁguration is illustrated in the recent US patent
by Mazanec et al. (125). In it, an electrochemical process is used for extracting
oxygen from an oxygen-containing gas by using a membrane module, which is
then transferred to another zone containing a gas that consumes oxygen, e.g., a
hydrocarbon.
It is possible that in the near future the combination of both factors, i.e., a
highly efﬁcient and economical reactor conﬁguration with a catalyst of excellent
performance level, will provide the key for deﬁnitive industrial implementation of
butane and other ODH processes as an alternative to conventional direct
dehydrogenation.
