ABSTRACT: Models of Cr(III)–silica were used to study C—H activation in ethane by oxidative addition as a
possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation. This mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and a
minimum energy crossing point (MECP) was located on the seam between the quartet spin potential energy surface of
Cr(III) and the doublet spin potential energy surface of Cr(V). Subsequent to the change of spin state, the C—H
activation path passes through a transition state on the doublet potential surface, leading to the formation of an
ethylhydridochromium(V) complex. This complex represents only a shallow minimum on the potential energy
surface and -hydrogen transfer to complete the catalytic cycle must therefore take place in the extension of the C—H
activation step. The combination of a signiﬁcant activation energy and a small pre-exponential factor in the rate
constant makes C—H activation by oxidative addition an unlikely mechanism for dehydrogenation in this system.

INTRODUCTION
A proven catalyst for the dehydrogenation of short alkanes,
Cr–oxide systems have been a topic of research since
1933.1 This effort has provided signiﬁcant insight through
a variety of experimental designs.2 The dominant view in
the modern literature is that chromium(III) is the oxidation
state showing the highest activity for dehydrogenation,
possibly with minor contributions from the þII state.3–8
In situ diffuse-reﬂectance UV–visible spectroscopy (DRS)
has been used to establish a semi-quantitative relationship
between the number of pseudo-octahedral Cr(III) sites on
mixed alumina–silica supports and dehydrogenation activ-
ity.3 Combined reactivity and characterization studies of
Cr–silica4,9 led DeRossi et al.4 to propose the catalytically
active chromium species to be bonded to the surface via
two oxygen bridges and with hydroxyl as the third ligand,
cf. Fig. 1.4 From its spectroscopic signature, this species
was dubbed CrIIIG.
Owing to the complexity of the catalyst surface, much
about the active site and the reaction mechanism is still
unknown. One crucial question concerns the mechanism
of C—H activation, for which the focus has been on
activation through direct interaction with chromium.10
The mechanistic information available is scarce. An
attractive strategy is therefore to consider, systematically,
the different C—H activation mechanisms known from
organometallic chemistry. The two most relevant ones are
oxidative and electrophilic
addition.11
Electrophilic
addition is also known as -bond metathesis,12 since
metal–ligand and C—H bonds are replaced by metal–
carbon and ligand–hydrogen bonds. Conversely, in
oxidative addition of ethane, carbon and hydrogen bind
directly to the metal as the C—H bond is broken. This
involves a formal oxidation of the metal and a change of
spin state. Owing to spin–orbit coupling, the reaction
may proceed on a single adiabatic potential energy
surface corresponding to the full electronic Hamiltonian.
A reaction scheme involving spin ﬂip in the course of the
reaction is known as ‘two-state reactivity’ (TSR).13 The
role of TSR in C—H activation and other transition
metal-catalysed reactions, has recently been reviewed.14
In general, -bond metathesis is favoured on light,
electron-deﬁcient metals, whereas oxidative addition is
favoured on the heavy and electron-rich late transition
metals.15–18 There are exceptions to this rule,12,19,20 and
although chromium is a ﬁrst-row transition metal, oxida-
tive addition cannot be ruled out a priori. For instance,
oxidative addition has been found feasible on O—
—Cr—
—O
and Cr—
—O.21 Furthermore, H2 activation by oxidative
addition has been reported for a Cr(III) complex with

three ligands covalently bonded through nitrogen.22 This
complex is similar in essence to the CrIIIG species
proposed as active in dehydrogenation by DeRossi et al.4
In a previous study, we explored C—H activation by
-
bond metathesis in the Cr–oxide system.23 Following
proposals in the literature,2,24 a mechanism was studied
that involves activation and reformation of a Cr—O bond
on chromium species that are stabilized by three oxygen
ligands. However, the computed activation energy exceeds
200 kJ mol1 and seems prohibitively high for catalytic
activity. Signiﬁcantly lower activation energy was found
for an alternative mechanism in which C—H activation
takes place at a reactive hydridochromium surface species.
The importance of the latter mechanism relies on the ability
of the chromium site to stabilize the hydride, which is
reactive with respect to formation of a Cr—O bond in the
vicinity of hydroxyl species. Alternative routes to C—H
activation should therefore be explored.
Here, we investigated whether C—H activation by
oxidative addition may represent a viable route to alkane
dehydrogenation. As in Ref. 23, we studied the Cr–silica
model catalyst, taking the CrIIIG structure in Fig. 1 as our
starting point and exploring the more general, conceptual
model of mononuclear Cr(III) complexes with three
covalent ligands coordinating through oxygen. The im-
portance of the choice of oxide carrier for the catalytic
dehydrogenation reaction is the subject of a forthcoming
publication [25].
COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
Models and methods
The surface models used in the current study are detailed
in Ref. 23. Cluster models were constructed either in an
ad hoc manner, drawing on chemical intuition and
experimental facts or systematically, starting from low-
index surfaces of silica crystals.
The ad hoc models include a generic model of the
CrIIIG species as proposed by DeRossi et al.4 The silica
surface is represented by a disiloxy ether moiety and the
model is denoted by gen-2bridge, cf. Fig. 2(A). To model
a site completely void of surface constraints yet having a
ﬁrst coordination sphere similar to that of the CrIIIG
species, the Cr(OH)3 molecule is used, Fig. 2(B).
Improved models taking into account larger parts of the
amorphous oxide carrier have been generated from
low-index surfaces of the high-T modiﬁcations of silica,
- and -cristobalite.23 On each surface, a cluster region
was deﬁned that includes chromium and its local chemi-
cal environment, with boundary bonds Ocluster–Sihost
severed and terminated by hydrogen atoms. In this
work, the models have been applied only as isolated
clusters, cf. the (100)-2bridge, (111)-3bridge and (101)-
3bridge models in Fig. 2(C), (D) and (E), respectively.
Mimicking the restoring forces of the extended struc-
tures, atoms at the cluster boundaries have their positions
ﬁxed to those of the parent slab model. In the two-bridge
models, this implies frozen position for all atoms but
those of the (—O)2CrOH moiety. In the three-bridge
models, the terminating Si(OH)n groups were held in
ﬁxed positions.
Quantum mechanical (QM) calculations were per-
formed using density functional theory as implemented
in the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) set of
programs.26–28 For electron correlation the LDA func-
tional of Vosko et al.29 augmented by the non-local 1986
corrections by Perdew30 were used. The exchange func-
tional consists of the Slater term augmented by gradient
corrections as speciﬁed by Becke.31 For details of basis
sets and geometry optimisation, see Ref. 23.
In general, energy differences refer to electronic de-
grees of freedom only, i.e. without zero-point vibrational
energies or temperature effects. In order to take into
account temperature and entropy effects, the full set of
thermodynamic functions were computed in the harmo-
nic and rigid-rotor approximation for simulations based
on the gen-2bridge surface model. The numerical inte-
gration schemes were used with the tightest accuracy
request available. All stationary structures display an
ultra-soft vibrational mode which consistently has been
omitted from the harmonic analysis.
Minimum energy crossing points (MECPs) between spin
potential energy surfaces were optimized using ADF, in

conjunction with the code developed by Harvey and co-
workers.32,33 A set of shell scripts and Fortran programs
were used to extract energies and gradients for the two spin
states and to combine these to produce an effective gradient
pointing toward the MECP and used to update the geome-
try. The convergence criteria are energy difference <0.1
mhartree and a gradient at the seam of crossing within the
normal ADF convergence criterion. Subsequent frequency
analysis used the effective Hessian32 along the hyperline of
equal energy of the two potential energy surfaces. The unix
scripts and Fortran programs were adapted to ADF in the
course of this work.
Accuracy
To compare the one- and two-state mechanisms of dehy-
drogenation, initiated by -bond metathesis and oxidative
addition, respectively, the accuracy of the applied density
functional method should be considered, in particular with
respect to the relative stability of the two spin states
involved in the oxidative addition. Relative energies com-
puted on a single potential surface are generally in agree-
ment with more sophisticated methods,34–37 whereas
prediction of relative energies on different potential sur-
faces is more problematic.38,39 Poli and Harvey38 reported
that ‘pure’ density functionals such as BP86 tend to
exaggerate the stability of low-spin forms, whereas hybrid
functionals such as B3LYP may overestimate the stability
of high-spin species. Accordingly, in a study of the Cr—
OH bond dissociation energy (BDE) in oxohydroxylchro-
mium complexes with oxidation states I–VI, the pure
BPW91 and hybrid B3LYP functionals reproduced the
general trend of more sophisticated methods, but over-
and underestimated, respectively, the BDE at higher oxida-
tion states.40 Moreover, BPW91 systematically but mod-
estly overestimated the stability of doublet states relative to
quartet states in the insertion reaction of ethene in
[H(NH3)CrIIIMe]þ.41 BP86 as applied here might therefore
be expected to underestimate the activation energy for
the two-state mechanism involving oxidative addition re-
lative to that of the one-state mechanism involving -bond
metathesis. An indication of this was obtained using the
Gaussian set of programs42 to compute the quartet/doublet
energy difference of the Cr(OH)3 model. In line with the
pattern described above, B3LYP puts the low-spin doublet
116 kJ mol1 above the high-spin quartet, while a differ-
ence of 75 kJ mol1 was obtained using BP86 in both ADF
and Gaussian. At any rate, differences <20 kJ mol1 in
relative energies computed for different reaction paths are
considered to be within the error bars of the method.
RESULTS
We start out by exploring C—H activation by oxidative
addition, followed by constructing a complete mechanism
of dehydrogenation. For convenience, each chromium
site is referred to by the ligands in the ﬁrst coordination
sphere of the metal. For instance, a general DeRossi-type
site may be denoted by (—O)2CrOH, where —O represents
a generic oxygen ligand singly bonded to chromium.
C—H activation
Ethane is found not to form any molecular complex with
chromium on DeRossi-type Cr(III) sites.23 This implies
that the initial encounter is reactive rather than physi-
sorptive. The reaction path of oxidative addition (OA) is
ﬁrst presented as computed for the gen-2bridge cluster
model [Fig. 2(A)]. In the unreacted cluster the coordina-
tion geometry of chromium is trigonal planar. The ground
state has quartet spin multiplicity, the doublet being
higher in energy by 75 kJ mol1. A schematic representa-
tion of the electronic energy proﬁle of C—H activation by
oxidative addition is presented in Fig. 3, together with
geometries of important stationary structures. As ethane
approaches chromium, one of the C—H bonds stretches
and the energy increases on both spin surfaces. The
gradient is larger on the quartet surface and the ﬁrst
step towards OA is thus crossing from the quartet to the
doublet potential energy surface at an MECP. The MECP

was located at an activated C—H bond length of
rCH ¼ 1.36 A
˚ and with the active hydrogen atom starting
to displace a bridging oxygen from the equatorial plane
toward an axial position in the trigonal bipyramidal
coordination geometry, cf. Fig. 3.
Frequency analysis at the MECP gives an imaginary
frequency in excess of 900i cm1 corresponding to the
reaction coordinate orthogonal to the seam of crossing.
After removal of this component, an imaginary frequency
of about 5i cm1 remains, probably due to numerical
noise. At the MECP, the spin density on chromium drops
from 2.8 in the quartet to 1.1 in the doublet state. The
electronic effects of spin change are localized to chro-
mium, leaving all Mulliken atomic charges essentially
unaffected.
Past the MECP and now on the doublet potential
surface, the C—H bond continues to lengthen while the
energy increases slowly, until a transition state (TS) is
reached at rCH ¼ 1.56 A
˚ , cf. Fig. 3. The Cr–H distance
remains essentially constant from the MECP through the
transition state and to the product complex. The coordi-
nation geometry of the resulting ethylhydridochro-
mium(V) complex may be described as a pseudo-
trigonal bipyramid, although the widest angle is only
140. Together with the fact that the energy changes only
slightly after the MECP (see Table 1), the geometry
changes just described are consistent with a late transition
state. Most of the C—H activation and all of the Cr—H
bond formation takes place in the quartet state. Past the
MECP, the energy cost of completing the rupture of
the C—H bond seems to be compensated for by the
formation of the C—Cr bond.
At 500 C, the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of
C—H activation are computed as 162 and 283 kJ mol1,
respectively (cf. Table 1). The large contribution from
entropy is due to the loss of translational and rotational
degrees of freedom when reducing the molecularity. The
change in electronic energy agrees well with that of the
enthalpy.
The corresponding reactions on the Cr(OH)3 and
(100)-2bridge models proceed essentially as described
for the gen-2bridge model, with an reaction energy
proﬁle parallel to and some 10 kJ mol1 below that found
earlier (see Table 1). The three-bridge models are more
rigid owing to the additional Cr—O ester linkage to the
support and as a consequence, their potential energy
surfaces do not possess local minima corresponding
to any ethylhydridochromium(V) complexes. Hence
oxidative addition of ethane is not likely to take place
at such sites. This is further elaborated in the Discussion
section.
b-Hydrogen transfer
Even for the two-bridge models, the primary products of
C—H activation are unstable with respect to the reverse
reaction of reductive elimination. According to Table 1,
for the gen-2bridge model the electronic energy barrier
of reductive elimination is a mere 5 kJ mol1 and the
enthalpic barrier actually vanishes. Completion of a
dehydrogenation cycle therefore requires an immediate
second reaction step. We have considered three candi-
dates for this second step, all of which include removal of
a -hydrogen (H) from the ethyl ligand: transfer of H to
the metal itself, transfer to an oxygen atom bonded to the
metal or transfer to the hydrogen atom ligated to the
metal.
-Hydrogen transfer to chromium results in a dihydri-
dochromium(V) surface complex and the release of
ethene to the gas phase. The reaction is computed to be
highly endothermic (94 kJ mol1) and does not appear a
viable alternative. The electronic energy is computed to
be 255 kJ mol1 above that of the separated cluster and
ethane.
Transfer of a -hydrogen to the hydroxyl ligand of the
gen-2bridge model to form water passes over an energy
barrier at 134 kJ mol1 above that of the reactant ethyl-
chromium complex. We will see that the third alternative,
-hydrogen transfer to the hydrido ligand, to form H2 and
a di--bonded ethene–chromium(V) complex, provides
an easier route.
The primary product of the C—H activation step and
hence the reactant of the present reaction step displays
ethyl and hydrido ligands in axial and equatorial posi-
tions, respectively, in a pseudo-TBP structure. The
ﬀHCrC angle is narrow and H may approach the
hydrido ligand only if the ethyl moiety is twisted to one
side, to make the C—C bond become almost orthogonal
to the Cr—hydrido bond. Although such a structure
allows for close H—H contact, the carbon—chromium
distance remains too long for bond formation between the
-carbon and chromium. This picture has emerged from
numerous attempts to obtain a reaction path using relaxed
linear transit (LT) models as well as relaxed two-dimen-
sional scans of the potential energy surface with respect
to the C—Cr and H—hydrido distances. Simulta-
neously scanning both of these critical distances, at
r(H—H) and r(C—Cr) distances around 1.2 and
2.2 A
˚ , respectively, the complex undergoes a stereoche-
mical rearrangement which leads both ethyl and hydrido

ligands to occupy equatorial positions. The ﬀHCrC angle
opens up from 63 in the reactant (see below) to 130.
Prior to the rearrangement, the electronic energy
exceeds 140 kJ mol1 relative to the reactant ethylhy-
drido complex and 300 kJ mol1 relative to the asymptote
of the unreacted cluster and ethane. This is even more
than the energy of the transition state of hydrogen transfer
to the hydroxyl ligand. However, attempts to optimise a
transition state for hydrogen transfer in this region have
all failed, suggesting that the minimal energy path does
not pass this way. Indeed, a route of notably lower energy
was obtained as a two-segment reaction path, in which
the steric rearrangement just described is a ﬁrst and close-
to-energy-neutral part, followed by the actual -hydrogen
transfer to the hydride.
In the early stage of the rearrangement, the reaction
coordinate is dominated by dihedral angles (SiOCrL,
L ¼ OH, H and Et). Approaching the transition state,
the reaction coordinate becomes mainly the ﬀHCrC
bond angle, which increases until the product conﬁgura-
tion is reached (cf. Fig. 4). The reaction path does not
comply with a Berry pseudo-rotation and the energy
barrier is also higher than is commonly found for Berry
transformations. According to Table 2, the activation
enthalpy and free energy at the transition state of the
stereochemical
rearrangement
amount
to
220
and
347 kJ mol1, respectively, relative to the asymptote of
separated cluster and ethane. The activation enthalpy of
this reaction step (see below) is computed to 56 kJ mol1.
The most stable ethylhydridochromium complex dis-
plays the ethyl ligand in a staggered conﬁguration. The
eclipsed conformation shown in Fig. 4 lies only
20 kJ mol1 higher in enthalpy. This structure accom-
modates a -agostic interaction which makes it a natural
starting point for the -hydrogen transfer step.
Assisted by the agostic interaction, a -hydrogen of the
ethyl group may transfer to the hydrido ligand to form
gaseous H2 and a chromium(V)–cyclopropane surface
complex in which ethylene is di- bonded to chromium.
According to Table 2, the enthalpy and free energy at the
transition state are 184 and 298 kJ mol1, respectively,
relative to the asymptote of separated cluster and ethane.
The activation enthalpy for the reaction, relative to the
preceding
non-agostic
ethylhydrido
complex,
is
38 kJ mol1. The energy at the transition state of -
hydrogen transfer is therefore 40 kJ mol1 lower than
at the transition state of the preceding stereochemical
rearrangement.
Dehydrogenation
The catalytic site may be regenerated by desorbing
ethene from the chromium(V)–cyclopropane complex,
thus completing the catalytic cycle. A complete mechan-
ism of dehydrogenation is presented in Fig. 5 in terms of
optimized stationary structures for the gen-2bridge
model. The corresponding reaction enthalpy and free
energy proﬁles are plotted in Fig. 6, with thermodynamic
parameters for each of the elementary reaction steps
given in Tables 1 and 2.
The four reaction steps shown in Fig. 5 include C—H
activation (1), stereochemical rearrangement (2), -hy-
drogen transfer (3) and ethene desorption (4). The deso-
rption step involves spin ﬂip at chromium to transform
the di--bonded ethene–chromium complex into a quar-
tet (—O)2CrOH species with a -bonded ethene. The
crossing point (MECP) of the reaction path from the
doublet to the quartet potential energy surface has been
determined at an average Cr—C bond length of 2.20 A
˚
and a C—C distance of 1.39 A
˚ . These values are much
closer to the geometry of the di--bonded complex than
that of the -bonded ethene complex and the energy of
the MECP is also very similar to the former.
The coordination enthalpy of the resulting ethene
-complex is only 33 kJ mol1, consistent with an almost
unperturbed C—C bond length in ethene of 1.35 A
˚ . Des-
orption of ethene is therefore favoured by entropy, resulting
in a free energy change of 68 kJ mol1 at 500 C.

From Fig. 6, the transition state of the stereochemical
rearrangement step may be identiﬁed as the highest point
on both the enthalpy and the free-energy reaction proﬁles
for the overall dehydrogenation reaction.
The same mechanism of dehydrogenation has been
examined for the (100)-2bridge and Cr(OH)3 models.
The electronic energies for all important stationary states
are given in Table 3. The reaction energy proﬁles
obtained for the (100)-2bridge and Cr(OH)3 models are
similar to that obtained for the gen-2bridge model. On all
three models, the favoured route to -hydrogen transfer
was found to include stereochemical rearrangement. The
electronic energies at the corresponding transition states
are about 220 kJ mol1 for the 2bridge models, with a
lower energy of 196 kJ mol1 for Cr(OH)3. This suggests
that surface restraints contribute 20 kJ mol1 to the
reaction barrier. Only for the -hydrogen transfer reac-
tion is the barrier markedly higher for the (100)-2bridge
than for the gen-2bridge model (see Fig. 7). This is
probably a result of poor -agostic interaction with
chromium,

(100)-2bridge model and Cr(OH)3, the transition states of
the stereochemical rearrangement and the -hydrogen
transfer step are equally high in electronic energy. Ac-
cording to Table 2, the entropy loss is larger in the ﬁrst of
these two elementary reactions and this makes the stereo-
chemical rearrangement the bottleneck of the overall
dehydrogenation reaction for all the three DeRossi-type
models examined.
DISCUSSION
The three-bridge models do not seem to offer any stable
ethylhydridochromium(V) complexes, hence oxidative
addition of ethane is not likely to take place at such sites.
On the other hand, the models have previously been
found to support C—H activation by -bond metathesis.
This involves cleavage of a Cr—O bond and formation of
a chromium–ethyl bond and a silanol moiety. A mechan-
ism of dehydrogenation based on such a reaction was
proposed in the literature2,24 and studied theoretically in
Ref. 23. In addition to the C—H activation step, it
involves formation of ethene through -hydrogen transfer
to
chromium,
giving
a
hydridochromium
complex
and release of H2 under reformation of the Cr—O
bond. Strain in the (111)-3bridge model resulted in a
low C—H activation energy of 80 kJ mol1, but also
makes closure of the catalytic cycle a highly unlikely
event. On the nearly unstrained (101)-3bridge model the
C—H activation energy increased to 160 kJ mol1, but
now the dehydrogenation cycle appeared viable. -Hy-
drogen transfer turns out to be the rate-determining step
with the enthalpy and free energy of activation estimated
as 240 and 350 kJ mol1, respectively, These values seem
too high to sustain catalysis at 500 C.23
Based on the present computations, C—H activation
by oxidative addition appears possible on DeRossi-type
species, i.e. on CrOH moieties bonded to the surface via
two oxygen bridges. The activation energy computed for
this initial step is 160 kJ mol1. However, since the
ethylhydridochromium complex is unstable with respect
to reductive elimination, the subsequent step towards
dehydrogenation must proceed immediately. The bottle-
neck of C—H activation by oxidative addition is there-
fore
better

of
the stereochemical rearrangement. Furthermore, as the
free energy at this point represents the highest point along
the reaction path of dehydrogenation, C—H activation
emerges as rate determining in the dehydrogenation
process. The computed enthalpy and free energy of
activation are 220 and 347 kJ mol1, respectively.
The overall activation energy for dehydrogenation
based on oxidative addition is therefore fairly high and
on a level with that of the -bond metathesis reaction on
unstrained three-bridge species. In addition, the reac-
tion depends on two crossings between spin potential
surfaces. For reactions of FeO þ, spin cross-over prob-
abilities as low as 102–103 have been obtained,43 and
even if the probability for a transition metal-mediated
two-state reaction may be signiﬁcantly increased by the
exact makeup of the complex,44 the actual probability
of the present reaction is likely to be notably lower than
unity. More importantly, the rotational segment of C—
H activation, i.e. the stereochemical rearrangement
step, puts severe constraints on the angular momentum
of the reacting alkane molecule. The steric factor in the
reaction cross-section is therefore likely to be small,
further reducing the pre-exponential factor in the rate
constant.

ligand, gives water which is likely to desorb.23 Reformation
of the DeRossi site under release of H2, as described
above, is therefore unlikely. However, the surface site is
stabilized as an ethylchromium complex and this species
supports catalytic dehydrogenation through cyclic repeti-
tion of (i) -hydrogen transfer to give a hydridochromium
complex and (ii) C—H activation and H2 release by -
bond metathesis.23 The computed activation energy for
this mechanism of dehydrogenation is <100kJ mol1,
with respect to the combined energy of the hydridochro-
mium complex and gaseous ethane.23 Moreover, the
activation energy associated with forming the initial ethyl-
chromium complex was computed as 130 kJ mol1,23
which is signiﬁcantly lower than that computed here for
the C—H activation step according to oxidative addition.
CONCLUSIONS
Quantum chemical cluster models of Cr(III)–silica sites
have been used to study C—H activation of ethane by
oxidative addition. The reaction involves a formal double
oxidation of chromium and whereas most of the actual
activation of the C—H bond takes place on the quartet
spin potential energy surface of Cr(III), the transition
state and the ethylhydridochromium(V) product are lo-
cated on the doublet energy surface. The product is
unstable with respect to the back-reaction and completion
of a dehydrogenation cycle requires that -hydrogen
transfer must take place in the extension of the C—H
activation step. On sites where chromium is linked to the
silica surface through two oxygen bridges, the preferred
mode of -hydrogen transfer is via a stereochemical
rearrangement of the ethylhydridochromium(V) com-
plex, followed by hydrogen transfer to the hydrido ligand
with release of H2. This leaves the complex as chro-
mium(V)–cyclopropane.
On sites where chromium is linked to the silica surface
through three oxygen bridges, we have not been able to
optimize any ethylhydridochromium(V) structure and
C—H activation according to oxidative addition seems
to be excluded.
The reactant two-bridge (DeRossi) site may be regen-
erated from chromium(V)–cyclopropane by desorption of
ethene. This concludes a catalytic cycle for dehydrogena-
tion, involving the following reaction steps: (i) oxidative
addition of ethane followed by immediate stereochemical
rearrangement, (ii) -hydrogen transfer to hydride with
subsequent loss of H2 and (iii) reductive elimination of
ethene from chromium(V)–cyclopropane. The kinetic
bottleneck of this reaction mechanism is given by the
ﬁrst step, which is associated with C—H activation but
more precisely with the transition state of the rearrange-
ment step. The computed enthalpy and free energy of
activation are high, ca 220 and 350 kJ mol1, respec-
tively, and close to the activation energies previously
computed for a different mechanism of C—H activation,
namely -bond metathesis, on speciﬁc three-bridge
chromium sites.23 Both of these seem inferior to a third
mechanism of dehydrogenation, which involves C—H
activation by -bond metathesis on a hydridochro-
mium(III) species. The computed activation energy of
the latter mechanism is <100 kJ mol1,23 and the two-
bridge models investigated here may act as precursors to
this more active species. C—H activation by oxidative
addition thus seems to be an unlikely route to catalytic
dehydrogenation for Cr(III)–silica catalysts.
